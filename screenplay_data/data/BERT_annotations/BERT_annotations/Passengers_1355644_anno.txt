scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTELLAR SPACE
text: A million suns shine in the dark.
text: A STARSHIP cuts through the night: a gleaming white cruiser.
text: Galleries of windows. Flying decks and observation domes.
text: On the hull: EXCELSIOR - A HomeStead Company Starship.
text: The ship flashes through a nebula. Space-dust sparkles as it
text: whips over the hull, betraying the ship's dizzying speed.
text: The nebula boils in the ship's wake. The Excelsior rockets
text: on, spotless and beautiful as a daydream.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - GRAND CONCOURSE
text: A wide plaza. Its lofty atrium cuts through seven decks,
text: creating tiers of promenades framing a vast skylight.
text: The promenades are empty. Chairs unoccupied. Beetle-like
text: robots vacuum the carpets and wax the floors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAFETERIA
text: Super-modern and gleaming. Hundreds of tables, all empty.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK
text: Lounge furniture and star-filled windows. Completely
text: deserted. A robot on spindly legs washes the glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIBERNATION BAY
text: Endless corridors lined with vertical glass tubes. Inside
text: each tube stands a PASSENGER. Eyes closed in sleep. If
text: they're breathing you can't tell by looking.
text: They sleep on their feet, leaning against padded supports.
text: Straps secure them in place; sensors adhere to their skin.
text: They wear shorts and tank tops with HomeStead Company logos.
text: We survey their faces. No children, no senior citizens. Men
dialog: and women of every ethnicity in the prime of their lives.
text: We settle on one man. JIM PRESTON, 38. Sound asleep. A small
text: display on his pod reads:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMES PRESTON
dialog: Rate 2 Mechanical Engineer
dialog: Denver, Colorado
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGE: 38
dialog: Blood type: A+
dialog: Passenger class: silver
scene_heading: FARE: ONE-WAY
text: A deep BOOM. Echoes roll down the corridors.
text: Lights wink on in Jim's hibernation pod. Machinery hums to
text: life. Instruments beep and chitter.
text: Medical data fills the pod's screen. Jim's temperature rises.
text: His heart begins to beat. He takes a breath.
text: Jim opens his eyes.
text: Groggy, blinking, seeing nothing.
text: The backrest behind him converts into a recliner, lowering
text: him into a seated position.
text: The sensors on his skin drop off and snake back into the
text: pod's machinery.
text: A video screen descends before Jim's eyes.
text: ONSCREEN - A beautiful stewardess appears, beaming at the
text: camera. She is inhumanly perfect, a computer-generated image.
speaker_heading: VIDEO STEWARDESS
dialog: Good Morning, James!
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (DISORIENTED)
dialog: Jim. What the...
speaker_heading: VIDEO STEWARDESS
dialog: Don't worry, Jim. It's normal to feel
dialog: confused. You've just spent a hundred
dialog: and twenty years in suspended
dialog: animation.
text: She makes it sound sexy. Jim scowls and rubs his eyes.
text: ONSCREEN - An animation. Happy people go to sleep in glass
text: tubes in a hospital. The tubes are loaded onto a spaceship.

speaker_heading: VIDEO STEWARDESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Your wake-up capsules and nutrient
dialog: juice will help you recover from

text: Pills rattle into a dish; a glass of pink juice appears. He

text: Jim's backrest eases him onto his feet. A drawer pops open,
text: revealing a Homestead Company bathrobe and slippers.
speaker_heading: VIDEO STEWARDESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Make yourself comfortable in your

text: He puts them on.
speaker_heading: VIDEO STEWARDESS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (FLIRTATIOUSLY)
dialog: Don't lose it!

speaker_heading: VIDEO STEWARDESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you're ready to go to your cabin.
dialog: Make yourself at home! Enjoy the rest

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim steps out of his pod into the corridor.
text: All the other pods are closed, the people inside asleep. A
text: look of concern crosses Jim's face.
speaker_heading: VIDEO STEWARDESS
dialog: Jim, your cabin is this way.
text: The screen flips around to face him. The video stewardess
text: points down the corridor.
speaker_heading: VIDEO STEWARDESS (CONT'D)
dialog: Take Elevator D to deck seven. Your
dialog: cabin number is on your shipcard.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Thanks.
text: He shuffles down the corridor in his slippers, rubbing his

text: Behind him, his pod closes up. Its screen reads PASSENGER
scene_heading: DISCHARGED.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELEVATOR FOYER
text: Jim finds a bank of elevators. As he approaches, the

text: He steps inside, and muzak begins to play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DECK SEVEN
text: A corridor lined with doors. A CLEANING ROBOT vacuums.
text: Jim appears. Instantly the corridor lights brighten. The

speaker_heading: CLEANING ROBOT
dialog: Hello, Passenger.
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (STARTLED)
dialog: Hello, robot.
text: Jim follows wall markings to his cabin. Lets himself in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM'S CABIN
text: Cozy but small. A bed, a desk, an armchair. No window.
text: A SCREEN lights up. The HomeStead Company theme music plays.
text: An ANNOUNCER speaks.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Welcome to your cabin, Jim! Your home
dialog: until we make landfall.
text: Jim doesn't pay attention. Pokes around, opening drawers.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Over the next two months, you'll
dialog: prepare for your new life on
dialog: Homestead II.
text: Jim peers into the tiny bathroom. There's a little video
text: screen, and the presentation's running there too.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: Passengers are organized into
dialog: Learning Groups for orientation.
dialog: You've been assigned to Learning
dialog: group...thirty-eight! Don't forget!
scene_heading: ONSCREEN: "Learning Group 38."
text: The DOORBELL rings.
text: Jim opens the door eagerly - and deflates. No one there.
text: He looks down. A waist-high CARGO ROBOT peers up at him with
text: goggle eyes. It carries two suitcases and a duffel bag.
speaker_heading: CARGO ROBOT
dialog: Passenger James Preston?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Jim. Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARGO ROBOT
dialog: Your luggage, Passenger Jim. Swipe
dialog: your shipcard to confirm.
text: Jim swipes his shipcard through a slot on top of the robot.
text: The robot scoots inside and deposits Jim's bags on the floor.
speaker_heading: CARGO ROBOT (CONT'D)
dialog: Enjoy your luggage!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CARGO ROBOT
dialog: Thank you, Passenger Jim!

text: A dry fountain gushes water at his approach.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK ONE - CONFERENCE ROOM TWENTY
text: Forty chairs around a big table. A large screen on the wall.
text: ONSCREEN: A digital INSTRUCTOR, a handsome woman of middle
text: age, waits with a computer's infinite patience.
text: Jim walks in. The door slides closed behind him.
scene_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Hello, Passengers. Will you all
dialog: please take a seat.
text: Jim looks around. He's the only one there. He sits.
speaker_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Earth is a prosperous planet. The
text: cradle of civilization. A world with
dialog: a long, proud history. But for many,
text: it's also overpopulated. Over-priced.
text: Overrated. Overrun.
text: Behind the Instructor, video clips of Earth's urban sprawl:
text: an endless gleaming metropolis glittering with traffic.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (raising his hand)
dialog: Can I just...
scene_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR
dialog: No questions until the end, please.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Wait. Where are all the other...
scene_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR
dialog: The Colonies offer an alternative. A
dialog: better way of life.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The screen fills with shots of Homestead II: aerial footage
text: of mountains, beaches, beautiful garden cities.
speaker_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: And none is more beautiful than
dialog: Homestead II, the Jewel of the
dialog: Occupied Worlds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ONE HOUR LATER
text: Jim sits wearily, chin propped on his hand. The Video
text: Instructor chatters on. Inspiring footage of Homestead II.
scene_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR
dialog: ...thriving job markets in mining,
dialog: farming and manufacturing. An
dialog: explosion in the cultural arts. And
dialog: if you long for the life less
dialog: civilized, you can apply for a
dialog: pioneer permit and seek your fortune
dialog: in the wild.
dialog: (a pregnant pause)
dialog: Any questions?
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (EXPLODING)
dialog: Where IS everybody?!
text: The Instructor pauses. The question seems to confuse her.
scene_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR
dialog: We're all on the Starship Excelsior.
dialog: Five thousand passengers and fifty-
text: eight crew members.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: But I'm the only one awake.
scene_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR
text: No, all the passengers wake up at the
dialog: same time.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Then something's wrong with the other
text: hibernation pods.
scene_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR
text: Hibernation pods are fail-safe.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: So why am I the only one here?
scene_heading: VIDEO INSTRUCTOR
dialog: I'm sorry. I don't understand your

speaker_heading: INFOMAT
speaker_heading: (INSANELY CHEERFUL)
dialog: Hello! What's your question?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I need to talk to a person. A real
dialog: live person.
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: What sort of person? Personal
dialog: trainer? Travel planner? Therapist?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Someone in charge.
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: The Ship Steward handles passenger
dialog: affairs. You can find him in his

text: ONSCREEN: A dotted line on the map shows how to get there.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: Happy to help!

scene_heading: SERVICE DECK - CORRIDOR
text: Jim appears around the corner. The lights brighten, the

text: He finds a door marked SHIP STEWARD.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHIP STEWARD'S OFFICE
text: The lights flash on as Jim enters, revealing...an office in

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Not good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR LOBBY
text: Another Infomat. Jim arrives at a jog.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: Hello! What's your quest...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Who's flying the ship?
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: The bridge crew includes the Captain,
dialog: the Pilot, the Chief Navigator...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The Captain. I want to talk to the
dialog: Captain.
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: The Captain rarely handles passenger
text: queries directly.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Emergency, okay? Where is he?
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: The Captain is usually found on the
text: Bridge, on the Command Deck.
text: ONSCREEN: A helpful map shows the way. Jim marches off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMAND DECK
text: Jim finds the door to the Bridge. He opens it eagerly - only
text: to find a second door behind it - an armored hatch labeled
text: FIREWALL and SECURE ACCESS AREA.
text: A porthole of thick glass gives a narrow view of the Bridge.
text: It's deserted. Instrument lights gleam in the dark.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (pounding on the hatch)
dialog: Come on! What the hell is happening?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK THREE - CAFE COURTYARD
text: Jim RUNS past restaurants, lounges, shops. All deserted.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (panic in his voice)
dialog: Hello? Hello!
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERVICE DECK - CELESTIAL PROMENADE
text: The highest promenade on the ship: windows on all sides. The

text: The atrium plunges seven stories to the Concourse below.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (an echoing shout)
dialog: Hello!
text: A SOUND behind him makes him spin.
text: But it's just a window-washer: a robot with long spindly
text: limbs. It moves past Jim, polishing windows. Oblivious.
text: A sign catches Jim's attention: "OBSERVATORY - Your Place In
dialog: the Universe."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OBSERVATORY
text: Jim enters the planetarium of the future: theater seats
text: facing a holographic "stage."
text: IN HOLOGRAM: An image of the starship hangs in space. Glowing
text: text reads "Look through the eyes of the Starship Excelsior!"
text: Jim goes to the control podium. Touches the screen.
speaker_heading: OBSERVATORY
dialog: (a voice as deep as God's)
dialog: What can I show you?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We're supposed to land pretty soon,
dialog: but it looks like I'm the only one
dialog: awake. Is that normal?
speaker_heading: OBSERVATORY
dialog: I don't understand. What can I show
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (IMPATIENTLY)
dialog: Show me Homestead II.
text: IN HOLOGRAM: The planet Homestead II, Earth's twin sister.
speaker_heading: OBSERVATORY
dialog: Homestead II is the fourth planet in

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right. And how soon are we landing?
speaker_heading: OBSERVATORY
dialog: Approximately ninety years.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What?
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OBSERVATORY
dialog: We land on Homestead II in ninety

speaker_heading: OBSERVATORY
dialog: Approximately thirty years ago.
text: Jim stares at the hologram in horrified realization.

speaker_heading: HIBERNATION BAY
text: Jim sprints down a row of hibernation pods. Heart pounding.
text: Slides to a stop in front of his empty pod.
text: Jim fusses with the controls, pressing buttons. But the

text: Crouching, he pulls at the pod's canopy, trying to open it
text: with his hands. It doesn't budge.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm supposed to be in there!
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIBERNATION BAY - CORRIDOR
text: Jim trudges between rows of sleeping passengers to the aft
text: end of the huge Hibernation Bay.
text: There he finds a hatch labeled CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY.
text: Jim opens it eagerly - and finds another armored hatch with a
text: small porthole. Labels reads FIREWALL and SECURE ACCESS AREA.
text: Jim presses the switch. No result.

speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: Interstellar messages are sent by

scene_heading: COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH
dialog: Begin message.
text: Jim's a deer in the headlights. He collects himself.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hi. I'm Jim Preston. I'm a passenger
dialog: on the Excelsior. Something went

dialog: soon. I can't get back to sleep.
text: Nobody else is awake.
dialog: (with growing panic)
dialog: If I don't figure something out, I'm
dialog: going to die of old age before we get
dialog: to Homestead II. So help me out here.
dialog: (takes a deep breath)
dialog: I'll keep trying to fix this. Maybe I

speaker_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE
text: Jim crosses the Concourse like a sleepwalker in his robe and
text: slippers. He looks shell-shocked.
text: He comes to the Concourse Bar: the fanciest watering hole on
text: the ship. Black leather stools along a marble bartop.
text: Jim touches the bartop...and a MAN swings up behind the bar -
text: as if mounted on a hinge. A handsome fellow in a bartender's
text: uniform - his hair and skin eerily perfect. This is ARTHUR.
text: Jim jumps out of his skin.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What can I get you?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I thought I was the only one awake!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I doubt it. It's the middle of the
dialog: afternoon. Are you drinking or not?
text: He produces a cloth and polishes the bartop. In a startling
text: movement, he glides the length of the bar, polishing all the
text: way, and glides back as if on roller skates.
text: Jim steps up on the footrail and peers behind the bar.
text: Arthur's body stops at the waist. He's mounted on rails,
text: built into the bar.
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (DEFLATED)

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Whiskey, neat.

speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Arthur, how much do you know about
dialog: the ship?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I don't know. I know some things.
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (A CHALLENGE)

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Ninety years or so.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: And when are all of us passengers
dialog: supposed to wake up?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Not until the last two months.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: So how can I be sitting here with
dialog: ninety years to go?
text: Arthur's eyes take on a faraway look. His head twitches.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It's not possible for you to be here.
text: He smiles as if he's solved the problem.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: But I am.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Sorry, Jim. My specialty is cocktails

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Arthur, I'm in trouble. I'm screwed.
dialog: I am completely, ridiculously
dialog: screwed.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Lot of self-pity.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Self pity? I'm going to die of old
dialog: age on this ship!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Jim, we all die. Even androids end up
dialog: on the scrap heap. It's not dying
dialog: that matters, it's living. This is
dialog: your life. Are you going to live it
dialog: or lie down and die?
text: Jim shakes his head in surrender.

scene_heading: INT. JIM'S CABIN - MORNING

dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He swipes his shipcard at a coffee machine. It offers sixteen

speaker_heading: COFFEE MACHINE
dialog: Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme

speaker_heading: COMMAND DECK
text: Jim prowls the floor, opening doors.
text: He finds a room marked EMERGENCY GEAR and opens it eagerly.
text: It's full of space suits and oxygen tanks.
text: He peers into a red HAZARD cabinet: fire extinguishers, an

speaker_heading: HIBERNATION BAY
text: Jim sits in front of his empty hibernation pod. His toolbox

text: The pod hums to life. Its data screen flickers with
text: information. Mysterious WHIRS and THUNKS.
text: The canopy opens.
text: Elated, Jim bounces to his feet. Strips off his shirt and

text: He assumes the position, his back against the backrest,
text: waiting for the pod to put him to sleep.
text: Nothing happens. He pokes at the ports where the sensors and
text: intravenous lines used to protrude. Shakes the machine.
text: He gives up. It's not working.
text: But now he's trapped inside the pod.
text: He pushes at the canopy, but it's locked shut. He pounds on
text: the glass with no effect. Finally he loses it, shouting and
text: stamping, hammering and raging - all muffled behind glass.
text: Exhausted, he sinks to the floor of the pod, staring out at
text: his tools and his manual, his discarded shirt.
text: Then he notices the emergency release handle down by the
text: floor. He pulls it, and the canopy pops open.

text: FADE TO BLACK.

scene_heading: SUPER: THREE WEEKS LATER
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY DOOR - MORNING
text: Jim works on the door with an industrial LASER CUTTER. Sparks
text: fly. He's drenched in sweat. Mussed and unshaven.
text: He lifts the goggles and inspects the door. The laser cutter
text: has barely marked the surface.
text: The door's a mess. Its switch hangs on wires. There are pry
text: marks around the latch. Gouges around the window. Failed
text: drill holes. Dents left by an axe.
text: But the door stands firm.
text: Jim lets the laser cutter fall. It joins a scrapyard of tools
text: on the floor: sledgehammer, jackhammer, drill, crowbar, axe.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIBERNATION BAY - JIM'S POD
text: Another debris field surrounds Jim's hibernation pod. Tools

text: Jim stalks by without so much as a sideways glance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CONCOURSE BAR - DAY
text: Arthur stands behind the bar polishing glasses. Jim sits,
text: sweaty and grimy, a whiskey in front of him.
text: His speech is soft around the edges. He's had a few.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I thought I'd figure something out. I
dialog: thought it would just come to me.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Stands to reason.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: But I've tried everything.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Sometimes you can't catch a break.
text: Jim gives Arthur a thoughtful look.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm your only customer, but you're
text: always polishing a glass.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Trick of the trade. Makes people
text: nervous when a bartender just stands
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Okay. Lay some bartender wisdom on
dialog: me. I'm lost in space here.
text: Arthur polishes the bar while he thinks that one over.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You're not where you want to be. You
dialog: feel like you're supposed to be
dialog: somewhere else. Right?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You said it.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Well, here's the thing. Say you could
dialog: snap your fingers and be wherever you
dialog: wanted to be. Back on Earth, or on
dialog: Homestead II.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'll bet even if you got your wish,
dialog: you'd still feel this way. Not in the
dialog: right place. Supposed to be somewhere
dialog: else. That's not a crisis, it's the
dialog: human condition.
text: Jim takes a moment to consider that.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's not me.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Well, maybe not. The point is, you
dialog: can't get so wrapped up in where
dialog: you'd rather be that you forget to
dialog: make the most of where you are.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What are you telling me?
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It's a big ship. You're always

dialog: yelling at the computers. Take a
dialog: break. Live a little.
text: Jim spins on his barstool, surveying the Grand Concourse.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Live a little.
text: When he comes back around he gives a shove. He spins faster.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: That's the spirit.
text: Jim goes for one more shove. Misses. Falls off his stool.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - INFORMATION KIOSK
text: Jim scans a map of the ship. Second-class cabins. First-class
dialog: cabins. And the good stuff: palatial suites named for
dialog: European cities.
text: His finger stops on one of the biggest. The Berlin Suite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERLIN SUITE
text: High ceilings, posh furniture, panoramic windows.
text: The door jumps in its frame with a THUNK. Slides open. Jim

text: suitcases. It deposits them on the floor.
speaker_heading: CARGO ROBOT
dialog: The Berlin Suite! Enjoy your luggage!
dialog: 
scene_heading: BERLIN SUITE - BATH

scene_heading: DECK THREE - MARCELLO'S - DAY

scene_heading: GYMNASIUM - BASKETBALL COURT
text: Jim shoots baskets. He's brought dozens of balls onto the

text: He shoots from half court. From even farther away. Long
text: shots, bounce shots off the wall.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He launches a full-court shot, bangs it off the rim, and lets

dialog: 
scene_heading: BELLA CANTINA - AFTERNOON
text: The ship's Mexican restaurant. It has the same robot waiters

scene_heading: INT. BERLIN SUITE - BEDROOM - MORNING

dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - SHOPPING DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: Jim walks past the upscale shops, blind to their displays.
text: He comes to a PHOTO BOOTH. The promotional pictures on the

text: He pulls back the curtain, sits in the booth. The curtain
text: falls. The strobe flashes.
text: A photostrip drops into the tray outside the machine: four
text: identical shots of Jim staring into the lens without emotion.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - ELITE PROMENADE - DAY
text: Jim walks numbly along, ignoring the stellar view. He munches

text: Jim feeds it chips. One for Jim, one for the robot.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK
text: Jim enters, still munching chips. The sweeper robot follows.

text: forehead against the glass. Moaning.
text: After a moment he sits down blindly.
text: The whole room begins to slide past him.
text: Confused, Jim looks around. He's accidentally sat down on the

dialog: 
scene_heading: TRAVELING SHOT

text: Jim jumps off.
text: He explores: it's an engineer's fantasia. Jim's eyes show
text: signs of life. But it's a hazardous place, with cranes and
text: platforms, hoses and blowtorches on the move.
text: He exits through another low hatch to find himself in the...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIBERNATION BAY
text: Thousands of sleepers in their glass tubes. Jim walks among

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Who are you?

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: JIM

text: The screen reads PASSENGER DISCHARGED.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK NINE - NUMBER NINE PROMENADE
text: Aurora finds her cabin. It's a first-class cabin, its door
text: overlooking the Grand Concourse atrium.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA'S CABIN
text: Posher than Jim's original cabin. A king-sized bed, a
text: panoramic window.
text: A widescreen video screen lights up. The Homestead Company
text: theme music plays.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Welcome to your cabin, Aurora! Your
dialog: home until we...
text: Aurora slaps the display off. Goes to the phone.
text: A touch of her finger brings up the ship's telephone
dialog: directory. Aurora selects "Information."
speaker_heading: PHONE
text: No one is available at that number.
text: She touches other phone links, faster and faster.
speaker_heading: PHONE (CONT'D)
dialog: No one is available...No one is...No
dialog: one...No one...No one is available at
dialog: that number.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What the hell's going on?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK FOUR - SHOPPING DISTRICT
text: Aurora strides down the lane of quiet shops. Actively
dialog: searching for other people.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - ELITE PROMENADE
text: Jim paces nervously, glancing around. She could be anywhere.
speaker_heading: AURORA (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
text: Jim rushes to the railing. Below on the Grand Concourse,
text: Aurora is turning in circles, looking up at the balconies.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (a husky whisper)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (mustering a shout)
dialog: Hello!
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Aurora spins. Spots him.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: Hey! I want to talk to you!
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: I'll come down.
text: Jim runs down six flights of stairs, his heart in his throat.
text: He reaches the Grand Concourse out of breath. He stops a few
text: paces away, just looking at Aurora, getting his wind back.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Passenger or crew?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Passenger. Jim Preston.
text: He sticks out a hand. She shakes it firmly. Electric for Jim.
dialog: First contact.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I'm Aurora.
text: Jim's lips move as she speaks her name, almost saying it with
text: her. Aurora. She doesn't pick up on it.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know what's happening? Nobody
dialog: else in my row woke up.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah, I...same for me.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: The crew's supposed to wake up a
dialog: month before we do. But I haven't
dialog: seen anybody.
text: Jim swallows hard.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: The crew's still sleeping. They've
dialog: got a special facility. I can see
dialog: them in there but I can't get in.
text: Aurora stares at him.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You're saying nobody's awake?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Just me.
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Just you?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Just us.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: But somebody's got to land the ship
dialog: in a few weeks.
text: Jim's finding it unexpectedly hard to deliver the bad news.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I have to show you something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR A
text: Jim and Aurora ride upward. She looks out into the atrium,
text: watching the floors go by.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Typical. There's so much incompetence
dialog: in these big companies. No
dialog: accountability! They lost my luggage
dialog: on the flight to the spaceport. I'm
dialog: leaving the planet and my bags almost
dialog: didn't make it! And nobody
text: apologizes. Nobody even feels bad.
text: Jim is only half listening - his eyes drawn to the spill of
text: her hair over her neck, the line of her jaw.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's the corporate mentality.
dialog: (looking at Jim)
dialog: Where are we going?
text: Jim yanks his eyes away from her neck.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The Observatory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OBSERVATORY
text: Aurora's eyes, wide and staring. Her face a mask of horror.
text: In front of them hangs the starship's progress indicator -
text: the Excelsior hanging between Earth and Homestead II. Thirty-
dialog: one years elapsed; Eighty-nine years to go.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: (a shocked whisper)
dialog: Eighty-nine years to go.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
text: The other passengers aren't late
dialog: waking up. We're early.
text: Aurora stares at Jim.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: We've got to get back to sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIBERNATION BAY
text: Jim and Aurora walk down a row of hibernation pods.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Nobody strands me on a spaceship for
dialog: a hundred years. I work for the New
dialog: Yorker. I'll write an expose so hot
dialog: you'll need oven mitts to read it.
dialog: Trust me.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's not that simple. Putting
text: somebody into hibernation takes
dialog: special equipment. Remember the
dialog: facility where they put us to sleep?
text: Jim points at a pod beside them. A middle-aged woman inside.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
text: This pod will keep her in hibernation
dialog: as long as you want. And it can wake
text: her up. But it can't put her back to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (GETTING IT)
dialog: You don't think there's a way back
text: into hibernation.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Not that I can see.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: There has to be. There's always a
dialog: way. Where's the crew?
dialog: 
scene_heading: CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY DOOR
text: Jim and Aurora stand staring at the door: scarred by Jim's
dialog: many assaults.
text: Aurora looks through the porthole at the crew inside. She
text: runs her hands thoughtfully over the door's dents and gouges.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: (dreading the answer)
dialog: How long have you been awake, Jim?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: A year and three months.
text: Aurora covers her mouth. Her eyes full of horror.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Oh, my God. No.
text: She turns her back. Suddenly she walks briskly away. And
text: breaks into a run. Jim watches her go, astonished.
text: After a moment he runs after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIBERNATION BAY
text: Aurora runs down a row of hibernation pods, her eyes
text: searching wildly among the glass tubes. She turns a corner.
text: Hesitates. Runs down another row. She's fighting tears.
text: She puts on speed. Her sash unknots itself and her robe
text: billows behind her.
dialog: 
text: IN ANOTHER ROW
text: Jim jogs along, worried. He's lost her. He pauses, listening.
text: In the distance, slippered feet. He runs that way.
text: He stops: the sash of Aurora's robe lies on the deck. He
text: picks it up. Runs on.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Aurora!
text: He turns another corner and sees her. She's sitting down, her
text: back against a hibernation pod. Laughing at her own tears.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I can't even find the one I'm
dialog: supposed to be in.
text: Jim extends a hand. She lets him pull her to her feet. He
text: gives her the sash, and she ties her robe around her.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Jim looks back at her, miserable with guilt.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I shouldn't have told you like that.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: No, I'm sorry. It just hit me how
dialog: serious this is. How did you wake up?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I just did. I woke up, my pod dumped
dialog: me out, and there I was.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Me too. We have to get help.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - COMMUNICATIONS CENTER
text: Jim and Aurora stand in at a Passenger Communication Station.
text: Jim swipes his card through the Comm Station's slot. It
text: brings up his account information.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I've sent...sixteen messages to
dialog: Earth. A bunch to the Homestead
dialog: company, one to the Space
dialog: Administration, one to the United
dialog: Nations. A couple to Homestead II,
dialog: just for the hell of it. My phone
dialog: bill's about eighty grand.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: How soon could we hear something?
speaker_heading: JIM
text: With speed-of-light lag, fifty-six
dialog: years. That'll be from Earth. Nothing
dialog: from Homestead II until we're almost
dialog: there anyway. Eighty years or so.
text: Aurora's mouth goes dry. She swallows hard.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What about the other planets?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The other occupied worlds are even
dialog: farther away. We'd die of old age
dialog: before they could answer.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What about other ships?
dialog: (off Jim's stare)
dialog: Jim?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (feeling very stupid)
dialog: I never thought of other ships.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Jim, you've had more than a year!
dialog: There has to be a flight plan or
dialog: something...
text: They search the Comm Center and find a map table showing the
text: Excelsior's position relative to the Occupied Worlds.
text: Aurora fiddles with the controls. Interstellar flight plans
text: appear: a spiderweb of starship tracks between the worlds.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: There!
text: They inspect the threads of light - an icon on each thread
text: representing a starship. Even Jim is excited now.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: How do we tell how far away they are?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The computer knows. Give me a ship.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: (peering at the star map)
text: The starship Zephyr.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Round-trip message lag...ninety-nine
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: AURORA
text: The starship Andromeda.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: One hundred thirty-two years.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: The Maximilian.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Eighty-one years.
text: Jim and Aurora deflate visibly.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: That's the closest one.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - EVENING
text: The ship's lights turn the cool blue of evening. Jim and
text: Aurora walk across the plaza.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I know I should be working the
dialog: problem right now, but I can barely
dialog: keep my eyes open.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You just came out of hibernation.
dialog: It'll be a couple days before you're
dialog: a hundred percent. You should rest.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (YAWNING)
dialog: I think I have to.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'll walk you to your cabin.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: No, I'm all right.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Jim. Don't look so down. It's going
dialog: to be okay. You've got me on the team
dialog: now. Chin up, all right?
text: Jim nods, speechless.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm in cabin ninety forty-eight, if
dialog: you need me.
text: Jim watches her walk away.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm in the Berlin Suite if you need
dialog: me.
text: She stops. Turns to look back at him.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: A year and a half? Must have been
dialog: hard.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It was.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Good night, Jim.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR
text: Jim sits down at the bar.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Whiskey. Rocks.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Sure thing. How's your day been?
text: Jim takes a stiff drink.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Aurora's awake.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Congratulations.
dialog: (off Jim's face)
dialog: You don't look happy.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Arthur. Can you keep a secret?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'm a bartender.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Don't tell Aurora I woke her up. She
dialog: thinks it was an accident. Let me
dialog: tell her. Okay?
dialog: 
scene_heading: AURORA'S CABIN - NIGHT
text: Aurora sleeps, her hair a fan of gold on the pillow.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BERLIN SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jim lies awake, fidgeting and staring at the ceiling.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - INFOMAT - MORNING
text: Aurora talks with a relentlessly cheerful Infomat.
text: She's wearing her own clothes, and it's a transformation: she
text: looks hip and urban, beautiful.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: How can there be no way to put
dialog: someone into hibernation aboard ship?
dialog: What if a pod breaks down?
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
dialog: No pod has malfunctioned in thousands
text: of interstellar flights.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Well, I'm awake.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INFOMAT
text: Hibernation pods are fail-safe.
text: Jim appears behind Aurora.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Good morning. Have you eaten?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I'm starving. This is the dumbest
dialog: machine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAFETERIA
text: Jim watches in astonishment as Aurora blithely orders the
text: snacks that the machines deny him. The Mocha Cappuccino
text: Extreme. The French Breakfast Puff. The Gourmet Fruit Salad.
text: They sit. Aurora eyes Jim's tray.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You're a man of simple tastes.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm a silver class passenger. The
dialog: French Breakfast Puff is above my pay
dialog: grade.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Oh, no! All this time? What can I get
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No, I'm fine, really...
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Shut up. I'll be right back.
text: She gets up. In a minute she's back, setting a tray down in
text: front of Jim: A western omelette with a side of bacon...a
text: cafe latte...half a honeydew melon.
text: Jim shoves his old breakfast aside.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Thank you.
text: They dig in.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You think the crew members would know
dialog: what to do?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I was hoping so.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Could we wake them up if we got in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (AWKWARDLY)
dialog: I'm no expert. But I think so.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Maybe there's another way to go to
dialog: sleep. Did you check out the
dialog: infirmary?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I looked around. It's the usual
dialog: hospital stuff. Scanners, autodocs.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Did you look for ways of going to
dialog: sleep?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Well, Jim!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You think they've got suspended
dialog: animation pills sitting around?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You don't know until you look. What
dialog: about cargo? Maybe there's a
text: hibernation machine in the hold.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I looked at the manifests. It's
dialog: mostly farming stuff, industrial
dialog: machines. We're not going to find a
text: hibernation facility in a box.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You don't know that! We have to think
dialog: big here. Maybe we can build our own
text: hibernation machine.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No, we can't.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You're not even trying!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I've been awake a year and a half.
dialog: I've tried everything I can think of.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: (she gets up angrily)
dialog: Well, it looks to me like you missed
dialog: some possibilities. And I'm not ready
dialog: to give up.
text: She strides out. Jim watches her go. Reaches over and takes
text: the Gourmet Fruit Salad off her tray.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK TWO - LIBRARY - DAY
text: Aurora sits at a library workstation.
speaker_heading: WORKSTATION
dialog: No plans are available.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What about research articles, any
dialog: kind of technical documents?
speaker_heading: WORKSTATION
dialog: Hibernation technology is
dialog: proprietary. The following articles
dialog: deal with the subject on a
dialog: theoretical level.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - DAY
text: Aurora sits at the Passenger Communications Booth.
scene_heading: COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH
dialog: Planet and connection, please.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Earth. The New Yorker magazine,
text: office of the Editor in Chief.
scene_heading: COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH
dialog: Begin message.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (INTO CAMERA)
dialog: My name is Aurora Dunn. I'm doing a
dialog: long-term piece on the colony worlds.
dialog: I know you won't get this message for
dialog: a long time...but you should know I'm
dialog: in trouble.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERVICE DECK - INFIRMARY - DAY
text: Aurora inspects the gleaming medical equipment. Rummages
text: through cabinets full of medicines and instruments.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She opens a steel vault. A deep freeze: icy vapor rolls out.
text: Inside: racks of steel capsules at subzero temperatures.
text: She leans close: each frosted capsule is labeled with a
text: passenger's name and the word SPERM or OVA.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY DOOR - EVENING
text: Aurora frowns through the window at the sleeping crew.
text: A litter of tools still surrounds the battered door. Aurora
text: snatches up a crowbar and bashes the porthole. The bar spins
text: from her stinging hands, but the window's not even marked.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - ELITE PROMENADE - EVENING
text: Jim sits at a table with his tools, struggling with a high-
dialog: tech mechanism.
text: Aurora drops into a chair across from him. He looks up. Takes
text: in her condition: weary and frustrated.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: There's no way we're going to build a
text: hibernation machine.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: And there's no magic sleeping drugs
text: in the infirmary.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I did find the gene bank. Five
dialog: thousand sperm and egg samples on
dialog: ice. I should be glad they do that.
dialog: By the time we get to Homestead II,
dialog: that little capsule in the freezer is
dialog: going to be all that's left of me. We
dialog: really are screwed, aren't we?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Pretty much.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BELLA CANTINA - EVENING
text: Jim and Aurora sit across a Mexican dinner they've already
text: put a dent in. An electric candle burns between them.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A robot in a sombrero drops off two mojitos and scoots away.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: So who are you, Jim? I'm going to be
dialog: seeing you around. I should know who
dialog: I'm talking to.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm from Denver. Lived there all my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What kind of work do you do?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: A little of everything. Transport,
dialog: robotics, industrial systems. I fix
dialog: what's broken. On the emigration
dialog: forms I'm a "rate two" mechanical
dialog: engineer. Means I don't have a Ph.D.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Neither do I. But a journalist
dialog: doesn't need one; she just needs a
dialog: way with words and an attitude. I'm
dialog: from Manhattan, so I had the
dialog: attitude.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I noticed.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: And the words have always been there
dialog: when I needed them.
speaker_heading: (SHE LAUGHS)
dialog: I would never have lasted a year with
dialog: no one but robots to talk to. They're
dialog: all such idiots!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Not all of them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR - NIGHT
text: Jim leads Aurora up to the Concourse Bar. It appears
text: deserted. Aurora is all curiosity.
text: Suddenly Arthur appears, doing his swinging-up-on-hinges
text: trick. Aurora gives a squeal of surprise.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Evening, Jim. Who's the lovely lady?
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Arthur, this is Aurora. Aurora,
dialog: Arthur.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Aurora. A pleasure.
text: He takes her hand formally.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Arthur! Lovely to meet you.
text: She peeks over the bar at Arthur's mechanical mounting, the
text: rails he rolls on.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What'll it be?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Dirty martini!
speaker_heading: (TO JIM)
dialog: Now this is a robot I can talk to.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Android, technically.
speaker_heading: (TO ARTHUR)
text: Whiskey and soda.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Empty glasses show that Jim and Aurora have been doing
text: yeoman's work at the bar. Both are tipsy and laughing.
speaker_heading: AURORA
scene_heading: (COLLECTING HERSELF)
dialog: My God, I almost forgot my life is in
dialog: ruins.
text: That wipes the smile off Jim's face.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What for? It's time to sleep. In the
dialog: morning we'll think of something
dialog: brilliant.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Good night, Jim. Good night, Arthur.
text: She exits.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Good night.
dialog: (to Jim, sotto voce)
dialog: She's wonderful. Excellent choice.
text: Jim drops his head into his hands.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AURORA'S CABIN - NIGHT
text: Aurora stows clothing in drawers and closets.
text: She hangs snapshots on the wall: family and friends. Most of
text: the pictures were apparently taken at the same grand party.
text: She looks at them wistfully - and a look of astonishment
text: crosses her face.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Of course!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - BERLIN SUITE DOOR
text: Aurora pounds on the door.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Jim! Wake up!
text: The door opens. Jim stands blinking in his bathrobe.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll go home!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What?
text: She pulls him down the hall, chattering.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: It takes too long to get to Homestead
dialog: II. But we're still closer to Earth.
dialog: We'll turn the ship around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
text: Aurora drags Jim in and punches the button.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: We'll go home.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It would take decades.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: It's our only chance of getting off
dialog: this ship in our lifetimes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMAND DECK
text: Aurora drags Jim out of the elevator. Looks around.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Where's the...navigating place?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That way. But...
text: She drags him toward the Bridge.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: We can learn how to pilot the ship.
dialog: We have all the time in the world.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: There's just one problem.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - BRIDGE DOOR
text: Aurora opens the Bridge door - revealing the armored firewall
text: hatch just beyond it.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Everything important - the reactor,
dialog: the gravity drive - it's all behind
text: firewalls. There's no way through.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (CRUSHED)
dialog: That was my last good idea.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
text: Aurora sits curled up in an armchair. Around her, a dizzying
text: view of the cosmos.
text: There's a cup of coffee on a table beside her. In her lap, an
text: electronic slate with an attached microphone.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: New file. My Voyage.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A clean page opens on the slate. The title in the corner: "My
text: Voyage." As Aurora speaks, the page fills with words.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: I boarded the Excelsior on
dialog: assignment. Maybe the most ambitious
dialog: writing assignment ever given. But
text: things have taken an unexpected turn.
dialog: I'm not writing for The New Yorker
dialog: anymore. I'm writing for me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Aurora jogs in sneakers and sweats. Cabin doors flash past.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: I've been awake on this ship for
dialog: seven days, awake far too soon...
text: Dead end. She's reached the aft end of the ship. She crosses
text: a lobby and runs back the other way.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...and I might spend the rest of my
dialog: life here...
text: Running along a promenade, Aurora reaches the forward end of
text: the ship. Dead end again.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...in a little steel world five
text: hundred meters long.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE
text: Jim sits at a table, a technical manual open in front of him.
text: He looks up. Watches Aurora jog around the atrium and vanish.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: I'm not alone. Another passenger
dialog: shares my fate. A mechanic named Jim
dialog: Preston.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWIMMING POOL - DAY
text: The swimming pool is a marvel: one entire wall is a window
text: extending from the ceiling to the bottom of the pool.
text: Aurora enters in her HomeStead Company bathrobe. Drops the
text: robe to reveal a bathing suit.
dialog: 54.
dialog:

speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)

speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: By the time they wake, Jim and I will
dialog: have lived, grown old and died.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK
text: Back on Aurora in her armchair, writing.
speaker_heading: AURORA
text: Vanished, like a dream, in the blink

scene_heading: CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Jim sits eating and tinkering with a small robot. The table
text: is strewn with dishes and tools.
text: Aurora sits down across from him.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Why did you do it?
text: Jim is thunderstruck. The game is up. He swallows hard.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Emigrate. Leave Earth. I'm
dialog: interviewing you.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You're what?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Interviewing you. You're the first
dialog: victim of hibernation failure in the
dialog: history of space travel. That makes
dialog: you news.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Who are you going to tell?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Posterity. So why'd you give up your
dialog: life on Earth?
text: Jim seems stunned by the question. He hadn't thought about it
dialog: in quite those words.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: A hundred and twenty years'
dialog: hibernation means you never see your
dialog: family and friends again. You sleep
dialog: your way to another planet and
dialog: another century. The ultimate
dialog: geographical suicide.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I, uh...I never really...
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Were you running away from something?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No. Things were okay.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I just wanted more, I guess. You
dialog: know. More room. A fresh start. Back
dialog: to basics.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (CHIDING)
dialog: That's HomeStead Company propaganda.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Jim!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm a mechanic. A rate-two mechanic.
dialog: We're a dying breed on Earth. But in
dialog: the colonies, they still have
dialog: problems to solve. My kind of
text: problems. In the colonies, a handyman
dialog: is somebody.
text: Nothing there for Aurora to scoff at. She looks impressed.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: And there's room! Open country. Woods
dialog: and fields. I like the outdoors. You
dialog: know, room to grow.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Now you're back to advertising.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Can't it still be true?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIBERNATION BAY
text: Jim and Aurora walk down an aisle of hibernation pods.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You know how much the Homestead
dialog: Company's made off its first planet,
dialog: Homestead I? Over eight quadrillion
dialog: dollars. That's eight million
dialog: billions. Colony planets are the
dialog: biggest business there is. Did you
dialog: pay full price for your ticket?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No, I'm in a desirable trade.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (TRIUMPHANTLY)
dialog: So they fill your head with dreams,
dialog: discount your ticket, and you fly off
dialog: to populate their planet and pay
dialog: HomeStead ten percent of everything
dialog: you do for the rest of your life. You
dialog: think you're free? You're just part
dialog: of the business plan.
text: Jim waves at the rows of sleepers.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: All you see here is five thousand
dialog: suckers?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I see zeroes on the HomeStead
dialog: Company's bottom line.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I see five thousand men and women
dialog: changing their lives. For five
dialog: thousand different reasons. You don't
dialog: know these people.
text: Jim walks up to a hibernation pod. Glances at the data
text: screen. He covers the screen with his hand.
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: This guy. Banker, teacher, or
dialog: gardener?
text: Aurora studies the sleeper: a barrel-chested man of 50 with
text: gray temples and a jutting jaw.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Banker.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gardener.
text: Jim moves down the row, peeks at another screen, covers it.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this Madison, Donna, or Lola?
text: Aurora peers: a birdlike young woman with long red hair.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: She's too silly to be a Donna. I
dialog: think she's a Lola.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Madison. Chef, accountant, or
dialog: midwife?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: She has to be a midwife. There's no
dialog: way you made that one up.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (chuckling, caught)
dialog: She's a midwife. I didn't know they
dialog: still had midwives.
text: They move among the sleepers, quizzing each other.
speaker_heading: AURORA
text: (pointing at a man and
dialog: woman side by side)
dialog: Married, or strangers?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Married.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (indicating a young woman)
dialog: Sixteen, twenty-six, or thirty-six?
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I'd almost say sixteen...twenty-six.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: (about an older woman)
dialog: Politician, historian, or artist?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I don't know. Artist?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: It doesn't say. But I'll tell you
dialog: this: I like her. We'd be friends.
text: Jim looks at Aurora seriously.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You think you can see that?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Don't you?
text: Jim looks at the woman in the pod. Smiles.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
text: Jim and Aurora sit at opposite ends of a sofa - their feet
text: almost but not quite touching. They sip cocktails.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: That was my plan. Travel to Homestead
dialog: II. Live there for a year and see
dialog: what emigrating's really like. Then
dialog: back to Earth. I'm the only passenger
text: on board with a round-trip ticket.
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (PERPLEXED)
dialog: I left Earth for a new life. But you
dialog: end up back where you started.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: No! I end up in the future. Two
dialog: hundred and fifty years in the
dialog: future. On Earth, which is still the
text: center of civilization, overcrowded
dialog: or not. And I arrive in the future
dialog: with an amazing story.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: A perspective no other writer has.
dialog: Literary immortality.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: And what's this amazing story?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: The selling of the colonial dream.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Big plans.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: My friends threw me this huge
text: farewell party. Everyone came. It was
dialog: the happiest, saddest night. And look
dialog: what it's all come to.
speaker_heading: (SHE SIGHS)
dialog: Jim, I can't think of anything else
dialog: to try. To save us, I mean. I don't
dialog: even want to think about it anymore.
dialog: So. What is there to do around here?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MOVIE THEATER - DAY
text: Jim leads Aurora into the movie theater. The lights come up.
text: The curtain opens. Aurora looks around in wonder.
text: A bundle of cables snakes down the aisle.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Watch your step. I've made a few
dialog: changes.
text: Next to Jim's favorite seat there's a cluster of machines
text: with power cables and hoses running to them.
text: Jim and Aurora sit. A screen beside Jim lists movies.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I got tired of running up to the
dialog: projector room, so I moved the
dialog: controls down here. Thirty thousand
dialog: movies to choose from. I've only
text: watched about five hundred of them.
text: He taps a button on another machine, which produces a bucket
text: of hot popcorn. He offers Aurora some.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Popcorn?
text: Aurora grins and takes some.

dialog: 
scene_heading: GYMNASIUM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
text: Jim and Aurora play one-on-one. She's not especially good,
text: but fiercely competitive. They jostle and scramble, laughing.
text: Aurora snags the ball. For a minute she just stands there,
text: beaming.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What are you so happy about?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I'm up two points!
text: She cuts around him toward the basket.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK TWO - VIRTUAL MUSEUM - EVENING
text: Jim and Aurora walk through the museum's white rooms. The
text: walls display a Jackson Pollock collection.
text: Aurora goes to the control podium. Scrolls through the menu,
text: covers her eyes and chooses blind.
text: The wall panels fill with Heironymous Bosch paintings -
text: medieval visions of Hell. She winces and chooses again. A
text: somber collection of portraits by Dutch masters. She frowns.
text: Jim steps to her side and makes a selection.
text: The walls fill with abstract landscapes - stark plains and
text: oceans, with lonely figures isolated in the vastness.
text: The images pull Jim and Aurora in: they stand before a dark
text: seascape.
text: Without thinking she reaches out and tucks her hand in the
text: crook of his elbow.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUPER: ONE MONTH LATER
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWIMMING POOL - MORNING
text: Aurora swims laps, cutting through the water.
text: In the balcony above the pool, Jim stands watching her.

text: Underwater she smiles.
dialog: 61.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK THREE - SHOPPING DISTRICT - MORNING
text: A cleaning robot scurries along the shopping street, looking

text: Jim's hands reach into frame, pluck the robot off its wheels.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK NINE - NUMBER NINE PROMENADE
text: Aurora stands at the railing, watching curiously as Jim
text: crosses the Concourse below with the robot under his arm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK C - MACHINE SHOP - DAY
text: Jim stands at a workbench, the robot in front of him. He
text: tinkers with its complex works.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - DAY
text: Jim sits in an armchair with his industrial laptop. He types
text: a string of commands, hits EXECUTE.
text: Beside him on the floor, his kidnapped cleaning robot does a
text: figure-eight. Jim smiles in satisfaction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
text: Aurora sits in her habitual writing position: cross-legged on
text: her favorite sofa, her writing slate in her lap.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: The starship's designers gave the
text: ship a daily rhythm. The light is
text: warm in the morning, bright during
dialog: the day, cool at night. We need those
dialog: changes. But I miss other rhythms.
dialog: There are no holidays here. Every day
dialog: is a day of leisure. There are no
dialog: seasons. The sky never changes.
text: A mechanical whir distracts her. She looks down.
text: Jim's pet robot looks up at her with binocular eyes. It
text: carries a note in a clip on its back. Aurora pulls it free.
text: A handwritten invitation from Jim. It reads:
dialog: 
dialog: Come to dinner with me tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: - JIM
text: Aurora reads the note with a grin.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the robot)
dialog: Is he asking me on a date?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK C - MACHINE SHOP
text: Jim sits at his laptop, watching the screen: a robot's-eye-
dialog: view of Aurora.
text: He wiggles a joystick on his laptop, and...
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK
text: ...the robot nods its goggle head.
text: Aurora laughs.
text: Beside the note-clip, the robot carries a pen in a makeshift
text: holder. Aurora takes the pen, scribbles on the paper. Tucks
text: it back into the robot's note clip.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR
text: Arthur polishes glasses behind the bar.
text: The robot crosses the Concourse, note clipped to its back.
text: Arthur watches it pass.

scene_heading: SUBDECK C - MACHINE SHOP
text: Jim plucks the note from the robot's back. Aurora's reply is
dialog: written in bold letters:
dialog: Love to.
dialog: -A
dialog: 
scene_heading: AURORA'S CABIN - EVENING
text: Aurora gets ready for dinner. A slim gown, a few pieces of
text: jewelry, her hair up. She looks like a goddess.
text: The doorbell rings. She answers it.
text: Jim stands on her doorstep in a black jacket, looking dapper.
text: His eyes widen as he takes Aurora in.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Wow.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You clean up all right yourself. You
dialog: went shopping.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I went shoplifting.
text: In the corridor stands a cargo robot to which Jim has
text: attached an upholstered loveseat. He helps Aurora aboard and
text: takes a seat beside her. She's charmed.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Rutherford! To the bar!
speaker_heading: CARGO ROBOT
dialog: Yes, Passenger Jim!
text: The robot zooms off to the sound of Aurora's laughter.

scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR
text: Jim and Aurora take seats. Arthur puts on his best manners.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Evening. What can I get for you?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: A manhattan, please.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Single malt, rocks.
text: Arthur pours.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You two look fine this evening.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (CONFIDENTIALLY)
dialog: We're on a date!
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Very nice.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: (to Jim, teasing)
dialog: Took you long enough to ask.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I was giving you space!
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Space is one thing I don't need more
dialog: of. I've been doing research.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: I found a drug that would put us in a
text: coma indefinitely, and machines that
dialog: would keep us alive.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Really?!
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: But it's not suspended animation.
dialog: We'd still be aging.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Yeah. If I have to grow old on this
dialog: ship, I'd at least like to be awake
dialog: for it. So that was a failure.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: A highly ambitious failure.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: There's the title of my memoir. "A
dialog: Highly Ambitious Failure," by Aurora
dialog: Dunn.
text: Jim laughs. He thinks for a minute.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: "Voyage to Nowhere," by Jim Preston.
speaker_heading: AURORA

speaker_heading: JIM

scene_heading: THE STARDOME - XANADU
text: A great glass dome, the highest point on the ship. Outside
text: the dome, a riot of stars. Inside, a luxury restaurant.
text: Jim and Aurora emerge into the dome.
text: She turns, looking at the glittering river of the Milky Way,
text: the blue stars ahead of the ship, the pink stars behind them.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Incredible.
text: They sit at the best table. Robots attend to their every

text: Beautiful dishes arrive: new wines with every course.

dialog: 
scene_heading: NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: A holographic 12-piece band plays on stage: a jazz standard.
text: Jim walks onto the dance floor. Holds out his hand to Aurora.
text: She comes to him, and they dance. They're pretty good. Smiles
text: grow on their faces.
text: Jim spins her out, spins her back - close enough to kiss.
text: They almost do - but they don't.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK THREE - SHOPPING DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: Jim and Aurora ride along on the cargo robot. Her head rests
text: on his shoulder. Suddenly she sits up.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Rutherford, stop!
text: The robot stops. She pulls Jim off.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, we have to do this!
text: She pulls him to the photo booth. They tumble inside. As the
text: strobe flashes, she kisses him hard.
text: Outside, the photo strip drops into the tray: four color
text: pictures. In the first they laugh; in the second they clown;
text: in the third, they kiss. In the last image, Aurora smiles at
text: the camera; Jim looks at Aurora.
text: Aurora taps the pictures: they start to move: each is a one-
text: second movie clip. The pictures laugh, and clown, and kiss.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK NINE - CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE AURORA'S CABIN
text: The robot pulls up to Aurora's door. Jim helps her down.
text: Aurora opens the door. Turns back to him.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Thank you. I had an amazing time. A
dialog: great night.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah, me too. Well, good night.
text: He turns to go.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Jim.
text: He turns back. Aurora grabs him and drags him into her cabin.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA'S CABIN
text: They stagger across the room together. He backs her up
text: against a wall, kisses his way down her throat.
text: She drags his jacket off his shoulders. Pulls at his shirt.
text: He slips the straps from her shoulders. Her dress slides to
text: the floor. They roll onto the bed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CAFETERIA - MORNING
text: Breakfast. Jim watches Aurora eat.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: This is so good. I'm starving.
dialog: (she smiles at him)
dialog: Last night was just what I needed.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You are the most beautiful woman I've
dialog: ever seen. You're so beautiful it
dialog: hurts me.
text: She stares, shocked. Leans across the table and kisses him.
text: Soon they're making out right on top of breakfast.
text: A passing robot pauses to observe the scene - then moves on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: 1. Jim and Aurora make out fiercely in the movie theater
text: while a movie plays onscreen.
text: 2. Aurora straddles Jim in a jacuzzi in the ship's Spa. She
text: moves against him: she's close. She climaxes gorgeously.
text: 3. Jim stands on a promenade. Aurora passes, jogging. He
text: gives her a smile as she goes by. A moment later she runs
text: back into frame and tackles him. They tumble to the deck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERLIN SUITE
text: Jim and Aurora lie in Jim's imperial bed, glistening with
text: sweat and breathing hard. She lays her head on his shoulder,
text: her eyes far away and wistful.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Yes, I'm fine. It's just...
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She waves her hand in the air as if to signify, all of this.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I know.
text: She snuggles in tighter, and he holds her close.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - BERLIN SUITE WINDOW
text: Through the window, Jim and Aurora lie together in the

scene_heading: SUPER: THREE MONTHS LATER
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - CORRIDOR - MORNING
text: A luxury cabin door: the doorplate reads "Vienna Suite."
dialog: 
scene_heading: VIENNA SUITE - BEDROOM
text: The best suite on the ship. One one side of the bedroom,
text: Aurora's mementos and possessions. On the other side, Jim's.
text: They wake together. She kisses him on the cheek with the ease
text: of long habit and heads for the shower. He watches her go.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SWIMMING POOL - MORNING
text: Swimming, Aurora reaches the end of a lap. A hand reaches
text: down and catches her before she can turn.
text: Jim kneels at the edge of the pool, in coveralls and work
text: boots, a tool belt slung over his shoulder.
text: Aurora pulls herself up and kisses him.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm going to finish my survey of the
dialog: cargo hold. See what there is to play
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Be careful.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Back by happy hour.
dialog: 68.

dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
text: Aurora writes on her sofa, surrounded by electronic slates,
text: each displaying a reference book or research paper. On one, a
dialog: map of the Polynesian archipelago.
speaker_heading: AURORA
text: The Polynesians set out into the
text: Pacific Ocean with no destination.
text: Searching for islands. They sailed
text: into the endless sea on faith.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK A - NUMBER EIGHT CARGO HOLD - DAY
text: Jim walks among the towering cargo racks. His flashlight
text: illuminates machines stacked from floor to ceiling: tractors
text: and combines, helicopters and seaplanes.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: Some never returned, but others found
dialog: land, and prospered. What drove them
dialog: out onto the sea? Curiosity?
dialog: Tradition? The wish for something
dialog: better?
text: Jim opens cargo containers. He finds ingots of metal,
text: computer components, spools of superconducting wire. Raw
dialog: materials for a young world.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The urge to move is as primal as
dialog: hunger or thirst. We run, we drive,
dialog: we sail, we fly.
text: Jim finds a stash of utility golf carts and his eyes light
text: up. He unpacks one, starts it up. Drives off into the dark.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR - DAY
text: Aurora sits at the bar with her slate, sipping a drink.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Is it movement that we need? Or the
dialog: possibility of something new?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I'm writing, Arthur. Hush.
text: Aurora's slate has recorded this exchange: she erases the

dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK A - NUMBER SEVEN CARGO BAY
text: Jim drives his cart into a new bay - and stares in wonder.
text: In oversized hibernation pods: cattle, horses, sheep, oxen.
text: All asleep. Chickens, ducks and geese in individual cells.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: Like seeds, we carry what we need.
dialog: The wind drives us - whether the
dialog: trade winds, the solar winds, or the
dialog: winds of chance.
text: The next aisle holds plants in stasis: saplings in tubes,
text: seedlings in individual vials.
text: Jim stops in front of a glass case. Rosy light bathes his
text: face. He smiles. We don't see why.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We take root where we fall. And
dialog: helplessly we grow.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VIENNA SUITE - BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Aurora sits with her slate. Eyeing Jim's side of the room.
text: Giving in, she begins to explore Jim's possessions: poking
text: into the drawers of his nightstand and dresser.
text: She opens his closet. Shifting things, she finds a dog-eared
text: manual on hibernation pods. She pulls it out.
text: There's a bookmark in the pages. She goes to open the book -
text: and the bookmark slides into her hand.
dialog: It's the photo strip Jim took during his isolation: Four
text: identical shots of his face, bearded and hollow-eyed. The
text: melancholy images hit her hard.
text: She touches the pictures to make them move: but Jim sits
text: immobile. In the fourth image, he sighs heavily.
text: Voices in the hall.
speaker_heading: CLEANING ROBOT (O.S.)
dialog: Hello, Passenger.
speaker_heading: JIM (O.S.)
dialog: Hello, robot.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hi. How was your day?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I don't know. I wrote a few pages.
text: I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore.
dialog: I was writing a book, and I was
dialog: keeping a diary. But the book and the
dialog: diary are running together. I think
dialog: I'm writing about us.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Makes sense to me.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I'm not sure I want to write about
dialog: this life. I don't even know how to
dialog: think about it. I live in a palace.
dialog: But it's also a prison. I'm moving at
dialog: half the speed of light and I can't
dialog: go anywhere!
text: Jim takes that in.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: The cargo hold is full of pioneer
dialog: gear. There's a submarine down there,
dialog: can you believe it? Ships and
dialog: airplanes and bulldozers. That's what
dialog: I wanted, a world still being built.
dialog: But I'll never see it.
text: They sit for a moment in glum contemplation.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Did you find anything that could help
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes. I found these.
text: Jim unzips his duffel bag and takes out a bouquet of long-
text: stemmed roses. Aurora gasps. Reaches out to touch them.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Are they real?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I cut them myself.
text: Aurora leaps into action. She finds scissors, a pitcher. At
text: the sink she trims the stems, arranges the flowers.
dialog: 71.

speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JIM

text: Jim and Aurora run up the stairs onto the highest promenade
text: on the ship: glass all around, skylight above.
text: The deep RUMBLE is louder. A bloody light fills the sky.
text: A STAR looms ahead of the ship: a RED GIANT. The Excelsior
text: rockets toward the star.
text: The passage takes less than a minute. The Red Giant swells in
text: the windows. The ship shudders. The engines howl. Aurora
text: falls into Jim's arms. The ship bathed in red light.
text: The star fills the skylight, fills the sky itself. A fiery
text: surface turbulent with sunspots and mysterious currents. The
text: engines howl.
text: And then they're past. The star recedes, dwindling as quickly
text: as it grew. The engines quiet. The ship's calm restored.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (BREATHLESSLY)
dialog: That was incredible.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Closest we'll get to a star on the

scene_heading: SUBDECK C - MACHINE SHOP
text: Jim puts the finishing touches on a beautiful RING woven from
text: gold and silver wire. It's crowned with a flower of gold.
text: He removes the ring from its clamp: inspects it thoroughly.
text: Satisfied, he wraps it in a cloth and tucks it in his pocket.
dialog: 
scene_heading: STARDOME - XANADU - EVENING
text: Jim and Aurora dine. They laugh and flirt with easy intimacy.
text: Their plates emptied, they sit back, sipping wine. Jim lifts
text: the table's candle and waves it in the air. A robot rolls up
text: with a birthday cake, candles alight.
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: Happy birthday to you...
dialog: Happy birthday to you...
dialog: Happy birthday, dear Aurora...
dialog: Happy Birthday to you.

scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR - NIGHT
text: Jim and Aurora sit at the bar, tipsy. Arthur pours.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Birthday cocktail for the birthday
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Aren't you going to check my I.D.? I
dialog: might not be old enough to drink.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'd never ask your age in front of a
dialog: gentleman.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Jim's not a gentleman. Anyway there's
dialog: no secrets between me and Jim.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (looking at Jim)
dialog: Is that so?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You heard the lady. Be right back.
text: He walks away.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You know what I like about you,
dialog: Arthur? You have a sense of occasion.
dialog: I bet ladies fall for you on every
dialog: trip.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'd say you were pulling my leg, but
dialog: I haven't got any.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Exactly! There you go.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I remember your last birthday, a year
dialog: ago. Jim was really looking forward
dialog: to meeting you.
text: Aurora frowns, processing this sentence - her smile fading.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEN'S WASHROOM
text: Jim stands at the mirror, straightening his lapels, touching
text: up his hair.
text: He unwraps the ring. Looks it over. Smiles at his reflection.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONCOURSE BAR
text: Aurora scowls at Arthur, trying to get her bearings.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What do you mean, he was looking
dialog: forward to it? How could he...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: He couldn't stop talking about you,
dialog: let me tell you. He spent months
dialog: deciding whether to wake you up.
text: Aurora eyes widen in shock.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Jim woke me up.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Oh, yes. Said it was the hardest
dialog: decision of his life, but I see it
dialog: worked out just fine.
text: Aurora stops breathing. She stares at the bartop.
text: Jim strolls up to the bar. His hand slides into the jacket
text: pocket where the ring lies hidden.
text: But Aurora's body language is all wrong. He stops, perplexed.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What?
text: She looks up, her face rigid. Her voice a whisper.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Did you wake me up, Jim?
text: Jim's hand slides out of his jacket pocket. He shoots a look
text: at Arthur, who smiles back, oblivious.
text: Aurora's eyes bore into him. Finally Jim finds his voice.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes. I woke you up.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (IN AGONY)
dialog: How could you do it?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I tried not to.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You pulled me out of hibernation. You
dialog: destroyed the rest of my life. You
dialog: murdered me!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's a little strong...
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You murdered me. I'm going to be
dialog: sick. Oh, my God. I...I can't see.
text: She gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Aurora.
text: He goes after her.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Get away from me!
text: She slaps at him blindly, almost hysterical. Stumbles away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERVICE DECK - CELESTIAL PROMENADE
text: Aurora stares out at the stars. Jim appears behind her.
text: She speaks without turning.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (BITTERLY)
dialog: How did you decide?
dialog: (turning on him)
dialog: Did you just go shopping? A couple
dialog: thousand women in their underwear,
dialog: and you get to pick your favorite.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It wasn't like that.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What was it like? And you had it all
dialog: planned out! Dinner and movies and
dialog: our big date...Oh, my God! And I just
dialog: ate it up. Fake! All fake!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: This was real. I didn't plan this.
dialog: It...happened.
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (MOCKING)
dialog: "Find true love on the Starship

speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: This is sick.

scene_heading: HIBERNATION BAY - AURORA'S POD
text: Aurora walks up to her old hibernation pod. Jim trails her.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: So?
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim stares at her, unbelieving. But she means it. He opens
text: the cover panel, points out the key components.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: I looked at my pod. A couple
dialog: different processors burned out at
dialog: the same time. I triggered the same
dialog: failure in your pod. Short circuit
dialog: across these two contacts, and then
dialog: these two. And cut these wires.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Just like that.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Just like that.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I'm so stupid. I fell for all of it.
dialog: I fell for you. I thought you saved
dialog: me. But you didn't save me, Jim. You
dialog: did this to me. And now I'm stuck
dialog: with you. Stuck with the second-rate
dialog: mechanic who ruined my life.
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (LAMELY)
dialog: Rate two mechanic.
text: But Aurora's already walking away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VIENNA SUITE - DAY
text: Aurora walks in, barely under control, and breaks down. Sinks
text: to her knees, racked by sobs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIBERNATION BAY - AURORA'S POD - DAY
text: Jim sits at the foot of Aurora's hibernation pod, staring
text: into the empty tube.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VIENNA SUITE - EVENING
text: Jim walks in. All of Aurora's things are gone. Her half of

dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK THREE - CAFETERIA - MORNING
text: Aurora sits finishing her breakfast. Jim enters and
text: approaches her table.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Can I talk to you?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I don't want to talk anymore. I don't
dialog: want to look at you anymore. If you
dialog: see me coming, get out of my way. If
dialog: you see me sitting, find somewhere
dialog: else to be. There's plenty of
dialog: choices. It's a big boat.

scene_heading: DECK FOUR - SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY
text: Jim walks alone, hands in his pockets, in a deep funk.
text: A little robot crosses his path: he KICKS it down the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWIMMING POOL
text: Aurora swims. Reaches the end of a lap and rests.
text: She looks up abruptly as if she senses someone watching her -
text: but the balcony above the pool is deserted.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
text: Aurora sits reading. Digital slates surround her. A whir
text: distracts her. She looks down.
text: Jim's pet robot sits beside her. A note on its back.
text: She picks up the note. It's the photo strip from her first
text: date with Jim: their first kiss captured on film. Clipped to
text: the photo strip is a handwritten note: "This was real."
text: Aurora leans down toward the robot's binocular eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBOT'S POV
text: Aurora looms close. She holds the note up to the robot's eyes
text: and crumples it up.
speaker_heading: AURORA
text: Watching me through a robot is
dialog: creepy, Jim. Cut it out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK C - MACHINE SHOP

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - DAY
text: Jim sits at the security console, disheveled and bearded.
text: Twenty screens give different views of the ship.
text: One screen shows the Elite Promenade. As he watches, Aurora
text: jogs by in sneakers and shorts.
text: Jim has her route mapped: as she vanishes from one screen she
text: appears on the next. He follows her from screen to screen.
text: He picks up a microphone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELITE DECK
text: Aurora circles the atrium.
text: OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM: Jim clears his throat.
speaker_heading: JIM (VIA INTERCOM)

speaker_heading: JIM (VIA INTERCOM) (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, just hear me.
text: Aurora rolls her eyes and resumes running.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - COMMUNICATIONS CENTER
text: Jim watches Aurora move from screen to screen. He holds the
text: mic in both hands. His voice reverberates through the ship.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The day I first saw you, my life
dialog: changed. I couldn't forget your face.
dialog: I kept coming back to see you. Trying
dialog: to know you through the glass. I read
dialog: every word you ever wrote, trying to
dialog: hear you. The day you woke up...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK NINE - NUMBER NINE PROMENADE
text: Aurora doesn't break stride. But she's listening.
speaker_heading: JIM (VIA INTERCOM)
dialog: When you woke up I had no idea what
dialog: would happen next. I had no reason to
dialog: believe you would see anything in me.
dialog: When you did, when we found each
dialog: other, this ship I'm trapped inside
text: suddenly felt like a limitless place.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: JIM (VIA INTERCOM) (CONT'D)
dialog: My pointless life suddenly had
dialog: meaning.
text: Aurora skids to a stop beside a Deck Steward's station.
text: She leans over the counter, finds an intercom terminal and
text: grabs the microphone. A whine of feedback. She looks into the
text: lens of the nearest security camera.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: That's great, Jim. Just great. I'm
dialog: glad that ruining my life somehow
dialog: improved yours. But I have a run to
dialog: finish, so...
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR
text: Arthur looks up, listening, as voices echo through the ship.
speaker_heading: JIM (VIA INTERCOM)
dialog: Wait. Aurora. Don't go.
speaker_heading: AURORA (VIA INTERCOM)
dialog: You may be the only game in town,
dialog: Jim, but that doesn't mean I have to
dialog: play. Just pretend I'm not here.
dialog: Because as far as you're concerned,
dialog: I'm not.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK NINE - NUMBER NINE PROMENADE
text: At the Deck Steward's station, Aurora stares into the camera.
speaker_heading: JIM (VIA INTERCOM)

dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - COMMUNICATIONS CENTER
text: Jim stares at Aurora on the video screen.
speaker_heading: AURORA (VIA INTERCOM)

scene_heading: SUPER: THREE MONTHS LATER

scene_heading: ELITE DECK - VIENNA SUITE - BEDROOM (DAY)

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Half-finished dishes in bed with him. The suite is squalid.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - CAFE MAXINE

text: Aurora eats a fancy lunch, reading a novel on a digital
text: slate. She's groomed and put together.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK THREE - CAFETERIA
text: Jim sits in front of a bowl of breakfast cereal, a dry slice
text: of toast. He stares into space. He has milk in his beard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK
text: Aurora sits in her writing chair, dictating to her slate.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: It's the modern way of life. We
dialog: surround ourselves with people. A
text: constant din of conversation. As if
dialog: we need the mirror of other faces to
text: see ourselves. The clamor of voices
dialog: in our ears to reassure us that we
dialog: exist. Do we need it? Can we live
dialog: without it?
dialog: 
scene_heading: VIENNA SUITE - DAY
text: The TV blares. Jim lies asleep in an armchair, covered with
dialog: snack chips.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: I think the secret to survival is
dialog: productive activity.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOPPING DISTRICT - CRAFT SHOP - DAY
text: Aurora investigates the craft shop's shelves. Collects an

speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: We need to be good for something.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VIENNA SUITE - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Jim lounges in the bathtub in his bathrobe: sopping wet and
text: drunk. Gold glitters in his hand: the RING he made for
text: Aurora. He scowls at the ring.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: A challenge equal to our character.
text: With a snarl, Jim tosses the ring into his mouth. Chases it
text: with a slug of vodka straight from the bottle. Swallows hard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERVICE DECK - CELESTIAL PROMENADE
text: Aurora stands in front of her easel on the promenade. She
text: looks out the window and begins to paint.
speaker_heading: AURORA (V.O.)
dialog: Something worth doing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOPPING DISTRICT - AVENUE
text: Jim plays kick-the-can with the empty vodka bottle. Drunk.
text: The bottle clatters against the PHOTO BOOTH.
text: Muttering in Russian, Jim attacks the booth, punching and
text: kicking - and hurts his foot with a shout. He limps away.
text: A moment later he's back - wearing his tool belt. He pulls a
text: LASER CUTTER and starts carving the booth away from the wall.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHOPPING DISTRICT - LATER
text: Jim drives his golf cart unsteadily across the deck.
text: A HORRIBLE NOISE: he's dragging the photo booth across the
text: floor by its power cord.
dialog: 
scene_heading: STARBOARD E.V.A. ROOM
text: Jim looks into the airlock through the small porthole in the
text: inner door. Red lights flash.
text: The photo booth is crammed into the airlock.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - AIRLOCK
text: The airlock shoots open. The photo booth tumbles into space.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR - EVENING
text: Arthur does make-work behind the bar.
text: Jim and Aurora approach simultaneously. They meet awkwardly:
dialog: they haven't spoken in a long time.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (DRUNK)
dialog: You! Tuesday's my day with Arthur.
dialog: You're trespassing.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Actually, today's Wednesday.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I slept through Tuesday?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Forget it. The bar's all yours. But
dialog: I'd say a drink is the last thing you
dialog: need. You're pathetic.
text: Aurora leaves. Jim takes a seat.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What'll it be?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm going to kill myself.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm a murderer.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Who'd you murder?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Aurora.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
text: But she's alive. She was just here.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: She won't talk to me. She won't let
dialog: me tell her what happened. How I fell
dialog: in love with her. How I want to be
dialog: with her. And I'm not sorry I woke
dialog: her up. I'm not. I love her. And you
dialog: know what? She loves me.
text: Around the corner, out of sight, Aurora stands listening.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: What was I supposed to do? I couldn't
dialog: live without her. It was now or
dialog: never, and I chose now. I chose now.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: And I was right. But I woke her up,
dialog: Arthur. I woke her up, and she says I
text: killed her. And now she's gone. She's
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: (SOBBING)
dialog: Gimme another bottle.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I think you've had enough.
text: Jim looks at Arthur as if he's said something profound.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You know what? You're right. I've had
dialog: enough.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK A - CARGO HOLD - DAY
text: Jim drives his cart up to a rack of large batteries: they're
text: identical to the battery that powers the golf cart itself.
text: Jim starts loading his cart with extra batteries.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERVICE DECK - CELESTIAL PROMENADE
text: Paintings leans against the windows: Aurora's starscapes. The
text: first few are rudimentary, the later ones quite good.
text: She works on a new one: a red nebula. She looks out the
text: window - and her focus changes. She sees her own reflection.
text: Her brush moves across the canvas. She adds the suggestion of
text: a cheekbone...a slender neck...an eye. A face made of stars.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK C - MACHINE SHOP
text: Jim finishes connecting a bank of batteries to his cart's
dialog: motor: quadrupling the power.
text: He rolls a huge tractor tire up to the cart and bolts it on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK FOUR - SHOPPING DISTRICT
text: Aurora jogs.
text: A rumble and wail of rubber behind her. Jim's monster golf
text: cart comes ROARING toward her.
text: Aurora leaps for safety as the cart passes. Jim blasts past
text: her with a war whoop and a wave. He wears welding goggles.
text: Aurora looks after Jim in astonishment.
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK FOUR - SERVICE CORRIDOR
text: Jim races down a long straightaway. Squeals around a corner.
text: Puts the cart on two wheels as he dodges a cleaning robot.
text: He steers down a stairway: The cart bounces crazily down to
text: the deck below. At the bottom Jim takes the corner too hard.
text: The cart tumbles and SLAMS into the bulkhead. Debris rains
text: down. Jim lies crumpled in the wreckage, his goggles askew.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK
text: Aurora sits in her writing chair, a slate in front of her.
text: But the slate is blank, and her face is tense.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I haven't written in days. I don't
dialog: know why. It's the old problem, I
dialog: guess. Who's my reader? Who am I
dialog: talking to? What's it for?
speaker_heading: (SHE SIGHS)
dialog: I used to love it.

scene_heading: SERVICE DECK - INFIRMARY
text: Jim lies in the autodoc in his underwear - his head

speaker_heading: AUTODOC
text: Two separated ribs. Fracture of the
dialog: right arm, radius and ulna. One
text: fractured finger. Dislocated thumb.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Am I gonna be okay?
text: Blindingly fast, robot arms straighten Jim's elbow. Wrap his
text: ribs and arm with smooth white bandages. Jim shouts in shock.
speaker_heading: AUTODOC
dialog: Leave the bandages on for one week.
text: The autodoc opens and Jim climbs out, testing his arm. A
text: bottle of pills rattles into a tray in front of him.
speaker_heading: AUTODOC (CONT'D)
dialog: Take one of these pills each day
text: until they are gone.

scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
text: Aurora paints, wild-eyed and fragile.
text: Her brushstrokes are fierce. She slashes at the canvas. As

text: painting. The easel shakes as she works.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE
text: Jim kneels on the Grand Concourse. He's torn a huge hole in
text: the carpet to expose the deck plates beneath.
text: With his laser cutter he cuts a large rectangular hole. Pries
text: the plate up with a crowbar, opening a cavity in the deck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA'S CABIN
text: Aurora paces in her bathrobe, hair wrapped in a towel.
text: She looks at her gallery of snapshots. Touches the pictures
text: one by one. The faces begin to move and speak. A cacophony of
text: good wishes. Laughter and cheers.
text: Finally only one clip still plays. Aurora's mother.
speaker_heading: AURORA'S MOTHER
dialog: I promise you we'll think of you
dialog: every day. When you wake up, I know
dialog: we'll be gone...but you just know

text: (She starts to cry.)
dialog: I don't understand, baby. I'm trying,

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Hello, Jim. Whiskey?
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Iced tea.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Coming up. Are you getting my

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Got to get dirty to get things done,

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Improvements.

scene_heading: ELITE DECK - ELITE PROMENADE - EVENING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE
text: Aurora walks wonderingly up to a GARDEN on the Concourse: a

dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK
text: Jim walks through Aurora's informal art gallery.
text: She has abandoned starscapes in favor of self-portraiture.
text: The painted faces ever more tragic.
text: The last one is a field of white. Aurora fading away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INFIRMARY - GENETIC BANK - DAY
text: Wisps of cold mist roll off the metal capsules. Aurora

text: With a start she comes across her own name. AURORA DUNN,
scene_heading: FEMALE, BORN 4/27/2819.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She punches buttons. The racks rotate, shedding flakes of
text: frost. She finds what she's looking for. JAMES PRESTON, MALE,
speaker_heading: BORN 9/9/2810.
text: She looks at the metal cartridge for a long moment. Then she
text: slaps a switch, and the genetic bank closes up on itself.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - LOUNGE
text: Jim sits reading an electronic slate. He looks up to find

speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I need you.

speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, I need a repairman.
text: Jim's face falls.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AURORA'S CABIN
text: Jim opens the door. Inside is chaos: the lights throb. Static
text: sizzles on video screens. Speakers blare noise. The blinds
text: jerk and flap. The adjustable bed convulses like a monster.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Wow. You do need a repairman.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AURORA'S CABIN - LATER
text: A dark room. In the light of a utility lamp, Jim re-attaches

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The control unit burned out. I took

text: He throws a switch. The lights come on. Back to normal.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: VOICE (VIA INTERCOM)

scene_heading: SUBDECK C - MACHINE SHOP

scene_heading: DECK ONE - HIBERNATION BAY

speaker_heading: VOICE (VIA INTERCOM)
dialog: This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.

text: Hibernation Facility stands open.
speaker_heading: VOICE (VIA INTERCOM) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE
text: GUS MANCUSO stands at a deck steward's station, intercom mic
text: in hand. A stocky man of 55, with a bristling mustache,
text: wearing a crewman's coverall. Haggard and weary. He stares in
text: consternation at the garden in the middle of the Concourse.
text: Running footsteps.
text: Jim and Aurora race into the Concourse from opposite
text: directions. They see Gus and stop, astonished.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (pointing at the tree)
dialog: Who did that?
text: Jim raises a hand sheepishly. Gus shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't even talk about that now. Who
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Jim Preston. Rate-two mechanic.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Mechanic, huh?
speaker_heading: (TO AURORA)
dialog: And who are you?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Aurora. Aurora Dunn.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Gus Mancuso, Senior Deck Chief. Nice
dialog: to meet you.
dialog: (looks at the tree again)
dialog: How long have you been awake?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: A year.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Two years.
speaker_heading: GUS

speaker_heading: CAFETERIA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I always get a hibernation hangover
dialog: but this is the worst ever.
speaker_heading: (HE DRINKS)
dialog: So it's just the two of you?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Two years. Ouch.
dialog: (looks them in the eye)
dialog: You know what it means, right?
text: There's no way back into hibernation.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I was hoping you'd know something we
dialog: didn't.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No. We're awake for the duration. How
dialog: far along are we? You know?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Thirty-two years. Eighty-eight years
dialog: to go.
text: Gus blows air.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: That's tough.
dialog: (he shakes his head)
dialog: Hibernation failure! They said it
dialog: couldn't happen. And now three on one
dialog: trip.
text: Aurora shoots Jim a look. Gus doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, let's see what we can do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMAND DECK
text: Gus leads Jim and Aurora to the Bridge's armored hatch. He
text: swipes his crew card and the door opens.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You have no idea how long I've been
dialog: trying to get in here.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Now you're in. Don't touch anything.

speaker_heading: BRIDGE

speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: We're on course....Whatever's wrong
text: with the ship, NavComp's still
text: minding the store.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What do you think is wrong?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Three pod failures? Something's
dialog: wrong. Question is what.
text: He turns to leave.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Wait. What about diverting the ship?
dialog: Can we go back to Earth?
text: Gus almost laughs.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: We're going forty percent of
dialog: lightspeed away from Earth. To go
dialog: home we'd have to come to a stop,
text: accelerate back towards Earth, and
dialog: then come to a stop again. It'd take
dialog: as long as going on to Homestead II.
dialog: Anyway, navigation's not for
dialog: amateurs. Space is a big place, and a
dialog: planet's just a little thing.
text: Gus has a coughing fit. Wipes his mouth with his fist.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go next door. See how the old
dialog: girl's doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIAGNOSTIC CENTER
text: Gus opens a secure compartment beside the bridge. Inside, the
text: Diagnostic Computer stands dark and dead.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I thought we'd see a lot of red
dialog: lights here. That would mean trouble.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: So everything's okay?
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No, if everything was okay we'd see a
text: lot of green lights here.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What does no lights mean?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No lights means big trouble.
dialog: Diagnostic Computer's down. We've got
dialog: some work to do.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What do you need?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Right now? Cheeseburger.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - STARDUST DINER
text: Gus eats a cheeseburger. Jim and Aurora sit across from him.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (with his mouth full)
dialog: Never been so hungry. Worst
text: hibernation hangover ever.
text: Jim can't take his eyes off Gus. A new person.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: So where you from, Gus?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Grew up in Chicago. But I've lived on
dialog: this ship a long time. The
dialog: Excelsior's made five inter-planetary
dialog: runs, and I've been on every one. I
dialog: live aboard. When she makes port, I
dialog: live where she lands until she lifts
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (doing the math)
dialog: How old does that make you?
speaker_heading: GUS
text: Fifty-six.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: But how long ago were you born?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Oh. Hang on...
dialog: (he does mental math)
dialog: About six hundred years ago.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Most of that I lost to hibernation or
dialog: relativity. Doesn't really count.
dialog: (he coughs again)
dialog: I tell you, I feel about six hundred
dialog: years old right now. I woke up hard.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You should rest.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I think I will.
dialog: (he climbs to his feet)
dialog: Tomorrow morning, eight bells, you
dialog: meet me beside that tree of yours.
dialog: Until I figure out what's wrong with
dialog: the Excelsior, you work for me.
text: Jim and Aurora smile.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Good night, Gus.
text: Gus waves and walks off. That leaves Jim and Aurora sitting
text: awkwardly on the same side of a diner booth.
text: After a moment Aurora moves over to the other side. Looks at
text: Jim across the table.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: Six hundred years old!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I've missed you.
text: Aurora stares, caught off guard. She gets up.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: See you in the morning.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - DIAGNOSTIC CENTER - MORNING
text: Gus and Jim examine the Diagnostic Computer. Jim holds a
text: flashlight while Gus pokes around with a voltmeter inside.
text: Behind them, Aurora stands watching with a digital slate.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: The CPU's burned out, can you believe
dialog: it? Why should that happen? It's
dialog: rated for five hundred years.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Can you fix it?
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You don't fix it, you replace it.
dialog: There are spares for everything in
dialog: storage. Make a note. Diagnostic
text: Computer CPU. And a new cooling fan,
text: this one looks shot.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Got it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE
text: Gus and Aurora stand waiting as if for a bus.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Don't take this the wrong way - I
dialog: wish for your sake you were still
dialog: asleep - but I'm glad you're here.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Thank you, sweetheart.
text: A GROWL of gears. Jim drives up in his souped-up golf cart.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: JIM
text: The golf cart.
text: Gus takes in the bank of batteries, the giant tractor wheels.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: This I like.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK A - NUMBER TEN CARGO BAY
text: Jim pilots the cart through the stacks. Aurora rides shotgun.
text: Gus, in the back seat, plays a flashlight over the stacks.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Next bay is the ship's stores. So how
dialog: fast can she go?
text: Jim puts the pedal down. The cart lays rubber on the deck
text: plates and shoots down the aisle while Aurora and Gus yell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHIP'S STORES
text: Up on a hydraulic lift, Gus digs components out of storage.
text: Hands them to Aurora, who hands them to Jim, who loads them
text: into the cart.
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIAGNOSTIC CENTER
text: Gus works on the Diagnostic Computer while Jim looks on.
text: Nearby, Aurora thumbs through Gus's technical manuals.
text: Gus clamps a final component in place and nods at Jim.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Start `er up.
text: Jim closes a circuit breaker and powers up the computer. A
text: deep electrical HUM as the machine boots up.
text: The screen flashes a message: RUNNING VESSEL DIAGNOSTIC. A
text: progress bar shows that the diagnostic is 0.0% complete.
text: The lights on the indicator panel remain dark. The first
text: light begins to flicker as the diagnostic runs.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: How long will it take?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Full diagnostic from a cold start?
dialog: Days. But it'll tell us everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE
text: Gus strolls through the ship, looking around nostalgically.
text: He passes Jim's garden and shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONCOURSE BAR
text: Gus walks up to the bar.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Chief Mancuso! Good to see you.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Good to see you too, Arthur.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What can I get you?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Just an ice water with a little
dialog: lemon. I feel hot as hell.
text: Gus mops sweat from his brow and sips his water. His hand
text: trembles hard enough to rattle the ice cubes.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS'S CABIN
text: A homey space, filled with Gus's possessions: pictures of
text: fellow spacers and vacation spots on half a dozen planets.
text: Books, keepsakes and mementos.
text: Gus sits on his bed, on a handmade quilt. Coughs violently
text: into a handkerchief, leaving the cloth spotted with blood.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - GARDEN - MORNING
text: Aurora stands waiting by the oak tree. Jim arrives with two
text: cups of coffee, and hands her one. Aurora smiles, touched.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Thank you.
text: Gus arrives in a fresh coverall, a steaming mug in hand. No
text: signs of frailty. He hands each of them a digital slate.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: All right. Last night I checked ten
dialog: atmosphere stations and two of them
dialog: were burned out. Twenty percent
dialog: failure rate. Unheard of. So we're
dialog: going to see how far the rot runs.
speaker_heading: (TO AURORA)
dialog: You. You're going to walk Decks Two,
dialog: Three, and Four, and check every
dialog: atmosphere station. Green light good,
dialog: red light bad, no light really bad.
dialog: Write down what you find, I want a
dialog: complete census.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (TO JIM)
dialog: You. Go down to the Ship's Stores.
dialog: Find atmosphere station CPUs and take
dialog: an inventory of the spares. I know
dialog: what the manifest says, but lists
dialog: ain't facts.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Got it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm going down to the Hibernation Bay
dialog: to look at our pods. Maybe I can spot
dialog: what went wrong.
text: Jim and Aurora exchange glances.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: That should be interesting.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIBERNATION BAY - AURORA'S POD - DAY
text: Gus kneels in front of the pod, examining the mechanism.
text: Alone, he doesn't hide his difficulty: sweating and panting.
text: Something he finds inside the machine makes him forget his
text: symptoms. He stares, astonished.
speaker_heading: GUS
text: Son of a gun.
text: A sound behind him. Gus turns to find Jim watching. He looks
text: from Jim to the pod mechanism and back again.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're supposed to be doing
dialog: inventory.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I finished.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (holding Jim's eyes)
dialog: I looked at your pod. Very simple.
text: The clock chips burned out. Not
dialog: supposed to happen, but it's simple.
text: Jim fidgets. Starts to speak. Gus cuts him off.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: My pod was complicated. A bunch of
dialog: different failures at once, the whole
dialog: thing went haywire. I think that's
dialog: why I feel so bad.
dialog: (points at Aurora's pod)
dialog: But this pod...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gus...
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: You did this.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I was thinking what a lucky son of a
dialog: bitch you were, stuck with a beauty
dialog: like Aurora. But it wasn't luck.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No.
text: Gus sits down heavily, looking at Jim.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: She knows?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: She knows.
text: Gus thinks that over, shaking his head at the idea.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I could see there was some trouble
dialog: between you.
text: Gus starts putting his tools away. Jim lays the electronic
text: slate down beside him.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Here's your inventory. I'll be in the
dialog: machine shop if you need me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - DIAGNOSTIC CENTER
text: Gus sits working. Behind him the Diagnostic Computer displays
dialog: its progress bar: the diagnostic is 9% complete.
text: Aurora enters with a digital slate.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I finished the census.
speaker_heading: (SHE HESITATES)
dialog: You saw the hibernation pods?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: So you know. What Jim did.
text: Aurora's chin begins to tremble.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yeah, he told me.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: He told you? Just like that? And?
text: She waits, trembling with righteous indignation. Gus doesn't
text: want to get into this: he looks away uncomfortably.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not forgivable, Gus. It's not.
dialog: Don't tell me it is.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No, it's a bad thing. But...
dialog: (he shrugs helplessly)
text: Look. When a drowning man drags
dialog: somebody down with him, you don't
dialog: call it right. But he's drowning. A
text: starving man steals a loaf of bread,
dialog: what can you say? You should have
dialog: starved?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I would have starved.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Really?
text: Aurora looks hard at Gus, thinking, and says nothing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - ARGENTINA STEAKHOUSE - EVENING
text: A rustic restaurant. Gus, Jim, and Aurora sit around a table.
text: Gus reads an electronic slate.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: By Aurora's count, about thirty
dialog: percent of the atmosphere station
text: CPUs are burned out.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We can replace them.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: We will. But they'll just burn out
dialog: again if we don't figure out why it's
dialog: happening.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Where do we start?
speaker_heading: GUS
text: We wait for the diagnostic report.
dialog: You've been knocking around this ship
dialog: for two years. A few days more won't
dialog: kill you.
text: Gus hacks and coughs. For a moment his weakness is plain to
text: see...but robots sweep in and lay dishes on the table. Gus
text: sets his slate aside.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you go. This is the best food on
dialog: the ship.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - CONCOURSE BAR
text: Jim, Aurora, and Gus sit at the bar. Arthur stands by.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: So how did you end up in space?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Only place I ever wanted to be. When
dialog: I was sixteen I lied about my age and
text: got onto a lunar shuttle crew. A few
dialog: years later I moved on to planetary
dialog: ships. Made the Venus run a hundred
dialog: times, then Jupiter and Saturn. Then
dialog: the gravity drive came along. Real
dialog: spaceflight. I did everything I could
dialog: to get onto an interstellar ship. I
dialog: was thirty-six years old the first
dialog: time I saw an alien sun. No going
dialog: back after that. I've walked on
dialog: seventeen planets in five solar
dialog: systems.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's incredible.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Don't you feel homeless?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I'm a spacer. My home is where I am.
dialog: You can't take much with you, so you
dialog: don't get hung up on things. You have
dialog: yourself. The things you do. The
dialog: company you keep.
text: Gus pushes himself off his stool. Momentarily shaky, he pulls
dialog: himself together.
text: He takes a seat at the grand piano and plays - a fine
text: beerhall pianist. Gus touches a switch and lifts his hands:
text: the piano keeps playing.
text: Gus stands and extends a hand to Aurora. She takes it, and
text: Gus sweeps her across the floor.
text: Jim watches from the bar.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (aside, to Jim)
text: Gus always dances with the ladies.
dialog: 101.
dialog:

text: unreadable. They watch each other as the dance goes on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GRAND CONCOURSE - THE GARDEN - MORNING
text: Jim and Aurora wait beside the garden. They've been waiting
text: for a while. Both look around for Gus.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You haven't seen him at all?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS'S CABIN DOOR
text: A doorbell chimes. Jim and Aurora wait in the hall,

speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I don't think he's up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUS'S CABIN
text: Gus lies feverish and semi-conscious in his bed.
text: A THUNK! The door slides open. Jim and Aurora rush in.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gus! Are you all right?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No. No, I'm not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INFIRMARY
text: Gus lies in a medical scanner. Jim and Aurora watch as the

speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Couldn't get up. Weak as a baby. What
dialog: does it say is wrong with me?
text: The scanner's display screen lists not one diagnosis, but
dialog: hundreds: disorders, diseases, dysfunctions.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (hiding his horror)
dialog: It's a few things.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL SCANNER
dialog: Diagnosis complete.
text: Gus hauls himself out of the scanner. Pulls a bathrobe on and
text: comes around to look at the screen. He sees it and blanches.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEDICAL SCANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Six hundred twelve disorders found.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What's the summary?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL SCANNER
dialog: Pan-systemic necrosis. Progressive
dialog: organ failure. Cause unknown.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: (losing his temper)
dialog: I'll tell you the cause. My goofy
text: hibernation pod is the cause.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What's the treatment?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL SCANNER
dialog: No treatment known.
text: Gus pivots the monitor so that only he can see it.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Prognosis.
text: A series of images flickers over the screen, casting shadows
text: on his face. Gus swallows hard and looks away.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: How long have I got?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL SCANNER
dialog: Between two and three days.
text: A long moment of silence. Gus turns and exits.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL SCANNER (CONT'D)
dialog: These sedatives will alleviate
dialog: suffering in the final hours...
text: Pill bottles clatter into a metal bin. Aurora scoops them up.
text: Jim goes after Gus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Gus settles himself behind the wheel of Jim's cart.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gus!
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Sorry, Jim.
text: Gus puts his foot down and the cart squeals away.
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Aurora stumbles into the hall, her hands full of pill

dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - COMMUNICATIONS CENTER
text: Aurora sits at the security console, watching the monitors.
text: Jim enters.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: He's not in his room.
text: Aurora flips on the intercom, speaks into the mic. Her voice
text: resonates through the ship.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Where are you? Gus, please answer.
dialog: We'll be at the Concourse Bar every
dialog: hour. I'm really worried.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Where is he? What's he doing?
speaker_heading: GUS (O.S.)
dialog: What are you doing?

speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Guy's got a couple of days to live
dialog: and he can't get any peace.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Where have you been?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Making arrangements. You kids have
dialog: dinner plans?
speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: GUS

speaker_heading: (EXITING)
dialog: Now stop shouting at me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GUS'S CABIN - EVENING
text: Gus makes a tour of the room, touching his photographs and
text: mementos in farewell.
text: He puts on his dress uniform: chest crowded with medals and
text: decorations for the planets he's seen, the voyages he's made.
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He takes a photograph from a dresser: a handsome woman in her
text: forties. Kisses the snapshot. Tucks it in his breast pocket.
text: In the mirror he studies his haggard face.
text: Suddenly he SHOUTS, a wordless cry of anger. Pounds on the
text: dresser with his fists. Teeth clenched in pain and fury.
text: Then he straightens. Stands at attention. Takes a deep
text: breath. Pivots on his heel and leaves the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: STARDOME - XANADU - NIGHT
text: Jim and Aurora enter the Stardome to find Gus sitting shaky

speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You look magnificent.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (TO JIM)
dialog: Ladies love the dress blues.
dialog: (to both of them)
dialog: Thanks for coming. Sorry to run out
dialog: today, but I didn't have a lot of
dialog: time, and there was a lot to do.
text: He sips his wine. Jim and Aurora watch with concern.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: How you feeling?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Fine, fine.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Gus, just because some stupid machine
dialog: says there's no cure...
speaker_heading: GUS
text: State-of-the-art machine, Aurora.
dialog: Anyway, I can feel it happening.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: But you just got here. It's barely

speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: No point counting the days.

speaker_heading: XANADU - LATER
text: Their dinners are nearly done. Gus pours more wine. He's in
text: the middle of a tale of adventure.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: A pure oxygen environment is about as
dialog: dangerous a place as you can be. A
dialog: steel pipe will burn in pure O2. And
dialog: there I am with a hammer, trying to
dialog: close this valve and stop the oxygen
dialog: flow, when one spark will kill us
dialog: all. But the thing is, O2 makes you
dialog: punchy. So I can't stop laughing. And
text: then the guys behind me start in, and
dialog: soon everybody's going. Captain's
text: giggling like a girl. The Navigator
text: pissed his pants laughing.
text: Jim and Aurora laugh. But pain contorts Gus's face. He grips
text: the table with white knuckles. And nobody's laughing anymore.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: This is happening fast. I got some
dialog: things for you. Come with me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK FOUR - STARBOARD E.V.A. ROOM
text: On a table at the edge of the plaza, a small pile of objects
text: waits. Gus stops beside them. Turns to Jim and Aurora.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I went through the ship's manuals and
dialog: made notes wherever there was
dialog: something special you should know.
dialog: These should keep you straight. In a
dialog: few days the Diagnostic Computer will
dialog: show you what needs fixing.
text: He takes his shipcard from around his neck. Hands it to Jim.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Oh, God! Gus, no!
dialog: 106.

dialog: Are you sure about this?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: If you knew how this feels, Jimbo,
dialog: you wouldn't ask me to stay.
text: Gus extends a hand to Aurora. She throws her arms around him.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Gus. I can't stand it. There's got to
dialog: be some other way. Don't do this.
text: Gus gently frees himself from her arms.
speaker_heading: GUS
speaker_heading: (TENDERLY)
dialog: It's all right, Aurora. It's all
dialog: right.
text: Gus turns to Jim. They clasp hands. Slap each other's
text: shoulders in a rough embrace.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: Jim. Fix the ship.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: And take care of each other.
text: Gus turns and opens the airlock. He straightens, squares his
text: shoulders, and steps inside. Turns to face them.
speaker_heading: GUS (CONT'D)
dialog: All right.
text: Aurora covers her mouth. Jim raises a hand in stunned
text: farewell. The airlock door closes. Red lights flash.
text: Through the porthole they see Gus look out into space.
text: Then the outer door slams open and a blast of air shoots Gus
text: out among the stars. His body lost in the infinite night.
text: Aurora steps into Jim's arms. Lays her head on his chest. For
text: a moment he holds her. Then she pushes him gently back. Meets
text: his eyes sadly.
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim watches her walk away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GRAND CONCOURSE - DAY
text: Arthur polishes glasses, chipper as ever. A SWEEPER ROBOT
text: passes on its daily errands.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK
text: Aurora slouches in her writing chair, staring into space - a
text: picture of sorrow.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK C - MACHINE SHOP
text: Jim sits motionless at his workbench, brooding.
text: A CLATTER rouses him.
text: Jim's little pet robot is banging its head against the wall,
text: emitting beeps of distress. Jim frowns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROBOTICS CENTER
text: Jim walks in. Everywhere robots bunch and stumble.
text: A pair of sweeper robots fight to enter the same recharging
text: niche. They trip up a procession of gangly window washers -
text: who stumble into a parade of robot waiters.
text: Chaos spreads. The robots' clockwork perfection upset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAFETERIA
text: Aurora draws a glass of orange juice and gets green sludge.
text: Dials for toast and gets two slices of charcoal.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - DIAGNOSTIC CENTER
text: Aurora enters. The Diagnostic Computer's console is no longer
text: dark: it's a sea of green and red lights. A lot of red.
text: The computer's screen reads "Diagnostic Complete." It
text: displays a long list of error messages.
text: 271 Aurora stares in horror at the red lights. 271
text: Jim enters behind her. Takes in the bad news.
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: There's trouble everywhere.
dialog: Atmosphere systems, water systems,
dialog: waste systems, robot control.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: What's happening?
text: Aurora goes to the worktable: its surface displays the
dialog: diagnostic report. Thousands of faults and failures.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: It started two years ago. Thirty
dialog: years with no trouble, then forty-
text: seven failures in a single day.
dialog: (reading the list)
dialog: Structural concussion.
text: System overvoltage.
dialog: Transient pressure anomaly.
dialog: Circuit reset, conduit 12.
text: Sync failure, hibernation pod 1498.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Pod 1498? That's me!
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Whatever happened that day woke you
dialog: up.
text: She pulls up a graph of failures over time: A trickle of
text: breakdowns that swells into a torrent.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Ever since then, more and more
text: failures. Faster and faster.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: How do we find out what's going on?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We start at the beginning. The
dialog: breakdowns from the day I woke up.
text: Aurora brings up a map of the ship on the display. Red
text: markers blink on the map.
speaker_heading: AURORA
text: They're all on Deck One.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK FOUR - AFT FIREWALL
text: An armored hatch leads to the Engine Room.
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim wears his tool belt. Aurora carries a flashlight. Each of
text: them carries one of Gus's manuals.
text: Jim swipes Gus's crew card and the hatch opens. They go in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENGINE COMPARTMENT - UPPER LEVEL
text: A huge space spanning multiple decks at the rear of the ship.
text: Here the real heart of the Excelsior throbs in the dark.
text: Jim and Aurora emerge into a humming electrical station. Jim
text: peers at gauges.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: Power Converter seems okay.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: The failures are all below us.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENGINE COMPARTMENT - MIDDLE LEVEL
text: A huge sphere 120 feet across dominates the compartment.
text: Signs read: CAUTION - FUSION REACTOR. A deep RUMBLE.
text: Jim and Aurora descend beside the reactor on a spiral stair.
text: They emerge onto a catwalk at the reactor's equator and walk
text: around the sphere.
dialog: 
scene_heading: REACTOR CONTROL ROOM
text: Jim cards open a door labeled "REACTOR CONTROL ROOM." Red
text: light pours out. They enter.
speaker_heading: JIM &amp; AURORA
speaker_heading: (TOGETHER)
dialog: Don't touch anything.
text: Banks of control panels - but Jim and Aurora have eyes only
text: for the windows into the reactor's heart.
text: Inside the reactor is a caged sun: an orb of fire hanging in
text: space. Loops and tongues of flame leap from its surface.
text: It roars like a forest fire.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Scares the hell out of me.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What keeps it in?
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gravity. The gravity plant gives us
dialog: weight. Propels the ship. And it
dialog: contains the fusion reaction. All one
dialog: system.
text: Aurora watches Jim as he walks among the consoles, studying
dialog: the instruments.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Not much trouble here. A couple of
text: computers running hot.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: The cluster of failures is still one
dialog: level down.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENGINE COMPARTMENT - LOWER LEVEL
text: Jim and Aurora emerge from an elevator. They come to a door
text: marked CENTRAL COMPUTING.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: This should be it.
text: Jim cards the door with Gus's shipcard. The lock flashes a
text: red light and stays closed.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gus's card should open any door.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: (flipping through her manual)
dialog: Let me try an override code.
text: She squeezes past Jim. Taps at the door's keypad. Jim peers
text: through the narrow window in the door.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Wait a sec, maybe there's a reason
dialog: the door...
text: The light flashes green.
text: The door begins to slide open.
text: A HOWLING WIND sucks Aurora against the crack in the door.
text: She screams. Jim grabs at her. A hurricane drags her inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CENTRAL COMPUTER FACILITY
text: Aurora tumbles into the room and smashes into a column. She
text: clings in the gale-force wind, grimacing in pain.
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: There's a RAGGED HOLE punched in the hull. Outside, stars
text: burn in the vacuum of space. A tornado of escaping air
text: screams out through the hole.
text: Red lights flash. Claxons sound. The door begins to close.
text: Jim pulls a HAMMER from his belt and jams it crossways in the
text: doorway, propping open the door. The door's motors whine.
text: Jim dives inside. Skids to a stop beside Aurora. Pulls her
text: loose from the column and shoves her toward the door,
text: fighting the wind.
text: Aurora scrambles through the doorway. Jim tries to follow -
text: but the hammer suddenly bends and springs out of the doorway.
text: The door slams: Aurora outside, Jim in the airless room.
text: The last of the atmosphere flashes away into space.
text: Aurora screams and pounds on the other side of the door. But
text: Jim hears only his own thudding heartbeat.
text: The last air leaves Jim's lungs in a silent shout, vapor
text: whipping away between his teeth.
text: He spins. Scans the room desperately.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE DOOR
text: Aurora re-enters the override code. But the code is denied.
text: She drops to her knees. Scans frantically through her manual.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE AIRLESS ROOM
text: Jim rips open a wide metal drawer built into the wall. It's
text: full of computer components: Jim sweeps them onto the floor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE DOOR
text: Aurora tears open an instrument panel beside the door,
text: revealing a yellow emergency button marked "PURGE." She flips
text: back the safety catch and slams the button.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE AIRLESS ROOM
text: White jets of compressed air blast from the ceiling, turning
text: the room into a whirling tornado of debris.
text: Jim clings for his life, gulping air as flying fragments
dialog: batter him.
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The wind tears him from his handholds and hurls him toward
text: the jagged hole in the hull.
text: He falls ACROSS THE HOLE. Metal fangs inches from his body.
text: He strains to avoid being speared or sucked out into space.
text: The air jets stop. The wind dies as the air escapes.
text: Jim lunges back to the open drawer. Pulls the LASER CUTTER
text: from his tool belt and cuts the entire drawer free.
text: He turns back, holding the metal DRAWER like a shield - and
text: staggers, half fainting.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE DOOR
text: Aurora sees Jim falter. Slams the PURGE button again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE AIRLESS ROOM
text: Compressed air blasts into the room, renewing the windstorm.
text: Jim rides the wind, sliding across the steel deck and
text: SLAMMING the steel drawer across the hole in the hull.
text: Air screams away through the gaps.
text: Jim lunges to an emergency locker and pulls out an epoxy
text: foamer - a steel canister like a fire extinguisher. He aims
text: it at the hole in the hull and pulls the trigger.
text: ORANGE FOAM blasts out, stiffening into a hard plastic. Jim
text: buries the steel drawer and the hull breach in foam.
text: His eyes flutter closed. Starved of oxygen, he falls limp.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE DOOR
text: Aurora hits the PURGE button. White jets of air blast into
text: the sealed room. The pressure comes up. The door slides open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CENTRAL COMPUTER FACILITY
text: Aurora dashes in. Falls to her knees beside Jim. Takes his
text: pulse. Listens for breath: he's not breathing. She presses
text: her mouth over his and blows air into his lungs.
text: After a moment Jim coughs. He opens bloodshot eyes. She props
text: his head on her knee.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Jim. Are you okay?
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim breathes deeply. Blinks his eyes.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I think I'm all right.
dialog: (his eyes go wide)
dialog: Look.
text: In the center of the room a round column houses the CORE
text: COMPUTER. There's a CRATER blasted in the machine.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: That's the core computer.
text: Jim hauls himself to his feet, leaning on Aurora. He
text: approaches the blasted computer. Reaches into the hole.
text: Strains. A CREAK...and Jim pulls a melon-sized METEOR from
text: the crater. An orb of pitted metal.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - DIAGNOSTIC CENTER
text: Jim and Aurora sit at the worktable. The meteor sits between
text: them on the table.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: A meteor.
speaker_heading: AURORA
text: A rock.
text: They stare at the meteor: the cause of it all.
text: A BEEP: on the Diagnostic Computer's console, more green
text: lights turn red. New errors pop up on the diagnostic report.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't get it. This thing hit down
dialog: on Deck One. But there are failures
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (A BRAINSTORM)
dialog: The computers are networked. Ever
dialog: since the core computer got blown
dialog: away, all the other computers must
dialog: have been carrying the load. Running
text: at full capacity around the clock for
text: two years. They're burning out.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: And every computer that burns out
text: increases the load on the others.
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah. The breakdown accelerates. If
dialog: we don't stop it, the whole ship will
dialog: go down.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: I'm trapped on a sinking ship?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Gus said there's spares for
dialog: everything. If we replace the core
dialog: computer, it'll pick up the load. The
dialog: burnouts will stop.
text: Another BEEP. Another green light turns red.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SUBDECK A - SHIP'S STORES
text: Jim pilots his golf cart at breakneck speed through the cargo
text: racks. Aurora rides shotgun, reading an electronic map.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Two more rows, then left!
text: The cart squeals around a corner.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CENTRAL COMPUTER FACILITY
text: Aurora buries the hull breach in another layer of epoxy foam.
text: Jim wrestles a massive crate off the golf cart's cargo deck.
text: Wearily uncrates the replacement computer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CENTRAL COMPUTER FACILITY - LATER
text: Aurora inspects the replacement core computer, a manual in
text: her hands. The pages she's consulting are covered with Gus's
text: handwritten notes.
text: Jim sits on the floor with another manual. Cables and
text: connectors lie around him on the floor.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: First you connect the data bus, then
text: the sync cable, then bridge the power
dialog: and backup power...you're supposed to
text: run a startup checklist, but Gus made
dialog: a note. He says you can skip straight
dialog: to power-up as long as you...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (FROWNING)
dialog: Jim!
text: Jim is nodding off over his manual. He looks up, blinking.
speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to sleep. We can't make
dialog: mistakes here.
speaker_heading: JIM
speaker_heading: (GROGGY)
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You just got sucked into outer space.
dialog: Take a break.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - BERLIN SUITE - NIGHT
text: Jim lies asleep in trousers and T-shirt, dead to the world.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK NINE - AURORA'S CABIN - DAWN
text: Aurora wakes. Rolls out of bed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: COMMAND DECK - DIAGNOSTIC CENTER - DAY
text: Aurora sips coffee. Surveys the Diagnostic Computer's warning
text: lights. Turns to stare thoughtfully at the meteor itself.
text: She exits.
text: The console flickers. A green light turns red. And another.
text: The pattern of red lights spreads like a bloodstain.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - BERLIN SUITE
text: Jim still lies sleeping. He hasn't moved a muscle. Aurora
text: looks in on him, and slips quietly away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK TWO - SWIMMING POOL
text: In a bathing suit, Aurora dives into the pool, cleaving the
text: water cleanly and striking out in a crawl stroke.
text: She reaches the end of the lane. Kick-turns and swims back...
text: ...and the gravity cuts out.
text: The water heaves itself into weird humps and tentacles.
text: Aurora flounders in the weightless water.
dialog: 116.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERLIN SUITE (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: Sound asleep, Jim floats weightless from his bed, his blanket
text: billowing. He touches the ceiling.
text: His eyes open. He shouts in astonishment.
text: Gus' crew card floats in front of him. He grabs it. His
text: blanket snarls around him: he struggles to free himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWIMMING POOL (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: Rippling masses of water float everywhere, dividing and
text: merging. There is no surface. There is no up.
text: In the middle of this chaos, Aurora is trying not to drown.
text: A truck-sized blob of water swallows her up.
text: Inside the jiggling mass she struggles, running out of air.
text: She gathers herself. Lunges through the water. Shoots out of
text: the blob, gasping for breath.
text: She drifts within reach of a railing and grabs hold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BERLIN SUITE (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: Jim braces himself in a corner of the ceiling. Spots his tool
text: belt floating in mid-air.
text: He dives through the air, snags his tool belt on the way, and
text: opens the door.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Aurora!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ELITE DECK - ELITE PROMENADE (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: Jim emerges from a corridor onto the promenade: airborne,
text: propelling himself from one handhold to the next.
text: He's barefoot in trousers and undershirt, his toolbelt around
text: his waist. Gus's shipcard around his neck.
speaker_heading: AURORA (O.S.)
dialog: Jim!
text: In the middle of the atrium, Aurora drifts mid-air, far from
text: any handhold. She wears a damp shirt over her bathing suit.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 117.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (EXASPERATED)
text: I'm drifting helplessly.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We've got to get you down. The
dialog: gravity might come back on.
text: Aurora hadn't thought of that. She looks down fearfully.
text: Jim swings over the railing. Braces his feet. Takes aim.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Whoa. Hey. Let's talk about this.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hang on.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: To what?!
text: Jim dives at her like Superman. Wraps his arms around her.
text: They tumble through space until Jim grabs a railing.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: There's no gravity.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah. That's bad.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Why is there no gravity?
speaker_heading: JIM
text: The gravity plant's failing. Internal
dialog: field goes first. After that the
dialog: engines die...then the fusion reactor
dialog: goes nova.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: That is bad.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We've got to get the core computer
dialog: online. Now.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENGINE COMPARTMENT - FUSION REACTOR (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: A roar of THUNDER. The caged sun shudders. Tongues of fire
text: lick from its surface.
dialog: 118.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK FIVE - CORRIDOR (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: Jim and Aurora, getting the hang of it, shoot down a hallway -
text: dodging a robot that spins its wheels in the air.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENGINE COMPARTMENT - CORE COMPUTER ROOM (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: Jim and Aurora float into the room and stare: Jim's golf cart
text: and the replacement Core Computer hang tumbling in the air.
text: Aurora extends her hand to Jim. He takes her hand, and with
text: his other hand grabs a handhold. Aurora floats up and grabs
text: the replacement core computer by a cable. A human chain, they
text: haul it down to the deck.
text: Aurora holds the new computer down. Jim floats up to the
text: ruined old computer. Opens latches. Disconnects cables. Eases
text: the machine out of the column into the air.
text: The room shakes. A deep note in the background falls silent.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: The engines just shut down.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FUSION REACTOR CONTROL ROOM (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: Consoles alive with warning lights. The room is bathed with a
text: hellish glow: the orb of fire swells and roars.
text: A computer burns out with a sputter of flame. The air fills
text: with a haze of smoke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FUSION REACTOR
text: The caged sun boils and swells. Tentacles of flame graze the
text: reactor walls, leaving charred trails.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CORE COMPUTER ROOM (ZERO GRAVITY)
text: Jim and Aurora strain at the replacement computer: it's
text: nearly in place. Each shoves with one hand, gripping a
text: handhold with the other. Their feet kick in the empty air.
text: Red lights flash. A warning klaxon sounds.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
text: Reactor failure. Reactor failure.
dialog: Passengers please remain calm.
text: Aurora holds the computer in place, gripping two handholds,
text: her shoulder planted against the machine.
dialog: 119.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jim floats up, reaches around the computer to connect cables.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Does the data cable go in the "bus"
dialog: port or the "through" port?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Bus port! The blue one!
text: The ship shudders violently, throwing them from side to side.
text: Jim forces one cable after another into their sockets.
text: Aurora tires: the computer slides out of place.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hold it! Hold it!
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Trying!
text: She strains. The computer slides back into place.
text: Jim closes the last connection. Slips out of the niche and
text: lowers the clamps that hold the computer in place.
text: He throws the heavy power lever. The lights go out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR
text: A wave of darkness engulfs the ship.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUBDECK A - CORE COMPUTER ROOM
text: Floating, Jim and Aurora stare at each other in the dark.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Don't know.
text: The core computer flashes to life. The lights come back on.
text: So does the gravity. Jim and Aurora slam to the floor. Inches
text: away, the old computer plunges down and embeds itself in the
text: deck. Across the room the golf cart bounces on its tires.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FUSION REACTOR
text: The orb of fire withdraws its blazing tentacles and dwindles
dialog: to its proper size.
dialog: 120.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CORE COMPUTER ROOM
text: Jim and Aurora lie on the deck, breathing hard. Aurora starts
text: to laugh.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: We're alive!
text: The engines rumble back to life.
text: A distant, rhythmic sound begins: BOOM-CHAK...BOOM-CHAK...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK TWO - PROMENADE
text: Jim and Aurora walk wearily.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We have to replace the other burned-
dialog: out computers. But we have time.
text: Aurora slides her arm around his waist.
scene_heading: BOOM-CHAK...BOOM-CHAK...
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: What is that sound?
text: Aurora stiffens, looking over his shoulder. Outside the
text: window, a hibernation pod spins into view. A woman inside.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: (finding her voice)
dialog: Jim!
text: He turns. Stares in shock as more pods drift past the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIBERNATION BAY
text: Jim and Aurora sprint into the facility. The sound is loud
scene_heading: here: BOOM-CHAK...BOOM-CHAK...
text: It's the sound of hibernation pods being ejected. The wave of
text: ejections marches down an aisle: one pod after another
text: disappearing into the ceiling.
text: Jim rushes to a CONSOLE. Scans the display.
speaker_heading: JIM
text: The hibernation system rebooted. It
dialog: thinks the ship's in port. It's
text: ejecting the empty pods.
dialog: 121.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURORA
speaker_heading: (HORRIFIED)
text: They're not empty.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR
text: The ship leaves a trail of glowing hibernation pods.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HIBERNATION BAY
text: Jim slides to a halt in front of a hibernation pod. Pulls a
text: power driver from his belt and removes the cover panel.
text: Aurora arrives on his heels. Watches as he works.
text: An ominous sound approaches. BOOM-CHAK...BOOM-CHAK... The
text: wave of ejections advances down their row.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Hurry.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I see it.
text: He's not fast enough. The pod slides up and out of sight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR
text: The pods Jim was working on tumbles out into space.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CREW HIBERNATION FACILITY
text: Jim slams into the facility at a dead run. Scans the crew
text: hibernation pods. Picks one and goes to work.
text: Aurora enters. Looks at the man inside the hibernation pod: a
text: stern fellow with a bristling gray beard.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: The Captain.
text: The sounds of the ejection wave come closer. Boom-chak.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You don't have much time.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I know.
dialog: 122.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BOOM-CHAK! A crewman's pod vanishes into the ceiling on the
text: opposite side. The ejections march down the row.
speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: Go go go!
text: The wave of ejections reaches the end of the facility and
text: marches back on Jim's side.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Got it!
text: The hibernation pod hums to life.
text: Inside, the Captain opens his eyes. He stares in astonishment
text: at the first thing he sees: Aurora, in her bathing suit and
text: shirt, a disheveled angel.
scene_heading: BOOM-CHAK!
text: The pod beside the Captain's shoots out of sight. He sees it.
text: Looks at Aurora in alarm. Reaches out, his hand spread flat
text: on the glass.
text: She reaches back, her hand matching his.
text: The Captain's pod rises through the ceiling and vanishes. Jim
text: roars in frustration. Aurora leaps back with a cry of horror.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DECK NINE - AFT OBSERVATION DECK
text: Jim and Aurora stare out the windows. In the ship's wake,
text: five thousand pods glitter like diamonds. The cloud of pods
text: dispersing as they watch.
text: Stricken, Aurora walks away.
text: Jim watches her go, then turns back to the window, looking
text: out at the tumbling sparks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR

speaker_heading: AURORA
dialog: You know, if it wasn't for you waking

speaker_heading: AURORA (CONT'D)
dialog: But no matter how we got here, the
dialog: fact is that we're here. All I know
dialog: is, when I have a good idea, you're
dialog: the person I want to tell. When I
dialog: wake up in the morning, I wish you
dialog: were there. When I look at you, I
dialog: just see Jim. And I miss him.

scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD II - CAPITAL LANDING FIELD - DAWN
text: An orange sun rises over green hills. In the foreground the
text: roofs of Homestead II's capital city glow in the dawn.
text: At the city's edge, timeworn spacecraft sit on their landing
text: gear around a grassy landing field.
text: Colonists gather. They watch the sky expectantly...
text: A new star shines on the horizon.
text: The star grows into a white starship gleaming in the sun. The
text: Excelsior sweeps over the field with a rumble of engines.
text: The ship's hull is scorched and abraded from its cosmic
text: crossing. But the lights shine, the engines throb, the
text: landing gear receive the weight of the ship.
text: The starship's gangway lowers. The doors open.
text: CHILDREN run down the gangway. Children of all ages, of all
text: races. Twenty of them, thirty. They point at the sun, at the
text: clouds, laughing, wide-eyed in wonder.
text: We move up the gangway, through the disembarking passengers.
text: Behind the children: Teenagers. Adults in smaller numbers as
text: they grow older. Finally a handful of gray-haired elders.

scene_heading: INT. STARSHIP EXCELSIOR - GRAND CONCOURSE
text: Transformed by the wear and tear of a century's habitation.
text: Paths worn into floors, furniture repaired or re-purposed.
text: We move past vegetable gardens. Battered sweeper robots water
text: the plantings. Window-washers till the soil.
text: The OAK TREE towers a hundred feet tall over the Concourse.
text: Its branches brush the skylight far above.
text: We move past walls decorated with murals and carvings.
text: At the Concourse Bar, Arthur is slicing vegetables. His
text: timeworn uniform mended by hand.
text: At the aft end of the Concourse, a high wall. Here a long
text: list of dates is inscribed. The last date is the ship's
text: landfall on Homestead II; the first, Jim's awakening. In
dialog: between: an accelerating tally of births, deaths, marriages,
dialog: catastrophes and achievements...a century of shipboard life.
text: At the base of the wall we find a table like an altar, where
text: a collection of artifacts is displayed:
text: The meteor pried from the Excelsior's heart.
text: Gus's worn shipcard, his picture still visible.
text: A beautiful hand-bound book. In the Blink of an Eye: Our
dialog: Lives Between the Stars, by Aurora Dunn. Beneath these
text: printed words, a handwritten dedication: For Jim.
text: In the center of it all, in the place of honor: the photo
text: strip of Jim and Aurora from their first date.
text: They laugh. They clown. She kisses him.
text: Aurora looks into the camera's eye.
text: Jim looks at Aurora.
