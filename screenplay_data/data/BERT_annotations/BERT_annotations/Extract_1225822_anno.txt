text: 
text: BEGIN CREDITS:
scene_heading: EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY
text: An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in
text: front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
text: flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We
text: see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a
dialog: company of about 50 - 75 employees.
scene_heading: INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY
text: We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
text: production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge
dialog: vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
dialog: products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a
text: high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
text: windows overlooking this manufacturing area.
text: We PAN up to the main office.
text: INSIDE THE OFFICE
text: JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the
dialog: phone with his friend DEAN.
speaker_heading: DEAN (v.o.)
dialog: You should come by tonight. Half
dialog: price well drinks while the game's
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You always give me free drinks
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: DEAN (v.o.)
dialog: Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah?... Might as well. No action
dialog: going on at my house, that's for
dialog: sure.
speaker_heading: DEAN (v.o.)
dialog: Really? The wife out of town?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No... I just haven't been laid in
dialog: a month.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: DEAN (v.o.)
dialog: You guys having problems or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. This is pretty much normal
dialog: these days...
text: As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the
text: manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down
dialog: through various stages of assembly line production, then
text: follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
text: HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
text: camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,
text: beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
text: mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he
dialog: says sound as macho and important as possible.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: You get this job through Manpower?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: I started here with Manpower too.
dialog: Started out on the line just like
dialog: you.
dialog: (DEAD-SERIOUS)
dialog: Only I did better... 40 crates a
dialog: day.
text: Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.
text: STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
text: polite reaction would be one of total amazement.
speaker_heading: STEP (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm the best sorter in here.
dialog: That's why they made me full time
dialog: with benefits. I'll probably be
dialog: floor manager this year.
text: A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with
text: too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,
dialog: lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of
text: pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
dialog: to be out of style by now.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 3.
text: Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He
text: flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
dialog: application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping
text: each box when he's done, generally making the activity look
text: like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step
text: and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: (hands them each a flier)
dialog: My band's playing this Friday, come
dialog: check us out.
text: Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties
text: clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, "God's
text: Cock". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much
text: English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the
dialog: flier.
text: AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,
text: sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
text: wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,
text: and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-
text: shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always
text: shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a
text: clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her
text: head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her
text: forties.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You see that... That new guy.
text: He's holding us up. It's not my
dialog: job to tell them to hold the line
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLA
dialog: And then Joel's gonna come yell at
dialog: us, cuz he's not doing his job.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (folds her arms, fed up)
dialog: I'm just gonna sit here.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLA
dialog: You're not gonna shut it off?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm not gonna hold the line. If
dialog: they're not gonna do their job, why
dialog: should I do mine.
text: Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause
dialog: the conveyor belt.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Joel is still on the phone with Dean.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: If I don't get home before about
text: 8:00, she puts on the sweatpants
dialog: and once the sweatpants are on,
text: it's over -- I get nothing.
dialog: (notices something down
dialog: BELOW)
dialog: Shit. I'm gonna have to call you
dialog: back.
text: Joel hangs up and runs downstairs.
text: ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR:
text: Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line.
text: Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What are YOU doing?!
dialog: (pointing at Hector)
dialog: What is he doing?
text: A YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory
text: and Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: All right. Now, what's the
dialog: problem?
text: They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay! Okay, everyone settle down.
dialog: Now Mary. Hector here is new okay?
dialog: It's gonna take him a couple of
dialog: days, maybe his English isn't so
dialog: good. You gotta be patient.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: That's what I was tryin' to say.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: And Step, if you wanna be Floor
dialog: Manager, this is the kind of thing
dialog: you're going to have to deal with.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: (KISS-ASS)
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's
dialog: get this cleaned up, and get
dialog: rolling again. We can't afford to
dialog: fall behind today.
text: Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts
dialog: right back up with Gabriella.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You see that? We always get the
dialog: blame.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production
text: floor, shaking his head. BRIAN, Joel's second in command,
text: walks in. He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed
text: beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut. He wears a
text: Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants. He walks over
text: to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Jesus... They're like a bunch of
dialog: goddamned children.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Tell me about it. Sorry I missed
dialog: the drama; I was showing boy-genius
dialog: down there how to back up a
dialog: forklift.
text: ANGLE ON Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as
text: he passes someone.
speaker_heading: BRIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's his whole career, driving
dialog: that damn forklift. You'd think
dialog: he'd wanna learn how.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, I guess he's got that band
dialog: he's in too...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (disgust at the word
dialog: "BAND")
dialog: "Band", ugh...
dialog: (MORE)
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: BRIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll bet dollars to donuts he sucks
dialog: at that too. Then you got ah...
dialog: (tries to remember her
dialog: name but can't)
dialog: Dinkus down there...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Who, Mary?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No, the other one -- what's-her-
dialog: face -- she asked me -- or rather
dialog: "axed" me -- for more personal
dialog: days. Just like that. I told her
dialog: maybe if she figures out how to
dialog: fill out the time sheets correctly
dialog: I'll give her more personal days...
dialog: (Off Joel's look)
dialog: Don't worry, she will never fill
dialog: out her time sheets correctly.
text: Joel looks down at the production floor. Joel's POV:
text: ANGLE ON: Mary and Step bickering. Step walks off. Mary and
text: Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of
dialog: old hens.
speaker_heading: JOEL (O.S.)
dialog: Look at 'em... I am so sick of baby
dialog: sitting these assholes.
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: I better get going...
text: Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about
dialog: "sweatpants."
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Joel drives home, in a hurry, checking his dashboard clock.
text: It's an upscale neighborhood of McMansions in a town like
text: Lincoln Nebraska. He turns a corner, slows down suddenly
text: when he sees something.
speaker_heading: JOEL'S POV:
text: NATHAN, a middle-aged, overweight, annoying guy is going out
text: to the street to get his mail.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (to himself, praying)
dialog: Please go back inside... Please
dialog: just turn around.. .Come on...don't
dialog: notice me...
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 7.
text: It's too late. Nathan turns, sees Joel's car and waves, then
text: crosses the street to Joel's driveway and waits to talk to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Shit!
text: Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down. Joel
text: begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan
dialog: can talk to him.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya...
text: Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while,
text: leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car,
dialog: trapping Joel.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: How've ya been? I left you a
dialog: message last week. I don't know if
dialog: you got it or not.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of
dialog: in a hurry here.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh yeah? You been busy?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, in fact...
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: I should go right now actually. I
dialog: gotta call the office before they
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well, real quick while I got ya
dialog: here -- what're you guys doing
dialog: November 17th?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Ah, I don't ah...
dialog: (realizes his should fake
dialog: IT)
dialog: Actually we're going to be out of
dialog: town that weekend.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh yeah? Where you going?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Ah...
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh, wait a minute -- I'm sorry, I
dialog: meant the 7th. Yeah, November 7th.
dialog: You'll be in town then right?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (DEFEATED)
dialog: Ah...Yeah.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Great. There's this dinner Leslie
dialog: and I are going to. It's an annual
dialog: thing -- we do it every year with
dialog: the Rotary Club -- it's for
dialog: charity. It's just a whole lot of
dialog: fun, and we wanted to invite you
dialog: and Suzie to be our guests at our
text: table. It's--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm sorry, I ah... I just don't
dialog: think that's something we're gonna
dialog: want to do.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Really? Why not? It's a lot of
dialog: fun.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, I don't know. Suzie doesn't
dialog: really like going to stuff like
dialog: THAT--
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, we wouldn't know anybody
dialog: there. She get's kind of
text: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh no -- It's not like that. She
dialog: won't be uncomfortable. I
dialog: guarantee it. No, it's not like
dialog: that at all. It's not formal or
dialog: anything. Trust me. It's just a
dialog: real loose bunch.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I just don't...
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I tell you what. Why don't we do
dialog: this -- I'll go ahead and get
dialog: tickets, since they're gonna sell
dialog: out fast. You talk to Suzie. See
dialog: what she says. Like I say, she
dialog: won't be uncomfortable at all.
dialog: Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a
dialog: call -- you know how it is when the
dialog: wives talk, heh heh--
text: Joel is about to snap.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Um, why don't we talk about this
dialog: later.
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: I gotta make this call before they
dialog: leave.
text: Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan to raise off the window sill.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (CALLING BACK)
dialog: Sorry... I just gotta make this
dialog: call!
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Joel pulls the car in, steps out and is shocked to see Nathan
dialog: right there in his garage.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Sorry, I almost forgot -- the
dialog: tickets are forty dollars a plate.
dialog: I know that's a little steep, but
dialog: the food is fantastic and it's for
dialog: a good cause. So that'd be eighty
dialog: dollars total. There's no tax or
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get
dialog: inside and make this call. Let's
dialog: talk about this another time.
text: Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door,
text: waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh, and if you need us to look out
dialog: for the house or anything when you
dialog: go out of town --
text: Joel's finger still on the garage door button.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well, just let us know. Where you
dialog: guys going anyway?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (BULLSHITTING)
dialog: Ah, just sort of a vacation. Look,
dialog: I gotta run.
text: Joel hits the button and the door starts going down.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Alright then. We'll see ya.
text: Nathan finally steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a huge
dialog: sigh of relief. Then,
text: ANGLE ON THE GARAGE DOOR:
text: As it gets halfway down, we see Nathan's legs, heading back
text: towards the door. Nathan leans down into frame as the door
text: goes down.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh, Joel one more thing--
text: Joel lets the door shut on him, and bolts into the house.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Joel walks into the living room just as his wife, SUZIE,
text: enters from the bedroom pulling on her SWEATPANTS. A look of
text: disappointment on Joel's face. Suzie is a decent looking
text: woman, about Joel's age.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Man, that Nathan won't shut up.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Yeah, what an asshole. I don't
dialog: even go into the front yard
dialog: anymore. That wife of his is even
dialog: worse.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 11.
text: Suzie plops down on the couch looking tired and pissed off.
text: Joel sits down next to her.
speaker_heading: SUZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: We gotta get a new pool cleaner.I
dialog: don't think that asshole checked
dialog: the chlorine levels again like I
dialog: asked him too...
text: Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder. She
text: doesn't seem to notice as he starts getting fresh.
speaker_heading: SUZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: .and every time he is here, he
dialog: goes on and on about some problem
dialog: with the goddamn filter, and I have
text: no idea what he's talking about...
text: Delayed reaction -- she notices Joel is getting frisky. He
text: gets closer, starts kissing her neck.
speaker_heading: SUZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (UNCOMFORTABLE)
dialog: Ah,...Joel?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: I'm sorry. It's just... I'm a
dialog: little tired, and, I don't know,
dialog: it's the middle of the week...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's not the middle of the week.
dialog: It's Monday. Why can't--
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Monday?
dialog: (Freezes, suddenly
dialog: REALIZING SOMETHING)
dialog: Oh shit!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (WORRIED)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Idol!
text: Suzie jumps up with newfound energy, runs for the remote and
text: turns on the TV. Joel just sits there.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 12.
text: Suzie plops down in a Barcalounger.
speaker_heading: SUZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry honey. Maybe this weekend.
text: Joel leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BATHROOM -- LATER
dialog: [Quick scene of Joel trying to masturbate (off screen of
text: course), but he's too distracted by the sounds of a bad out-
text: of-tune Idol audition blaring through the wall.]
scene_heading: EXT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT
text: Establishing shot. A sports bar that's part of a Holiday
dialog: Inn.
scene_heading: INT. SCOREBOARDS -- CONTINUOUS
text: Joel sits at the bar. DEAN, the owner of the bar, late
text: forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar on
text: a stool.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I gotta get a house with a bathroom
dialog: that's doesn't share a wall with
text: the TV.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Why don't you do that in another
dialog: bathroom. You've got three of 'em.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It would look suspicious. We never
dialog: use those other bathrooms... Maybe
dialog: if I had some insulation put in...
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Insulation?... All I know is, you
dialog: shouldn't move man; you've got a
dialog: nice house. I mean you've got the
dialog: American dream really -- you own
dialog: your own company. I can't believe
dialog: you used to bar back for me here,
dialog: and now you've got all that.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: But what do I have really? It's a
dialog: big pain in the ass.
dialog: (MORE)
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm always working; can't stop or
dialog: the whole place will fall apart.
dialog: And what good does it do me anyway?
dialog: I don't get laid. That stock guy
dialog: with the shitty band that works for
dialog: me probably gets laid more than I
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (trying to help)
dialog: Yeah, but he probably lives in a
dialog: crappy apartment.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hell, I'd move into a crappy
dialog: apartment if the bathroom wasn't
text: right next to the TV.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY
text: CINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter
text: looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of
text: the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's
dialog: beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something
text: vulnerable and sweet about her as well.
text: Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired,
text: goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much
text: attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women
text: this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each
dialog: other trying to help her.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #1
dialog: Yeah, it's expensive but it's
dialog: sweet... Are you familiar with the
dialog: Gibson humbucking pickups?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: No, sorry. I don't play. It's for
dialog: my Dad actually -- for his
dialog: fiftieth birthday. My sisters and
dialog: I are all pitching in.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #2
dialog: Ah, that's nice... Your Dad would
dialog: love these humbuckings. They
dialog: really kick ass.
text: An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy,
text: trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible.
text: He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MALE CUSTOMER
dialog: Excuse me... I just have a quick
dialog: question...
text: Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #2
dialog: (OBLIVIOUS)
dialog: So, what kind of music did he play?
text: Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer
text: finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I think he played like, jazz or
dialog: something. I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #2
dialog: Well this is an excellent jazz
dialog: guitar. It's what Pat Metheny
dialog: plays.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #1
dialog: Is your Dad into Metheny at all?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh, I don't know who that is.
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #2
dialog: He's like, a totally kickass fusion
dialog: guitarist. Are you into fusion?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I don't really know much about
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #2
dialog: I play fusion guitar so... Just
text: curious.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Um, do they come in any other
dialog: colors?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #1
dialog: You mean different finishes?
dialog: There's a sunburst finish we might
dialog: have in stock.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #2
dialog: Yeah, do you wanna see it? I'll go
dialog: get it.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #1
dialog: Or I could go. Whatever.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #1/SALESMAN #2
dialog: Oh totally./ No prob!/ I'll show
dialog: you the case it comes with too.
text: The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the
text: back to find the other guitar.
text: Cindy stands there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then
text: casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks
text: out the front door with it.
scene_heading: EXT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Cindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts
text: the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish
text: guitar and the other with the hard-shell case. They look
text: around, notice she's gone. They stand there for a beat,
text: disappointed, before they realize what just happened.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #1
dialog: Oh shit!...
dialog: (FRANTICALLY LOOKING
dialog: AROUND)
dialog: THE GIBSON!
text: They run out the front door, but Cindy is long gone.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in, excited.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're not gonna believe this.
dialog: Remember the guy from General Mills
dialog: that called a while back? Talking
dialog: like he wanted to buy us out?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I thought you said he wasn't
dialog: serious; he was just sniffing
text: around.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, well he's serious now. He
dialog: just made an offer -- I mean a real
dialog: offer this time.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No. It must be part of some bigger
dialog: strategic move, because it's over
dialog: market value I think.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Wow...
text: Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking
text: down on the production floor.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I could unload all this... I could
dialog: probably retire...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I mean, yeah, there's a lot of
dialog: details to work out, but this could
dialog: be great. They'll be calling back
dialog: next week, what should I tell them?
text: Joel looks down, sees Mary sitting with her arms folded,
text: shaking her head.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Tell 'em hell yes.
scene_heading: INT. MANUFACTURING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Mary sits with her arms folded, refusing to hold the line.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I already warned him. This is the
dialog: last time. I'm just gonna sit
dialog: here.
text: In SLOW MOTION, we see:
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 17.
text: - The first box falls off the end of the assembly line,
text: bottles shatter.
text: - Rory, carrying some boxes slips on the broken bottles of
text: goopey extract, falls and slides into an aisle.
text: - A forklift stops suddenly to avoid hitting Rory, causing a
text: huge stack of pallets to fall off.
text: - Quick shot of Mary shaking her head in slow-motion.
text: - Just as Step rounds a corner to see what's going on, the
text: pallets land on a bunch of pipes and high-pressure valves
text: which burst open sending a piece of shrapnel flying across
text: the room heading straight for
text: - STEP'S CROTCH. The shrapnel heads straight for his

text: Step is on a stretcher being loaded into a MEDIVAC helicopter
text: by a couple of EMS guys. Step moans in pain as Joel tries to
text: comfort him. A small crowd of employees watch.
text: ANGLE ON Mary in the crowd, shaking her head.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I knew it. That's what happens
dialog: when you don't pay attention.
scene_heading: INT. SCOREBOARDS -- LATER
text: Joel sits at the bar, on a cell phone. Dean sits behind the
text: bar on a stool.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (to the person on the
dialog: PHONE)
dialog: Uh-huh... Alright. Let me know if
dialog: you hear anything else.
text: He hangs up, talks to Dean.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, he's definitely lost one of
dialog: 'em. They think they might be able
dialog: to re-attach the other one, but
dialog: they're not sure.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Wow...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah... I'm not sure how it
dialog: happened, but we have a great
dialog: safety record and we comply with
dialog: all the safety codes so... it was
dialog: just a freak accident. There'll be
dialog: an investigation of some kind I'm
dialog: sure.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well, you have insurance for that
dialog: kind of thing, right?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh yeah. Of course. In fact,
dialog: he'll probably get a huge
dialog: settlement.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah. I would think so. I mean,
dialog: it's your balls...
text: Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Boy it really makes you stop and
dialog: think about how fragile we are --
dialog: especially our balls. They're just
dialog: hanging there in a little sack
dialog: between our legs. At any moment
dialog: they could be cut off forever.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah. And your balls are really
dialog: important man. Your balls are
dialog: everything. What kind of life would
dialog: you have with no testicles? Can you
dialog: imagine that shit?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You know Dean, my life wouldn't be
dialog: much different than it is now
dialog: actually.
dialog: (MORE)
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Except for once every three months
dialog: when I have sex with my wife. In
dialog: fact, I might even be better off...
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Wait. Three months? I thought you
dialog: said it was once a month.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I did? I must've been lying. I
dialog: don't know... Maybe things'll get
dialog: better when I sell the company.
dialog: I'll be around more...
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well, I hope so. That would
dialog: suck... I get laid all the time.
dialog: (off Joel's reaction)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Ah, it's all right...
dialog: (THINKS)
dialog: Actually, it sucks.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah, sexual frustration is bad
dialog: news... You know what you oughtta
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Get some Xanax.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah it is, but I find it's good
dialog: for just about any phsychological
dialog: problem. I mean, basically it just
dialog: makes you feel good, so it sort of
dialog: works for anything. I even take it
dialog: when I have a cold. It's probably
dialog: great for sexual frustration. Want
dialog: me to get you some?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You know what else is good?
dialog: Codeine cough syrup.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It's just good.
text: Joel looks at Dean for a beat.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you on something now?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: No... Well, I guess I took some
dialog: Vicodin this morning. But that was
dialog: just 'cause I was hung-over.
scene_heading: EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY
text: Establishing shot, a pawn shop in a strip mall. Cindy's car
text: parked out in front.
scene_heading: INT. PAWN SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Cindy is at the counter, the Gibson guitar we saw earlier is
text: in front of her. A PAWN SHOP GUY is counting out money. He
text: pauses, looks around, then speaks sympathetically to her.
speaker_heading: PAWN SHOP GUY
dialog: Um, you know, I'm really not
dialog: supposed to say this... but since
dialog: this belonged to your father, and
dialog: since he passed away and all...
dialog: (QUIETLY)
dialog: You could probably get a better
dialog: deal at a music store.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh, that's okay. Thanks. But I
dialog: just kind of wanna get it over
dialog: with, you know? It's kind of hard
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: PAWN SHOP GUY
dialog: I understand.
text: He looks around to see if his boss is watching, then counts
text: off a FEW MORE TWENTIES, feeling sorry for her.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: PAWN SHOP GUY (cont'd)
dialog: Here.
scene_heading: INT. CINDY'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Cindy puts the money in her wallet, along with a driver's
dialog: license.
text: CLOSE ON THE WALLET.
text: Cindy shuffles through three or four different driver's
text: licenses. On one, her name says MISTY PATTERSON. It's a
dialog: Kansas license. She takes another one out from Colorado,
text: with the name CINDY METZLER on it and puts that in front,
text: then puts the wallet away.
text: A newspaper sits on the front seat. Something grabs her
text: attention.
text: ANGLE ON THE NEWSPAPER:
text: We see an article about Step's accident. There's a picture
text: of Step being taken away on the stretcher.
text: Cindy starts reading the article, with growing interest.
scene_heading: CINDY'S POV:
text: She scans the article, zeroing in on certain words,
dialog: ".. .potentially big settlement..." "...no testicles..."
dialog: "several million dollars" then back to "no testicles" then
dialog: quickly back and forth several times -- "million dollars" "no
dialog: testicles" "million dollars" "no testicles"
text: ON CINDY'S FACE - A look of determination. She looks one
text: more time at the name under the picture -- Don "Step"
text: Wilkenson, then zeroes in on the words "Reynold's Extract."
text: She starts the car and speeds away.
scene_heading: INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Joel sits with Brian. Brian has a clipboard, going over the
dialog: day's business.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: So obviously Step's not coming back
dialog: anytime soon. I had to hire a
dialog: couple temps. Is that okay?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, sure. How is Step?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Better. They say he's going home
dialog: in a couple of days. Speaking of
dialog: which, the guys at General Mills
dialog: heard about this whole Step thing.
dialog: They're worried. If Step decides
dialog: to sue us -- beyond the insurance
dialog: settlement -- it could be a serious
dialog: liability. They don't want to make
dialog: an offer until this thing has
dialog: settled.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Really? They think it's that big
dialog: of a liability?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well yeah. Don't you? I mean,
dialog: think about it. Imagine if you
dialog: asked a bunch of jurors how much
dialog: you'd have to pay 'em to cut their
dialog: balls off? I mean, I wouldn't let
dialog: someone cut my balls off for a
dialog: billion dollars. Seriously --
dialog: unless there were some kind of
dialog: really expensive operation that
dialog: could give you artificial balls or
dialog: something. Would you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, I guess not.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Anyway, I wouldn't worry. He says
dialog: he's not going to sue us. Says he
dialog: (CRUDE IMITATION)
dialog: "don't want somethin' fer nothin "'
dialog: and "What's right is right." If we
dialog: can just get him to sign something
dialog: to that effect we should be fine.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Boy, Step sure is being mellow
dialog: about all this.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, well I think when you lose
dialog: your balls it mellows you out. You
dialog: don't get as pissed off and
dialog: aggressive about things. I know
dialog: it's true for horses, and bulls.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Boy, it sure does make you think..
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh, by the way, guess who asked for
dialog: a raise today?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
speaker_heading: (GESTURES INDISCRIMINATELY
dialog: to someone downstairs)
dialog: Dinkus. Can you believe that?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Brian, you call everyone here
dialog: "Dinkus." I don't know who you're
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You know, Forklift-Dinkus?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh... I thought you call him "boy-
dialog: genius."
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, well boy-genius asked for a
dialog: raise. I said, "are you kidding?
dialog: You nearly got someone killed last
dialog: week," and then he blamed it on
dialog: Dinkus over there.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You know Brian, you really ought to
dialog: learn the employees' names.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, I was thinking about that,
dialog: but hey, if this deal goes through
dialog: next week, I won't have to. It's
dialog: not like I'm gonna be inviting
dialog: Dinkus and Boy-Genius over for
dialog: dinner.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY
text: Joel stands on one side of his office looking down through a
text: long window overlooking the manufacturing area. Dean comes
text: in, walks over to the window, looks down at the production
dialog: floor with Joel.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hey man. What's goin' o-- Whoa!
text: DEAN'S POV: It's CINDY, now working down on the floor, on
text: the assembley line.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn! Who's she? Is she new?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah. She's a temp.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: She's a tramp?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No a temp. Quit staring.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Damn, she's hot! Way to go.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hey, I didn't hire her. She came
dialog: here through Manpower, like
dialog: everybody else. They just sent her
text: over.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give
dialog: them a call. You don't usually
dialog: have girls anywhere near that hot
dialog: working here. What's the deal?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I know. I guess it makes
dialog: sense though if you think about it.
dialog: Hot girls need a job just as much
dialog: as anyone else.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (thinks for a second)
dialog: Do they really?... Huh... You just
dialog: don't see 'em here. Usually your
dialog: temps look like winos. And they're
dialog: guys.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You wanna hear something really
dialog: weird?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: She came on to me.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: No way! Really?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I
dialog: could be wrong, but...
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hey, I'm sure she did. Are you
dialog: kidding? You could have any girl
dialog: down there.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know about that.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I'm serious. Dude, you're the big
dialog: shot here. You're the king of...
dialog: What do you call that shit you make
dialog: here again?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Extract. And spray-dried
dialog: flavoring, and we're branching out
text: INTO--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah, you're the Extract King man.
dialog: You could have any girl here. I
dialog: mean, I wouldn't want most of 'em,
dialog: but her... Way to go Joel.
text: Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: So how did she come on to you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, first she started asking me
dialog: about what happened to Step and all
dialog: that stuff -- you know, just sort
dialog: of making conversation?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: But it really seemed like she was
dialog: flirting with me, you know?
dialog: (MORE)
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Then, she just sort of asked me
dialog: out... I think.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Really? How?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, you see that guy down there
dialog: by the fork lift?
text: ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
text: His band is playing somewhere, at
dialog: some party this weekend, and she
dialog: asked me if I wanted to go with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Wow. So, you gonna do anything
dialog: about it?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What? No. No way. I couldn't
dialog: live with myself if I cheated on
dialog: Suzie... It'd be nice if I got
dialog: laid at home once in a while
dialog: though...
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (still staring at her)
dialog: Man, she is fine. You mind if I
dialog: hit that then?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I do sort of...
text: We see a COMMOTION down on the floor. Mary runs out of the

scene_heading: INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT / MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: ACTION
text: Mary runs over to where Hector is working, hysterical.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: My purse is stolen! It's gone!

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Now hold on--
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I won't hold on! I'll call the
dialog: cops!
speaker_heading: HECTOR

dialog: What? I don'... No comprende...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (HORRIBLE SPANISH)
dialog: Espera un momento Hector. Tu sabes
dialog: donde esta su... uh, purse?
text: ANGLE ON CINDY, watching the whole thing-- completely

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Now wait a second. Calm down Mary.
dialog: How do you know it was stolen?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's gone! That's how.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, what did it look like.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It was black with a fur, leopard
text: style border...
dialog: As Mary describes the purse, we
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CINDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON
text: Cindy sits in her parked car, going through the purse Mary
text: just described. She takes some cash, puts it in her pocket,
text: then finds what she's looking for -- the address book.
text: ANGLE ON ADDRESS BOOK.
text: Cindy turns to the Ws and finds Step Wilkenson. She notes
text: his address. She starts the car and takes off.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STEP'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Cindy sits and waits, listening to the radio. It's a very
text: blue-collar neighborhood. She's about three houses away from
text: Step's house, keeping an eye on it.
text: After a beat, Step limps out of the house, walks over to his
text: pickup truck, painfully gets in, and leaves. Cindy starts
text: the car and follows from a distance.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Step wheels his shopping cart into one of the checkout lines.
text: He uses the cart as a crutch to help him walk. Cindy gets in
text: line behind him. She only has one item, a bottle of
text: Reynold's Orange Extract. Step notices her.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: You can go ahead of me if that's
dialog: all you have.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (SWEETLY)
dialog: Thank you so much.
dialog: (holds up extract bottle)
dialog: I can't believe I'm buying this
dialog: stuff -- I work at the factory.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Really? I work there too. Or, ah,
dialog: I used to.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Really? You're kidding! I just
dialog: started there. What's your name?
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: I go by Step. Yeah, I'm the

dialog: As Cindy and Step get to know each other we
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Joel enters the living room. He first sees the sweatpants,

text: turns and leaves.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text:

scene_heading: INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT
text: Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean. Joel is drinking some
dialog: kind of hard liquor, getting a buzz.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm sick of it Dean. I'm sick of
dialog: being turned down in my own house
dialog: by my own wife. We're turning into
dialog: one of those brother-sister
dialog: couples.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Huh...Now that you mention it, you
dialog: guys kind of look alike too.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (GROSSED OUT)
dialog: No we don't!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (takes a drink)
dialog: Maybe things will be better after I
dialog: sell the company... Or maybe it's
dialog: just going to mean more time to sit
dialog: around and contemplate not getting
dialog: laid.
text: Dean nods sympathetically.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What about that girl at work? She
dialog: still into you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah... she was really coming on to
dialog: me. She gave me her phone number
dialog: and everything. Told me to call
dialog: her if I wanted to go to that
dialog: party. Can you believe that? And
dialog: there's nothing I can do about it,
dialog: but just be sexually frustrated.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I've got some Xanax if you want it.
dialog: Like I say, that always works for
dialog: me.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No thanks...
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well maybe you should call that
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, I can't. I can't cheat on
dialog: Suzie. I just gotta power through
dialog: it until I'm so old that I can't
dialog: get it up anymore.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What about if Suzie cheated on you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hmm... I hadn't even thought of
dialog: that...
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: I wish she would.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You wish she would cheat on you?
dialog: Wouldn't that bother you?
text: Joel thinks about it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. I don't think it would
dialog: actually.
dialog: (occuring to him)
dialog: I guess that's weird huh?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah, it's a little weird. Sort
dialog: of.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: But see, then I could do something
dialog: about all this sexual frustration,
dialog: without feeling guilty about it.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Do you think she would cheat on
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Nah...
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You sure?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (CONSIDERS IT)
dialog: Well, I don't know. Hmm... Maybe
dialog: if she were really tempted she
dialog: would. Like if some really studly
dialog: guy came on to her.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: So you're saying she would probably
dialog: cheat on you if she was put in
dialog: temptation's way?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, maybe.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You know what you oughtta do?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (WEARY)
dialog: I don't wanna do any drugs Dean.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: No, no. Check this out -- If you
dialog: really wish your wife would cheat
dialog: on you, it's not that hard to make
dialog: it happen.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hire a gigolo to have an affair
dialog: with your wife.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I'm serious. I know a guy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: You know a gigolo?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: How do you know a gigolo?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: This guy Brad. He comes in here
dialog: all the time. He's a friend of
dialog: Vic's. You could hire him to have
dialog: an affair with Suzie.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Come on Dean.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Why not? You said you wouldn't
dialog: care if she cheated on you. Then
dialog: you'd be free to go out with that
dialog: Cindy chick and get your ya-yas out
dialog: -- with no guilt. Problem solved.
dialog: (proud of himself)
dialog: Man, what a great idea.
text: Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You know, maybe I will try some of
dialog: that Xanax.
text: Dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a
text: little box and pulls out a pill.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE -- SAME TIME
text: Step's truck is parked out at a lake in the country. He and
text: Cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate, looking at the
dialog: stars, talking.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: I just believe that what's
dialog: right is right.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: That's right Step, and what's right
dialog: is for you to send a message.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: A message?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You need to send a message so that
dialog: a horrible accident like this never
dialog: happens to anyone else ever again.
dialog: That's what's right. And the way
dialog: you do that is to take them to
dialog: court.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Yes Step... That's why I called a
dialog: lawyer for you -- that guy on all
text: the bus stop benches.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Joe Adler?
dialog: (TOUCHED)
dialog: You did that for me?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Mmm hmm... I just want you to do
dialog: what's right Step.
text: They start cuddling, kissing. Cindy pulls away.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I'm sorry Step, your doctor said
dialog: you shouldn't get aroused.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: No he didn't.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Maybe it was your lawyer, but he
dialog: talked to your doctor. And your
dialog: doctor said it's very important not
dialog: to get aroused until after the
dialog: trial... I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: That's okay... You're so good to me
dialog: Cindy.
text: They start cuddling again.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Look Step, you're getting me turned
dialog: on, I'm getting you turned on... I
dialog: better just go.
scene_heading: INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- LATER
text: Joel is starting to look really tweaked as the drug-alcohol
text: combination begins to kick in.
text: Dean is examining a pill under the cash register light,
text: trying to read the small print. He looks concerned.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Shit... Do you remember what color
dialog: that pill I gave you was?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Damn. I don't think it was Xanax.
dialog: I think that might've been
dialog: Ritalin... Or "Special K."
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (feeling the buzz)
dialog: Ah, who cares?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It's just that, ah, Special K is a
dialog: horse tranquilizer, kinda has a
dialog: weird effect when people take it
dialog: but... well, don't worry about
dialog: it... You might not want to drink
dialog: too much more though.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (beginning to slur his
dialog: SPEECH)
dialog: You know that thing you were
dialog: talking about? About the gigolo?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Do you think it would be wrong to
dialog: do that? I mean morally wrong?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (with full authority)
dialog: Oh nooo. Definitely not. What
dialog: could be morally wrong about it?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Look, if she doesn't want to go for
dialog: it, she doesn't have to. And if
dialog: she does, then she's the one who
dialog: sinned, and then it's perfectly
dialog: morally right for you to go out and
dialog: boff whoever you want.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (SLURRED SPEECH)
dialog: Yeah, I guess you're right. I

dialog: wrong about it either.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: And this guy, he's a friend of
dialog: yours? What's his name?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Brad. You want me to give him a
dialog: call?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know. It's kinda weird
dialog: even talking about it.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Look, this is no big deal Joel.
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah. I mean, you can't lose. Just
dialog: say you're hiring him to come clean
dialog: the pool or something. See what
dialog: happens. If she doesn't go for it,
dialog: then at least you know you're doing
dialog: the right thing by being faithful.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I guess you're right... I
dialog: don't know. It's crazy.
text: Dean pours Joel another drink.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Look. Have another drink. Think
dialog: about it... You know what? Why
dialog: don't I just call Brad and see what
dialog: he has to say?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Alright. What the hell.
text: Joel takes a big swig of liquor.

scene_heading: INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR - BACK OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Dean and Joel are talking with BRAD, the gigolo. He's young,
text: blonde, super good-looking, but clearly a complete airhead.
text: Joel looks really messed up now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: So it's two-hundred dollars then?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah, two-hundred.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well yeah, but don't forget, I'm
dialog: getting ten percent.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What, so you're a pimp now?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (CONDESCENDING CHUCKLE)
dialog: I don't think they're called
dialog: "pimps" when it's with male
dialog: prostitutes, okay. There's some
dialog: other word for it -- it's not a
dialog: "john," but it's something like
dialog: that. Besides, I'm the one who
dialog: hooked all this up. And don't worry
dialog: 'cuz it's coming out of Brad's
dialog: money anyway.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Alright, alright.
dialog: (TO BRAD)
dialog: So it's two-hundred dollars then?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Two-hundred and twenty.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Wait a minute--
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Um, I have a question?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah?
text: Brad looks at Joel, deeply concerned.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: So like, are you gonna, like, watch
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No no no. God no! It's not like
dialog: that. I won't even be there. I'll
dialog: be at work. Remember? We already
dialog: talked about this.
text: Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What you'll do, is come to my house
dialog: pretending to be the new pool
dialog: cleaner. Then you simply try to
dialog: seduce my wife. Okay? If she
dialog: doesn't respond, you simply clean
dialog: the pool and leave. That's all.
dialog: It's that simple.
dialog: Hold on Brad for a long beat.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: So, uh, you're not gonna touch my
dialog: ass or anything...?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: NO! Try to pay attention okay? I
dialog: will not be there. I will be at
dialog: work. You come over to my house
dialog: while I'm not there, posing as the
dialog: new pool cleaner and then try to
dialog: seduce her...
text: Brad finally makes a breakthrough.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Oooh, I see. Sorry man. Yeah,
dialog: yeah. I get it now. You're not
dialog: even gonna be there...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, that's right.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah... cool. No problem. This is
dialog: gonna be great!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Remember, she might not go for it--
text: Brad starts to get a little too excited.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah, this is gonna be cool! I can
dialog: hardly wait! Awesome. Hey man, if
dialog: you know anyone else who needs --
dialog: you know -- what I do, like you
dialog: know, lonely housewives and shit,
dialog: maybe you could tell 'em about me,
dialog: you know...
text: Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to stop
text: talking.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Cuz like, I figure if I did a
dialog: few jobs and I was, like, really
dialog: good? Then maybe they'd tell their
dialog: friends, you know, and they'd give
dialog: me a... what do you call those
dialog: things?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Referrals.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah yeah, those things. Then
dialog: those women could tell more women
dialog: and then it'd be like I was, like,
dialog: uh... branching or..
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Networking.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah, networking! Totally. Then
dialog: if I got enough of 'em, maybe I
dialog: could quit my landscaping job and
dialog: do this full time. That would be
dialog: awesome! Cause I hate landscaping.
dialog: I like getting laid a lot better,
dialog: and my boss is a total dick...

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: BRAD

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Goodnight Brad.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Okay. See you later.
text: Brad finally leaves.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Let me drive you home. You're in

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Are you sure about this guy Dean?
dialog: He acts like he's never done this
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Oh no. He does it all the time.
dialog: Don't worry. He just gets a little
dialog: excited sometimes. He's cool.
speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: DEAN

dialog: in.

speaker_heading: CINDY

dialog: (FLIRTATIOUS)

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh shit!

text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE

speaker_heading: JOEL

dialog: Oh, hey Joel.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Thank God you're home. Ah,... did
dialog: that really happen last night? I
dialog: mean, did we go through with it --
dialog: with that gigolo stuff?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Ah, yeah. As far as I know.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Shit! What was I thinking?! We
dialog: gotta call it off. Right now. Can
dialog: you call that guy, Brad?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Tell him I'll pay him anyway,
dialog: whatever, just don't come over.
dialog: God, what was I thinking?!

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What? I thought you called him
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah, but I got his number from

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well get it from him again.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Vic doesn't have a phone right now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Shit! I'll try information.
dialog: What's Brad's last name?
text: Pause.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hmm... it's something like,... I
dialog: think it's a Mexican name.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (LOSING PATIENCE)
dialog: Mexican?! The guy's got blonde
dialog: hair and blue eyes!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah, I thought it was weird too --
dialog: a guy like that with a Mexican last
dialog: name... It's like Lopez, or Sanchez
dialog: or something.
text: Joel looks at his watch. It's 11:15.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Shit!

text: Joel rushes past him.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Not now!

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Excuse me Joel? There's a Brad

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I can't, I--
text: Joel stops suddenly.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Brad Chavez. He said he's done
dialog: with the job you guys talked about
dialog: at your house? Do you want me to
dialog: take a message?
text: Joel looks pale.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Um, no... He's the ah, pool
dialog: cleaner. I better take that.

speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Hey, it's Brad. Mission
dialog: accomplished dude.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: I mean it worked. She totally went
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What? What're you...?
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: You weren't even supposed to be
dialog: there for another 45 minutes.
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Oh really? I forgot what time you
dialog: guys said, and I was so excited
dialog: about it, I just went over there.
text: Joel sits down, freaked out.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (reality setting in)
dialog: So you mean she actually ah... you
dialog: guys...?
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Yup. It was easy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (AGITATED)
dialog: Easy? What do you mean "easy"?
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Oh, I don't mean easy like she was
dialog: easy -- like she was a slut or
dialog: anything. I just mean it wasn't
dialog: hard to get her to... Never mind.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. Tell me. Tell me how it

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Okay. Well, she let me in, so I
dialog: went back like I was cleaning the
dialog: pool...
scene_heading: EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY
text: As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's
text: telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax.
text: We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag.
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: .I don't know anything about pool
dialog: cleaning, so I was just faking it.
dialog: She was in her bathing suit...
text: Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs.
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: .So I struck up a conversation...
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: This is a really nice house.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Is it your Dad's house?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: No. It's ours.
speaker_heading: BRAD

speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Oh, thanks.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Do you have any sunscreen? I
dialog: forgot mine.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 45.
text: Brad's dopey narration comes back in...
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: I thought that was pretty smart
dialog: of me -- to ask her to borrow
dialog: sunscreen. See, 'cuz that way,
dialog: once she gave me some, I could ask
dialog: her if she wanted some too, and rub
dialog: some on her back, instead of just
dialog: coming out and asking her to rub
dialog: some on her. Pretty smooth huh?...
text: We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face-
text: down on the chair.
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on
dialog: her, the rest was easy...
text: We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back.
text: Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel
text: interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay that's enough! Stop!
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye.

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: No... not today...
text: Joel puts the car in reverse, starts to pull behind a parked
text: car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves and
text: crosses the street. Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his
text: driveway.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: How's it goin'?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, I'm kind of busy actually.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I
dialog: just wanted to let you know, I got
dialog: those tickets to that dinner we
dialog: talked about on the 7th. I think I
dialog: told you they were forty dollars a
text: piece, but it turns out it's a tad
dialog: more this year -- fifty-five -- so
dialog: if I could go ahead and just get a
dialog: check from you guys...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Look, ah, we can't go. Remember?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No, this is the 7th. You said
dialog: you're going out of town on the
dialog: 17th.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, but remember, I told you we
dialog: didn't really want to go to this
dialog: thing.
text: Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap.
speaker_heading: NATHAN

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Like I say, General Mills isn't

text: their parolees -- various gang-bangers, drug dealers,
text: junkies, a hideous transvestite prostitute, etc. As we pan,
dialog: each officer is giving them nothing -- "this is your last
text: chance," "You expect me to believe that?", etc. We continue
dialog: past officers giving them nothing, giving them nothing,

text: giving Cindy everything -- almost apologetic.
speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: I'm sorry to even bring this up,
dialog: but you're not living with the drug
dialog: dealer anymore are you?
text: Cindy's parole officer is a sad schlub of a guy, about 50

dialog: (ALMOST BLUSHING)
dialog: It's okay. I'm just glad to see
dialog: you're doing so well... Ah, one
dialog: more thing I just need to ask you:
dialog: We had a little incident up in
dialog: Templeton a couple weeks back where
dialog: someone stole an expensive guitar
dialog: from a music store? Someone who
dialog: fit your description. You know
dialog: anything about that?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Huh? No... I was probably at work
dialog: that day.

speaker_heading: PAROLE OFFICER
dialog: Look Cindy, you realize you can't
dialog: screw up anymore right? I mean,
dialog: even something minor, and you could
dialog: go back to jail for a while this
dialog: time. I'd hate to see that happen.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Well yeah, but why would I steal a
dialog: guitar? I've got no musical
dialog: talent. I'm tone deaf.

dialog: Heh heh, So am I. I can't carry a
dialog: tune to save my life.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Really? Wow...
text: Cindy acts fascinated by Parole Officer's lack of musical

dialog: No. It was today. The new guy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What'd he look like?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Blonde haired kid, about this high,
dialog: good looking. Real good looking.
text: IN FACT--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You sure it was today? Not
dialog: yesterday?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You're absolutely sure?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yeah. I know it was today, because
dialog: I came home for lunch. I was gone
dialog: all day yesterday. Anyway, you
dialog: think I could go ahead and get that
dialog: check from ya? Like I say, it's 55
dialog: dollars a plate, so that'd be 110
dialog: total. There's no tax...
text: Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the
text: opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Joel is on his cell phone, yelling in hushed tones at Brad.
text: He has the door shut so Suzie won't hear him.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What the hell were you doing at my
dialog: house today?!
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Oh, umm... nothing.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Bullshit!
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Look, don't worry about it bro'. I
dialog: won't charge you for this one.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Won't charge me for...? You had
dialog: sex with my wife again?!
speaker_heading: BRAD (V.0.)
dialog: Well, I figured we already did it
dialog: once, so what's the big deal? I
dialog: mean, she said to stop by if I was
dialog: in the neighborhood, so... Besides,
dialog: I'm not gonna charge you--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Not gonna charge...? God damn you!
dialog: Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm
dialog: gonna pay you! You're not having
dialog: sex with my wife for free! And I
dialog: better not ever catch you anywhere
dialog: near my house ever again!
text: Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone,
text: picks it back up and hits the "End" button.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants. Joel walks
text: through, mumbles something about going to a party.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S CAR -- NIGHT
text: Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on. He
text: stays in the car, checking it out.
text: Scanning Joel's POV, we see the band, Godscock, playing in
text: the backyard, with Rory on bass. They are set up on the
text: patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of the
text: people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on
text: the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The band
text: sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The
text: lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even
text: more loud and overly dramatic. Rory acts all intense, in
text: stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 55.
text: They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look.
dialog: It's downright pathetic.
text: There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head,
text: playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes.
text: Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He
text: watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away.
text: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT
text: Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I can't believe my wife slept with
dialog: that guy.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well... I thought you said it
dialog: wouldn't bother you.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I guess I didn't really think about
dialog: it long enough... I just wish it
dialog: hadn't been so easy for him.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah, I'm tellin' ya, chicks really
dialog: go wild for that Brad...
dialog: (Off Joel's look)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, you're right. He may be a
dialog: stupid, dull-witted moron, but he
dialog: can get any girl he wants. Me, I
dialog: had to work for it. I had to work
dialog: hard, get a career going, take
dialog: Suzie out a bunch of times, marry
dialog: her. But not Brad. He gets to
dialog: waltz into my house and have sex
dialog: with my wife just like that. Oh,
dialog: and by the way? That little prick
dialog: was at my house again today.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: No shit? What was he doing?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Take a wild guess.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Wow... You pay a guy to do a job,
dialog: then he comes back and does it for
dialog: free.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm not going to let him do it for
dialog: free. No way. I'm paying him.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Really? How much?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, I don't know. The same, I
dialog: guess. Why?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hmm... So should I get my twenty
dialog: dollars from Brad then or...
text: Joel shoots Dean an angry look.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We can worry about that later...
dialog: Look at the bright side, now you
dialog: can call Cindy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know... I feel weird about
dialog: it. Besides, she's at the party,
dialog: she probably won't be home 'til
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You know what you need to do?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: I don't wanna do drugs Dean.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Look, I know I joke around a lot,
dialog: but this time I'm serious.
dialog: (like a doctor)
dialog: You should try smoking a little
dialog: pot. It's just an herb, it heals.
dialog: Stress can kill you, and--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I get paranoid when I smoke pot.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Not when you just smoke a little.
dialog: Come on. You ever meet my friend
dialog: Willie? Great guy. Really great
dialog: guy.
dialog: (as if it's a positive)
dialog: He's the guy I got that horse
dialog: tranquilizer from.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, wonderful.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: WILLIE loads up some kind of giant three-foot tall bong and
text: inhales a massive bong-load. He's a burly ex-football player
dialog: type who looks like he might have an extra y-chromosome or
text: two. Joel watches Willie, feeling a little uneasy. Dean
dialog: pontificates.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I've been reading about it --
dialog: they're making technological
dialog: advances now, coming up with great
dialog: drugs that can make you happy and
dialog: won't leave you with a hangover or
dialog: nothin'.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (holding in bong-hit)
dialog: Right on.
text: Willie finally exhales. The exhale seems to go on way longer
text: than humanly possible, endless amounts of pot-smoke billowing
text: out (accomplished with special FX). He finally hands the
text: bong and lighter to Joel.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a
dialog: light weight. I think that's too
dialog: much for me--
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (still holding out the
dialog: bong and lighter)
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Come on Joel. Don't worry, this
dialog: stuff isn't that strong.
dialog: (to Willie, re: Joel)
dialog: (MORE)
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CON T-D)
dialog: He gets paranoid when he gets too
dialog: stoned.
text: Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong,
dialog: partly out of being intimidated by Willie.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Ah, what the hell.
text: Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same
text: condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Okay, now this is a gravity bong.
dialog: Have you ever used one before?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Umm, I think... no.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Okay, pay attention. Put your
dialog: thumb right here on the carburetor.
dialog: When I pull the plunger up and say,
dialog: "let go" I want you to let go and
dialog: inhale hard.
text: Joel's POV: Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong
text: with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl.
speaker_heading: WILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay exhale!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You know, maybe I should just let
dialog: YOU GUYS--
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (starting to get scary)
dialog: Bullshit! EXHALE HARD!
text: Mostly out of fear, Joel exhales. Willie puts the bong up to
text: Joel's face, lights it and starts lifting the plunger. Then
text: pushes it down.
speaker_heading: WILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let go! Inhale! NOW!
text: Joel lets go of the carburator, inhales.
speaker_heading: WILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (INSANE)
dialog: GO! GO! HARDER!!!
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 59.
text: Joel inhales with all his might, sucking up massive amounts
text: of thick pot smoke as Willie pushes down the plunger.
speaker_heading: STONER-RIPPLE
text: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Willie, Dean and Joel sitting around, completely baked --
dialog: especially Joel. (We play most of the scene from Joel's
dialog: stoned, paranoid POV.)
text: Dean makes some kind of barely audible mumble -- or did he?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What?
text: Long pause.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Huh?
text: Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits there
text: with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, I thought somebody said
dialog: something.
text: Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to
text: Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then,
text: in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: BWAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
text: Joel jumps back, scared shitless. Willie starts laughing his
dialog: ass off.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Haaaah ha... The look on your face!
dialog: (INSANE CACKLE)
dialog: Man you really do get paranoid when
dialog: you get stoned.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (fake, timid laugh)
dialog: Yeah, heh heh...
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hey Joel, why don't you call that
dialog: chick now?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Time for you to call her and
dialog: finally get laid man!
dialog: (handing him the phone)
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It's twelve thirty. She might be
dialog: back by now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Alright.
text: Joel gets the phone number out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: So what's this chick look like?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, she's got brown hair. Pretty
dialog: hot. Kind of working-class
text: looking...
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: What do you mean by that?
text: Willie stares at Joel for a beat. Joel can't tell if he's
dialog: offended Willie or not.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Umm... Oh you know,...
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Is she kind of slutty lookin'?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: Beat. Joel's not sure if that was the right answer either.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Alright! That's how I like 'em.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGH)
dialog: Kinda nasty, heh heh...
text: Joel starts dialing the number.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope I don't wake her up...
dialog: (LISTENS)
dialog: It's busy.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Alright. At least you know she's
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Try her again. Come on.
text: Joel hits redial.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Still busy... Man, what kind of
dialog: person doesn't have call-waiting.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I don't have call-waiting. I hate
dialog: call-waiting. Every time I hear
dialog: that goddamn clicking sound, I
dialog: wanna put my fist through someone's
text: head.
text: Beat. Once again, Joel doesn't know whether to shit or wind
text: his watch. Willie stares at him, then
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Haaa ha! Man you really do get
dialog: paranoid when you're stoned...
dialog: Seriously though, I fuckin' hate
dialog: call-waiting.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
dialog: Yeah...
text: Willie grabs the phone.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Here let me dial. You're too
dialog: stoned.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 62.
text: Willie grabs the piece of paper with Cindy's number. He
text: looks at it, starts to dial, then pauses, realizing
dialog: something.
text: Willie looks up at Joel, with slowly building rage, then
text: hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I'll tell you why you're getting a
dialog: busy signal. This is my number.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Huh? But...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh... You're joking right? Trying
dialog: to make me paranoid?
text: Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn't. He
text: just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR
text: UNLOCK. Everyone looks.
text: CINDY enters.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hi. Sorry I'm late, I...
dialog: (NOTICING JOEL)
dialog: Joel? What are you doing here...?
text: Willie stands up and walks over to Joel's chair. Dean
text: suddenly stands up.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well, it looks like you guys got a
dialog: lot to talk about here so I think
dialog: I'm just gonna go ahead and take
dialog: off. Later guys.
text: Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to
text: leave, but Willie blocks him.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Kinda slutty?
text: Willie grabs Joel and throws him against the wall. Joel
text: tries to make a break for the door, but Willie hauls off and
text: punches him across the face. The ass-kicking begins as we
text: CUT TO:
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Joel limps into the house, his face bruised black and blue
text: from the ass-kicking. He looks awful.
text: As he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible, he trips
text: on something, waking up Suzie. She turns on a light and sees
dialog: Joel.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Oh my God Joel, are you alright?
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm fine. I'm fine. I just ah...
dialog: got my ass kicked. Go back to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: What? By who? What happened?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It was just... some guy over at
dialog: Scoreboards.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Let me drive you to the hospital.
dialog: You need to get checked out.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. I'll be fine. I just want to
dialog: sleep right now, okay?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: You sure you're okay? It looks
dialog: like your nose is broken, and your
dialog: EYE--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (AGITATED)
dialog: Don't worry about it! People get
dialog: their asses kicked all the time!
dialog: It's no big deal. Go back to

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Hi Joel. Brian wanted to see you--
dialog: (NOTICING)
dialog: Oh my God, what happened?
text: Joel keeps walking, MUMBLES something about falling down some
text: stairs, goes into his office and shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Joel walks over to the window overlooking the production
text: area. He looks down and sees Cindy working, with her back
text: turned. Shakes his head.
text: Brian KNOCKS on the door and enters, looking worried.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hi... Did you talk to Step yet?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: He isn't returning my calls.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Shit... We've got problems. He did
dialog: hire a lawyer -- Joe Adler -- he's
dialog: that personal injury lawyer you see
dialog: on all the bus-stop benches. You
dialog: oughtta see this guy. He's a real
dialog: piece of shi--
dialog: (noticing Joel's face)
dialog: Oh man, what happened to you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, I fell down some stairs.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Damn... Well anyway, I hate to say
dialog: this, but I think we're screwed.
dialog: There's no way this Adler guy is
dialog: gonna settle for anything less then
dialog: bankrupting us. Says he'll sue us
dialog: into the stone age.
speaker_heading: JOEL

dialog: MISERABLE)

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Man, everyone's getting hurt.

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Ah... no.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Step did it. Can you believe that?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No he--!
dialog: (CATCHES HIMSELF)
dialog: What? Where did you hear that?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's what she told Mary.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: But... Step? Does he even know
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Apparently they've been going out.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I know, it's weird. They didn't
dialog: even meet here. They met at a
dialog: grocery store or something. Just a
dialog: total coincidence.
text: Joel looks down at Cindy on the production floor, his mind
text: reeling.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Anyway, we're gonna have to hire a

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: JOEL

text: Joel looks down at Cindy with growing suspicion.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. Don't fire him. Just trust me

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Shit!

speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I don't know. This is my first

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: BRAD

dialog: know -- I think we're in love.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: In love?!
dialog: (COMING UNGLUED)
dialog: HA! Man are you stupid. You are

speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I don't think so dude.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, you don't think so "dude?"

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: So how was that new pool cleaner?
text: Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but
dialog: she plays it cool.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Um... What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What do you think I mean?... Did
dialog: he do a good job cleaning the pool?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Ah... well--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Did he get all the... leaves? It
dialog: doesn't really look that clean. I
dialog: mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say
dialog: it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the
dialog: guy even clean it at all? It sure
text: doesn't look like it.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: (NERVOUS)
dialog: Well yeah, I guess he didn't do a

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: JOEL

text: Step and Joel enter. Step's 300 POUND HALF-BROTHER sits on a

speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Wow, I don't think you've ever been
dialog: to my house before. Have you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (talking above the TV)
dialog: Yeah, I don't think so. I would've
dialog: remembered...
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: This is my half brother Phil.
text: Joel starts to motion "don't get up," then realizes that's

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: You know, my lawyer told me not to

dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: You're not here to try to talk me
dialog: out of suing are you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, no... No, I'm just kind of
dialog: curious about... ah... So you've
dialog: been going out with Cindy, huh?
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Yes sir. She's my girlfriend. We
dialog: might even get married after all
dialog: this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets
dialog: worked out.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: .so some of the guys at work are
dialog: saying you gave Cindy that black
text: eye.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: What? That ain't true at all.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I know it's not.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: She got it from falling down some

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hmm... Look, you might wanna be
dialog: careful with Cindy.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: (DEFENSIVE)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, I'm not sure how to put this,
dialog: but... You know, you got a lot of
dialog: money coming your way with this
dialog: settlement. You might wanna be
dialog: CAREFUL--
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Oh no. No, she didn't even know
dialog: about that 'til after we started

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You sure about that?
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Oh yeah. I didn't tell her about
dialog: it for a while 'cuz I was kind of
dialog: embarrassed, you know? You don't
dialog: tell a girl you just met that you
dialog: lost one of your balls. Especially
dialog: a girl as hot as Cindy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (DELICATELY)
dialog: You know she lives with this guy
dialog: Willie right?
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: That's her ex. She broke up with
dialog: him. She's gonna move out. She
dialog: just needs to get all her stuff
dialog: outta there.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You sure about that?
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Oh yeah. She's moving in with me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh. Hmm...
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Look, I know Cindy's got some
dialog: problems, but she means well.
dialog: She's the best thing that ever
dialog: happened to me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, okay... If you say so.
dialog: Another thing -- you just might
dialog: want to watch your back. Some of
dialog: the guys at work who think you gave
dialog: Cindy the black eye were talking
dialog: about paying you a visit -- you
dialog: know, getting even.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Oh. Well I'm not worried about

speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: It's not right. I feel horrible.
dialog: Besides, I think Joel's getting

speaker_heading: BRAD

speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: (TURNED OFF)
dialog: Uh-huh... Look Brad, the truth is
dialog: I love my husband. I really do.
dialog: This was all a big mistake. I'm
dialog: sorry. I don't know what got into
dialog: me, but we have to stop this. I
dialog: want to make my marriage work
dialog: again. I'm going to tell Joel
dialog: about the whole thing and just hope
dialog: he forgives me. And even if he
dialog: doesn't, at least I won't be

speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Uh... This doesn't mean we can't

scene_heading: INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY
text: JOE ADLER, is holding court with the various lawyers and
text: paralegals waiting for the meeting to start. As promised, he
text: is awful. He looks like Henry Winkler with an extra Y
dialog: chromosome and a lot of steroids. (Maybe cast Gene Simmons
text: with his hair pulled back in a pony tail.)
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: .You see, if both his balls had
dialog: been knocked clean off, he would be
dialog: a good case, but not a great case:
dialog: A man with no balls is no man at
dialog: all. He's a freak. He's barely
dialog: human. He's gross. And a jury will
dialog: never feel like they can walk in
text: the shoes of a ball-less, neutered,
dialog: he/she freak. But Step. He's
dialog: still got one ball - barely. He's
dialog: still a man. A man who's very
dialog: manhood has been jeopardized, but
dialog: still a man. And that manhood,
dialog: that very sense of what you are as
dialog: a human being is hanging by a
dialog: thread. Jesus, you can't get more
dialog: dramatic than that. That brave
dialog: ball, hanging on for dear life,
dialog: hanging on for justice, is going to
dialog: be the hero of this trial. I'm
dialog: tellin' ya this Step guy is the
dialog: fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball
dialog: Jackpot. And you all laughed at me
dialog: when I bought those bus bench ads.
dialog: But I knew the asses of those poor
dialog: slobs that sit on those benches and
dialog: ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle
dialog: cars are our future. And I --

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And we're the ones doing all the
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: It's bullshit man. We should get a
dialog: piece of it. I work my ass off.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Gabrielle and I work harder than
dialog: anybody. I should be making what
dialog: Brian makes. If you add up all the
dialog: crates I move, I lift 10,000 pounds
dialog: a day. Minimum.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: That's right. Here he's gonna make
dialog: a million dollars, and we're the
dialog: ones who do everything. I went to
dialog: college. For three years.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: If we quit, this place couldn't
dialog: run. They wouldn't be able to sell
dialog: this place for anything.
text: JIM, a tall skinny 50-something guy with a ridiculously big
text: mustache and a little paunch, chimes in.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: That's why what we should do is, is
dialog: we should all go on strike --
dialog: demand stock in the company before
dialog: it sells. If General Mills knew
dialog: we were on strike, they wouldn't
dialog: buy this place until the strike was
dialog: over. That way they'd have to give
dialog: us stock.
text: Jim points to his head, gives everyone a "how's that" nod.
text: It starts to build steam.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: That's right man. We should do it.
dialog: We should strike.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's right. I could get a job at
dialog: Gemco like that. At Gemco, all the
dialog: employees are owners -- even says
dialog: so on the name tags.
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
dialog: Southwest Airlines...
scene_heading: INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY
text: The meeting is already in progress. On Adler's side of the
text: table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals. On
dialog: Joel's side it's just he, Brian and Joel's secretary. Maybe
dialog: one lawyer who doesn't say much.
text: Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents.
text: The confrence room, like Joel's office, has a full length
text: window facing the manufacturing area.
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: Ok gentlemen. We've gone through
dialog: everything and the only way we
dialog: would even begin to consider a
dialog: settlement would be to the tune of
dialog: the number you see on the bottom of
dialog: page 18. Does everyone have this?
text: Joel and the rest of them find page 18. Joel is stunned by
dialog: the number.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What!!!?
dialog: (so pissed he can barely
dialog: get the words out)
dialog: We don't have this much money! Not
dialog: even close!
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: Not in cash you don't. Of course
dialog: not. But if you were to sell off
dialog: your assets: the property lease,
dialog: the equipment, the--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What the ff-- Are you shitting
dialog: me!? That would bankrupt us!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: This is what I've been trying to
dialog: tell you Joel...

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: If you think I'm just going to give
dialog: up this entire company that I built

text: Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation.
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: How about what my client gave up!?
dialog: His testicles! How about that!?
text: He walks over to the door...
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: In fact, I'll make a deal with you -
dialog: - we will drop this case right now
dialog: if you come over here and put your
dialog: testicles right here
dialog: (indicates the space
dialog: between the door and the
dialog: HINGES)
dialog: and let me slam this door like
dialog: this...
text: Adler SLAMS the door ridiculously hard.
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: Go ahead. We can settle this right
dialog: now -- call it even. I will drop
dialog: this case right now if you let me
dialog: slam your balls in this door,
text: BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY
dialog: CLIENT!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It was an accident!
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: Not according to our investigation.
dialog: We believe that, in fact, there was
dialog: gross negligence...
scene_heading: INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINUOUS
text: The employees, same ones in the breakroom, are milling

speaker_heading: RORY

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Mmm hmm...
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: See, now they're probably up there
dialog: negotiating right now -- cuttin' up
dialog: the pie that we baked. That's what
dialog: it looks like to me.
text: The employees all nod in agreement.
text: Employees POV: Adler pointing at his balls, pointing to the
text: door again, about to slam it. One of his lawyers stops him.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: We gotta act fast. They could be
dialog: about to close the deal.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah, and leave us out in the cold.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Yeah, then it's too late. If
dialog: they've already sold it we can't
dialog: get a piece of it. We gotta act
dialog: fast. We need to do one of those
text: walk outs.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, we better do it now.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Okay, who's in? We need a show of
dialog: force. Come on, it's now or
dialog: never...
text: We PAN around the employees as the idea builds momentum,

speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: Okay then, let me go back to my
dialog: previous offer: I will gladly come
dialog: down on that price -- I'll come all
dialog: the way down to zero and drop this
dialog: case -- if you go over there right
dialog: now and slam your testicles in that
dialog: door! Because--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't wanna slam my testicles in
dialog: the door! I want you to be
dialog: reasonable! You won't even budge
dialog: one penny! Come on!
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: Like I say, if you slam your--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'll slam your balls in the door!
speaker_heading: ADLER
dialog: I'm sorry, did you just threaten
dialog: me?
text: Brian puts his hand on Joel, motions him to calm down.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Look, we need to cool off a minute.

text: Joel walks down the stairs. The group of employees see him
text: and ready themselves for the big confrontation. Joel notices
text: them all looking at him and stops.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah?... What?
dialog: But they are ill-prepared. No one knows who should talk
text: first. It's incredibly awkward. They all look at each other
dialog: and mutter things like, "go ahead" "you first". Finally...
text:

text: 
text:

speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Umm... We were just uh...
speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: that ah... We were considering the

speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Well, we just think that we should
dialog: maybe get a piece of it, you know
dialog: cuz we do all the work... And if we
dialog: don't... um...
text: Joel's in no mood for this. He goes off on them.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You know what? Fine. Fine.
dialog: You're all in charge -- all of you.
dialog: (gestures to all the
dialog: EMPLOYEES)
dialog: As of now. You run the goddamn
dialog: place. Go ahead. In fact, you can
dialog: go up there right now and meet with
dialog: Adler. He may slam your balls in
dialog: the door, but woohoo! You're the
dialog: boss!
text: Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there.
text: A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the
dialog: talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first,
dialog: etc. "I was gonna say something but you interrupted," "You
dialog: didn't say anything when he was leaving, so I thought you
dialog: were quitting. I would've stood up to him."

speaker_heading: SUZIE (CONT'D)

dialog: well, you've been so caught up in
dialog: you're work lately, and I'm here
dialog: alone all day and sometimes I just--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You banged the pool cleaner.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Wha...
text: Suzie is stunned.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: That's what you're trying to tell
dialog: me right? You had sex with Brad?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: You knew?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yes I knew. I hired him.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Well I know you hired him, but how
dialog: did you know about--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't mean I hired him to clean
dialog: the pool, I mean I hired him to
dialog: have sex with you.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: He's a gigolo Suzie.
text: Suzie is stupefied.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: But... what... Why?
text: Joel is so fed up, he just tells her everything.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I hired him to have an affair with
dialog: you so that I could have an affair
dialog: without feeling guilty. I was
dialog: really drunk and on some kind of
dialog: horse tranquilizer and--
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Brad was getting paid?...
dialog: (disbelief, hurt)
dialog: So you've been paying Brad this
dialog: whole time? All fifteen times?!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: FIFTEEN TIMES?! Jesus Christ
dialog: Suzie!
text: Joel sinks into his chair, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I only paid him once -- well,
dialog: twice. The rest was on the house.
text: Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: You wanted to have an affair with
dialog: another woman?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yes. But I didn't.
text: Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all
dialog: this. Then, decisively,
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: You asshole.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, I'm the asshole?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Yes! How could you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (LAUGHS)
dialog: How could I? How could you?!!!
dialog: You didn't have to have sex with
dialog: him. You could've simply said "No
dialog: thanks. Just clean the pool," but
dialog: you didn't, did you?! No, you took
dialog: him up on his little offer and had
dialog: sex with him -- fifteen times!
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: None of this would've happened if
dialog: you hadn't hired him.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay. I'll admit, I made a big
dialog: mistake. I was drunk, on drugs,
dialog: stressed, sexually frustrated and I
dialog: shouldn't have hired a male
dialog: prostitute to seduce you. But if
dialog: you had simply been faithful, none
dialog: of this would've happened.
text: Suzie just looks at him for a beat.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: You're sick, you know that?
dialog: Beat. Joel can't really argue this point.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What do you see in Brad anyway?
dialog: He's borderline retarded. You
dialog: probably could've been arrested for
dialog: having sex with a guy that dumb.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: That's it. I'm leaving.
text: Suzie heads for the door. Joel follows after her.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. You're not leaving me. I'm
dialog: leaving you!
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Fine.
text: Joel opens the door, about to storm out, only to find
text: NATHAN, standing right there about to ring the doorbell.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh, hey guys. Glad I caught ya.
dialog: You guys hardly ever answer the
dialog: door. Heh heh.
text: They are both so flustered, they can barely talk.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Now's not a good time Nathan.
text: Joel turns around, storms off back into the house.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh, you guys goin' somewhere?
text: 
text:

dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: No. Look, we can't talk right now.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well, you think I could go ahead
dialog: and get that check from ya then?
dialog: I'm just trying to balance my
dialog: checkbook here...
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Now's not a good time.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: When would be a good time, you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: See the thing is--
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Okay tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Great, what time?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: I don't know. Just come by
dialog: tomorrow. I can't talk now.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Okay great. And if you could just
dialog: go ahead and have that check,
dialog: that'd be great. It's a hundred
dialog: and ten. That's two plates at

speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Hey man... I know you probably
dialog: want to kick my ass, but--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I couldn't kick your ass if I
dialog: wanted to. You're a good 10 years
dialog: younger than me, and I'm a pussy.
dialog: So why don't you just leave me
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I just wanted to tell you, I'm not

dialog: know, about us. She's really into
dialog: you dude. I guess that's why she

dialog: gigolo. So I was wondering if you
dialog: had any openings over there at your
dialog: extract place?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (EXASPERATED SIGH)
dialog: Brad, you had sex with my wife.
dialog: I'm not gonna give you a job, okay?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Okay... Sorry man.
text: Brad walks away. Joel stares at his beer for a beat,
text: thinking. He calls out to Brad.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hey Brad?...
text: Brad stops.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know... Maybe come by the
dialog: office tomorrow. Fill out an
dialog: application. I'll see what I can
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Cool. Thanks man.

scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY
text: Brian sits with Joel. They both look pretty miserable.
text: Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: We're screwed. General Mills has
dialog: pretty much withdrawn the offer
dialog: pending a really favorable
dialog: settlement with Step.
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Not only do we not sell the
dialog: company, we could wind up bankrupt.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (muttering to himself)
dialog: So I don't sell the company, don't
dialog: get the money, I'm bankrupt, I
dialog: don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to
dialog: have sex with my wife, and she
dialog: actually did it...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY
text: Suzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with
text: the long pole with the net at the end. She looks miserable.
speaker_heading: NATHAN (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
text: Nathan enters through the back gate.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: (MUTTERS)
dialog: Shit...
text: Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. She
text: acts as unfriendly as possible.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Why are you cleaning the pool
dialog: yourself? That new guy didn't work
dialog: out?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Yeah, didn't work out.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Boy, you just can't get good help,
dialog: eh?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: So, did you get a chance to write
dialog: that check?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't
dialog: going to that dinner okay?
text: Nathan acts deeply disappointed.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well gee, I wish you would've told
dialog: me that before I went and bought
dialog: the tickets.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Joel never agreed to this Nathan,
dialog: and neither did I.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well, it sure sounded like you guys
dialog: were going. Leslie was gonna talk
dialog: to you about it, but you didn't
dialog: return our calls. I mean, I
dialog: already bought these tickets.
dialog: They're nonrefundable. I really
dialog: wish you guys had been a little
dialog: more clear with me...
text: It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes
text: all her pent-up aggression on Nathan.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Okay, let me be really clear with
dialog: you then. When we say "I don't
dialog: think so," or even "I'm not sure,"
dialog: that means "no." Why can't you
dialog: understand that?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well, I just--
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Shut up! In fact, let me be even
dialog: more clear with you. We don't like
dialog: you! Is that clear enough? You're
dialog: dull, you never shut up, you never
dialog: listen, and we don't want anything
dialog: to do with you ever again!
text: Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts to
text: shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good
dialog: to stop.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Is that clear enough for you
dialog: Nathan?! Is that...?
text: Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: (WORRIED)
dialog: Nathan?
text: Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses.
text: Suzie SCREAMS.
scene_heading: EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- NIGHT
text: Joel pulls into the parking lot. He looks surprised, seeing
text: something on the other side of the lot that gets his
text: attention.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: No way...
text: From JOEL'S POV, we see Cindy pull up and get out of her car.
text: Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up
text: the stairs. Joel gets out and watches her from a distance.
text: He sees her go into a room and shut the door.
text: He stares up at the door for a beat. Then, with a look of
text: determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her
text: door.
scene_heading: INT. CINDY'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Cindy opens the door, a little startled to see Joel, but
dialog: pleasant to him.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh... Joel. I ah,...
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What're you...? What's up? How'd
dialog: you know I was here?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Ah, actually, I'm staying here too.
text: Down on the first floor, around the
dialog: back. I thought I saw you so I
dialog: ah...
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Well, come in.
text: Joel enters, stands in the living room. Cindy heads in to
text: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CINDY (O.S.)
dialog: Do you want something to drink? I
dialog: think all I have is Diet Coke.
text: Joel notices MARY'S PURSE lying on the coffee table. He
text: stares at it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No thanks.
text: Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Have a seat.
text: Joel remains standing, looking at the purse.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: That's Mary's purse... Isn't it?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Right there. That's Mary's purse.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh that? No, that's mine... So
dialog: how are things at work?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: That's Mary's purse. You stole it,
dialog: didn't you?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 93.
text: Cindy acts like he's being silly. There's nothing about her
dialog: demeanor that would make anybody think she's lying.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: No. It probably just looks like
dialog: it. There's a lot of those.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I've never seen another one. You
dialog: probably have Sylvia's wallet in
dialog: here somewhere too, don't you? And
dialog: everything else that's been stolen
dialog: from my employees.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Joel, are you okay?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, I'm not. That's Mary's purse
dialog: Goddammit! Okay? Everyone blamed
dialog: Hector. He almost got fired.
dialog: Doesn't that bother you?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (innocent, sweet)
dialog: Joel, I don't know what you're--
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hector! Hard working guy, never
dialog: did anything wrong. And what are
dialog: you doing with Step? You're trying
dialog: to screw him out of his settlement
dialog: money aren't you?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I have no idea what you're talking
text: about.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yes you do! You're the only reason
dialog: he's suing us aren't you? You know
dialog: how much work it took for me to
dialog: build up that company? You just
dialog: don't care about anybody do you?
dialog: What are you, some kind of
dialog: sociopath?
text: Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't even admit that you stole
dialog: this purse can you? You just can't
dialog: do it.
dialog: (MORE)
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: In fact, you probably can't tell
dialog: the truth about much of anything,
dialog: can you?...
text: Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I bet Cindy's not even your real
dialog: name is it? Who are you? Where
dialog: the hell are you from?
text: Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't answer can you? Because
dialog: if you said one true thing, you'd
dialog: have to tell the truth about
dialog: something else and then it would
dialog: all unravel wouldn't it? Then
dialog: you'd have to admit that you stole
dialog: this purse and God knows what else.
text: Beat. Cindy still looking away, down at the floor. We see
text: her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (COMPOSES HIMSELF)
dialog: Well, I'm leaving now.
text: Joel picks up the purse.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: And I'm taking this purse with me.
dialog: If it really is yours, you can call
dialog: the police and tell 'em I stole
dialog: it... In fact, I'm gonna call the
dialog: police and report it...
text: Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the
text: couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor,
text: her voice cracking slightly.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Please don't...
text: Joel stops.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: (still looking down)
dialog: Please don't report it to the
dialog: police. I'm on probation. I'll go
dialog: to jail. For a long time.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well... Maybe you should've thought
dialog: about that before you started
dialog: ripping off my employees.
text: Joel starts to open the door.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Joel? Please? I'll leave Step
dialog: alone. I promise. He'll drop the
dialog: lawsuit.
text: Joel considers this.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: How do I know that?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You can keep the purse. If I don't
dialog: leave him alone; if he doesn't drop
dialog: the lawsuit, then you can report
dialog: me. Please?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you
dialog: have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's
dialog: watch? Can I get those too?
text: Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well... Okay then. I guess that
dialog: works.
dialog: (REALIZING)
dialog: And I guess you just admitted that
dialog: you stole the purse. That's good,
dialog: I guess... A step in the right
dialog: direction...
text: Joel sits down on the couch also. With her head still down,
text: Cindy is weeping quietly. Joel doesn't notice, looking
text: straight ahead.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: So what's your deal anyway?... I
dialog: mean, how did you end up like this?
text: Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's
text: caught off guard.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: .Ah... Cindy?
text: Cindy breaks down and starts bawling.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, now you see... that's what
dialog: I'm talking about. You're trying
dialog: to manipulate me now, and I'm not
dialog: gonna fall for it...
text: Cindy starts bawling even harder.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I really hope you're not faking
dialog: this right now, because I'm feeling
dialog: really bad. Are you faking it?
text: Cindy shakes her head "no."
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm sorry, I was just curious, you
dialog: know, how a person ends up like...
dialog: this...
text: Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically.
text: Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or
dialog: comfort her in any way.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Never mind. I'm sorry...
text: Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she
text: leans in to him, crying on his chest.
text: He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even
text: closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in
text: even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start
text: kissing. As they get hot and heavy we
text: DISSOLVE TO:
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- MORNING
text: Wide shot of the Hotel. It's a beautiful morning.
scene_heading: INT. CINDY'S ROOM - DAY
text: Joel wakes up, looking more relaxed than we've ever seen him.
text: We PULL OUT to reveal that he's alone in Cindy's bed. He
text: sits up, yawns. He has a big satisfied smile on his face.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Cindy?
text: He looks around, realizes he's alone. Then suddenly looks
text: worried.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit!
text: He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he
text: realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants,
text: then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the
text: wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he
text: looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse,
text: Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side.
text: He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again.
scene_heading: INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA -- MORNING
text: Extract bottles moving along the assembly line full steam.
text: Mary and Gabriella gossiping.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (looks at her watch)
dialog: Joel hasn't been in all morning.
dialog: can you believe that?
speaker_heading: GABRIELLE
dialog: If we come in late, we get fired.
dialog: And here we're working our tails
dialog: off, and he's gonna get rich.
text: Joel walks in, bright-eyed and cheery, greeting people. He
text: walks over to Mary carrying her PURSE.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Here you go Mary.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 98.
text: Joel hands her the purse. Mary looks at it, not quite sure
text: how to react, not ever wanting to appear grateful for
dialog: anything -- not in her nature.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: And by the way, Hector didn't take
dialog: it. Cindy did.
text: Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She
text: whispers to Gabriella.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Can you believe that? Blaming
dialog: Cindy just to protect Hector.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Step's here to see you.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Really? Bring him in.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
text: No, he's outside. At the loading
dialog: dock. Wants to talk to you alone
dialog: back there for some reason.
dialog: (CRUDE IMMITATION)
dialog: "Man to man."
scene_heading: EXT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - LOADING DOCK
text: Step is pacing around, waiting. Joel comes out.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi Step...
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: How you doin'? How's your, ah...
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: (looking down at his
dialog: CROTCH)
dialog: Oh it's okay. Some days it still
dialog: hurts, but they've got me on some
dialog: pills. It's not too bad I guess...
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well... that's good.
text: They both sit down on the edge of the dock.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Look, ah... Cindy left me.
text: Joel's nods, not surprised, but sympathetic.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Wow... Bummer...
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Yeah, it is a bummer... You know, I
dialog: thought the worst part was having
dialog: my balls knocked off, but you know
dialog: what the worse part is? Dealin'
dialog: with all this bullshit... I'm sick
dialog: of that Adler guy tellin' me what
dialog: to do. He's a real dick.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, he sure is.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: The truth is, I just want to have
dialog: my old life back -- I just want to
dialog: go back to work. I'm a workin'
dialog: man; that's what I do.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah... I'm beginning to think I
dialog: might be the same way... I'm a
dialog: little worried about what I'd do
dialog: with too much time on my hands.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: I just lay around and watch TV all
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: The problem is, if I bankrupt the
dialog: company, there won't be a job to go
dialog: back to.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You don't have to bankrupt the
dialog: company.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Yeah, but then if I drop the
dialog: lawsuit, you'll sell the company,
dialog: and the new company might not hire
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, maybe I don't have to sell
dialog: the company... You know I've been
dialog: thinking; all these years I've been
dialog: building this company, dreaming
dialog: about the day I could sell it and
dialog: retire, but what would I really do
dialog: if I retired? It's like that old
dialog: saying -- it's not about the
dialog: destination, it's about the
dialog: journey?
text: Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I guess what I'm saying is, too
dialog: much free time might not be such a
dialog: good thing -- like that old saying,
dialog: idle hands are the Devil's
dialog: playground?
dialog: Step's never heard that one either.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't do much book
dialog: readin'.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What I'm saying is, I'm thinking
dialog: maybe I won't sell the company...
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: that is, if you dropped the
dialog: lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll
dialog: still get that insurance money --
dialog: probably a couple hundred thousand.
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Hmm. That sounds fair... But
dialog: under one condition...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What's that?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: You make me floor manager.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Deal.
text: They shake hands.
scene_heading: INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA
text: Joel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the
dialog: employees.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hold the line!
text: Mary shuts off the conveyer belt.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay, listen up everybody.
dialog: (Waits for them to settle)
dialog: I've decided not to sell the
dialog: company...
text: Gasps and murmurs among the employees.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: And I'm making Step the new Floor
dialog: Manager.
text: More gasps and murmurs.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: And if anyone doesn't like it, I
dialog: hear they're hiring over at
dialog: Gemco... But just remember, at
dialog: Gemco, the owner doesn't know your
dialog: names; you never even meet him,
dialog: he's at an office up in Chicago
dialog: somewhere and you get an auto-
dialog: response if you try to email him to
dialog: complain about anything. Here, you
dialog: can come up to my office any time
dialog: you have a problem. Thanks.
text: Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Huh? You're not selling?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's about the journey Brian. The
dialog: journey.
text: ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You know, if Joel's going to put
dialog: him in charge, we should go on
dialog: strike. You know, at Gemco, the
dialog: union handles the strikes and you
dialog: don't even have to--
text: PULL OUT as Step cuts her off.
speaker_heading: STEP
dialog: Quit yapping and get back to work
dialog: or you're fired.
text: Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and
text: Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads.
text: LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL - DAY
text: We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OUT
text: to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body.
text: Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment and
text: then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE,
text: sitting by herself, dressed in black.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi... You doing okay?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Yeah, I'm okay.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I heard you were right there when
dialog: it happened. That must've been
dialog: rough.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: It was horrible Joel. He came over
dialog: to ask for that check, and I
dialog: just...
text: Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING.
speaker_heading: SUZIE (CONT'D)
dialog: .I just lost it. I started
dialog: yelling at him. I said horrible
dialog: things. He had an aneurism and I
dialog: probably caused it.
dialog: (CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY)
dialog: I think the last thing I said to
dialog: him was "shut up." Those were the
dialog: last words he heard.
text: Joel hugs her, consoling.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's okay, it's not your fault...
dialog: It's not your fault.
text: Suzie's crying subsides a little.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: It could happen to any of us Joel.
dialog: Any of us could have an aneurism.
dialog: We could die at any moment.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I know... I know... But we
dialog: probably won't. It'll be alright.
text: Suzie starts to regain her composure.
text: They stand there for a beat.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You wanna go get something to
dialog: eat... or something?
text: Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Yeah, okay. Sure.
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 104.
text: They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while,
text: Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Here...
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Thanks.
text: They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Maybe we should've been married in
dialog: a Church like that one. Instead of
dialog: the Botanical Gardens.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: I thought you liked the Botanical
dialog: Gardens?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, but... a church just seems
dialog: more -- I don't know -- official.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: You think it would've made a
dialog: difference?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know... So, are we still
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Well, legally yes.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I mean otherwise.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Hmmm... We can talk about it I
dialog: suppose.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Alright.
text: They walk for a beat.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You know, this is really bad,
dialog: but... Oh never mind.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: What?
text: 
text: 
text: 
text: 
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, as I was looking down at
dialog: Nathan there, I was thinking...
dialog: That's the longest I've ever seen
dialog: him with his mouth shut.
text: Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself.
speaker_heading: SUZIE
dialog: Joel!
