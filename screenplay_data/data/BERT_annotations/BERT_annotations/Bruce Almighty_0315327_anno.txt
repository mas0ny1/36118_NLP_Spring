scene_heading: INT. KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAY
text: A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by
text: are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,
dialog: MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
text: employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the
dialog: background.
text: BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
text: to place a large segment of wayward hair.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong.
dialog: This is a bad sign.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: We really need to get a make-up
dialog: person?!
text: The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Not in the budget. And not to *
dialog: *
dialog: worry, you're going to look great
dialog: in this.
text: She holds out a HAIR NET.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair
dialog: net. I just did the hair.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: Health code. In the kitchen or
dialog: around the cookie, you gotta have
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (to crew: re hair net)
dialog: You guy's should tell me this
dialog: before hand, this is like a huge
dialog: waste of...moose.
text: Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
text: looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Remind me to swing by an elementary *
dialog: school after this and serve lunch.
text: Ally laughs.
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: You're a thing of beauty. In
dialog: three, two, one. . .
text: Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
dialog: (Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
text: "REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
dialog: that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms
dialog: Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: For three decades the Kowolski
dialog: Family Bakery has been a mainstay
dialog: in downtown Buffalo. Known for
text: their sinfully rich, cream filled,
dialog: deep fried polski pierogis. And
dialog: the occasional sugar induced coma
dialog: that follows. Today, in honor of
dialog: their 30 year anniversary, Momma
dialog: Kowolski and her sons Gustov and
dialog: Vol, decided to do something, a
dialog: little bit different. Tell me
dialog: guys, how did this idea come about?
speaker_heading: GUSTOV
dialog: Well, Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why
dialog: don't we make the biggest chocolate
dialog: chip cookie in Buffalo?' And I
dialog: said, 'Yeah, sure.'
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Wow. Fascinating.
text: Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: The previous Buffalo cookie record
dialog: was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
dialog: Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth
dialog: cookie clearly proving that Gustov
dialog: and Vol have much more free time.
text: The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
text: toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks
text: dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (CONT'D)
dialog: As we witness the ceremonial
dialog: toasting with milk it makes one
dialog: pause and think. What are we
dialog: really looking at here?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it just a big cookie or does
dialog: this cookie represent the pride of
dialog: Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard
dialog: working citizens the key
dialog: ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
dialog: in.
text: (motions his eyes to the
dialog: Kowolski twins)
dialog: And finally, the love of our
dialog: families which provides the warm
dialog: chewy center making our beloved
dialog: Buffalo the sweetest place to live.
text: Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (CONT'D)
dialog: And that's the way the cookie
dialog: crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,
dialog: Eyewitness News.
text: Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE
text: TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
text: The frame FREEZES.
text: We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,
dialog: watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...
scene_heading: INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box
text: of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
text: into a photo album.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: So, what do you think?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's good.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It sucks. It's a story about a
dialog: cookie. People with eating
dialog: disorders will be riveted,
dialog: (goes into huge pathetic
dialog: fan character)
dialog: Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.
dialog: I can't wait to vomit so I can make
dialog: room for more cookies.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I thought it was funny. I love the
dialog: hair net. How'd you get it to do
dialog: that?
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What? I'm cutting that. They made
dialog: me wear that stupid thing. I don't
dialog: even look like myself. The hair is
dialog: one of the most important parts of
text: an on camera persona. Right out of
dialog: the gate, I lost the hair
dialog: advantage.
text: Grace looks at a photo,
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My
dialog: sister is so drunk.
text: She places it in the album.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Grace. Try to stay focused here.
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Aren't you taking this a little too
dialog: seriously?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: It's sweeps Grace. It is serious.
dialog: There's an anchor job open. This
dialog: is important. This is our future!
text: Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing
text: he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
text: hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly
dialog: has a fragile temperament.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I'm never going to get anchor doing
dialog: these kind of assignments. I want
dialog: my work to matter.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It does matter. You're funny. You
dialog: make people smile. Come on, take a
dialog: break, help me put this album
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (reluctant)
dialog: Alright.
text: Grace holds up a photo.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh look at this. It's the first
dialog: day we moved in together.
text: It's the two of them, younger, laughing.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (down)
dialog: Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh, here's me at my sister's
dialog: wedding. I caught the bouquet.
text: It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
dialog: for the bouquet.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You look pretty intense, hun.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Well, I was thinking about you.
text: Grace cuddles into Bruce.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: So, you're attracted to me in some
dialog: way, is that what you're trying to
dialog: say?
text: Grace rolls over onto Bruce.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You have no idea.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I was saving myself for the wedding
dialog: night, but if you keep this up, I
dialog: may lose my resolve.
text: Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Well, that's the way the cookie
text: crumbles.
text: They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Hey, that's a good line, but you
dialog: need more resonance. From the
text: diaphragm.
dialog: (newscaster voice)
dialog: That's the way the cookie crumbles.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh, say it again.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (bigger)
dialog: That's the way the cookie crumbles.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (sweet, southern groupie)
dialog: Oh, I just love on-air
dialog: personalities.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (newscaster voice)
dialog: Well then, let me take these
dialog: clothes off and slip into my hair
dialog: net.
text: Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A TELEVISION SCREEN
text: We see the INTRO FOR SIXTY MINUTES:

dialog: I'm Ed Bradley, I'm Merely Safer,

text: LESLIE STAHL is HIT IN THE NECK WITH A TRANQUILIZER DART.

scene_heading: INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace
text: hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Sweety, time to get up...
text: She kisses Bruce, gets up.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No, I'm having a great dream.
text: The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME. Bruce throws a mock
dialog: hissy fit.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.
speaker_heading: SPORTSCASTER
dialog: ...and the Sabers lost another
dialog: close one last night. Four to
dialog: three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Of course they lost, they're my
dialog: team.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign-
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: "And that's the way the cookie
dialog: crumbles."
dialog: (calls to Grace)
dialog: You know, I think there might be
dialog: something to that cookie line.
dialog: Everything great anchor has his own
text: signature sign-off.
dialog: (as Walter Cronkite)
dialog: "And that's the way the cookie
dialog: crumbles."
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SAM
text: Peeing in the corner on the carpet.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh no! Grace, the dog!
speaker_heading: GRACE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm in the shower!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Ah!
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE
text: Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms
text: dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Whoops, sorry.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam
text: looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh, you're all done, huh?
dialog: B-e-a-utiful.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - MORNING
text: Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars
text: unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Wow, nice car, huh?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah, if you want to rub your
dialog: success in people's faces.
text: Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school
text: with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What's with the hubbub?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: We're having a blood drive.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Creepy. Needles, yech...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh, that's a nice response.
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I mean, it's just s o . . .
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Helpful and life saving?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: C'mon, that's your...blood. It's
dialog: in your body and I don't think it's
dialog: supposed to come out. Besides,
dialog: they stockpile that stuff. They
dialog: have an endless supply frozen in a
dialog: warehouse somewhere then tell
dialog: everyone there's a shortage.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: They do not. Now stop it. I'm *
dialog: giving. I have a very rare blood *
dialog: type, AB positive.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive
dialog: they aint touchin' me with no
dialog: needle.
text: Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (suddenly remembers
dialog: something)
dialog: O. . .
dialog: h
text: She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Prayer beads. The kids made 'em.
dialog: Keep you safe.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, I hope they work, cause it's
dialog: going take a miracle to get me to
dialog: work on time.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the
text: prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.
dialog: 10.
text: A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's
text: screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is
dialog: oblivious.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: This is just my luck.
text: Bruce's BEEPER sounds. He checks it.
speaker_heading: BRUCE.
dialog: The meeting's starting, perfect...
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Screw it.
text: He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels
text: off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's
dialog: kill or be killed, only the strong
dialog: survive, no guts, no glory1
speaker_heading: SFX: SIREN
text: Bruce pulls over, fumes.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (looking heavenward)
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping
text: over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS
text: MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign
text: boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN
dialog: reads:
speaker_heading: R EWE BLIND?
text: Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
text: continues on.
scene_heading: INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
text: Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs
text: right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.
dialog: 1.
speaker_heading: 1
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy.
dialog: Don't even move, I got somethin'
dialog: special today. My mom made it just
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go-
dialog: I'm late...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (bending down)
dialog: You like Quiche?
text: He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You know, contrary to popular
dialog: belief the quiche was actually
dialog: invented by the Mayans, then stolen
dialog: by the French. They shoulda said,
dialog: "Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's
dialog: Mayan!"
text: Bobby belts out a laugh.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Bobby, I can't, I--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Just taste it, taste it...
text: Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking
text: it with exasperation.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's a buck seventy-five.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Can you get Kelly- Ahh...
text: Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for
dialog: cash.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-
dialog: five, two-ten...
dialog: 12.
text: Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy
text: anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Way out of our league, huh?
text: Bruce offers his money to Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You know, I saw them editing your
dialog: cookie piece.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: They must have gotten high or
dialog: something, cause they was orderin'
dialog: everything, I had. Hey, how long
dialog: have you been interested in pastry?
dialog: 'Cause I've got an aunt who makes
text: baklava twenty layers deep.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (holding money out)
dialog: Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (gets a brilliant idea)
dialog: Maybe you could do a story on her!
text: Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Keep the change.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: I'll give her a call, we'll talk
dialog: about it later!
scene_heading: INT. STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: ON THE MONITOR:
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Is something killing your kids?
dialog: Find out tonight at eleven.
text: Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
text: continues on.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: IN THE ROOM
text: The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group
text: is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a
text: constant furrow in his brow.
text: Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
text: EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,
dialog: perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.
dialog: FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
dialog: vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally
dialog: Loman.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, promos are approved, let's--
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Ah, isn't that last one a little
dialog: misleading? I mean, the story's
dialog: about flu shots. Do we have to
dialog: scare people to death?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: No, just into watching. Or I could
dialog: change it to: "Slow news day, come
dialog: yawn with us. At eleven."
speaker_heading: FRED
text: Sniffles at eleven is nice.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Attack of the killer sniffles?
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: (to Dallas)
text: The tanning booth is starting to
dialog: zap your brain, you know that?
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: I don't use a tanning booth.
text: A beat and they all crack up.
speaker_heading: FRED *
dialog: Come on. You're turning orange. *
speaker_heading: EVAN *
dialog: He looks Florida ripe to me. . *
dialog: More laughs. *
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I would have swore I already said
dialog: this, but promos are approved. Now *
dialog: can we move on? *
speaker_heading: ALLY
dialog: Jack, shouldn't the promos be *
text: focusing on Pete's retirement.
dialog: This is his last week.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (leading)
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open
dialog: anchor position, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Evan, you'11 know something when I
dialog: know something.
text: Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't
text: need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault.
dialog: The traffic was -- You guys already
dialog: played the spots?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice story, Bruce, but we're going
dialog: with Evan's piece on the sex
dialog: scandal at the mayor's office for
dialog: sweeps.
text: This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: And that's the way the cookie
text: crumbles.
text: The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: I'm just messin' with you, Bruce.
dialog: See you've got to remember that the
dialog: news room is like a cookie...
text: More laughs.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (re: Evan's perfect
dialog: posture)
dialog: That's great Evan.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BRUCE (cont'd)
dialog: Is you're posture naturally that
dialog: good, or do you have to shove a
dialog: stick up there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're
dialog: holding your story in reserve.
dialog: Now, can we get back to the board
dialog: so we have something to air today?
text: Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce
text: slides down into his chair, deflated.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce
text: catches up .to him.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Jack, Jack, hey. Can I talk to you
dialog: for a second?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Sweeps.
text: Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Don't worry about it. I called my
dialog: aunt, we're on.
text: Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm
dialog: getting desperate man, I am pushing
dialog: forty and what have I got to show
dialog: for it? The point is, I've hit
dialog: some kind of a ceiling here. Some
dialog: kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And
dialog: Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
dialog: He gets the good stories, he gets
dialog: on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more
dialog: like Evan.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You don't want to be like Evan.
dialog: Evan's an asshole.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I can be an asshole.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, Bruce. You can't.
text: Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It
text: scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other
dialog: for a beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you going to pick that up?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yeah, I'm sorry.
text: Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: It's just- this anchor position
dialog: looming, it's gotten me nuts...
text: He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA
text: saunters by.
speaker_heading: JACK BRUCE
dialog: Hi, Susan. Hi, Susan.
speaker_heading: SUSAN ORTEGA
dialog: Hi, Jack.
text: Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look, Bruce. You're a good
dialog: reporter. You make people laugh.
dialog: God knows today we can use it.
dialog: Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before. *
speaker_heading: JACK *

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce.
dialog: I've seen your outtakes.
text: Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Yes 1 You will not regret this,
dialog: Jack.
dialog: (releases Jack)
dialog: I will not forget you when I go
dialog: national.

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: GOD

text: Bruce backs away from God.
speaker_heading: BRUCE

dialog: actionable!
speaker_heading: GOD
dialog: Well, that's not very neighborly.
dialog: I brought you here to offer you a

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: GOD

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: AAAHHHHHHHH!J!

text: Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing

speaker_heading: PAUL NEWMAN
dialog: Hey Mario, did you get that box of

text: He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal

scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Oh hi, ah, coffee please.

speaker_heading: WAITRESS

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No, that's okay.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: It's tomato.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Alright, okay.
text: She heads off. Bruce sits thinking. Could it be real?
text: He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out
text: his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS
text: HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.
text: Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and
text: sugar into his cup, looks around the table.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Excuse me I need a spoooo...
text: Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
dialog: napkin.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: That's alright, I found one.
text: The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves

text: The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I lie to my sister.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (becoming emotional)
dialog: And I'm sleeping with my best
dialog: friend's husband. I know he's just
dialog: using me but.. I'm just so tired of
dialog: being alone. I don't know why I'm
dialog: telling you all this. Just seems

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (sets the check down)
dialog: Take care of that whenever you're
dialog: ready.
text: Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense. He slowly

scene_heading: MUSIC UP: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEME
text: The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner
text: and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE
text: PARTS HIS RED SOUP.
text: A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the
text: edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.
speaker_heading: GOD (O.S.)
dialog: Havin' fun?
text: Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal
text: collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You- He- Thy...
speaker_heading: GOD
dialog: Let's take a walk.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE ERIE - DAY
text: God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.
text: God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.
speaker_heading: GOD
dialog: (re: the cockroach)
dialog: Most people want to kill these
dialog: guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very
dialog: streamlined design. Like little

dialog: hold their breath for forty minutes
dialog: and their cells divide only once

dialog: that...
dialog: (catching himself)
dialog: Oh, this is a bit over your head,

text: Off Bruce's look.

speaker_heading: GOD

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Rules ?
speaker_heading: GOD
dialog: Yeah, you left in such a rush I
dialog: didn't get a chance to explain.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Well the two extra fingers freaked
dialog: me out a little bit.
speaker_heading: GOD
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I figured that would get your
dialog: attention.. I did the same thing to
dialog: Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three
dialog: weeks. Now, here's the deal. You
dialog: have all my power. Use it any way
dialog: you choose. There are only two
dialog: rules. You can't tell anyone
dialog: you're God. Believe me you don't
dialog: want that kind of attention. And
dialog: you can't mess with free will.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Uh huh. Can I-ask why?
speaker_heading: GOD
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Yes you can. That's the beauty it.

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: This is amazing.
speaker_heading: GOD
dialog: Oh, speaking of amazing...
text: God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS.
text: He pockets them as he talks.

speaker_heading: GOD
dialog: Since you're finished with these, I
