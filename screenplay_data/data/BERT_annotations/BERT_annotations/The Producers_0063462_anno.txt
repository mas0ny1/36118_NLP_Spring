speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Here, don't panic.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (clutching his blanket)
dialog: I'm sorry ... I don't like people
dialog: touching my blue blanket. It's not
dialog: important. It's a minor compulsion.
dialog: I can deal with it if I want to.
dialog: It's just that I've had it ever
dialog: since I was a baby and ... and ...
dialog: I find it very comforting.
text: HE KISSES IT AND SHOVES IT INTO HIS POCKET.

dialog: produced only cost fifty-eight
dialog: thousand. There's two thousand
dialog: dollars unaccounted for.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: I went to a Turkish bath, who cares?
dialog: The show was a flop. What
dialog: difference does it make?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: It makes a great deal of difference.
dialog: That's fraud. If they found out,
dialog: you could go to prison.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Why should they find out? It's
dialog: only two thousand dollars, Bloom,
dialog: do me a favor, move a few decimal
dialog: points around. You can do it.
dialog: You're an accountant. The word
dialog: 'count' is part of your title.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: But that's cheating!
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: It's not cheating ... It's charity.
dialog: Bloom, look at me ... look at me!
dialog: I'm drowning. Other men sail
dialog: through life. Bialystock has
dialog: struck a reef. Bloom, I'm going
dialog: under. I am being sunk by a
dialog: society that demands success, when
dialog: all I can offer is failure. Bloom,
dialog: I'm reaching out to you. Don't
dialog: send me to jail. Help! Help!
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: DURING BIALYSTOCK'S LAST SPEECH, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES
text: INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT
text: ACROSS HIS CHEEK.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: Help!
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: All right. I'll do it. I'll do it.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Thank you, Bloom. I knew I could
dialog: con you.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Oh, it's all right ... wha?
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (pouring over the accounts)
dialog: Now let's see, two thousand dollars.
dialog: That isn't much. I'm sure I can
dialog: hide it somewhere. After all, the
dialog: department of internal revenue
dialog: isn't interested in a show that
dialog: flopped.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Yes. Right. Good thinking. You
dialog: figure it out. I'm tired. I'm
dialog: gonna take a little nap.
dialog: (crossing to couch)
dialog: Wake me if there's a fire.
text: HE HURLS HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE COUCH.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Now let's see, if we add these
dialog: figures, we get ...
text: CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING
text: DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES. HE COMES TO THE END AND
text: IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW.
text: BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM. HE COMPARES PAGES.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (musing to himself)
dialog: Heh, heh, heh, amazing. It's
dialog: absolutely amazing. But under the
dialog: right circumstances, a producer
dialog: could make more money with a flop
dialog: than he could with a hit.
text: QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE. HIS EYES POP OPEN.
text: CUT BACK TO BLOOM.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Yes. Yes. It's quite possible.
dialog: If he were certain the show would
dialog: fail, a man could make a fortune.
text: CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM.
text: HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS. HE MOVES TO
text: BLOOM'S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR
scene_heading: MORE INFORMATION. BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE
text: THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Yes???
text: BLOOM LOOKS UP. HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO
text: CLOSE TO HIS OWN.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (at a loss)
dialog: Yes, what?
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: What you were saying. Keep talking.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: What was I saying?
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: You were saying that under the
dialog: right circumstances, a producer
dialog: could make more money with a flop
dialog: than he could with a hit.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Yes, it's quite possible.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: You keep saying that, but you don't
dialog: tell me how. How could a producer
dialog: make more money with a flop than
dialog: with a hit?
dialog: 20.
text: BLOOM, SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED, PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES
text: BIALYSTOCK. HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A
speaker_heading: STUDENT.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: It's simply a matter of creative
dialog: accounting. Let us assume, just
dialog: for the moment, that you are a
dialog: dishonest man.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Assume away!
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Well, it's very easy. You simply
dialog: raise more money than you really
dialog: need.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: You've done it yourself, only you
dialog: did it on a very small scale.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: What did I do?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: You raised two thousand more than
dialog: you needed to produce your last play.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: So what? What did it get me? I'm
text: wearing a cardboard belt.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Ahhhhhh! But that's where you made
dialog: your error. You didn't go all the
dialog: way. You see, if you were really a
dialog: bold criminal, you could have
dialog: raised a million.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: But the play only cost $60,000 to
dialog: produce.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Exactly. And how long did it run?
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: One night.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: See? You could have raised a
dialog: million dollars, put on a sixty
dialog: thousand dollar flop and kept the
dialog: rest.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: But what if the play was a hit?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Oh, you'd go to jail. If the play
dialog: were a hit, you'd have to pay off
dialog: the backers, and with so many
dialog: backers there could never be enough
dialog: profits to go around, get it?
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! So,
dialog: in order for the scheme to work,
dialog: we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: What scheme?
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: What scheme? Your scheme, you
dialog: bloody little genius.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Oh, no. No. No. I meant no
dialog: scheme. I merely posed a little,
dialog: academic accounting theory. It's
dialog: just a thought.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Bloom, worlds are turned on such
dialog: thoughts!
text: BIALYSTOCK STARTS MOVING IN ON BLOOM.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Don't you see, Bloom. Darling,
dialog: Bloom, glorious Bloom, it's so
dialog: simple. Step one: We find the
dialog: worst play in the world -- a sure
dialog: flop. Step two: I raise a million
dialog: dollars -- there's a lot of little
dialog: old ladies in this world. Step
dialog: three: You go back to work on the
dialog: books. Phoney lists of backers --
dialog: one for the government, one for us.
dialog: You can do it, Bloom, you're a
dialog: wizard.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Step four: We open on Broadway and
dialog: before you can say 'step five' we
dialog: close on Broadway. Step six: We
dialog: take our million dollars and fly to
dialog: Rio de Janiero.
text: BIALYSTOCK GRABS BLOOM IN HIS ARMS AND BEGINS TO LEAD HIM IN
text: A WILD TANGO AROUND THE ROOM.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (sings)
dialog: "Ah, Rio, Rio by the seao, meo,
dialog: myo, meo ... "
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (afraid of the
dialog: scheme, afraid of the
dialog: dance, afraid of Bialystock)
dialog: Mr. Bialystock. No. Wait. Please.
dialog: You're holding me too tight. I'm
dialog: an honest man. You don't understand.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (leading Bloom as he talks)
dialog: No, Bloom, you don't understand.
dialog: This is fate, this is destiny.
dialog: There's no avoiding it.
text: AT THIS POINT, BIALYSTOCK SWEEPS BLOOM INTO AN ELABORATE DIP.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
text: (the back of his head
dialog: practically touching
dialog: the floor)
dialog: Mr. Bialystock, not more than five
dialog: minutes ago, against my better
dialog: judgment, I doctored your books.
dialog: That, sir, is the ultimate extent
dialog: of my criminal life.
text: BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS FISTS TO THE HEAVENS IN DESPAIR.
scene_heading: BLOOM, EXPERIENCING A DEFINITE LACK OF SUPPORT, GOES CRASHING
text: TO THE FLOOR.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
text: OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH! OOOOOHH!
text: OOOOOHH! I WANT THAT MONEY!
text: CAMERA ON BLOOM AS HE LIES STRICKEN ON THE FLOOR.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh, I fell on my keys.
dialog: (he shifts slightly
dialog: to make himself more comfortable)
dialog: I've got to get out of here.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (angrily hovering
dialog: over Bloom)
dialog: You miserable, cowardly, wretched
dialog: little caterpillar. Don't you ever
dialog: want to become a butterfly? Don't
dialog: you want to spread your wings and
dialog: flap your way to glory?
text: BIALYSTOCK FLAPS HIS ARMS LIKE A HUGE PREDATORY BIRD.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (his eyes widened in terror)
dialog: You're going to jump on me.
text: BIALYSTOCK STARES AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: You're going to jump on me. I know
dialog: you're going to jump on me -- like
dialog: Nero jumped on Poppea.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (nonplussed)
dialog: What???
speaker_heading: BLOOM
text: (by now he is shrieking)
dialog: Poppea. She was his wife. And she
dialog: was unfaithful to him. So he got
text: mad and he jumped on her. Up and
text: down, up and down, until he squashed
dialog: her like a bug. Please don't jump
dialog: on me.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (shouting and jumping
dialog: up and down next to Bloom)
dialog: I'm not going to jump on you!
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (rolling away in terror)
dialog: Aaaaaaaaaa!
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (hoisting Bloom to
dialog: his feet)
dialog: Will you get a hold on yourself.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (up on his feet and
dialog: running for cover)
dialog: Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
text: HE RUNS TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM. TRAPPED! HE TURNS.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: What are you afraid of? I'm not
dialog: going to hurt you! What's the
dialog: matter with you?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: I'm hysterical. I'm having
dialog: hysterics. I'm hysterical. I
dialog: can't stop. When I get like this,
text: I can't stop. I'm hysterical.
text: BIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK. PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER
text: AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM'S FACE.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: I'm wet! I'm wet! I'm hysterical
dialog: and I'm wet!
text: BIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOM'S HYSTERICS,
text: SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (holding his face)
dialog: I'm in pain! And I'm wet! And I'm
dialog: still hysterical!
text: BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: No! No! Don't hit. It doesn't
dialog: help. It only increases my sense
dialog: of danger.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: What can I do? What can I do?
dialog: You're getting me hysterical.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Go away from me. You frighten me.
dialog: (he indicates the sofa)
dialog: Sit over there.
dialog: 25.
text: BIALYSTOCK SITS ON THE SOFA.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Okay. I'm way over here. Is that
dialog: better?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: It's a little better, but you still
dialog: look angry.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: How's this?
dialog: (he smiles sweetly)
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Good. Good. That's nice. That's
dialog: very nice. I think I'm coming out
dialog: of it now. Yes. Yes. I'm
dialog: definitely coming out of it. Thank
dialog: you for smiling. It helped a great
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (for want of something
dialog: sensible)
dialog: Well, you know what they say,
dialog: "Smile and the world smiles with
dialog: you." Heh, heh.
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: The man should be in a straight
dialog: jacket.
dialog: (to Bloom)
dialog: Feeling better?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Much, thank you. But I am a little
dialog: lightheaded. Maybe I should eat
dialog: something. Hysterics have a way of
text: severely depleting one's blood
dialog: sugar, you know.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: They certainly do. They certainly
dialog: do. Come, let me take you to lunch.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: That's very kind of you, Mr.
dialog: Bialystock, but I ...
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy. I
dialog: lowered your blood sugar, but least
dialog: I could do is raise it a little.
text: BLOOM LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: And I promise you faithfully, I
dialog: won't discuss that silly scheme to
dialog: make a million dollars anymore.
text: BIALYSTOCK DONS HIS CAPE AND "BELASCO" HAT. FROM A RACK HE
text: SELECTS A GOLD-TOPPED WALKING STICK. HE GOES TO DOOR, OPENS
text: IT, AND WITH A GRAND FLOURISH, MOTIONS BLOOM TO PRECEDE HIM.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Avanti!
scene_heading: BLOOM GRACIOUSLY COMPLIES. THEY EXIT.
text: CUT TO EXTERIOR. ENTRANCE OF BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE BUILDING.
text: THE DOOR OPENS. IT IS HELD BY BIALYSTOCK. BLOOM EXITS
text: BUILDING INTO STREET.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (to Bialystock, who
dialog: is holding door)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Je vous empris.
text: THEY TURN UP 45TH STREET AND HEAD TOWARD BROADWAY.
text: BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND COUNTS HIS MONEY. HE
text: LOOKS WORRIED. SUDDENLY HIS FACE BRIGHTENS.
text: WE SEE WHAT BIALYSTOCK SEES.
text: CUT TO MURRAY THE BLINDMAN WORKING 45TH STREET.
text: CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.
text: BIALYSTOCK DROPS A STEP BEHIND, QUICKLY TAKES OFF HIS HAT
text: AND FLINGS IT THROUGH THE AIR.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (pointing to his hat)
dialog: My hat.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: I'll get it.
dialog: 27.

scene_heading: BIALYSTOCK DETOURS SLIGHTLY TOWARD MURRAY THE BLINDMAN, WHO
text: WEARS A LARGE CARDBOARD SIGN WITH THE LEGEND: "MURRAY THE

text: BIALYSTOCK REACHES DOWN INTO HIS CUP AND GRABS A FIST FULL
text: OF COINS.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Murray, I'm going to lunch. I took
dialog: two dollars.
scene_heading: MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
dialog: Okay, Bialy, that makes six eighty
dialog: you owe me.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: I know. Don't worry. You'll get
dialog: it. You'll get it.
scene_heading: MURRAY THE BLINDMAN
dialog: (tapping his way along)
dialog: Well, don't forget about it. I
dialog: need it. Nobody understands. I'm
dialog: competing with giants. The Greater
dialog: New York Fund. The March of Dimes.
dialog: The Community Chest. They're
dialog: driving me out of business.
text: BLOOM COMES DASHING BACK WITH HAT IN HAND.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
text: HE PROFFERS HAT TO BIALYSTOCK. BIALYSTOCK TAKES IT.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Thank you, Leo. And call me Max.
dialog: You know, I don't let everybody
dialog: call me Max. It's only people I
dialog: really like.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (trying it on)
dialog: Okay ... Max! And you can call me
dialog: Leo.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: I already have. Come on.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Oh.

speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Where would you like to eat?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Well, Max, I don't know, Max. What
dialog: do you think, Max?
text: BIALYSTOCK QUIETLY WINCES AT THE SURFEIT OF MAX.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Let me see ... it's such a beautiful
dialog: day. Why waste it indoors. I've
dialog: got it! Let's go to Coney Island!
dialog: We'll lunch at the sea shore.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Coney Island??
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: What's the matter, Leo? Don't you
dialog: like Coney Island?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: I ... I love it. I haven't been
dialog: there since I was a kid. But it's
dialog: nearly two o'clock. I really
dialog: should be getting back to Whitehall
dialog: and Marks.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and
dialog: Marks are concerned, you're working
dialog: with Bialystock, right?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Then stick with Bialystock!

dialog: Two pistachios, my good man.
speaker_heading: CUSTARD MAN

speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Everybody's a big shot.
dialog: (turns to Bloom)
dialog: Well, Leo, are you having a good
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: I don't know. I think so. I feel
dialog: very strange.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK

speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Yes. That's it. Happy. Well,
dialog: whatta ya think of that. Happy.

dialog: turn-kick-turn! It's enough to
dialog: make you throw up! At last a
dialog: chance to do straight drama! To
dialog: deal with conflict, with inner
dialog: truth. Roger De Bris presents
dialog: history. Of course, I think we
dialog: should add a little music. That
dialog: whole third act has got to go.
dialog: They're losing the war. It's too
dialog: depressing. We'll have to put
dialog: something in there.

speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: I am the author of this play. You

speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: (with hysterical conviction)
dialog: I'm turning myself in. It's the

dialog: library. So long.
dialog: 82.

speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: They are? Have you ever eaten with

speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Liebkind, no!
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (to Bloom)
dialog: What are you doing? We're trapped.

text: BLOOM HANDS FUSE TO LIEBKIND.
text: LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS KNAPSACK, TAKES OUT LITTLE BLACK
text: METAL BOX WITH TWO TERMINAL CAPS AT EITHER END AND SETS IT
scene_heading: DOWN ON CELLAR FLOOR.
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
text: Now ve take the two fuse leads,

dialog: female. But electricity is strange.
dialog: It's male to male.
text: HE QUICKLY FINISHES THE CONNECTION.
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: Sehr gut.

speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: I must find out. It is critical.
text: HE STRIKES THE MATCH AND LIGHTS THE FUSE. WHOOSH! IT
text: IGNITES. THE SPARKS RUSH TOWARD THE MASTER CONNECTION.
text: LIEBKIND CHARGES DOWN THE STAIRS AND CHASES AFTER THE QUICK
text: BURNING FUSE FOR ALL HE'S WORTH. HE CATCHES UP WITH IT JUST
text: BEFORE IT REACHES THE MASTER CONNECTION AND QUICKLY STAMPS
speaker_heading: IT OUT.
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: Let's face it. That was dumb.
text: HE TROTS BACK.

dialog: We assumed that.
text: LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND SHOWS THEM A ROLL OF
speaker_heading: FUSE.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: Here. You see. This is the slow
text: fuse. It is much wider. It has
dialog: more resistance, more density.
text: Therefore, it burns slower.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: You mean you had the slow fuse in
dialog: your pocket all the time and you
dialog: forgot to put it on?
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: Yes. Amazing isn't it?

speaker_heading: BACK.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: The coast is clear!
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: Good. Get down.
dialog: 92.
text: BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS.

speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: Goodbye, my foolish fancy. Goodbye,
dialog: my misbegotten child. Goodbye, my
text: tortured testament of twisted truths.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Do it! Do it!
text: LIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE. HE STARTS AND STOPS.
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: I can't. I can't do it. It's a
dialog: demon. It's a gargoyle, it's a
dialog: monster... but it's still my child.
scene_heading: HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY. BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE
text: AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN.
text: HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN
scene_heading: ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION. NOTHING HAPPENS. AFTER A
text: WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (quizzically)
dialog: Nothing.
text: LIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES
speaker_heading: DETONATOR.
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: Here is gut... of course, of course.
dialog: In electricity, it's always male to
dialog: female. But with people, it's not
dialog: always so. Come ve must go back.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: Do you need us?
speaker_heading: LIEBKIND
dialog: Of course I need you. It's dark in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Okay, okay. Let's not waste time.

speaker_heading: JUDGE

speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: Thank you, your honor. Max
dialog: Bialystock is a very selfish man.
speaker_heading: BIALYSTOCK
dialog: (whispers to Bloom)
dialog: Don't help me.
speaker_heading: BLOOM
dialog: He's a liar and a cheat and a
dialog: scoundrel. He's taken money from
dialog: little old ladies. He's talked
dialog: people into doing things they never
dialog: would have dreamed of. Especially
dialog: me. But who has he really hurt?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: BLOOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are the victims? Not me, I had
