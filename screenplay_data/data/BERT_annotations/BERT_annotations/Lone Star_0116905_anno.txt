text: Two men in shorts and Hawaiian shirts are poking around a
text: sandy section in the middle of scrub flats. SERGEANT CLIFF
text: POTTS is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as
text: SERGEANT "MIKEY" HOGAN works a metal detector over a large,
text: sandy bank in the b.g. Both are Army career men with a
text: morning off to pursue their hobbies.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: We got ocotillo, devil's walking
dialog: stick--what's this stuff--it's that
dialog: whattayoucallit--horse-crippler.
text: Mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it
text: in a canvas bag slung on his hip.
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: This place is a gold mine.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Lead mine.
text: MIKEY sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off.
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: It's a lead mine.
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: I don't know why I'm talking to you,
dialog: you've got that thing on your head.
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: You finding lots of cactus and shit?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: It's not just cactus. There's the
dialog: nopals, the yuccas--
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: (Puts headset on)
dialog: Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (Grumbles)
dialog: Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties

text: from a prickly pear.
speaker_heading: MIKEY

dialog: Cliff--
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: You live in a place, you should know

speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: Cliff--
speaker_heading: CU MIKEY
text: MIKEY in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls

speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: Cliff, you gotta look at this--
text: Cliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Don't tell me--Spanish treasure,
dialog: right? Pieces of eight from the
dialog: Coronado expedition--
text: He stops by Mikey and looks down, his expression changing
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Jesus--
scene_heading: GROUND -- CU BONES
text: Sticking out from the sand bank are the SKELETAL BONES of a
text: MAN'S HAND. There is a ring on one finger.
speaker_heading: MIKEY (O.S.)
dialog: Was Coronado in the Masons?
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD -- DAY
text: A distant cloud of DUST appears on the horizon MUSIC
text: underscores that we are in Texas, and we SUPERIMPOSE the
text: OPENING CREDITS as the dust takes form around an APPROACHING
text: CAR. The car comes close enough to see it has a County
text: Sheriff's insignia on the side.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: We see SAM DEEDS, the Sheriff, driving. Sam is 40, quietly
text: competent to the point of seeming a bit moody. He sees
text: something up ahead.
text: MUSIC, CREDITS END as Sam pulls off the road and we see the
text: sergeants standing in the scrub.
scene_heading: EXT. SCRUB -- DAY -- BONES
text: The hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are
text: visible now.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Cliff stands looking at the arm with Sam. MIKEY is a few
text: yards behind them, playing with his metal detector. Beyond
text: him we see the Sheriff's car parked.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I was driving back from Apache Wells
dialog: when they got me on the radio.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: This was a rifle range way back when.
dialog: But we figured it isn't Army land
dialog: anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (Nods)
dialog: I've got the forensics fella coming
dialog: down from the Rangers. No way to
dialog: know how old the body is without
dialog: some lab work.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: That ring--
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Masons been around a long while.
text: Mikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal
dialog: detector.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Treasure hunter?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (Apologetic)
dialog: Old bullets. He uhm-- makes art
dialog: with them.
text: Sam just nods. Mikey frowns, goes down on one knee and
text: scratches something out of the dirt at their feet--
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch
dialog: anything,
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: (To Sam)
dialog: He can't hear with that rig on--
dialog: Mikey!
text: Mikey comes up with something, holds it before them. An
text: encrusted piece of metal--
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: What've we got here?
text: Sam takes the thing, lays it back down where Mikey found it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: S'posed to leave everything right
dialog: where we found it. They're real
dialog: particular about that.
speaker_heading: MIKEY
text: The scene of the crime.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No telling yet if there's been a
dialog: crime.
text: Sam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CU METAL
text: Sam's thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal. It
text: is roughly star-shaped.
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: But this country's seen a good number
dialog: of disagreements over the years.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY -- TEXAS MAP
text: We look at a beautiful old pull-down map of Texas.
speaker_heading: PILAR (O.S.)
dialog: We do the best we can here--
text: A teacher in her late 30s, PILAR CRUZ, steps in front of the
text: map and we FOLLOW her across the room, carrying a poster
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: --but hey, public education these
text: days is a bit of a battleground.
text: Posters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from
dialog: Texas history-- Sam Houston, Stephen Austin, Juan Seguin. A
text: new parent, CELIE PAYNE, stands in the middle of the otherwise
text: empty classroom.
speaker_heading: CELIE
dialog: He went to school on base when we
dialog: were in Okinawa. It's all--you know--
text: kids in the same boat--Army brats.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: His record shows that he's a good
dialog: student.
speaker_heading: CELIE
dialog: I'm more worried about the social
dialog: thing. Are therelike--gangs, or...?
text: PILAR starts to put the poster up. CELIE moves to hold it in
dialog: place for her.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: We haven't had any serious violence,
dialog: if that's what you mean. We've got a
dialog: pretty lively mix though--you walk
text: into the cafeteria and the Anglo
dialog: kids are in one section, the Mexican
dialog: kids in another and the Black kids
dialog: have a table in the back--thanks--
speaker_heading: CELIE
dialog: So Blacks are--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: They're the smallest group except
dialog: for a couple Kickapoo kids. Look,
dialog: you're obviously a concerned parent.
dialog: Chet has no history of getting into
dialog: trouble--I'm happy to have him in my
dialog: class.
text: She steps back to see if the poster, an old photo of Geronimo,
text: looks straight. Another teacher, MOLLY sticks her head in
dialog: the door--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (Uncomfortable)
dialog: Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Okay? He's not here?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No. Is he sick?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: (Mutters)

scene_heading: EXT. STREET -- DAY -- CU VAQUERO PICTURE
text: On the door of a deluxe pickup truck is an airbrushed picture
text: of a Pancho Villa-looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing
text: his chest and a gun blazing in each hand. We hear LOUD MUSIC--
speaker_heading: AMADO (O.S.)
dialog: Luis! Give me that Phillips-head
dialog: back--
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: A small group of teenage Chicano BOYS hang around the truck
text: in the bed, on the hood, leaning against it. A BOOMBOX placed
text: on top of the cab blasts RANCHA MUSIC out at the neighborhood.
text: Somebody's legs are hanging out the open passenger-side door.
text: The kids suddenly look as a Sheriff's Department car slides
text: into the f.g. A Deputy Sheriff, TRAVIS, gets out.
speaker_heading: KIDS
text: Trying to look tough and unworried as we TRACK across the
text: street toward them. Travis's hand reaches out from behind
text: the camera to flick the MUSIC OFF.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP
text: AMADO CRUZ, Pilar's 15-year-old son, lies on the front seat
text: installing a compact disc player into the dash slot. He

dialog: Somebody hand me the CD player--
dialog: damelo pendejos--
text: He looks up and we TILT to see Travis leaning in the window,
dialog: examining the new radio
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: They come a long way from those old
dialog: 8-track jobs, haven't they?
speaker_heading: AMADO
dialog: Something wrong?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (Waves radio)
dialog: This is stolen property. Alla you

scene_heading: INT. CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE
text: Sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent
text: immigrant, ENRIQUE, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos
text: to a booth. MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the b.g. We
text: HOLD on the booth, where HOLLIS POGUE, in his 60s entertains
dialog: two GOOD OLD BOYS--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
text: So Buddy walks up to the porch and
dialog: there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin'
text: the dirt out his toenails with a
dialog: pocketknife--he was the most hygienic
dialog: of all the McHenrys--
text: The breakfast companions are laughing already--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
text: "Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet
dialog: way of his, "What you know about
dialog: them tires that went missing from
dialog: markets?" Fishbait thinks for a
text: minute, then he lifts up a loose
text: board from the porch floor and calls
dialog: down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter,
dialog: they caught us!"
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: He known who it was onnacouna the
text: tire tracks in the dirt from the
text: back of the garage to where they
text: loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says,
dialog: "never lifted a thing in this world
dialog: if there was a way he could roll
dialog: it."
dialog: More laughter--
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Won't be another like him. That boy
dialog: of his doesn't come near it. You ask
dialog: me, he's all hat and no cattle
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: Fellas--
text: We WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth. No telling how
text: long he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Sam! I was just telling a few about
dialog: your old man.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: He was a unique individual.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, he was that.
dialog: We sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Big day coming up--I wish we'd have
dialog: thought of it while he was still
dialog: living. But he went so unexpected.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Better late than never. Korean War
dialog: hero, Sheriff for near thirty years--
dialog: Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers.
dialog: Danny Padilla from the Sentinel,
dialog: that crowd.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Every other damn thing in the country
dialog: is called after Martin Luther King,
dialog: they can't let our side have one
dialog: measly park?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Bad enough all the street names are
dialog: in Spanish--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They were here first.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Then name it after Big Chief
dialog: Shitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa
text: fella was. He had the Mexes beat by
dialog: centuries.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: There was a faction pulling for that
dialog: boy who was killed in the Gulf War--
dialog: Ruben--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: --Santiago.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Right. But nobody here ever noticed
text: him till they read his name on the
dialog: national news--
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: They just wanted it to be one of
dialog: theirs--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: That's not the whole story. The
dialog: Mexicans that know, that remember,
dialog: understand what Buddy was for their
dialog: people. Hell, it was Mercedes over
dialog: there who swung the deciding vote
dialog: for him.
text: Sam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, MERCEDES
text: CRUZ, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. She seems
text: to be avoiding looking toward him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That so?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: She put it even at three to three,
dialog: so as the Mayor I get to cast the
dialog: tiebreaker. The older generation
dialog: won't have any problem with it. They
dialog: remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff,
dialog: that it was all 'cause he took their
dialog: part.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Tell that one, Hollis--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Hell, everybody heard that story a
dialog: million times.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'd like to hear it. Your version of
dialog: it.
text: Something about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Go ahead, Hollis.
speaker_heading: CU HOLLIS
text: Hollis is hooked into it now--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: The two of us were the only deputies
dialog: back then me and Buddy--it's what--
dialog: '58--
speaker_heading: FENTON (O.S.)
dialog: '57, 1 believe--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: And the Sheriff at the time was Big
dialog: Charley Wade. Charley was one of
dialog: your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets
dialog: kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy
text: bite out of whatever moved through
dialog: this county.
text: He looks down at the table--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: It was in here one night, back when
dialog: Jimmy Herrera run the place. Started
dialog: right here in this booth.
text: We PAN down to the table, The food has changed. The tortillas
text: are in a straw basket instead of plastic. The jukebox changes
text: to ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly. A hand with a
text: big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla--
text: underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills. The hand lifts
text: them up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE,
text: a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. It is 1957--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (Grins)
dialog: This beaner fare doesn't agree with
dialog: me, but the price sure is right.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Wade sits across from his young deputies, YOUNG HOLLIS (30s)
text: and BUDDY DEEDS (20s). A chicken-fried steak sits untouched
text: in front of Buddy. Hollis has the anxious look of an errand
text: boy, while Buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for
dialog: his age.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: WADE
text: Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks,
dialog: most of 'em relatives. People breed
dialog: like chickens.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I roust some muchacho on the street,
dialog: doesn't have his papers, all he got
dialog: to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy
dialog: Herrera."
text: Wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You got to keep the wheels greased,
dialog: son. Sheriff does his job right,
dialog: everybody makes out. Now this is
dialog: gonna be one of your pickups, Buddy.
dialog: First of the month, just like the
dialog: rent. Get the car, Hollis.
text: Wade and Hollis slide out of the booth to stand.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'm not doing it.
text: Hollis stops a few feet away, shocked. Wade just stares down
dialog: at Buddy.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Come again?
text: Buddy looks Wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: It's your deal. You sweated it out
dialog: of him, you pick it up.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: There's gonna be some left over for
dialog: you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That's not the point.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him
dialog: tell you the size of the mordida
dialog: they took out of his hide when he
dialog: run a place on the other side. Those
dialog: old boys in Ciudad Leon--
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'm not picking it up.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You do whatever I say you do or else
dialog: you put it on the trail, son.
text: The CUSTOMERS are all watching now, nervous. Buddy thinks
text: for a moment, not taking his eyes off Wade.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: How 'bout this--how 'bout you put
dialog: that shield on this table and vanish
dialog: before you end up dead or in jail?
text: Wade rests his hand on his pistol. It is dead silent but
text: for the MUSIC on the box.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You ever shoot anybody was looking
dialog: you in the eye?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Who said anything about shootin'
dialog: anybody?
text: Buddy has his gun out under the table. He slowly brings it
text: up and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it
text: or his eyes off Wade.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Whole different story; isn't it?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You're fired. You're outta the
dialog: department.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: There's not a soul in this county
dialog: isn't sick to death of your bullshit,
dialog: Charley. You made yourself scarce,
dialog: you could make a lot of people happy.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You little pissant--
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Now or later, Charley. You won't
dialog: have any trouble finding me.
text: Wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction. He
text: leans close to Buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You're a dead man.
text: He turns and nearly bumps into Hollis. He gives the Deputy a
dialog: shove.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Get the goddamn car. We're going to
dialog: Roderick's.
speaker_heading: CU BUDDY
text: He watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then
text: holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing
text: had happened. He calls softly--
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Muchacho--mas cerveza por favor.
text: He looks up at somebody and we PAN till we see Sam, still
text: standing over the booth, listening. We are back in 1995--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (O.S.)
dialog: "Mas cerveza por favor."
speaker_heading: FENTON (O.S.)
dialog: That Buddy was a cool breeze.
text: We PULL BACK to see Hollis and his buddies at the table,
text: eating their lunches as they listen.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Charley Wade were known to have put
text: a good number of people in the ground,
dialog: and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: We made our collection at Roderick's
dialog: place and that was the last anybody
dialog: seen hide nor hair of him. He went
text: missing the next day, along with ten
dialog: thousand dollars in county funds
text: from the safe at the jail.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Never heard from him again?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
text: Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Buddy Deeds said a thing, he damn
dialog: well backed it up. Won't be another
dialog: like him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's
dialog: people and sent 'em back to the other
dialog: side?
text: Hollis sees what Sam is getting at, grins--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Oh--he come to an accommodation.
dialog: Money doesn't always need to change
text: hands to keep the wheels turning.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Look, I know you had some problems
dialog: with your father, and he and Muriel--
dialog: well--
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Your mother was a saint.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: --but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
text: Sam nods, speaks softly--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Won't be another like him.

scene_heading: REAR OF AUDITORIUM
text: PALOMA CRUZ, Pilar's teenage daughter, peeks into the room,
text: then moves down the side toward the stage.
speaker_heading: ANGLO FATHER
dialog: You may call it history, but I call
dialog: it propaganda. I'm sure they got
dialog: their own account of the Alamo on
dialog: the other side, but we're not on the
dialog: other side, so we're not about to
dialog: have it taught in our schools!
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: There's no reason to be so threatened
dialog: by this--
text: Pilar is trying to stay calm despite her anger.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I've only been trying to get across
dialog: some of the complexity of our
dialog: situation down here--cultures coming
dialog: together in both negative and positive
dialog: ways.
speaker_heading: ANGLO MOTHER (O.S.)
dialog: If you mean like music and food and

speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: We shoot past Pilar toward the parents in their seats. PALOMA

speaker_heading: ANGLO MOTHER
dialog: --but when you start changing who

speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: We're not changing anything, we're
text: presenting a more complete picture.
speaker_heading: ANGLO MOTHER
dialog: And that's what's got to stop!
text: Pilar looks troubled by what she's heard. She shoots a look
text: toward the others at the table, then slips away with Paloma--
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: There's enough ignorance in the world
dialog: without us encouraging it in the
dialog: classroom--
speaker_heading: ANGLO MOTHER
dialog: Now who are you calling ignorant?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Folks, I know this is a very emotional

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay--we'll take a statement from

text: Otis over at the club.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Any poop on the John Doe you found

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: CU SAM
dialog: Wonders what she's doing there--
speaker_heading: SAM'S POV -- PILAR
text: She stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable
dialog: to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around

text: harsh overhead light.
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: Pilar.
speaker_heading: PILAR AND SAM
text: Pilar looks around. Sam is standing by her. We can tell there

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Something wrong?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: They've got my Amado.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: PILAR

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: ATHENA

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: SAM

text: Travis looks at his booking sheets--
speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They tell me you're good at fixing

dialog: Nothin--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your father was a hell of a mechanic.
dialog: Still nothing--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You know, if you figure minimum wage
dialog: on the time most thieves spend in
dialog: jail, they could have bought most
dialog: everything they stole.
speaker_heading: AMADO
dialog: I didn't steal anything.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I didn't say you did. My name is

speaker_heading: MIKEY

speaker_heading: DEL

speaker_heading: CLIFF

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Everybody on the border knows that

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You got a cause of death?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Skull was intact, no soft tissue
dialog: left--not much to go on.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So he could have gone out to the

text: into the dirt on the old rifle range
dialog: and had a heart attack.

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So is Buddy on your short list?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: If it was some poor mojado, swam

dialog: wouldn't go any further. But this is

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You got to investigate. No question
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What I will do is keep names out of

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.

speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Charley? I believe he was. Used to

speaker_heading: SAM
text: All it was wearing was a big old

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You don't remember anything else

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: there?
dialog: Hollis makes a great show of considering--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Besides my father, I mean.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: There's no call for that, Sam. Fella

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: We got that dedication tomorrow.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: People have worked this whole big

dialog: want to believe he couldn't do it.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: And I understand why you might want

text: This is a low blow, but accurate enough to shake Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: HOLLIS

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: MINNIE

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I know you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
dialog: Name's Otis.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Otis what?
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
dialog: Payne.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Why you think that was?
text: Otis feels people watching. He doesn't want to lose face--
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
dialog: Some crop needed pickin' and the man
dialog: was shorthanded.
dialog: A very insolent answer for the time and place--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: As I remember it was because he had
text: a sassy mouth on him. Must run in
dialog: the family--You wouldn't be runnin'
dialog: numbers out of this club, now, would
dialog: you, son?
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
dialog: Runnin' numbers illegal.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Runnin' numbers without I know about
dialog: it is both illegal and unhealthy.
dialog: You remember that.
text: The beer is poured. Otis starts away--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Whoah, son. You're not finished.
dialog: Pour his.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOLLIS
dialog: I prefer it in the bottle--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Shut up, Hollis. Pour.
text: Otis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: How come you don't took familiar?
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
dialog: Been away. Up to Houston.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Houston, huh? I hear they let you
text: boys run wild up there.
text: No response. Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer
text: splashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Aw--look what you done now. Better
dialog: get something to wipe it up, son.
text: Half the people in the room are watching now, the other half
text: moving away to relative safety. Otis tries to keep a lid on
text: his temper, looks around the room--
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
dialog: You spilt it, you wipe it up.
text: Wade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I told you to do something. Are you
dialog: gonna hop to it, or are we gonna
dialog: have a problem?
text: Otis is starting to shake, but holds his ground--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Don't want to turn tail in front of
dialog: your people. I understand.
text: He starts to turn away then WHAP! brings the butt of his
text: pistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. A
text: woman SCREAMS and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen
text: over, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at
dialog: his face--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Come on, Houston, give it a try!
dialog: Come to Poppa--
text: RODERICK is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture
text: of peace, as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar,
dialog: petrified--
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just
dialog: a bit slow, is all. He don't mean
dialog: nothin' by it--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: That the problem, son? You Slow?
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
text: Otis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything--
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: You got him too scared to peep,
dialog: Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun
dialog: up--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You telling me what to do, Roderick?
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: No, Sheriff, I'm just--
text: Wade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What's this I see? Is that whiskey
dialog: in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick,
dialog: I'm gonna have to cite you for a
dialog: violation of state law--
speaker_heading: RODERICK
dialog: This is a club, Sheriff--you been in
dialog: here--
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: And people better clear out of here!
dialog: Now!
text: A few people start for the exit. Wade swivels and BLAM sends
text: a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind
text: the bar. People run for the door. Wade squats down to look
dialog: Otis in the face--
speaker_heading: CU WADE
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You learn how to act your place,
dialog: son. This idn't Houston.
text: He stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar--
speaker_heading: OTIS (V.O.)
dialog: 'Course I was young and full of beans
dialog: then--
text: The camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands
text: Otis, PRESENT DAY, reminiscing. We are back in '95--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I didn't understand the spot I was
text: putting Roderick in.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And that was the last time you saw
dialog: him?
text: We SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Oh--I think he came in one more time
dialog: with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy
dialog: wasn't with them. Made their monthly
dialog: pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just
dialog: kept my mouth good and shut and handed
text: over that envelope.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That was the night he disappeared?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (Shakes his head)
dialog: Could of been. That was white people's
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And when my father was Sheriff?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What was your deal with him?
text: Otis smiles, chooses his words carefully--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Buddy was more a part of the big
dialog: picture--county political machine,
dialog: chamber of commerce, zoning board if
dialog: I kept those people happy, he was
dialog: pretty much on my side.
dialog: (Smiles)
dialog: Whenever somebody thought--they start
dialog: up another bar for the black folks,
dialog: they'd be--how should I put this?
dialog: They'd be officially discouraged.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He ever accept cash for a favor?
text: Otis smiles, looks away to ponder his response--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I don't recall a prisoner ever died
dialog: in your father's custody. I don't
dialog: recall a man in this town--Black,
dialog: White, Mexican--who'd hesitate a
dialog: minute before they'd call on Buddy
dialog: Deeds to solve a problem. More than
dialog: that I wouldn't like to say.

speaker_heading: PILAR

speaker_heading: PILAR

dialog: (Softly)
dialog: I gonna meet that family of yours?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Why would you want to do that?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Because I'm your father.
text: Del gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between
text: them. He gets up and heads for the door--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: You'll get official notification
dialog: when I make my decision. He is out
text: the door--Otis pulls himself a beer
text: as Carolyn steps back out--
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: So that's him--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Yeah--that's him. Got two, three

speaker_heading: H.L. (O.S.)
dialog: Sheriff!
text: We WIDEN as H.L. and Jorge catch up to him. H.L. slaps Sam
dialog: on the back--
dialog: H.L.
dialog: Historic occasion, isn't it?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Seems like we have another one every
dialog: week.
dialog: H.L.
dialog: Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce
dialog: boys got to keep things hummin'--
speaker_heading: JORGE

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: Sam--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You ought to put up a banner--
dialog: "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut-

dialog: H.L.
dialog: That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Rather have that than the ten-foot-
dialog: high catfish statue--
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel
dialog: to kill that story.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The Perdido thing?
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Danny's gonna be out for blood the
dialog: next time.
dialog: H.L.
dialog: Which is why we need to talk to you
dialog: about the new jail--just so we're
text: all on the same page.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We don't need a new jail.
dialog: H.L.
dialog: That's a matter of interpretation--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We're already renting cells to the
dialog: Feds for their overflow--
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: There was a mandate in the last
dialog: election--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It wouldn't happen to be your
dialog: construction company gonna get the
dialog: bid on building this thing, would
dialog: it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be
dialog: thinking about a couple dozen new
dialog: jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
dialog: H.L.
dialog: Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned
dialog: about crime--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We need a drug rehab program, we
dialog: need a new elementary school--
speaker_heading: JORGE
dialog: There isn't money allocated for that.
dialog: But a jail--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look, I'm not gonna campaign against
dialog: your deal here, but if anybody asks
dialog: me, I got to tell them the truth. We--
dialog: don't--need--a new jail.
dialog: H.L.
dialog: When we backed you--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: When you backed me you needed
dialog: somebody named Deeds to bump the
dialog: other fella out of office. Hey,
dialog: folks--
text: Sam and the others smile as they reach the CROWD of

text: Photographers from the paper and a local TV news crew wait

scene_heading: INT. MIKEY'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING
text: We start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old

text: Mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book
text: propped open in front of him. Cliff sits at the worktable
text: playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from MIKEY'S
dialog: bag
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: Never thought I'd see the day a buddy
dialog: of mine was dating a woman with three
text: up and three down on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: I think it's beyond what you'd call
dialog: dating.
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: You going to get married?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: (Shrugs)
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: You met her family? They gonna be
dialog: cool about you being a white guy?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Priscilla says they think any woman
dialog: over 30 who isn't married must be a
dialog: lesbian. She figures they'll be so
dialog: relieved I'm a man--
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: Always heartwarming to see a prejudice
text: defeated by a deeper prejudice. But
dialog: marriage, man--I did two tours in
dialog: Southeast Asia and I was married for
dialog: five years--I couldn't tell you which
dialog: experience was worse.
text: Cliff picks up a slug--
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Hey, Mikey--
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: I knew she was Japanese going into
dialog: it, but she didn't tell me the ninja
dialog: assassin part--
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Mikey--
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: Her parents acted like I was gonna
dialog: blow my nose on their curtains--
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Mikey--
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: If I stayed out past ten with the
dialog: guys she'd go into her Madame
dialog: Butterfly routine--
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Mikey look at this--
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with
dialog: bullets here.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: It's a .45.
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: This is the stuff we picked up the

dialog: is all .30 caliber--
speaker_heading: MIKEY
dialog: They were using M-1's, yeah--
speaker_heading: CLIFF

scene_heading: EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Sometime in the early '70s a reporter
dialog: from a national magazine was talking
dialog: to the governor of our Lone Star
dialog: state, and he asked him, "Governor,
dialog: what's your ideal of what a real
dialog: Texan ought to be?" Governor said,
dialog: "That's easy, son- you just go down
dialog: to Rio County and get a look at
dialog: Sheriff Buddy Deeds."
dialog: Applause--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Watching the crowd--
speaker_heading: SAM'S POV
text: We PAN with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to
text: Danny and a couple of Chicano friends, looking grim. We RACK
text: FOCUS beyond them to see Pilar, watching the ceremony from a
dialog: few yards back--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (O.S.)
dialog: Thank you. We've got one more person
dialog: to hear from--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: --and he's somebody who probably
dialog: knew Buddy better than any of us,
dialog: Sam--would you say a few words?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Not thrilled to be called on. He steps forward reluctantly
dialog: to APPLAUSE--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You folks who remember my father
dialog: knew him as Sheriff. But at home he
dialog: was also judge, jury
text: He looks to Hollis--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: --and executioner.
text: LAUGHTER. Sam holds Hollis's eyes for a moment before
dialog: continuing--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is a real honor you're doing
dialog: him today, and if Buddy was around
dialog: I'm sure his hat size would be gettin'
text: bigger every minute.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Watching--
speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: I used to come to this park to hide
dialog: from him. Now that you're putting
dialog: his name on it--
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll have to find someplace new to
dialog: duck out.
scene_heading: More LAUGHTER--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I do appreciate it, and wherever he
dialog: is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice
dialog: for the bunch of you. Thank you.
speaker_heading: APPLAUSE--
text: Sam steps back and Mercedes steps forward with her scissors
dialog: without looking at him--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: And now my fellow Council member and
dialog: one of Frontera's most respected
dialog: businesswomen, Mrs. Mercedes Cruz,
dialog: will do the honors for us.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
text: She freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten
text: their shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that
dialog: lets the cloth drop--
speaker_heading: STATUE
text: The cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a
text: block of smooth limestone. A decent likeness of Buddy in
text: uniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking
text: boy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully.
dialog: APPLAUSE from the gathering--
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Watching, a bit removed, as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge
text: and H.L. and Hollis for the cameras. He overhears a pair of
text: BYSTANDERS who are checking out the statue--
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER 1 (O.S.)
text: It does look like old Buddy.
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER 2 (O.S.)
dialog: Runnin that kid in for loiterin'--
text: The bystanders LAUGH--Sam steps away, intercepting Mercedes
text: as she steps away--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.
text: Mercedes just looks at him, keeps going. His gaze brings him
text: to Pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Steps over from the dispersing crowd--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Field trip?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Lunch hour. My next class isn't till
text: nine-thirty.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Want to take a walk?
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE -- DAY
text: Sam and PILAR walk together alongside the Rio--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your mother still doesn't like me.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I can't name anybody she does like
dialog: these days.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I see she built a place up here by
dialog: the river.
speaker_heading: PILAR
text: A real palace. She rattles around
dialog: alone in that thing--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She's done well for herself--on her
dialog: own and all--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: So she tells me three times a week.
text: She looks at him--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I thought you got through that pretty
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They cooked the whole thing up without
dialog: asking me.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: People liked him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Most people did, yeah.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I remember him watching me once.
dialog: When I was little--before you and I--
text: She shrugs.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I was on the playground with all the
dialog: other kids, but I thought he was
dialog: only looking at me. I was afraid he
dialog: was going to arrest me--he had those
dialog: eyes, you know--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Weird what you remember.
text: They walk in silence a moment--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your boy, there--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Amado.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nice-looking kid.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: He hates me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No--
speaker_heading: PILAR
text: With Paloma, it's more like she pities
dialog: and tolerates me- totally age-
dialog: appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's
dialog: never been book-smart. Had a hard
dialog: time learning to read. Me being a
dialog: teacher and caring about those things
dialog: is like an embarrassment--like a
dialog: betrayal.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fernando did okay, and he dropped
dialog: out--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Fernando wasn't pissed off at
dialog: everybody. He just wanted to fix
dialog: their cars.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It might just be the age. I spent my
dialog: first fifteen years trying to be
dialog: just like Buddy and the next fifteen
text: trying to give him a heart attack.
text: She looks at him--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: So why did you come back here, Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work
dialog: for my father-in-law anymore. The
dialog: fellas down here said they'd back me--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: You don't want to be Sheriff.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I got to admit it's not what I thought
dialog: it'd be. Back When Buddy had it--
dialog: hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60-
text: room hotel with bars on the windows.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: It can happen so sudden, can't it?
dialog: Being left out on your own.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You've got your mother, your kids--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: They've got me. Different thing.
text: They stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Remember this?
text: Pilar looks at the spot. She isn't ready to deal with whatever
dialog: memory it brings back--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I should get back.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Pilar--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Looks real bad if the teacher's late
dialog: for class. It's really nice to talk
dialog: with you, Sam.
text: She waves and walks away, feeling awkward. Sam watches for a
text: minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at
dialog: the water.
speaker_heading: RIVER SURFACE
text: A little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and
text: drifts away with the current. We TILT UP to see YOUNG PILAR

speaker_heading: YOUNG SAM
dialog: You going to tell her?
speaker_heading: YOUNG PILAR
dialog: You going to tell him?
speaker_heading: YOUNG SAM
dialog: He doesn't need to know all my
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PILAR
dialog: He's gonna find out.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SAM
dialog: So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
text: Young Pilar frowns, tosses more bark--
speaker_heading: YOUNG PILAR
dialog: It's supposed to be some big sin,
dialog: even if you love each other.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SAM
dialog: You believe that?
scene_heading: CU YOUNG PILAR
text: She turns to look at him--
speaker_heading: YOUNG PILAR
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: PILAR

speaker_heading: AMADO

speaker_heading: AMADO
dialog: They're not going to jail.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew

speaker_heading: AMADO
dialog: Just some rich Anglo out on the lake.
dialog: Don't even live here all year.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: That makes it okay?
speaker_heading: AMADO

speaker_heading: AMADO

speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: That isn't true.
speaker_heading: AMADO
dialog: Oh, come on--you and Grandma think

speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: If you grew up to he anywhere near

speaker_heading: AMADO
dialog: And what did she do?
speaker_heading: PILAR

speaker_heading: CHUCHO

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: WESLEY

dialog: That and your mother. 'Course he had

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You know who it was?
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: The other one? Hell, at my age, every

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: HOLLIS

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think somewhere between Roderick

speaker_heading: CHET

dialog: He a Black man or an Indian?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (Steps in)
dialog: Both.
text: Otis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: He was part of the Seminole Nation,
dialog: got pushed down into the Everglades
dialog: in pioneer days. African people who
dialog: run off from the slaveholders hooked
dialog: up with them, married up, had
dialog: children. When the Spanish give up
text: Florida, the U.S.Army come down to
dialog: move all them Indian peoples off to
dialog: Oklahoma--
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: The Trail of Tears.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (Smiles)
dialog: They teaching that now? Good. Only
dialog: a couple of 'em held out--this man,
text: John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat,
dialog: and a fella name of Osceola. Army
dialog: put all of them in prison and Osceola
text: died, but them other two escaped and
text: put together a fighting band and
dialog: held out another ten, fifteen years.
dialog: Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops
dialog: at Lake Okeechobee.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: So they stayed in Florida?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: They got tired of fighting, went to
dialog: the Indian Territories for a while.
dialog: But the slave-raiders were on 'em
dialog: even there, and one night they packed
dialog: up and nearly the whole band rode
text: down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle
dialog: Pass.
text: They move on to some photos of very African-looking people
dialog: dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Men worked for Santa Anna down there,
dialog: waited out the Civil War. The land
dialog: wasn't much to feed people on, so in
text: 1870 they come north and put up at
dialog: Fort Duncan and the men joined up
dialog: what was called the Seminole Negro
dialog: Indian Scouts. Best trackers either
text: side of the border. Bandits, rustlers,
dialog: Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: They fought against the Indians?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Same as they done in Mexico.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: But they were Indians themselves.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: They were in the Army. Like your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (Surprised)
dialog: You know who I am?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I got a pretty good guess.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: That guy who got shot--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: You didn't go telling your father
dialog: you were here?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Are you kidding? And face a court-
dialog: martial?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (Smiles)
dialog: He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: No sports if I don't keep a B average,
dialog: no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
speaker_heading: OTIS
speaker_heading: PDA?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Public Display of Affection. Every
dialog: time he moves up a rank, it's like
dialog: he's got to tighten the screws a
dialog: little more--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Well--
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you
dialog: know--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Didn't have a father?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (Shrugs)
text: He's still pissed off about it.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: When you're his age you'll still be
text: pissed off about him.
text: Chet nods, looks around--
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: So how come you got into all this?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: These are our people. There were
dialog: Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras
dialog: Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit--
dialog: Congressional Medal Of Honor--
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: So I'm part-Indian?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: By blood you are. But blood only
dialog: means what you let it.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: My father says the day you're born
dialog: you start from scratch, no breaks
dialog: and no excuses, and you got to pull

speaker_heading: OTIS

speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: No, sir--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Then how would you explain the fact
dialog: that out of one hundred twenty people
dialog: we tested, you're the only one who
dialog: came up positive for drugs?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I'm sorry, sir.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: When you were given the opportunity
dialog: to enlist, a kind of contract was

dialog: honored its part of that agreement.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Yes, sir--
speaker_heading: DEL

speaker_heading: ATHENA

speaker_heading: DEL

text: Athena is confused, hesitates to speak--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: These aren't trick questions, Private.
dialog: You'll be given an Article 15 and be

speaker_heading: DEL

speaker_heading: DEL

speaker_heading: ATHENA

speaker_heading: DEL

speaker_heading: ATHENA

speaker_heading: ATHENA

speaker_heading: DEL

speaker_heading: ATHENA

speaker_heading: DEL

speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: No, sir. They all been real straight

text: Del stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: It works like this, Private--every
dialog: soldier in a war doesn't have to
dialog: believe in what he's fighting for.
text: Most of them fight just to back up
dialog: the soldiers in their squad--you try
dialog: not to get them killed, try not to
dialog: get them extra duty, try not to

text: He is right in her face now--
speaker_heading: DEL

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: ENRIQUE
dialog: We was crossin' the river--

text: hops awkwardly to move forward--
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could
dialog: you bring them here?
speaker_heading: ENRIQUE
dialog: They need help. Jaime, Anselma--
dialog: esta es mi jefa--
speaker_heading: NESTOR

speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: I'll call the Border Patrol, they'll

speaker_heading: ENRIQUE
dialog: No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't
dialog: do that--]
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: You think you're doing these people
dialog: a favor? What are they going to do?
dialog: Either they get on welfare or they
dialog: become criminals--
speaker_heading: ENRIQUE
dialog: No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
speaker_heading: NESTOR
dialog: Con permiso, Senora, la muchacha
dialog: tiene mucho dolor--[Please, Senora,
dialog: the girl is in a lot of pain--]
text: Mercedes grudgingly indicates the lounge chair--
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Sientase. [Sit.]
speaker_heading: NESTOR
dialog: Es muy amable. [You're very kind.]
text: He and Enrique help Anselma into the chair. The Girl looks
text: up at Mercedes, frightened--
speaker_heading: ANSELMA
dialog: Ayudanos, Senora, por favor no podemos
dialog: regresar--[Help us, Senora, please.
dialog: We can't go back]
text: Mercedes looks at ANSELMA disapprovingly. The girl can't be
dialog: more than 14--
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: This girl is a friend of yours?
speaker_heading: ENRIQUE
dialog: Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
speaker_heading: MERCEDES

dialog: on the door--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hollis? You in there? Hollis?
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

text: SPLASHING, the frightened VOICE of a young woman--
speaker_heading: YOUNG MERCEDES (O.S.)
dialog: Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where
dialog: are you? I'm lost--]
speaker_heading: ELADIO (O.S., DISTANT)
dialog: Aqui! [Here!]
text: The girl flounders into the shot, wet and scared. Young

dialog: in the Rio, lost, scared--
speaker_heading: YOUNG MERCEDES
dialog: No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see
dialog: the bank!]
speaker_heading: ELADIO (O.S.)
dialog: Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here!
dialog: Come this way!]
text: Mercedes struggles toward the voice and suddenly a young man

speaker_heading: YOUNG MERCEDES
dialog: Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el
dialog: corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away
dialog: by the current--]
speaker_heading: ELADIO

speaker_heading: ELADIO

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MERCEDES' HOUSE -- MERCEDES
text: Mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. She steps into
text: the light by the carport. Enrique and Nestor are propping
text: Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old
dialog: station wagon--
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Rapidamente! Everybody in the world
dialog: is going to see!
speaker_heading: ENRIQUE
dialog: Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to
dialog: be a doctor on the other side.
dialog: Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if
dialog: you can pay he can handle it.
speaker_heading: ENRIQUE
dialog: Senora, anything it costs, I can
dialog: work--
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Don't worry about it. He owes me
dialog: some favors.
text: Enrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the
dialog: station wagon--
speaker_heading: ENRIQUE
dialog: Seas tranquila, mija.
dialog: (Nods to Mercedes)
dialog: Estamos en las manos de Senora Cruz.
dialog: [Just relax, honey. We're in the

speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: In English, Enrique. In English--
scene_heading: INT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM
text: Del steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in
text: panels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment--
speaker_heading: CARTOON
text: A tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun
dialog: blasting away--
speaker_heading: DEL (O.S.)
dialog: Homework?
speaker_heading: DEL AND CHET
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: I finished that. I'm just messing
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Tanks, huh?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: You got to be in the Army, you might
dialog: as well have something slick to drive.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: So you're going into the Army?
text: Chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his
dialog: drawing--
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: That's the general plan, isn't it?
text: Del watches for a long moment, thinking--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: (Softly)
dialog: That's up to you.
text: Chet looks at his father again. All this is news to him--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: The Army isn't for everybody.
text: Chet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to
dialog: the refrigerator--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Not that I don't think you'd be good
dialog: at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be
dialog: disappointed if you decided to do
dialog: something else with your life.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: You wouldn't?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: No.
text: Chet nods, begins to play again, considering the
text: possibilities. Del is making an effort and he doesn't have
dialog: much practice--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: How's your room shaping up?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Good.
dialog: An awkward silence--
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (Tentative)
dialog: Are we going to ever see your father?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: My father.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Yeah. He lives here, right?
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: He does.
text: Del pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws--
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Maybe we'll clean that thing out
dialog: back up, have a barbecue next weekend.
dialog: We could invite him and his wife
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Cool.
text: Chet flips the page of his sketchbook--
speaker_heading: CHET
text: He makes his own sauce.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT, BIG O'S -- NIGHT
text: The neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a
text: light within. Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches
dialog: the door--
scene_heading: INT. CLUB
text: The door opens. The place is empty now except for Otis,
text: standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with Hollis,
text: sitting on a stool. Both swivel to look around guiltily as
text: they hear Sam step in--
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to
dialog: the two men--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fellas.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Hey, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Open late.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I'm not open. We were just talking.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hollis probably told you we found
dialog: Charley Wade.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Yeah. How about that? People start
dialog: digging holes in this county, there's
dialog: no telling what'll come up.
text: He sits a few stools away from Hollis--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You two saw it, didn't you? You two
dialog: saw it when Buddy killed him.
text: Hollis and 0tis look at each other--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Imonna find out one way or the other.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Your father had the finest sense of
dialog: justice of any man I ever met--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For
dialog: fifteen years the whole damn town
dialog: knew he had another woman on the
dialog: side. Stole ten thousand dollars to
dialog: set her up in business. But hell,
dialog: what's that? You got a problem?
dialog: Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in
dialog: jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off--
dialog: if you do what he says, when he says.
dialog: You got some business that's not
dialog: exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Buddy Deeds--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
text: He looks at the two older men for a long moment--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That night in the cafe--he didn't
dialog: stay long after you left, did he,
dialog: Hollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone
dialog: too far with Wade, maybe he figured
dialog: he better not wait for the Sheriff
text: to get behind him. So he stepped out
dialog: to see if he could catch up--and you
dialog: were here at the club that night,
dialog: weren't you, O?
text: Otis sighs, begins to speak softly--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I was here.
speaker_heading: CU OTIS
text: He turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we
text: PAN away with his gaze--
speaker_heading: OTIS (O.S.)
dialog: I'd been running a game on the side
dialog: after hours craps, draw poker on the
dialog: weekends. Roderick didn't know about
dialog: it. More important, Charley Wade
dialog: didn't know about it, 'cause I didn't
dialog: want to cut him in. I suppose I'd
dialog: been drinking some, and I was pretty
dialog: full of myself in those days--but
dialog: hell, I just didn't expect the man
dialog: so early--
text: Sheriff Wade and Young Hollis step in the door and we are
text: back in 1957. BLUES HARMONICA FADES UP, wailing from the
text: jukebox. They stop and look at the place--
speaker_heading: THEIR POV -- CLUB
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. The club is empty, dark. A LIGHT shines
text: from the back room.
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Smoke fills the air and Young Otis sits
text: back laughing, a large pile of money on the table in front
text: of him. The other four BLACK MEN at the table aren't doing
text: so well. One by one they all look up past the camera to the
dialog: door--
speaker_heading: CU OTIS
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis doesn't see at first, engaged in
text: dealing the cards. Finally, he senses the presence, looks up--
scene_heading: WADE AND HOLLIS -- YOUNG O'S POV
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade stands over the table in the f.g.,
text: Young Hollis hanging back in the doorway. Wade is smiling
text: his cold smile, cursing--
speaker_heading: CU YOUNG OTIS
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Trying to look unimpressed--
scene_heading: EXTREME CU WADE'S EYES
text: Cold and unblinking. MUSIC CONTINUES--
scene_heading: EXTREME CU WADE'S MOUTH
text: Twisted in a snarl as he curses. MUSIC CONTINUES--
speaker_heading: MEN, TABLE
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade's body as the other men
text: step away from the table, grab their hats, and hurry out the
text: side door. Young Otis is left sitting at the table. Wade
text: starts walking toward him--
speaker_heading: CU YOUNG OTIS
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. His eyes following as Wade comes to stand
dialog: over him--
scene_heading: WADE, YOUNG OTIS
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade grabs the table and violently jerks it
text: over onto Young Otis, cards and money flying--
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOLLIS
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Watching squeamishly as Wade goes to work
text: on young Otis, the overhead light swinging wildly--
scene_heading: INT. BARROOM
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis is hurled out of the back room,
text: face bruised and bleeding. Wade follows, then Young Hollis--
speaker_heading: CLOSER
scene_heading: MUSIC CONTINUES.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Wade puts his gun next to Young Otis's ear, cursing at him.
text: Young Otis gets to his feet, goes behind the bar--
speaker_heading: BAR COUNTER
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis slaps an envelope full of cash
dialog: onto the counter--
speaker_heading: WADE
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. He waves his pistol, indicating something
dialog: behind Otis--
scene_heading: INT. BAR
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade at the counter as Otis
text: turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind--
speaker_heading: CIGAR BOX
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Lying open, an old pistol inside of it.
dialog: Young Otis reaches--
scene_heading: CU YOUNG HOLLIS
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Frowning as he senses something wrong--
speaker_heading: WADE
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade levels his gun at Young Otis's back,
text: then turns to wink at Hollis like he did before he shot Eladio--
speaker_heading: WADE'S HAND
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Finger closing around the trigger of the
dialog: .45--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Mouth open in horror--
speaker_heading: WADE
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Eyes burning as he aims--
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Stepping in the door, seeing, CALLS OUT--
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Turning to see Buddy--
speaker_heading: WADE
text: BLAM! THWAP! A bullet plows through his neck, knocking him
text: back against the bar.
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. His gun falls from his hand--
speaker_heading: YOUNG OTIS
text: Horrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood. MUSIC
speaker_heading: CONTINUES--
speaker_heading: BAR COUNTER
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the
dialog: envelope and are soaking up blood--
speaker_heading: CU BUDDY
text: Calm and hard-eyed. MUSIC CONTINUES. As he steps forward, we
text: see his pistol is still in its holster. He reaches out and
text: takes the .45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in
text: the eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis--
text: We PAN with his gaze to a CLOSE-UP of Otis, back in the
scene_heading: PRESENT. The MUSIC FADES--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Sheriff Charley had some real big
dialog: friends in politics then, and if the
dialog: truth come out it wasn't going to go
dialog: easy on Hollis.
dialog: (He shrugs)
dialog: I don't know why I trusted Buddy
dialog: with it--don't know why he trusted
dialog: me. The first time I ever talked
text: with him was right there, and then
text: with a dead white man leakin' blood
text: on the floor between us. He could
text: charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy
dialog: Deeds.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: This isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: The three of us cleaned up and took
text: him to the post and put him under.
dialog: Can't say I was much help.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And the ten thousand?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Widow's benefits. He figured it would
dialog: make the disappearance look better,
dialog: and that Mexican gal was just scrapin'
dialog: by after Charley killed her man.
dialog: They didn't get hooked up till late--
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Time went on, people liked the story
dialog: that we told better than anything
dialog: the truth might have been.
text: Sam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where
dialog: Charley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with--
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: What's the call, Sam?
text: Sam rolls it over in his mind before answering--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Don't think the Rangers are likely
dialog: to find out any more than they
dialog: already have.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Word gets out who that body was,
dialog: people are gonna think Buddy done
dialog: it.
dialog: Sam gets up--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Buddy's a goddamn legend. He can
dialog: handle it.
text: He heads for the door--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: 'Night, fellas.
text: Hollis and Otis watch him go--
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVE-IN, WIDE SHOT -- MORNING
text: We see Sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the
text: deserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen.
text: Pilar's car rolls in, parks beside him--
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Pilar gets out, kisses Sam, sits by him on the hood--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: When's the picture start?
text: Sam looks at her for a moment--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You gonna tell your mother we been
dialog: seeing each other?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: She'll figure it out sooner or later.
dialog: I don't have to ask permission
dialog: anymore, if that's what you mean.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You have any idea when your father
dialog: died? Eladio?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: (Shrugs)
dialog: Couple months before I was born--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Try a year and a half. He bands her
text: an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
speaker_heading: CU PHOTO
text: Buddy and Young Mercedes on the lake. Buddy with his shirt
text: off on one end of a sailboat, Mercedes in a bathing suit,
text: both smiling for the camera--
speaker_heading: SAM AND PILAR
text: Pilar hands the photo back to him, tries to be calm--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I've never seen my mother in a
dialog: bathing suit before. Didn't know
dialog: she owned one.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Buddy bought the cafe for her with
dialog: money he took from the county.
text: Pilar looks away, struggling not to
dialog: cry--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: They can't pull this on me. It isn't
dialog: fair--I don't believe this--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He paid the hospital bill when you
dialog: were born. Your mom always calls you
dialog: "our beautiful daughter" in the
dialog: letters she wrote to him.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: From the first time I saw you at
dialog: school--all those years we were
dialog: married to other people I always
dialog: felt like we were connected.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I remember thinking you were the one
dialog: part of my life Buddy didn't have a
dialog: piece of--
text: A silence, both of them wondering what the next move should
dialog: be--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: So that's it? You're not going to
dialog: want to be with me anymore?
text: Sam knows what he feels but doesn't have the words--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I'm not having any more children.
dialog: After Amado, I had some complications--
dialog: I can't get pregnant again, if that's
dialog: what the rule is about--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If I met you for the first time today,
dialog: I'd still want to be with you.
dialog: It is what Pilar needed to hear--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: We start from scratch--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Everything that went before, all
dialog: that stuff, that history--the hell
dialog: with it, right?
text: PILAR takes Sam's hand, kisses him--
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Forget the Alamo.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT, DRIVE-IN
text: Sam and Pilar sit by each other holding hands, looking at
