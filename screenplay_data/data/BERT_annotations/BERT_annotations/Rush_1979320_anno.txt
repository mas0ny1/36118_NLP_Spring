scene_heading: 2 AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY 2
text: A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
dialog: Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..
scene_heading: 3 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY 3
text: The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of
text: international TV commentators in different languages.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATORS
dialog: ...in places the track is still
text: dangerously wet, but following a
dialog: drivers meeting the decision has been
dialog: taken. The race is going ahead...
scene_heading: 4 INT. FERRARI - DAY 4
text: The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
text: wearing a fireproof balaclava...
text: Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His
text: name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.
speaker_heading: NIKI (V/O)
dialog: My grandfather always said history is
dialog: cruel and reductive and no matter how
dialog: long we live, or how much we achieve -
dialog: we are remembered for very little. So
dialog: make sure it's the right things.
text: NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.
dialog: Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...
dialog: Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be
dialog: using slicks or wets?
scene_heading: 5 EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY 5

speaker_heading: 5 CONTINUED: 5
text: Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An

dialog: Minute"...
text: Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: This is bullshit. We have no control
dialog: over our legacy. We cannot choose what
dialog: we are remembered for...
text: A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian
text: above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare
dialog: anche tu?
dialog: (Mass is going on slicks. You
dialog: want to change?)
text: NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white
text: helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of
text: MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for
dialog: my rivalry with this asshole. And the
dialog: 1976 season.
text: NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
text: Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: What about Hunt? Has he changed?
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: No, he's going on wets.
text: The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,
dialog: mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..
text: The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but
text: HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.
text: NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's
text: glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,
text: flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: I don't know why it became such a big
dialog: thing. We were just drivers. Busting
dialog: each other's balls. To me this is

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da

dialog: (Then we go on wets, too.)
text: The ten-second board is held up.
text: NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a
text: split-second, eyes staring...
text: NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
text: engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000
speaker_heading: RPM.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Maybe that explains the state of mind
dialog: I was in. And why it happened. The
dialog: other thing I'm remembered for.

dialog: On August 1st, that same year...
scene_heading: CAPTION: "AUGUST 1st, 1976".
text: The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his

text: scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.
text: NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin
text: leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..
text: NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's
text: a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.
text: His arch-rival. HUNT.
text: But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
text: Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.
text: NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong
dialog: decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to
dialog: change tyres...
text: NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at
dialog: one end...
dialog: 4
scene_heading: 6 INT. PITS - DAY 6
dialog: Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
text: crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the

text: It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...
text: The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four
text: men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same
text: Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Hair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le
dialog: slicks!
dialog: (See? I told you to go on

speaker_heading: NIKI

speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: There!
text: NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: C'mon...!!
text: NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: What's GOING ON???
text: "Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5
speaker_heading: 8 CONTINUED: 8
text: He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and
text: Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place
text: now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.
text: NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering
text: wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven
dialog: any harder.
text: NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of
text: the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.
dialog: And tight. Too tight. A mistake...
text: "Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the
text: inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155
text: mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..
text: "Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier,
text: and is thrown across the track..
text: Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,
text: with another car bearing down upon him...
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: No...!
text: The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a
text: sickening, terrifying impact.
text: The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane
text: gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his
text: seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.
text: NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees
text: temperature. Trapped inside his car.
text: Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...
dialog: Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV
text: commentators helplessly describe what's happening..
text: NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable
text: figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..
text: Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully
text: to undo NIKI's seatbelt..
text: Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.
text: Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Emergency...
text: She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is

speaker_heading: NURSE

text: Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as

text: The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and
text: consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...
scene_heading: CAPTION: "EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER"
text: Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks

text: Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing
text: overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,
text: (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...
dialog: A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to

scene_heading: 11 INT. JAMES'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 11
text: `Crash', the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble

text: The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor
text: student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer

dialog: budgerigars.
text: A mattress on the floor.
text: Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's
text: crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the
dialog: government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,

text: JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-
text: dressed, but already passionately making love...
speaker_heading: JAMES (V/O)
dialog: I have a theory why women like racing
dialog: drivers. It's not because they respect

dialog: She's no beauty. But goes like the

speaker_heading: JAMES

speaker_heading: HESKETH

speaker_heading: HESKETH

text: JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Who's the number one driver?
speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Why would I defer to him if I am
dialog: paying his wages?
text: NIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY's smile fades..
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Because he's a proven winner at the

dialog: who quite frankly, could teach you a
dialog: thing or two.
text: NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: OK. There is one clause missing.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: The one about mechanics' exclusivity?
dialog: Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM.
dialog: All information is shared between ALL

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: And I made it perfectly clear that my

dialog: This is something I cannot sign.

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: All right. I'll have the lawyers amend

speaker_heading: NIKI

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Thank you. My parents always wanted me

dialog: people left and right. I'm quick to
dialog: settle matters with my fists. The only
dialog: creatures I've ever loved and treated
dialog: well, are budgerigars. In any normal

speaker_heading: JAMES

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: What horsepower are you getting out of

speaker_heading: MECHANIC

speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: 142 CONTINUED: 142
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Thank you. I called this meeting
dialog: because as all drivers know the
text: Nurburgring is a race track from the
dialog: Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,
dialog: outdated, dangerous, track in the
dialog: world. You've all seen the rain which
dialog: has been falling this morning. Those
dialog: of you with experience know the Ring
dialog: needs perfect conditions to be even
dialog: remotely acceptable in terms of risk.
dialog: As you can see today is anything BUT
dialog: perfect, so I called this meeting to
dialog: take a vote to cancel the race.
text: A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: There would be no change to the

speaker_heading: EDWARDS

speaker_heading: NIKI

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: It also means you would effectively

speaker_heading: HARALD ERTL
dialog: Maybe it's just that he's frightened?
text: Laughter among the DRIVERS...
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Which asshole said this?
text: Silence. No hand goes up. No one has the courage to own up.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Yes, I am frightened. Always a little
dialog: bit when I race. I accept every time I
dialog: get in my car there is 20% chance that
dialog: I could die. But not one per cent
dialog: more. And today, with the rain the
dialog: risk IS more. How dare you accuse me
dialog: of lack of courage? Let me remind you.
dialog: I have the track record here. I am the
dialog: only person in history to do the Ring
dialog: in under 7 minutes. So actually it's
dialog: to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.
dialog: Because I'm quicker than all of you.

text: walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I heard you were spending more and
dialog: more time in one of these...
text: A hunched PILOT doing final checks. The figure turns. It's
text: NIKI. His wounds have healed a little, but it's still a
dialog: painful sight...
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Do you fly?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: You should try it. If something goes
dialog: wrong up there, you're on the edge,
dialog: but have to stay within the rules.
dialog: Stick to regulations. Suppress the
dialog: ego. It's good discipline for the
dialog: racing.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: And there I was thinking you were
dialog: about to wax lyrical about the romance
dialog: of flight. I should have known better.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: What brings you here?

text: JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: A friend's wedding. At least I think
dialog: it was a wedding. Might have been a
dialog: birthday. All a bit of a blur. How
dialog: about you? Been at Fiorano?
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Pre-season testing.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Already? In February? You're
dialog: relentless.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I'm not sure I meant it as a
dialog: compliment.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: But it is one. Relentlessness is good.
dialog: Means you're a fighter. That you never
dialog: give up. Behind my back I know some of
dialog: you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I
dialog: look like one. It's meant as an
dialog: insult. But I don't mind it. Rats are
dialog: ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But
dialog: they're intelligent. With a strong
dialog: survival instinct.
text: JAMES can't help smiling. That's NIKI.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: So when do you start testing? Next
dialog: week?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Are you mad? I didn't just win the
dialog: biggest thing of my life so I could
dialog: get right back to work.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Why? You need to. To prove to all the
dialog: people who will always say you only
dialog: won it because...
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Because what...? Because of your
dialog: accident? Is that other people, Niki?
dialog: Or you? I won. On the all important
dialog: day when it came down to it, we raced
dialog: on equal terms in equally good cars.

speaker_heading: JAMES (cont√≠d)
dialog: You bottled and I had the guts to see
dialog: it through.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: It's true. You won that race. And
dialog: believe me if I had to lose that title
dialog: to anyone, I'm happy it was you. But
dialog: that doesn't change the fact you have
dialog: to win again.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Because that's what it means to be a
dialog: winner, no? It's a permanent
dialog: condition. Never stops or goes away.
dialog: It stays with you always.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That's winning? Sounds like losing to
dialog: me. Some of life needs to be for
dialog: pleasure, Niki. What's the use of
dialog: having a million cups and medals if
dialog: you never have any fun? How is that
dialog: winning?
text: The plane load of JAMES's friends call out..."C'mon, James!"
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: You're right. I could learn from you.
dialog: In hospital the toughest part of my
dialog: treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the
dialog: shit out of my lungs. It was agony.
dialog: While doing it, I was watching
dialog: television...you winning all those
dialog: races...and I was cursing you.. "That
dialog: bastard, Hunt", I would shout, "I hate
dialog: that guy." one day the doctor said,
dialog: "Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of
dialog: advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse
dialog: to have been given an enemy in life.
dialog: It can be a blessing, too." I said,
dialog: "Who are you, Confucius?" He said, "A
dialog: wise man gets more from his enemies
dialog: than a fool from his friends." And you
dialog: know, he's right. Look at us. We were
dialog: a pair of kids when we first met.
text: Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed
dialog: nowhere. Now we're both Champions of

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy
dialog: myself first. And so should you. You
dialog: think you can?
text: NIKI stares. A blank look..
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: See you on race day, Champ.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: You will. Champ.
text: JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his
