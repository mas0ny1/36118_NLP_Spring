text: A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE. It dangles from the ceiling of
text: a basement.
text: LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.
text: Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence. She stands
text: in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines
text: her slender body. Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and
text: come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.
text: She walks to the bottles. Her fingertips slide over the labels.
text: She stops when she finds just the right one. A tiny smile as she
text: slides it out.
text: Anna turns to leave. Stops. She stares at the shadowy basement.
text: It's an unsettling place. She stands very still and watches her
text: breath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR. She's visibly
dialog: uncomfortable.
text: Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry. Each step faster
text: than the next. She climbs out of the basement in another burst
text: of LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.
text: WE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.
text: THE LIGHTBULB DIES. DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.

scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING
text: Two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.
text: Take-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china. An empty
text: bottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.
text: Anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.
text: She hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: It's getting cold.
text: MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and
text: tie on the sofa behind him. A jacket and an overcoat lay on a
text: brirfcase next to him.
text: Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,
text: intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study. His
text: charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face. He points.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: That's one fine frame. A fine
dialog: frame it is.
text: Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a
text: dining room chair. It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.
text: The frame is a polished mahogany.
text: He slips on the sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: How much does a fine frame like
dialog: that cost, you think?
text: Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I've never told you... but you
dialog: sound a little like Dr. Seuss when
dialog: you're drunk.
text: Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Anna, I'm serious. Serious I am,
dialog: Anna.
text: Anna giggles. She's clearly buzzed herself. Malcolm doesn't get
text: it. Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine. Her attention
text: slowly moves to the framed certificate.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Mahogany. I'd say that cost at
dialog: least a couple hundred. Maybe
dialog: three.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Three? We should hock it. Buy a
text: C.D. rack for the bedroom.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Do you know how important this is?
dialog: This is big time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm going to read it for you,
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
text: Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat. She leans forward
text: her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to
text: tickle her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: In recognition for his outstanding
dialog: achievement in the field of child
dialog: psychology, his dedication to his
dialog: work, and his continuing efforts to
dialog: improve the quality of life for
dialog: countless children and their
dialog: families, the City of Philadelphia
text: proudly bestows upon its son Dr.
dialog: Malcolm Crowe... That's you...
dialog: the Mayor's Citation for
dialog: Professional Excellence.
text: Beat. The power of the words sobers the two of them.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Wow. They called you their son.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: We can keep it in the bathroom.
text: Anna turns to Malcolm. He smiles.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It's not real, Anna. Some
dialog: secretary wrote that up. Don't
dialog: tell me you thought it was real?
text: Anna's expression becomes serious.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What?
text: She just keeps staring. Beat.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Don't do the quiet thing. You know
dialog: I hate it.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This is an important night for us.
text: Finally someone is recognizing the
dialog: sacrifices you made. That you have
dialog: put everything second, including me,
dialog: for those families they're talking
dialog: about.
text: Malcolm plays softly with her face. Anna takes his hands and
text: holds them steady.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: They're also saying that my husband
dialog: has a gift. Not an ordinary gift
text: that allows him to hit a ball over a
dialog: fence. Or a gift that lets him
dialog: produce beautiful images on a
dialog: canvas... Your gift teaches
dialog: children how to be strong in
dialog: situations where most adults would
dialog: piss on themselves.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes, I believe what they wrote
dialog: about you.
text: Anna lets go of his hands. Anna's eyes are emotional. Malcolm
text: smiles softly.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Thank you.
text: Anna leans towards him. They hold each other tight. Beat.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What are we hugging about again?
text: Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nothing. There wasn't supposed to
dialog: be any crying at this celebration.
dialog: Just a lot of drinking and sex.
text: Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I would like some red wine in a
dialog: glass.
text: Anna hands him his glass. He stares at it.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I would not like it in a mug. I
dialog: would not like it in a jug.
text: Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said. They crack up
text: laughing. THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY. They try to

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Bulb's out.
text: Anna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the
dialog: bedroom.
dialog: 
text: MALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.
text: A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the
dialog: room.
text: Anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater. She sways to a
text: pretend striptease song.
text: Malcolm can't hold back his grin. He joins in -- slowly peeling
text: off the sweat-shirt. He looks back to Anna. She's stopped her
text: playful dance. She's facing away from him.
text: He walks towards her. HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS. Malcolm's
text: face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED
text: WINDOW in their bedroom. The wind moves through the room. A
text: lamp lays broken on the ground by the window.
text: Malcolm kneels down. Beat. Anna's eyes fill with a quiet
dialog: awareness.
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: He's still in the house.
text: A SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.
scene_heading: ANNA SCREAMS.
text: Malcolm spins around. His heart stops.
text: Malcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary. They know
text: someone is inside. Beat.
text: Malcolm slowly starts towards the door. The first thing that
text: comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor. Then the
text: figure of a man comes into view. A STRANGER stands bare chested
text: in the back of the bathroom.
text: NO ONE MAKES A SOUND.
text: The STRANGER is about nineteen. Drugged out. Pitch black eyes
text: bulging. His body is covered in scars and bruises. His hands
text: are folded in front of him. He shakes ever so slightly. He has a
text: patch of white in his hair.
text: Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice. Never takes his eyes off
dialog: the stranger.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Anna, don't move. Don't say a word.
text: Anna barely nods her understanding.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (to the stranger)
text: This is forty-seven Locust Street.
dialog: You have broken a window and
dialog: entered a private residence. Do
dialog: you understand what I'm saying?
text: The stranger slowly looks up for the first time. His eyes lock
dialog: on Malcolm.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: You don't know so many things.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: There are no needles or
dialog: prescription drugs of any kind in
dialog: this house.
text: The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway. Malcolm
text: stumbles back onto the edge of the bed.
text: Anna sees the stranger for the first time. Her face drains of
dialog: color.
text: The stranger looks at Malcolm. He half grins.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Are you drunk?
text: The stranger's stare slides to Anna.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Did you get him drunk?
text: The stranger gazes at Anna. Gazes directly into her eyes. A
text: penetrating, unwavering stare.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Do you know why you're scared when
dialog: you're alone?
text: Anna's expression instanly changes.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: I know.
scene_heading: BEAT. THE ROOM GOES SILENT.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What do you want? I don't
dialog: understand what you want.
text: The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: What you promised.
text: Malcolm stops all movement.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: --My God.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: --Do I know you?
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm
dialog: Crowe. Recipient of awards from the
text: Mayor on the news. Dr. Malcolm
dialog: Crowe, he's helped so many children...
dialog: And he doesn't even remember my
dialog: name?
text: Malcolm can't speak. Beat. The stranger's face starts to
dialog: tremble.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: I was ten when you worked with me.
text: Beat. Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Downtown clinic? Single parent
dialog: family?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I had a possible mood disorder...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I had no friends... you said I was
dialog: socially isolated.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I was afraid -- you called it acute
dialog: anxiety...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You were wrong.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Come on, clear your head... Male,
dialog: nine... Single parent... Mood
dialog: discorder... Acute anxiety.
text: Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: I'm nineteen. I have drugs in my
dialog: system twenty-four hours a day...
dialog: I still have no friends. I still
dialog: have no peace. I'm still afraid.
text: Tears jump into the stranger's eyes.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: ...I'm still afraid.
text: Malcolm stands.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Please give me a second to think.
text: Malcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the
dialog: stranger. Beat.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Bed Freidken?
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Some people call me freak.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: ...Ronald... Ronald Sumner?
text: Tears fall down the stranger's face.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: I am a freak.
text: Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words. Something clicks
text: in his head.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: --Vincent?
text: THE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Vincent Gray?
text: VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep
dialog: waters.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I do remember you, Vincent. You
dialog: were a good kid. Very smart...
dialog: Quiet... Compassionate...
dialog: Unusually compassionate...
text: Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You forgot cursed.
text: VINCENT is fully crying now.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You failed me.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Vincent... I'm sorry I didn't help
dialog: you... I can try to help you now.
text: Vincent turns to the sink. His hand goes in. He turns arund and
text: raises a gun at Malcolm. He FIRES. A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING
text: ECHO. Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll
text: onto the bed.
text: Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head. ANOTHER
text: HORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR. Vincent crumples onto the
dialog: bathroom floor.
text: ANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON
text: The legend, "Two Years Later" appears.
text: A man flips open a worn file folder on his lap. Handwritten
text: notes fill every line. At the top of the first page reads,
dialog: "Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989."
text: The man's hand touches the name almost reverently.
text: He glances through the page. Words and phrases are circled
text: throughout the file.
dialog: "...Acute anxiety"
dialog: "...Socially isolated"
dialog: "...Possible mood disorder"
dialog: "...Parent status -- Divorced"
dialog: "...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"
text: The man's hands flip the page. At the top of this new page
dialog: reads, "Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998."
text: As the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words
dialog: and phrases circled throughout this new case history.
dialog: "...Acute anxiety"
dialog: "...Socially isolated"
dialog: "...Possible mood disorder"
dialog: "...Parent status -- Divorced"
dialog: "...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"
text: The hands close the notepad. The hands are slightly shaking now.
text: WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm
dialog: Crowe.
text: Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes
text: across the street. He gazes blankly at the brownstones. Beat.
text: A door opens. Malcolm is brought out of his trance.
text: COLE SEAR steps out his front door. Cole is a munchkin of a boy
text: with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.
text: Cole carefully locks the door behind him.
text: He moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.
text: Anxiously.
text: The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a
text: pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES. They look comical on him.
text: Malcolm rises to his feet. He smooths out his shirt. Looks down
text: and buttons his jacket.
text: When he looks up, Cole is gone.
text: Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy. Cole runs at full
text: speed down the street and turns the corner. TINY SNEAKERS
text: SCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.
text: For a second, Malcolm doesn't react. The second passes. He
text: stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk. He comes to a hard stop at a
text: street intersection. Searches. Spots Cole running into a
text: parking lot.
text: COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a
text: building. He has to use all his strength to push open the highly
text: ornate doors. He slips inside.
text: Malcolm jogs into the parking area. His pace slows to a walk and
text: then to stillness as he gazes up at the building. Its old stone
text: and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all
text: around it. Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church
dialog: quietly.
text: A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE. Malcolm's hand goes to it
text: quickly. He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate
dialog: doors.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - DAY
text: Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.
text: Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for
text: in the last row of the church.
text: He moves down the center aisle towards the back.
text: Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and
text: beige plastic soldiers. Cole makes the soldiers talk to each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Pro... Fun... Add...
text: The words are unintelligible.
text: Cole senses someone. He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at
text: him. The boy immediately goes white. Every cell of his body
text: still with fear.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It's okay, Cole. Don't be
dialog: frightened.
text: Cole stays rigid. Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I
dialog: was supposed to meet you today.
dialog: Sorry I missed our appointment.
text: Malcolm waits for a response. None comes.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Do you mind if I sit down? I have
dialog: this injury from a couple of years
dialog: ago and it flares up every once in
dialog: a while just so I won't forget it.
text: Beat. Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of
text: the seat. Malcolm sits.
text: Cole fidgets with his soldiers. Beat. Malcolm looks over and
text: stares at Cole's glasses. He leans forward to inspect them more
dialog: carefully.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Your eye frames. They don't seem to
dialog: have any lenses in them.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (soft)
dialog: They're my dad's. The lenses hurt
dialog: my eyes.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I knew there was a sound explanation.
text: Malcolm returns to staring at his lap. Beat.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What was that you were saying
dialog: before with your soldiers? Day pro
dialog: fun.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: ...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
text: Malcolm stares surprised.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's called Latin. It's a
dialog: language.
text: Malcolm nods at the information.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: All your soldiers speak Latin?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, just one.
text: Malcolm smiles at Cole. His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.
text: Malcolm's smile slowly disappears.
text: Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES. Some almost
text: healed. Some fresh. Malcolm looks around to gather himself.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I like churches, too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In olden times, in Europe, people
dialog: used to hide in churches. Claim
dialog: sanctuary.
text: Cole looks up.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: What were they hiding from?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad
dialog: people for one. People who wanted
dialog: to imprison them. Hurt them.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Nothing bad can happen in a church,
dialog: right?
text: Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Right.
text: Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I forgot your name.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Dr. Crowe.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You're a doctor. What kind?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I work with young people who might
dialog: be sad or upset or just want to
dialog: talk. I try to help them figure
dialog: things out.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Are you a good doctor?
text: Malcolm smiles.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I got an award once. From the
dialog: Mayor.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Thank you. It was a long time ago.
dialog: I've kind of been retired for a
dialog: while.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're my very first client back.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You use needles?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Not even little ones that aren't
dialog: supposed to hurt?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That's good.
text: Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'm going to see you again, right?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: If it's okay with you?
text: Cole thinks it over carefully.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's okay with me.
text: Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: And Cole, next time I won't be late
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Next time I won't be scared of you.
text: Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church. Malcolm loses
text: himself in his thoughts.
text: When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and
text: take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table. Cole pockets the
text: statue and quietly leaves the church.
text: Malcolm just sits and stares.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - EVENING
text: The house is dimly lit. Malcolm has to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM

text: ON. THE SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS.
text: Malcolm moves to her side. The sight of her stops him.
text: He stares at his wife...
text: She huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand. He
text: takes it in silently.
text: His eyes move to her face... One wisp of hair falls over her

text: looks like an angel.
text: Malcolm forms a tiny smile.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALL - NIGHT

text: THE DOOR KNOB. He tries to open it. IT'S LOCKED. Malcolm
text: reaches into his pockets. Searches for his keys.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: The empty basement is no longer empty. It's piled with file
text: cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books. A desk sits
text: in the corner next to the wine racks.
text: The room still feels unsettling.
text: Malcolm hunches over one of the books. Rifles through a stack of
text: dusty books. Pulls out a thick text.
text: The spine of the text reads, "The Meridian Latin Dictionary."
text: Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file. Handwritten
text: on the first page are the words,
dialog: "De profundis calms ad te, domine"
text: Malcolm starts working through the Latin text. As he comes to
text: each word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.
text: Malcolm translates the last word.
text: He stares quietly at the paper. The new words reads...
dialog: "Out of the depths, I cry to you Lord."
dialog: Beat.

text: She shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly

dialog: open.
text: Lynn shakes her head.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Cole.

scene_heading: TINY FOOTSTEPS.

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Your Cocoa Puffs are getting soggy.

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: You got a spot.
text: Lynn unclips the tie. Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as
text: Lynn walks back into the laundry room.
text: The dog is gone now. Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a
text: new tie. She finds one, then turns and steps back into the
text: kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.
text: Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open.
text: Cole sits at the kitchen table. His hands are pressed flat on

speaker_heading: LYNN

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: LYNN

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Think about what you want from our

dialog: should be?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Something I want?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: If we could change something in

dialog: would you like that to be?
text: Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: You don't have to answer now.
text: Malcolm heads for the door, stops when Cole emerges from behind

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Instead of something I want, can I
dialog: have something I don't want?

scene_heading: MR. CUNNINGHAM

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I don't like people looking at me

scene_heading: MR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You're a stuttering Stanley!

scene_heading: MR. CUNNINGHAM
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Hey, big guy.

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Do you like magic?

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Watch the penny closely.

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: And suddenly the penny has

dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: But that's not the end of the trick.
text: With another magic shake, the penny

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: But that's still not the end!... I

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: ...Once upon a time there was this
dialog: person named Malcolm. He worked
dialog: with children. Loved it more than
dialog: anything.
dialog: (smiles)
text: Then one night, he finds out he
text: made a mistake with one of them.
dialog: Didn't help that one at all. He
dialog: thinks about that one a lot. Can't
dialog: forget.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ever since then, things have been
dialog: different. He's become messed up.
text: Confused. Angry. Not the same
dialog: person he used to be.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: His wife doesn't like the person
text: he's become. They don't speak
dialog: anymore. They're like strangers.
text: Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches
text: him with unwavering attention. Malcolm smiles.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: And then one day this person
text: Malcolm meets a wonderful boy who
dialog: reminds him of that one. Reminds
dialog: him a lot of that one. Malcolm
dialog: decides to try to help this new boy.
dialog: He thinks maybe if he can help this
dialog: boy, it would be like helping that
dialog: one too.
text: Malcolm leans forward, whispers with emotional eyes.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I don't know how the story ends.
dialog: I hope it's a happy ending.
speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I want to tell you my secret now.
text: Malcolm blinks very slowly.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Okay.

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: In your dreams?

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: When you're awake?
dialog: Cole nods, "Yes."
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Dead people, like in graves and
dialog: coffins?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: No, walking around, like regular

dialog: they're dead.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: They don't know they're dead?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I see ghosts.
text: Malcolm becomes completely motionless. Works to hide his shock.
text: He and Cole stare at each other a long time.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: They tell me stories... Things
dialog: that happened to them... Things
dialog: that happened to people they know.
text: Beat. Malcolm's words are extra-controlled. Revealing nothing.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: How often do you see them?
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: All the time. They're everywhere.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You won't tell anyone my secret,

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: ...No.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Will you stay here till I fall
dialog: asleep?
text: Malcolm nods, "Yes." Cole pulls the covers up to his chin and
text: turns to the window in the room. Malcolm is very still and
text: stares at Cole.
text: MALCOLM'S EYES -- slowly turn and survey the room. They find
text: nothing. Malcolm returns to watching Cole.
text: COLE'S EYES LOOK AROUND THE ROOM WARILY... WE MOVE IN ON THEM --
text: TILL HIS EYES FILL THE FRAME.
dialog: Beat.
text: And then we see what he's staring at. Through Cole's hospital
text: room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building.
text: Rows of hospital room windows are visible. In the windows are
text: patients... SOME OLD, SOME YOUNG... SOME ARE DRESSED IN MODERN
scene_heading: HOSPITAL GOWNS... SOME FROM DECADES PAST.

text: cautiously into the hall.
text: Cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor. Opens

text: He checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and

text: A LARGE FIGURE MOVES PAST THE DOORWAY.
text: Cole instantly stops peeing. His body becomes very still. He

text: He just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall.
text: HIS BREATH FORMS TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.
text: Beat. Cole finally steps out into the hallway. His eyes catch a

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

dialog: needed seat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You don't need someone with a
dialog: masters. You need a wrestler guy
text: whose neck is larger than his head.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I need a wrestler with a masters.
text: Anna fills out the paperwork for the ring.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What's this?
text: Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: From you?
dialog: Anna nods, "yes."
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Is it wrestling tights?
text: Anna smiles as she moves to his desk. Sean begins to tear off
text: the wrapping paper like a kid at Christmas.
text: Anna laughs. Sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of "THE
text: GREAT GATSBY." Beat.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's a first edition.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Wow, this is too much. It's
dialog: perfect, Anna.
text: Sean puts down the book and hugs her. He pulls back a little,
text: still holding her. They smile at each other.
text: Beat. The moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second
text: too long. Their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold
text: each other. Nothing happens for the longest time.
text: CRASH! A SHATTERING DOOR SLAM ECHOES THROUGH THE STORE. Anna
text: and Jeffery pull apart. They rush past the young man and the
text: young woman to the front of the store. They find the glass front
text: door cracked in a spider web pattern.
text: They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk.
text: Look around. No one in sight.

dialog: face.

scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

text: Cole rides inside the shopping cart tucked between bags of food.
text: Mother and son are quiet as they move towards their car.
dialog: Beat.
text: Lynn leans over, looks at the side of her son's pensive face.
text: She starts pushing the cart faster. Cole wakes from his thoughts
text: as his hair flutters in the wind. He looks back. Lynn is
text: smiling as she pushes. Cole turns and raises his hands in the
text: air like he's on a roller coaster.
dialog: Beat.
text: They slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car. Lynn
text: leans over -- sees the side of Cole's face smiling.
text: Lynn's face shows a little happiness for the first time. A

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Cole and Lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries.

speaker_heading: LYNN

speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: Your pick.
text: Cole stares at his mom quietly.
speaker_heading: LYNN
dialog: It can even have Jean Claude Van
dialog: Damme in it if you want.
text: Cole smiles at that. He nods, "Yes" joyfully.
text: His smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the
text: HEATER controls.
text: Cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.
text: Suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield. It's a page
text: from a Playbill. A 1941 Playbill. It flies away revealing a
text: woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks
text: into the middle of the street as the pages of her Playbill swirl
text: in the air.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Momma, look out!

text: Playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view.
text: Lynn slams the brakes... Too late.
text: THE WOMAN SMASHES INTO THE FRONT GRILL OF THE CAR... HER TERROR-
text: STRICKEN FACE COMES OVER THE HOOD AND CRASHES RIGHT THROUGH THE
text: WINDSHIELD IN A SHOWER OF BLOOD AND GLASS...
text: COLE SCREAMS. LYNN SCREAMS... THE CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP IN
text: THE MIDDLE OF A CONGESTED INTERSECTION.
text: The line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve
text: to one side avoiding a mass collision. After a few seconds, the
text: entire intersection has come to a halt.
text: Cole who has shut his eyes... slowly opens them.
text: He looks around fearfully. His eyes move to the windshield. No
text: broken glass. No blood. And no woman. Cole looks out through
text: the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped
text: and staring all around them.
text: Cole slowly looks over to his mother. He finds her staring at

dialog: he screamed.

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Dr. Crowe?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You believe me, right?

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret,

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I don't know how to answer that.

text: It's not the one he wanted. Malcolm looks down.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: How can you help me if you don't
dialog: believe me?
text: Cole reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a PENNY.

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: I don't think that's the way it

text: and father. Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.
text: Malcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase.
dialog: Waiting.
text: The front door opens as another group arrives. Malcolm nods to

dialog: upstairs.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
text: The narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies. I.V.
text: stands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being
text: taken away. The boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door.
text: Cole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in. His
text: eyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the
text: hallway wall. He gazes at the many countries and continents.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I wish I were somewhere else.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Where will you go, where no one has

text: Cole stares at the map and then turns to Malcolm.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Don't go home, okay?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I definitely won't.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Cole closes the door behind him. He turns and gazes at the
text: girl's bedroom. There's a hospital bed near the window. The
text: walls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family,
dialog: friends, and school children.
text: Her shelves are filled with puppets. All shapes and sizes of
text: puppets. Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on
text: a mini tripod sitting next to it.
text: Cole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER. He
text: places it in his pocket.
text: On the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes.
dialog: The labels read, "Puppet Show Christmas 96," "Puppet Show
dialog: Birthday party," "Puppet Show class trip"...
text: Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the
text: closets. He passes the bed.
text: AN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND GRABS
speaker_heading: COLE'S ANKLE.
text: Cole jerks back startled. He watches as the girl's hand slips
text: back under the bed. Cole stays very still. Waits. Nothing
dialog: happens.
text: He slowly bends down. His hands touch the floor. He tilts his
text: head and looks under the bed.
text: The emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the
text: floor. Her bulging eyes glare at Cole. She moves suddenly.
text: Thrusts a jewelry box forward. It slides across the wooden floor
text: and stops just before Cole. Cole and the sickly girl stare at
text: each other. Neither of them say a word.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: The room is thick with mourners. Most are gathered around the
text: GIRL'S MOTHER, a young woman in her late twenties. As she moves
text: through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards,
text: hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence. Mrs. Collins
text: leaves the living room.
text: Malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves
text: through the many adults across the room.
text: The girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties,
text: is seated on the reading chair next to a T.V. His face is
text: granite. No one in the room dares to talk to him. He stares
text: statue-like at an abstract point in the room.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Mister?
text: The man doesn't react. Some of the guests look oddly at the
text: little boy standing before the man.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Excuse me, Mister.
text: Beat. The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing
text: next to him. Cole is very shaky.
text: Malcolm watches everything anxiously.
text: Cole stares at Mr. Collins.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Are you Kyra's daddy?
text: The man's face begins to crumble. Beat. He nods, "yes" softly.
text: Cole holds out the jewelry box. It trembles with his hands.
text: The father just stares at it. Beat.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's for you...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She wanted to tell you something.
text: The father becomes very still. His eyes fill with a storm of
text: confusion and pain. After the longest time, the father reaches
text: and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.
text: Cole begins to back away...
text: The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd. Cole
text: reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.
text: The father looks down in a daze. He goes to open the jewelry
text: box. His movements are slow and strained. He lifts the latch
dialog: and open the box.
text: Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.

text: The entire room has stopped what they were doing.
speaker_heading: T.V. SCREEN
text: WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS. The puppets go limp.
text: The entire stage gets lifted up. We see it carried away by Kyra.
text: We can view the whole bedroom now. The camera is seated on her
text: desk in the corner.
text: Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door
text: opens. It's Mrs. Collins. She carries in a tray of soup and a
dialog: sandwich.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: The crowd watches in riveted silence. The father never takes his
text: eyes off of the screen.
text: The image of the mother prepares the meal. She uncovers the
text: fruit and the soup. Places a straw into the drink.
dialog: And then it happens.
text: The image of the mother walks to a closet. Opens it. An
text: assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside.
text: She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner. Reads the label for the
text: ingredients. Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the
text: cap on the floor cleaner. The mother pours some into the cap.
text: Checks it.
scene_heading: MRS. COLLINS
dialog: (video tape)
dialog: That's too much.
text: The mother pours some into the bottle. The remainder goes into
text: the child's soup. She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back

scene_heading: MRS. COLLINS

scene_heading: MRS. COLLINS

text: the taste. She looks up at her mother.
scene_heading: MRS. COLLINS
dialog: (video tape)
dialog: Don't say it tastes funny. You
dialog: know I don't like to hear that.
text: Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another

scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

text: She looks up.
text: Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins. A

text: Husband and wife's eyes meet. Mrs. Collins smiles softly.
text: Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears.
speaker_heading: MR. COLLINS
dialog: (soft)
dialog: You were keeping her sick...
text: The whole world stops.
text: The mother's face registers confusion at first. Then slow
text: realization. Her eyes glace at the many faces around her.
text: She looks back at her husband. His glare is painful. Rage
text: filling every cell of his body. Tears falling faster down his
dialog: cheeks.
text: Mrs. Collins turns her attention back to the flowers. She
text: concentrates with all her strength. Beat. Her hands begin to
dialog: shake.
scene_heading: MRS. COLLINS
dialog: (to no one)

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You liked it, she said.
text: The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes

dialog: ceased.
text: Cole turns to the four-year-old.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: She watched out for you.

speaker_heading: FOUR YEAR OLD

scene_heading: INT. PROP ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop

text: Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham.
scene_heading: MR. CUNNINGHAM

text: The play is in full swing... Cole and a large group of costumed

text: costume. He stands to the side -- hidden by others.
text: A boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage
text: where a large cardboard stone is seated. A sparkling HANDLE
text: sticks out of the top.
text: The armored boy tries to lift it. It won't budge.
text: Bobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's

speaker_heading: MERLIN

speaker_heading: MERLIN

dialog: for the first time.
text: The villagers rise and rush to Cole. They scoop him up and carry

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: GONE.
