scene_heading: CLOSE ON: A "Have A Nice Day" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises
text: past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING.
text: We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE
text: worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his
text: physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome
text: too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face.
text: Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian
text: tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup .
scene_heading: INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: The apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific
text: New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He
text: sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits
text: the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news:
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN
dialog: --addressing the United Nations today,
dialog: the President expressed his concern over
dialog: the increasingly intense territorial
dialog: disputes in both Asia and the Middle
dialog: East.
text: CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
text: The sound of a bullet at one end of the
text: world echoes across the ocean to the
dialog: other end. Armed conflict is not self
dialog: contained in its respective region--the
text: consequences reverberate through every
dialog: nation across the world and therefore
dialog: must be avoided at all costs.
text: CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman--
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN
dialog: While the President's position was clear,
dialog: he did not comment on whether or not he
dialog: would order Dr. Manhattan into action
dialog: should the situation continue to
text: escalate.
text: CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he
text: appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage
text: shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads
dialog: straight for him.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in
text: its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face.
text: With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr.
text: Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the
text: smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed--
text: --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel--
text: CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake
text: jumps up, immediately at the ready--
text: --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake
text: sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see
text: that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT
text: HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake.
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: Just a matter of time, I suppose.
text: With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from
text: under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The
text: Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes,
text: but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER
text: from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro
text: . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot
text: off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out
dialog: of Blake's hand--
text: --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder
text: drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like
text: the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much
text: faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to
dialog: the head.
text: Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake
text: up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great
text: New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in
dialog: the eye
text: . and starts laughing. Hysterical.
speaker_heading: BLAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I always thought I knew the punchline.
dialog: But I guess the joke's on me now.
text: He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment--
text: --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS
text: HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a
text: sound as he plummets to the sidewalk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EVENING
text: CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in
text: fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his
text: head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the
text: sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood
speaker_heading: DRIPS on it
text: . when the pin is WASHED AWAY.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT)
text: A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from
text: the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its
text: place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper.
speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!
speaker_heading: SHOPKEEPER
dialog: It's been over four hours, I got a
dialog: business to run--
text: As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as
text: the water carries it to a DRAIN--
dialog: --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV
text: as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it.
text: We never see his face. We move from his POV--
text: --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at
text: the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still
text: arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow
text: tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG.
text: Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse
dialog: the magazines and periodicals, most of which have
text: inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere
text: currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads "War?", The
dialog: New York Times: "China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese
dialog: Waters," The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President
dialog: with Dr. Manhattan: "What Me Worry?"

dialog: I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late--
text: We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment
text: building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass
text: window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--
scene_heading: INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: --inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded)
text: and DET. FINE (street worn, but not quite cynical yet) walk

scene_heading: DET. FINE
dialog: Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225.
text: A solid 225, guy was built like a
dialog: linebacker. This is plate glass too,
dialog: you'd have to step on the gas just to put

dialog: At least. You check the bedroom?
scene_heading: DET. GALLAGHER
text: Drawers were open, tossed through.
text: Mattress flipped.
scene_heading: DET. FINE
dialog: Robbery?
scene_heading: DET. GALLAGHER

scene_heading: DET. FINE
dialog: You're saying this guy was a spook? You

dialog: I think that this is way bigger
dialog: than the both of us.
text: He leaves Det. Fine to ponder this.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
text: Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news
text: stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone.
text: We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the
text: broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC
text: SHEETING.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH (V.0.)
dialog: Rorschach's Journal, October 12th.
dialog: Earlier today I came across what appeared
dialog: to be a suicide. It was later learned to
dialog: be a homicide. Someone's time was up.
text: Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his
dialog: pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the
dialog: person whose POV we were in earlier.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I discovered a clue. Something I
text: recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly
dialog: . I heard my own clock ticking.
text: We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time--
text: RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench
text: coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS
text: moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a
text: Rorschach test. Scary looking.
text: Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and
text: FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches
text: itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT,
text: Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: With a grunt, Rorschach pulls himself past the plastic
text: sheeting, through the window, and into Blake's apartment. He
text: investigates, silent. He sees the same things that the cops
text: saw . . but he notices the speakers by the TV. Notices one
text: of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew.
text: Rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the
text: speaker was hollow. (The Intruder clearly took Blake's gun
dialog: and put the cover back on when he left. Why?)
scene_heading: INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT
text: Blake's clothing hangs in military rows. Rorschach runs his
text: fingers along the wall-seams. He pauses, presses on the
text: hanger BAR, which SLIDES BACK to reveal a RED BUTTON.
text: Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN,
text: revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRAMED
text: PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included in
dialog: this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook--he
dialog: was a superhero.
text: WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS,
text: GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got it.
text: But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention.
text: Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current
text: COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over it
text: all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK.
text: Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE
text: BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads "The Comedian Gets Last
text: Laugh On Moloch." Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed in
text: the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhero
text: called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervillian
dialog: named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.)
text: On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of
text: superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhattan,
text: as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, and
dialog: LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The
text: caption below reads: "The New Watchmen."
text: Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly

speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: I tell ya, I'd rather do traffic duty
dialog: than be posted at a crime scene all
dialog: night. Watch the door.
text: Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than
text: being concerned. He then enters the bedroom.
text: Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:
speaker_heading: COP 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Clear! I'm checking the other rooms.
text: Cop 2 relaxes a bit, turns--
text: --and comes face to "face" with Rorschach, standing inches
text: away. The Cop's face goes slack with childish terror. He goes
text: to yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, "Shhh"--
text: The fingers JAB INTO THE COP'S WINDPIPE. The cop HISSES and
text: falls silently as Rorschach brushes past him like a whisper.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (O.S.)
dialog: See, the Comedian thought he had it all
dialog: worked out.
scene_heading: INT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
text: CLOSE ON: A FRAMED PHOTO of the first Watchmen--identical to
text: the old one in Blake's closet. Holding the photo is HOLLIS
text: MASON. He puts the photo down, but we don't see his face yet.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (O.S.)
dialog: He was young and arrogant, but what he
dialog: lacked in experience, he made up for in
dialog: . tenacity.
text: As he speaks, we PAN ACROSS various FRAMED MEMORABILIA: The
text: first is a NEWSPAPER CLIPPING dated 1958: MYSTERIOUS MASKED
text: MAN CLEANS UP WHARFS--the caption underneath reads "Hero
dialog: Calls Himself The Nite Owl."
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)

scene_heading: PAN ACROSS: Another FRAMED CLIPPING, dated 1962: NITE OWL
text: FORMS WATCHMEN--COSTUMED HEROES COMBINING FORCES! "'We're
dialog: going to clean up this town!' Says costumed crusader."
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: So a few cops, we decide it might be
dialog: funny to mask up too. Be anonymous. Take
dialog: these guys on at the street level, right?
dialog: Then the media got wind, ran with it,
dialog: turned it into a whole different beast.
text: PAN ACROSS: A GOLD STATUE of NITE OWL in his Sixties-era
text: costume. The plaque below reads: IN GRATITUDE, 1969. Another
text: clipping: "Hero Retires, Reveals Identity In Tell All Book."
text: Finally, we come to HOLLIS MASON (aka Nite Owl), 70s, though
text: his eyes sparkle with strength and his face still shows the

speaker_heading: HOLLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Superheroes, Supervillians--you know who
dialog: I ran into the other day at the market?
dialog: The Screaming Skull. We chatted for a

speaker_heading: DAN (V.0.)
dialog: No way.
text: We see who Hollis is speaking to--DAN DREIBERG (the second
text: Nite Owl), late 30's, handsome, though he's let himself go
dialog: the past few years--his edges have gone soft. He was in the
text: photo of the new Watchmen in Blake's apartment.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: All the nuts that started popping up,
dialog: I'll tell ya. Who was that midget you and
dialog: your partner chased down years ago?
dialog: What'd he call himself?
speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That's bullshit, Hollis, and you know it.
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: With all this talk of war, all that's

dialog: the TV:
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN

speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: Move your leg.
speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: GANG LEADER

dialog: Ridiculous.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You're right. I heard he was working for

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: RORSCHACH

dialog: That I'm paranoid?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot
dialog: of enemies over the years, even amongst
dialog: his friends, if he had any. The man
dialog: wasn't exactly endearing. Just because
dialog: something happened to him doesn't mean it
dialog: involves us.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: One of our own has been murdered. I
dialog: thought you might be interested. An

dialog: yanks the Hooker off--
text: --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which

text: PROJECTED onto the walls, architectural models of real estate
dialog: developments, poster size ad campaigns for "Nostalgia"
dialog: perfume--all reflecting the financial empire of Veidt
dialog: Enterprises owned by--
text: --ADRIAN VEIDT, late 30s, movie star looks, is at the far end
text: of the office, SPRINTING on a treadmill as journalist DOUG
text: ROTH holds a tape recorder to him. Adrian sees Dan
text: approaching, smiles wide. He holds up a finger, telling Dan
text: to hold on a sec. Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch. Picks
text: up a Fortune magazine with Adrian on the cover.
speaker_heading: DOUG ROTH
dialog: Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you
dialog: are considered the world's smartest man?
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: I think it's better to be the world's
dialog: most modest man. You should ignore my PR
dialog: people, they tend to be a little too
dialog: enthusiastic.
text: Though Adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed, he hardly
text: seems out of breath as he answers questions.
speaker_heading: DOUG ROTH
dialog: If we could move off the subject of
dialog: business for a moment, I'm curious
dialog: whether the world's smartest man thinks
dialog: we're headed for our next World War.
text: Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Predicting stock prices isn't the same as
dialog: predicting world events. I hope there
dialog: isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that
dialog: matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has
dialog: some exciting plans, plans that will,
dialog: pardon the cliche, truly make this world
dialog: a better place. My team of engineers and
dialog: scientists have been working with Dr.
text: Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new,
dialog: cheap form of energy which will eliminate
dialog: the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with
dialog: no toxic emissions. This energy could
dialog: power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there
dialog: are no limitations--

scene_heading: INT. ADRIAN VEIDT'S OFFICE - LATER
text: Dan and Adrian sit, talking over coffee. Dan examines an
text: ACTION-FIGURE of Adrian as OZYMANDIAS (his superhero alias).
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Rorschach. He paid me a visit too.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: He did? Must've been tough to get past
dialog: your security, even for him. I thought
dialog: your assistant was going to take me out.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Sara can be tough. Is that why you came
dialog: to see me? You're worried about this mask
dialog: killer theory Rorschach's conjured up?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You're the world's smartest man, Adrian.
dialog: You tell me.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through
dialog: nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the
dialog: public as soon as the Keene Act was
dialog: passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it
dialog: would have been done already.
text: Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors.
dialog: Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian

speaker_heading: ADRIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No, there are other things in the world

speaker_heading: PAKISTANI SOLDIER
dialog: We should attack the Indian bastards. I

dialog: soldier.
speaker_heading: INDIAN SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
dialog: --why I can't just pull this trigger.
text: We see two Indian Soldiers, hidden in the mountains, one with

scene_heading: EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - EVENING
text: A SIGN posted on a RAZOR-WIRE FENCE reads: ROCKEFELLER
text: MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. An M16-toting GUARD stands at the
dialog: gate.
text: We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The
dialog: guard has no reaction to Rorschach--
text: --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army
text: Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The
text: Guard waves him through.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING
text: Rorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask
text: on. He quietly enters--
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS
text: --a huge room, which contains technologically advanced
text: MILITARY DEVICES. Distorted in sections of GLASS, we see the
scene_heading: REFLECTION of a HUGE MAN, GLOWING BRIGHT BLUE--
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
dialog: Good evening, Rorschach.
text: --and we see DR. MANHATTAN (formerly Jon Osterman) for the
text: very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT ripples
text: from his skin, emanating pure power--he is God on earth. He
text: works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air--
text: not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan
dialog: already knew he was coming.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: Dr. Manhattan.
text: Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his
text: girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime,
text: enters from the other end.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What
dialog: are you doing here? You're a wanted man.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Don't call me that. My mother made me

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should

dialog: been murdered.
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: Yes, since he and I are the only two
dialog: extranormal operatives currently employed
dialog: by the government, I was informed. The
dialog: CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic
dialog: groups.
text: Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He
text: speaks in a cold, even, matter of fact manner.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: I have my own theories. But neither of
dialog: you seem too concerned.
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
text: A live human body and a dead human body
dialog: have the same number of particles.
dialog: Structurally there's no difference.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Well, I might not be able to count
dialog: molecules, but either way, Blake was a
dialog: bastard. You know he tried to rape my
dialog: mother?
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: Sounds like you may have had a score to
dialog: settle. You or your mother.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: What? Are you accusing--
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: Rorschach, please don't upset Laurie. I
speaker_heading: DON'T--

speaker_heading: MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
dialog: (in Arabic)
dialog: It's him He's, he's real. Allah
dialog: help us, he's real!
text: The men run for it but it's useless--Dr. Manhattan shoots

text: --when PORT SECURITY pulls up. They get out of their jeeps,
text: in awe of Dr. Manhattan, still floating in mid-air.
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: These men were transporting a shipment of
dialog: enriched uranium--
text: With a gesture, the container floats off the truck and
text: separates into pieces . . revealing the URANIUM inside.
dialog: Suddenly the uranium changes--
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I've safely transformed the uranium into
dialog: sand. I trust you can take things from
dialog: here.
text: And just like that he disappears--
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS
text: --and is back in the lab without missing a beat.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: --I'm not here to judge the moral

speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: You call rape a moral discrepancy?!
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: Rorschach--you're upsetting Laurie. I
dialog: think you ought to go.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: I came here to warn you both, just like I
dialog: warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone

text: Rorschach materializes down the road from the base.
speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: --had my say
text: Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his

scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: He's gone. Are you okay now?
speaker_heading: LAURIE
speaker_heading: YEAH
dialog: (studies Dr. Manhattan)
dialog: Are you okay, Jon?
text: Dr. Manhattan pauses for a moment, thoughtful.
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: I'm having trouble with my vision. I
text: can't see clearly what lies ahead.
text: There's some static interference.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Interference? Caused by what?
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: I'm uncertain. A power surge of great
dialog: magnitude? Perhaps a nuclear detonation.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: More war talk. I can't deal with this. I
dialog: don't want to think about the future
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: There's no such thing as the "future."

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAURIE

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm sorry, it's just a little
text: unnerving to be with someone who can see
dialog: the future, or whatever you call it.
speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: I understand your frustration, Laurie.
dialog: The human mind for some reason is only

text: Dr. Manhattan touches her head--
scene_heading: INT. JUPITER HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 25 YEARS AGO)
text: Laurie's childhood home. We're in Laurie's POV, as a little

speaker_heading: LAURIE (V.0.)
dialog: Jon, stop!
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - EVENING
text: Back in the present, Laurie pulls away from Dr. Manhattan's

speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN
dialog: I didn't mean to upset you.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: I know. I think I've been cooped up on
dialog: this base for too long. Rorschach
dialog: mentioned Dan Dreiberg--we haven't seen
dialog: him in years. Maybe we can give him a
dialog: call, see if he's available for dinner

speaker_heading: DR. MANHATTAN

speaker_heading: LAURIE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Whatever happened to him?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and

speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: How is Jon, by the way?
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: I really don't know. It's been harder and

scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You're probably right.
speaker_heading: LAURIE

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: LAURIE

speaker_heading: RORSCHACH
dialog: Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable.
dialog: Probably true.

speaker_heading: MOLOCH
dialog: So that's it? I'm clean?

speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Now. What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You know! You killed the Comedian! You

speaker_heading: ADRIAN

speaker_heading: DAN

text: effortlessly dodges the blow, GRABS Rorschach's mask, TWISTS
text: it, then KNEES him in the gut. Rorschach drops to the floor.
text: Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan helps Rorschach up
text: and they follow.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I never intended to kill the Comedian--
dialog: that was an accident. Part of his duties
dialog: as a government operative was to keep
dialog: track of all former masked heroes, make
text: sure there was no rocking of the boat. He
dialog: must have liked Rorschach because he
dialog: allowed him to continue to exist. I had
dialog: thought that the Comedian might be
dialog: incompetent, but he disproved that
dialog: hypothesis when he discovered what was
dialog: really going on. here in Karnak--no easy
dialog: task. Even my staff was unaware--I made

speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan
dialog: nearly a decade in the works after
dialog: analyzing confidential psychological

speaker_heading: DAN

dialog: What we were doing with the Watchmen was
