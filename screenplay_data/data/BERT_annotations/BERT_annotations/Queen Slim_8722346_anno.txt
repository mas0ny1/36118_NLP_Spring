dialog: Screenplay by
dialog: Lena Waithe
dialog: Story by
dialog: James Frey
dialog: and
dialog: Lena Waithe
scene_heading: INT. DINER - NIGHT 1 (SOMEWHERE IN OHIO) 1
dialog: We're in the kind of place that feels like everyone should
dialog: know your name. But they don’t. Families frequent this spot
text: when they’ve fallen on hard times. It’s practically empty on
text: this boring Thursday. SERVERS drop off hot plates while
text: ELDERLY PEOPLE sip cheap coffee at the counter.
text: Our focus is directed toward a BLACK MAN and a BLACK WOMAN
text: sitting in a small booth in the back.
text: The MAN: has a slender frame and a laid back demeanor. He’s
text: not a fan of rocking the boat or ruffling feathers, but he
dialog: ain’t no punk either. For the purpose of this story we’ll
dialog: call him SLIM.
dialog: The WOMAN: She’s regal as fuck. She’s not an easy laugh and
text: she’s always waiting for the other shoe to drop. For the
dialog: purposes of this story, we’ll call her QUEEN.
text: Not unlike most first dates there are long silences and a lot
dialog: of forced small talk.
text: The WAITRESS quickly drops off their food and walks away
text: without uttering a word. Queen examines the spread.
text: Slim prays over his food. This is how he was raised. Queen
text: sits awkwardly waiting for him to look up.
dialog: As soon as he does --
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Didn't you ask for scrambled eggs?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
text: She clocks the two sunny side up eggs on his plate.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s all good.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No, it’s not.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It’s just eggs.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I have a thing about that.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Eggs?
dialog: They have
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No, about people not doing their
dialog: job well.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: She's got four kids and an
text: alcoholic husband at home. She’s
dialog: doing the best she can.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: She comes through my line every
text: Sunday, yelling at her kids and
text: giving me a stack of coupons. She
dialog: can never find her Costco card so I
dialog: always let her use mine so she can
dialog: get the discount.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That’s nice of you.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t know, can you?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Easy, I know good grammar.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We not in a classroom.
text: a quick standoff.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You gonna ask me your question or
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What took you so long to respond to
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I didn’t realize that much time had
dialog: passed.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I sent you a very well crafted
dialog: message three weeks ago. I spell
dialog: checked it and everything and got
dialog: crickets. Then today, out of the
dialog: blue, you hit me up asking if I
dialog: wanna grab dinner. What changed?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I had a shitty day.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What was so shitty about it?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: The state decided to execute my
dialog: client.
text: Queen says that as if she were giving him the logline to her
dialog: least favorite movie.
text: In an instant Slim loses his appetite.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I didn’t know that was still legal
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yup. It’s legal in 31 states. And
dialog: Ohio happens to be one of ‘em.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Was he innocent?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Even if he’s not - the state
dialog: shouldn’t decide whether he lives
dialog: or dies.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Me too.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Normally, I’d just go home and have
dialog: a glass of wine by myself. But I
dialog: didn’t feel like being alone. Not
dialog: tonight.
text: Slim can't tell if this is a cry for help or a proposition.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You didn’t have any friends or
dialog: family you could call?
text: Slim sips his soda.
dialog: Then --
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: So you turned to Tinder?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Why'd you pick me?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I liked your picture.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: (flattered)
dialog: Word?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You had this sad look on your face.
dialog: I felt sorry for you.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I didn’t mean for that to sound
dialog: shady.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Well it did.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: My dad took that picture of me.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Why aren't you smiling?
text: Slim shrugs. Not ready to divulge the reason just yet.
dialog: They're still getting to know each other.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: To be honest, I don’t have that
dialog: many photos of myself.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I know what I look like.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Pictures aren’t just about vanity.
dialog: They're proof of your existence.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: My family knows I exist. That’s
dialog: enough.
dialog: The idea of not having to prove oneself to the world is
dialog: foreign to Queen.
text: Slim stares at Queen’s plate. Most of her food is untouched.
text: Particularly her Caesar salad.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: You gon eat that?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You can have some.
text: He reaches over and stabs a few big pieces of lettuce with
dialog: his fork.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: They always use just the right
dialog: amount of dressing.
dialog: Then --
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Do you really like this place or is
dialog: it the only spot you could afford?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It’s black owned.
dialog: She wasn’t expecting that answer. Queen can appreciate this
dialog: small token of righteousness.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Touché.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - AN HOUR LATER - NIGHT 1 2
dialog: Slim drives a WHITE HONDA ACCORD. Yeah, he don’t give a fuck
text: about cars. He tries to create a vibe by playing some neo-
text: soul music. Which is regular soul music with a hint of
dialog: patchouli.
text: He keeps looking down at his phone. Checking the directions.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You shouldn’t text and drive.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Ain’t nobody texting. I’m making
dialog: sure I don’t get lost.
text: She grabs Slim’s phone from his lap.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I can tell you how to get to my
dialog: hotel.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Give me my phone!
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Relax. I’m gonna give it back.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You gon tell me where to turn?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yeah.
text: Queen points left.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Oh so now you gon point the
dialog: directions?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I’m telling you where to go.
text: Slim is visibly annoyed. Queen starts sifting through his
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You made a playlist? That’s cute.
text: Slim tries to grab his phone back, unsuccessfully.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Don’t go through my phone!
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Did you like “In a Sentimental
dialog: Mood” before or after “Love Jones”?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I knew about that shit way before
dialog: “Love Jones.”
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Don’t lie.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Okay - I fucked with it more after
dialog: I saw the movie.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I appreciate your honesty.
dialog: Then --
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: So what happens tonight?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You’re gonna drop me off and you’1ll
dialog: go home, I guess.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Did you think we were gonna have
dialog: sex?
text: Slim is embarrassed.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No. I thought we were gonna hang
dialog: out. Maybe get to know each other.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Nah, I’m good.
text: Slim takes his phone back from Queen causing him to SWERVE a
text: bit. Then he SWITCHES LANES without signaling.
text: Just as he starts to pick up speed. He hears a horrifying
text: sound. WOOP WOOP. Every black person’s worst nightmare.
dialog: 8.
text: We hear a robotic voice muffled through a loud speaker: “Pull
dialog: over. That corner right there.”
text: Slim’s heart starts to race. Queen’s heart beats at its usual
dialog: speed.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have any warrants?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Nah, I ain’t got no warrants.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Do you have any weapons in the car?
dialog: Any narcotics?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I got a pocket knife in the glove
dialog: compartment.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That’s fine.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I know it is.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT 1 3
text: The POLICE OFFICER steps out of his car and makes his way to
text: Slim’s door.
text: He motions for Slim to roll down his window. He does.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Can you turn the radio down?
text: Slim pauses for a beat. Then he does as he’s told. He’s
dialog: always been good at being obedient.
text: The Police Officer aims the light directly in Slim’s eyes.
text: Slim quickly shields his face so he can see what’s in front
dialog: of him.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: Put your hand down.
text: He does as he’s told.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: He only had it up because you were
text: shining a light in his eyes.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: I’m trying to see inside the
dialog: vehicle.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: It’s just us.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: License and registration.
text: Slim reaches for his wallet.
speaker_heading: SLIM
text: I’m grabbing my wallet.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: I can see that.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Well, y’all like to shoot first and
dialog: ask questions later.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Do you have something you wanna say
dialog: to me?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No, I don’t.
text: Slim hands over his license. Slowly. As he reaches over to
text: rummage through his glove compartment his hand accidentally
text: grazes Queen’s thigh. He’s not being fresh. Just nervous. He
text: finally finds his crumpled up registration and hands it over.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Do you know why I pulled you over?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: You forgot to use your signal back
dialog: there. And you swerved a bit.
text: Queen shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Oh, my bad.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Yeah, it is.
text: The Police Officer takes Slim’s license and registration and
text: slowly walks back to his squad car.
text: Queen sits there. Seething. Slim is calm as a cucumber.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I can’t believe this shit.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Just chill.
dialog: She doesn’t like being told what to do.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I told you to chill out.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I have a right to be angry.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I ain’t tryna die tonight.
text: The weight of that statement leaps out of Slim’s soul and
text: lands in Queen’s lap.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 1 4
text: The Police Officer talks to his DISPATCHER.
text: On his dashboard we see a PHOTO. It’s a picture of his WIFE
text: and KIDS.
text: The Kids are TWIN BOYS. They both have blonde hair and green
text: eyes. They’re completely unaware of how privileged their
dialog: lives will be simply because they were born white and male.
text: The Wife is a bored brunette whose dreams are no bigger than
dialog: her backyard.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: Whattya got?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
text: Black male. Black female. Both late
text: twenties. They’re in a white Honda.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: Driver changed lanes without
text: signaling. He was driving
text: erratically.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: Is he under the influence?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: I don’t know yet. I’11 make him do
text: a breathalyzer.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: Let me know if you need anything.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Will do.
scene_heading: INT. SLIM'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 1 5
text: The Officer is back at Slim’s window - leaning in a little
dialog: too close.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Will you step out of the vehicle,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Can I ask why, Officer?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: No, you can’t. Step out of the car.
text: Before he gets out of the car Queen and Slim lock eyes. He
text: doesn’t know Queen very well, but he can tell she has the
text: spirit of Nat Turner wrestling inside of her.
text: Slim steps out and puts his hands on the roof of the car. The
text: Police Officer proceeds to search him, aggressively.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: You got any sharp objects in your
dialog: pockets I should know about?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Any illegal substances?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: What about in the vehicle?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SLIM'S CAR - PASSENGER SEAT - SAME TIME - NIGHT 1
text: Queen’s left knee bounces uncontrollably. Her chest goes up
dialog: and down.
text: Queen looks in the rearview mirror and sees the Police
text: Officer interrogating Slim on the side of the road.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 1
text: The Police Officer finishes patting Slim down.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Have you been drinking tonight?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No.
text: Slim laughs.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Why is that funny?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Cause I don’t drink.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Do me a favor, pop the trunk.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Because I asked you to.
text: Slim hesitates.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Ain’t nothing in there but some
dialog: shoe boxes.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Let’s see ‘em.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Okay.
text: Queen HONKS the horn in an effort to get the Police Officer’s
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Do you have a warrant?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Ma’‘am, he’s already agreed to the
dialog: search. So I don’t need one.
text: Slim pops the trunk.
text: He was telling the truth. The only thing in his trunk are a
text: bunch of sneakers. Consumerism is his only vice.
text: Slim feels vindicated and violated at the same time.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Told you.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (0.S.)
dialog: Can we go now?
text: The Officer’s cheeks turn bright red.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: What’s in the boxes?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Shoes.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: I’m gonna check just to be sure.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Fine.
dialog: Then.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you please hurry up?
dialog: 14.
text: And just like that a SWITCH GOES OFF in the Police Officer's
text: head. He feels disrespected. His uniform isn’t as
text: intimidating as he thought it was. His super powers are
dialog: imaginary. So he goes from 2018 to 1953 real quick.
text: He PULLS OUT HIS GUN and AIMS IT AT SLIM.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Get on the ground and put your
dialog: hands behind your back, now!
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Get on the ground!
text: Slim does as he’s told.
text: The Officer keeps the gun pointed at Slim’s head while
text: looking at Slim’s car to make sure Queen stays inside.
text: But after a beat she GETS OUT OF THE CAR to see what the fuck
text: is going on.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Why is he under arrest?
text: The Officer turns around and AIMS HIS GUN AT HER. With one
text: hand. The other hand stays planted on Slim’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Ma’am if you don’t get back in the
dialog: car I’m gonna have to arrest you
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I'm happy to get back in the car,
dialog: but would you mind telling me why
dialog: you're arresting him?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Get back in the vehicle now!
speaker_heading: QUEEN
text: I’m reaching for my cell phone --
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Keep your hands where I can see
dialog: them! !
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I have the right to record this
dialog: arrest.
dialog: 15.
text: Queen REACHES in her pocket.
text: Officer Reed AIMS HIS GUN AT HER and FIRES OFF TWO SHOTS.
dialog: BOOM! BOOM!
text: The first shot misses her, but the SECOND SHOT GRAZES HER
text: RIGHT THIGH. She collapses to the ground. And hits her head
text: on the pavement.
text: Slim SCREAMS for her. He tries to run toward her, but Officer
text: Reed grabs him by the shoulders and slams him on the ground.
text: Officer Reed and Slim roll around on the ground for a few
text: seconds. Until Officer Reed finally pins Slim to the ground
text: and points the gun at his face.
speaker_heading: OFFICER REED
dialog: Don’t move!
text: Officer Reed sees Queen trying to get up. He points his gun
text: at her again - while the Officer’s attention is diverted -
text: Slim KNOCKS the firearm out of his hand.
text: When the gun goes flying - Officer Reed reaches for it, but
text: Slim gets to it first.
text: When Slim turns around he sees Officer Reed LUNGING toward
dialog: him.
dialog: Slim FIRES the gun! BOOM.
text: HE SHOOTS OFFICER REED IN THE NECK. Killing him instantly.
text: Slim drops the gun and stops breathing. Queen muffles her own
dialog: scream.
text: Officer Reed's lifeless body lies on the pavement. A pool of
text: blood quickly forms around him.
text: Queen applies pressure to her fresh wound and winces in pain.
text: Slim gets up and runs to her side. He sees the blood running
text: down her leg.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Oh shit!
text: He tries to help her up, but she doesn’t want his assistance.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I got it.
text: She slowly stands up. Gritting her teeth the entire time.
dialog: Independence hurts.
dialog: 16.
text: Queen looks at the dead Police Officer.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Physically yes. Emotionally no.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
text: Slim puts Queen’s arm around his neck. He knows she’s
text: struggling to stand on one good leg.
text: She kneels down and grabs the gun. Then she gently shoves it
text: in his pants.
dialog: It’s their gun now.
text: Queen turns to face Officer Reed’s squad car. The headlights
text: are still on. Giving the small CAMERA on the DASHBOARD a
text: perfect view of her face.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Let's go.
text: Slim looks at her for a long beat.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We can’t just leave him here.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yes, we can. Now let’s go.
text: Slim walks Queen back to the car. The engine is still
text: purring. He helps her into the passenger seat.
text: Slim walks around to the other side and gets in the driver's
text: seat. Still in shock.
text: As they drive off into the darkness all we hear is the static
text: filled radio coming from the squad car.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: Officer Reed? Officer Reed, do you
dialog: need back up? Officer Reed, do you
dialog: copy?
text: As we hear sirens far off in the distance, we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OPENING CREDITS
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 1 8
text: Slim drives faster than his car is used to going. No music is
text: playing. They’re no longer wrapping up a date. Now they’re
text: fugitives, on the run. And one of them is wounded.
text: Slim has no idea where they’re going. Neither does Queen.
text: He’s just driving. Aimlessly.
text: Slim grabs his phone.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I gotta call my dad.
text: Queen snatches his phone and tosses it out the window. She
text: chucks hers as well.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We can’t call anybody. It’1ll make
text: them accomplices.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You could've just said that shit.
dialog: Now we ain’t got no phones.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: A phone ain’t nothing but a
dialog: tracking device anyway.
text: Slim is shell shocked as Queen tries to take deep breaths.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You're bleeding a lot.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: It's okay it only grazed me.
text: The severity of what they did starts to sink in.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Fuck! Why didn’t you just stay in
dialog: the car?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: So this is my fault?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You should've just let me handle
dialog: it.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: If I didn’t get out the car you'd
dialog: be dead right now.
text: Slim looks at her wound. There’s a big gash.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We gotta get you to a hospital.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No! We can’t. Just keep driving.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Here -—
text: Slim takes off his jacket while driving.
dialog: She balls
dialog: hell.
dialog: She looks
dialog: She grabs
dialog: her teeth
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Use my jacket as a bandage.
text: it up and presses it against her leg. It hurts like
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Fuck!
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I have a small bottle of bourbon
text: under the seat.
text: at him with judgmental eyes.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I thought you didn’t drink.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don’t. My cousin stole that from
dialog: a hotel and left it in my car.
text: it and pours some on her open wound. Queen grits
text: and presses against it to stop the bleeding.
text: Slim’s mind starts to race. He can’t sit still.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: What if he was wearing a body cam?
dialog: Or had a camera in his car. This
dialog: shit bout to be all over the
dialog: fucking news.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That's why we have to keep going.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We can’t run forever.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I know that. But right now we have
dialog: to run until we come up with a
dialog: better plan.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Well, start throwing out some
dialog: ideas.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Since when am I in charge of coming
dialog: up with the ideas?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Since you made the decision to run.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We made that decision together.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don’t remember that.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We ain’t turning ourselves in, I
dialog: know that much.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: If people watch the tape they’1l
dialog: see what happened.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yeah - they’1l see you shooting a
dialog: police officer, you idiot!
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Man, fuck this!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT 1 9
text: Slim pulls the car over. He gets out and just starts walking.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What the fuck are you doing? Are
dialog: you crazy?
text: Queen limps out and hurries after him. Slim walks aimlessly
text: up the road.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you going?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I‘mma find somebody with a phone so
dialog: I can call my family.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: If you do that they’1l know where
dialog: we are.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What if they kill us?
text: That stops Slim in his tracks. He turns to look at her.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Don’t say that.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: There’s no guarantee they won’t.
dialog: Then.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re a black man that killed a
dialog: cop and then you took his gun.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We took it for protection.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I’m not a criminal.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You are now.
text: Slim stares at her.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I just want to go home. I wanna see
dialog: my family.
text: Slim's eyes start to water. Queen grabs his hand.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: If you turn yourself in - you’1l
dialog: never see them again.
text: And just like that. Something in Slim shifts. He feels
text: powerless and small.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: All we can do is go forward.
dialog: There’s nothing back there for us.
dialog: Please. Let’s just keep going.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What about your family? You don’t
dialog: care about leaving them behind?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No. I don’t.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We can’t just keep driving. We need
dialog: to figure out what the fuck we gon
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Alright, let’s go to my uncle’s
dialog: house. We can stay there for a few
dialog: days. Then we can figure out our

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You answered too fast.
speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Are you a good lawyer?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I’m an excellent lawyer.

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Touché.
text: This brings a small smile to Queen’s face.
text: Then she keeps knocking. Until a TALL BLACK GIRL, with a fire
text: in her belly and a glimmer in her eye, answers the door. She
text: looks like the romantic interest in every hip hop music video
dialog: ever made.
speaker_heading: TALL BLACK GIRL
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: 28
dialog: 29
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Is my uncle here?
speaker_heading: TALL BLACK GIRL
dialog: Who’s your uncle?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Bitch, don’t play with me.
text: The Tall Black Girl opens the door to let them in.
speaker_heading: TALL BLACK GIRL
text: He in the back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 2 28
text: Queen walks through the house like she owns it. Slim trails
text: behind her. She makes her way down a few hallways, and
text: brushes by GODDESS - a half black, half Asian twenty-
text: something girl. There’s no glimmer in her eye - just stars.
text: Her eyes widen as Slim and Queen walk by.
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Oh shit! It’s them!
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 2 29
text: Queen opens the door to find her UNCLE EARL peeling shrimp.
text: He’s rocking a red velour track suit and has a bald head. He
text: stands up and looks at Queen.
text: From the look on his face they haven’t seen each other in a
dialog: while.
text: Uncle Earl wipes his hands and walks over to give her a hug.
text: The embrace is one-sided.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Well, if it isn’t the black Bonnie
dialog: and Clyde.
text: Earl reaches out to shake Slim’s hand. Earl’s hand is twice
dialog: the size of his.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t know what the news is
dialog: saying, but whatever it is - it’s
dialog: not true.
dialog: 30
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: You know I don’t fuck with the
text: news. I keep my ear to the streets.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
text: The streets lie too.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: They know better than to lie to me.
dialog: Y’all hungry?
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 2 30
text: Uncle Earl cooks up some CREAMY SHRIMP SCAMPI ALFREDO. It
text: looks amazing. He makes plates for Slim, Queen, and the two
dialog: beautiful girls we saw earlier.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: I always hoped you’d escape this
dialog: life without getting shot at.
text: He leans back.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Who patched you up?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: She did.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: You ain’t do a good job.
text: Earl stares at Queen for a long beat. A little too long.
text: Causing her to look away.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s your plan?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We need to figure that out.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Well, y’all need to hurry up cause
text: the cops are like slave catchers.
dialog: They can smell a runaway from miles
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I’m aware.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: How you gon outrun the police?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We don’t have to outrun them. We
dialog: just have to make sure they don’t
dialog: know where we are.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: That ain’t hard to do. Cops are
dialog: dumb as shit.
speaker_heading: TALL BLACK GIRL
dialog: Not all of ‘em.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: She only saying that cause she used
dialog: to fuck one of them muthafuckas.
speaker_heading: TALL BLACK GIRL
dialog: Don’t be jealous.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: I ain’t jealous of nobody. Niggas
dialog: jealous of me.
text: Before this turns into a bigger fight Queen interrupts.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We might need to stay here for a
dialog: little while.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Hell nah. The SWAT team probably
dialog: already on they way. And I can’t
dialog: have them muscle neck muthafuckas
dialog: sniffing around my shit.
text: This puts the fear of God in Slim.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: So what are we supposed to do?
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: So you just gon let us get killed?
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: That’s the risk you take.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Fuck you, Earl.
text: She gets up to leave. Slim follows her. Goddess looks at Earl
text: with puppy dog eyes. Her charm is hard to resist.
dialog: Then --
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: How long y’all need to stay?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: A night or two.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Well which one is it?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Two nights.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We need some cash.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Enough to last us for a few days.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We need one of your cars.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: You can kiss my black ass.
speaker_heading: TALL BLACK GIRL
dialog: He love those cars more than he
dialog: love us.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You want me to sign the house over
dialog: to you or not?
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: You always tryna blackmail
dialog: somebody.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: I ain’t got no extra cars just
text: laying around.
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: What about the Cadillac?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Goddess, if you don’t shut the fuck
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don’t know how inconspicuous we
text: gon be riding around in a Cadillac.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That’s the whole point. We’1ll be
text: hiding in plain sight.
text: Goddess sits on Earl’s lap.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you agree to my terms or not?
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: I’m not giving you no car.
text: She gets in his face.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You owe me.
text: Those three words stab him in his stomach. Slim tries to read
text: the situation, but can’t make sense of it.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: You sure this how you want me to
dialog: pay you back?
text: Queen nods.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay.
text: Earl gets up and grabs the CAR KEYS from a drawer nearby. He
text: tosses them to Slim. Slim doesn’t catch them.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to figure out what the
dialog: fuck you gon do when you leave
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We will.
text: Earl looks at Slim.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: She talk for both of y’all?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Could’ve fooled me.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Don’t do that.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: I just wanna know what the nigga’s
dialog: thinking. Cause he look kinda slow
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I think we should go to Cuba.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Now we talking! Ain’t that where
dialog: Assata went after she killed that
dialog: state trooper?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Allegedly killed.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We just gotta keep driving until we
dialog: get to Miami and then --
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We'll be standing in front of a
dialog: large body of water. How are we
dialog: supposed to cross that?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don’t know yet.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Of course you don’t.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: You got a better idea?
text: For once she doesn’t. She gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Where you think you going?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: To lay down. I’m exhausted.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Y'all ain’t going nowhere until we
dialog: shave yo heads.
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We're not doing that.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: You wanna keep walking around
dialog: looking how you look in that video?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We'll be fine.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: No, you won’t.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You're not shaving my head.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Fine. I believe women have the
dialog: right to choose - but you don’t.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
text: Naomi, use the cheap razor on his
dialog: ass.
text: Tall Black Girl has a name. It’s Naomi. She goes looking for
dialog: the cheap razor.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER - DAY 2
dialog: 31
text: Slim sits on a stool while Naomi takes a razor to his head.
text: He’s pissed.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Man, this is fucked up.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: This what happens when you on the
dialog: run from the law.
text: Earl motions for Naomi to keep shaving.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Do you guys have any wigs?
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: I live in a house full of
dialog: strippers. Of course we got wigs.
dialog: 32
dialog: 49,
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - GODDESS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 2 32
text: There’s a row of about TWENTY WIGS. They all come in
text: different colors, lengths, and types. It looks like a museum
text: in there. Queen walks by them. Touching a few. Smelling
text: others. She’s fascinated.
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Take whatever you want. You can
dialog: have some of my clothes too.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: Then --
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Can I look at your leg?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Nah, I’m okay.
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: I took a year of nursing school. I
dialog: know what I’m doing.
text: Queen feels bad for judging her.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Alright.
text: Goddess helps Queen take her pants off. Goddess slowly pulls
text: the bandage away. Queen winces.
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Don't worry. I got you.
text: They lock eyes. Goddess smiles at her. Queen smiles back.
speaker_heading: GODDESS (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t know Earl had a niece.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We’re not close.
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Is he related to your mother or
dialog: your father?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: My mother. She and I weren’t close
dialog: either.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Damn, who are you close to?
text: She shrugs.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Are you close to your family?
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Yeah. They don’t care how I make my
dialog: money as long as I’m happy.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What makes you happy?
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: Robes at fancy hotels. A good lace
dialog: front. And when your uncle kisses
text: me on my forehead.
dialog: Queen wasn’t expecting that answer.
speaker_heading: GODDESS (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Nothing. I’m just surprised by the
dialog: amount of love he has in his life.
speaker_heading: GODDESS
dialog: He don’t always deserve it, but he
dialog: needs us to worship him. Out there
dialog: he ain’t shit. But in here - he a
dialog: king.
text: Queen let’s that sink in. She marvels at Goddess’ thin frame
text: as she cleans her leg with precision.
dialog: In another life Goddess could’ve been a nurse with an
dialog: affordable mortgage, but in this one she occupies the
dialog: fantasies of working class men who will never understand how
text: innocent she really is.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 33
dialog: 34
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER - DAY 2 33
text: Queen walks into the kitchen wearing a Tina Turner wig. From
text: her early Ike & Tina days. She looks more regal than before.
text: She looks up and sees Slim leaning against the stove. With
text: his newly shaved head. He looks like the second lead vocalist
text: in an R&B group from the nineties.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You like it?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t know yet.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You like this shit.

scene_heading: INT. UNCLE EARL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - 2
text: Uncle Earl is smoking a cigar while Naomi watches TV. She’s
text: watching a cable news channel and the focus is on Queen &

text: police being on their trail.
text: She looks nervous.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: I know you stole my pinky ring.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Whatever nigga.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: It’s one of a kind. I designed it
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Don’t nobody care about yo fake ass

speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: That’s your problem. You don’t care

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Oh that’s my problem?

dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Yeah, that’s your problem.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: My problem is yo ass.
text: Earl gets up and SLAPS her with the back of his hand. She
text: falls out of the chair and hits the floor hard.
text: Then she QUICKLY gets up and smacks his face.
text: He flings her across the room. She then throws a lamp at his
text: head. He ducks just in time and it crashes into the wall.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: My mama gave me that lamp!
dialog: As they continue to brawl, we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Slim and Queen lie next to each other on a cozy bed.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You hear that?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah, it sounds like somebody's
dialog: fighting.
text: Queen gets up and walks over to the door. She peeks out and
text: sees Naomi and Earl yelling at each other.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: You want me to talk to him?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Please don’t.
text: Queen walks back to bed.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: He didn’t used to be like this.
dialog: Iraq fucked him up.
text: She lays back down.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t wanna deal with this shit.
dialog: Let’s leave first thing in the
dialog: morning.
dialog: 53.
text: Slim and Queen lie next to each other in silence.
text: Slim stares up at the ceiling. In a daze.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: How is that possible? You took
dialog: somebody's life yesterday.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I guess, I’m just used to saying
dialog: I’m okay even when I’m not.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I know the feeling.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What if God wanted me to die and I
dialog: messed up His plan?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t think that’s what He
dialog: wanted.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: How you know?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I just think you were meant to be
dialog: here.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I’m making an executive decision.
dialog: We’re going to Cuba.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Executive decision? What do you
dialog: think this is “Mad Men”?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We can’t leave here tomorrow and
dialog: not know where we’re going.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What about that large body of
dialog: water?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We'll figure it out.
dialog: Queen has never been great at letting men lead. Right now,
text: she doesn’t have much of a choice.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I’m scared.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: That’s alright. I'll be brave
dialog: enough for both of us.
text: Queen lets out a sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, why does your uncle owe you?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I got him out of prison once.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: He killed somebody.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Damn, who'd he kill?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: My mother.
text: Slim is stunned by that answer. But he knows better than to
dialog: ask a follow up question.
text: Slim turns off the light and turns over. Queen’s hand finds
text: its way to his newly shaved head. She rubs it, gently.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m rubbing your head for good
dialog: luck.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don’t believe in luck. I think
dialog: everything is destined.

speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Who the fuck called you?
scene_heading: BLACK POLICE OFFICER
dialog: I’m just here to make sure
dialog: everybody’s okay.

speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: You still fucking this nigga?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Then why the fuck is he here?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I ain’t call him.
text: Earl turns to look at the Black Police Officer.
scene_heading: BLACK POLICE OFFICER
dialog: A neighbor heard some commotion and
dialog: got concerned.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Don’t worry. I take good care of my

scene_heading: BLACK POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Oh yeah. She’s my biggest draw.
text: The Officer looks at the side of the house and sees the

scene_heading: BLACK POLICE OFFICER
dialog: You got a new truck?
dialog: Earl is pissed Slim didn’t park that shit in the back.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: I don’t know whose truck that is.

scene_heading: BLACK POLICE OFFICER

speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Make sure they use the big font. I
dialog: can’t see shit.
scene_heading: BLACK POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Keep your hands to yourself, Earl.
dialog: I don’t wanna have to come back

speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL

scene_heading: INT. UNCLE EARL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - N2 39

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 2 40
text: The truck that the black police officer just took a picture
text: of is currently ENGULFED IN FLAMES. Earl stands back and

text: Goddess hands Earl a small piece of paper.
text: He looks at it for a beat. Then hands it off to Queen, along
text: with an envelope full of cash.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Take this.
text: The piece of paper has an address written on it.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: That should cover your gas for most

dialog: The address is in Florida.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Johnny Shepherd? Who’s he?
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: We served together. I saved his

dialog: And he know a guy with a plane that

dialog: water.
text: Queen hugs Earl as if she’1ll never hug him again.
text: Then Earl hands Slim the keys to his BRIGHT RED CADILLAC. The

dialog: film.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Thank you, Uncle Earl.

dialog: 42
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL
dialog: Nigga, I ain’t yo uncle!
text: And with that Slim gets in the car.

speaker_heading: UNCLE EARL (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 2 Al

scene_heading: he has albums by : FRANKIE BEVERLY & MAZE / THE OJAYS /
scene_heading: GEORGE CLINTON.
text: He also has albums by : TUPAC, TRU, and JOE.
text: She picks one up and sticks it in the player.

text: turns it back up.
text: He looks at her and smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN ROAD - DAY 3 (DAWN) 42
text: Slim and Queen drive through the bible belt. It’s a mix of
text: beautiful landscapes and poverty.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It’s beautiful out here.
text: Then they see a bunch of PRISONERS working the land. They’re
text: in a long line. Moving in unison.
dialog: 59.
text: Queen’s heart aches for the men in blue jumpsuits who mean
dialog: nothing more to this country than a pair of strong hands that
dialog: can do cheap manual labor.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I'm just tryna make conversation.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I’m just being honest.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Do you have to be honest all the
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Do you want me to be silent?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I didn’t say that.
text: There’s an awkward silence. Then Queen stares out the window
text: for a bit. She takes in the fields, the colorful sky, and the
text: birds chirping. He’s right. It is beautiful. But there are
text: still some ugly parts she can’t ignore.
text: Queen searches through the CDs and finds a pleasant surprise.
text: She shoves it in and hits play.
text: Queen climbs into the backseat and lays on her back. Letting
text: the wind blow through her long flowing wig.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: What you doing?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I’m gon try to get some sleep.
text: Slim has gotten more comfortable driving the Cadillac. He

text: Slim pulls over and slows down.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What are you doing? Are you crazy?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I heard a band playing, I wanted to

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM

dialog: the second date. Now, where we
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I’m taking you dancing. Let’s go.
text: Slim gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Can we dance once we get to where
dialog: we're going? Just to be safe.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I’m tired of playing it safe.
text: Slim extends his hand to her.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You're willing to risk getting
dialog: caught just so we can dance?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Hell yeah.
text: Queen isn’t convinced.
dialog: 44
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: One dance and we can leave. I
dialog: promise.
text: She refuses to budge.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘1l buy you a drink.
text: And with that, she grabs his hand and we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JUKE JOINT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 3 44
text: This place is so crowded the walls are sweating. This small
text: establishment feels like it was built during a time when
dialog: black folks still had to drink from the shitty water
dialog: fountain.
text: The lighting is pretty dim. And everyone is on the dance
text: floor grinding slow and hard to a THREE MAN BAND playing B.B.
dialog: King’s “How Blue Can You Get.”
text: Slim takes Queen’s hand. Startling her.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Why you so jumpy?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I’m nervous.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Ain’t nobody in here thinking ‘bout
dialog: us.
text: She rolls her eyes. Slim leads her to the middle of the dance
text: floor and pulls her in close. She shoves him away.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Watch your hands.
text: Queen slowly puts her arms around Slim’s neck. He puts his
text: arms around her waist, careful not to touch her ass. The
text: music gets louder and even more soulful as Queen and Slim
text: start to find their groove.
text: Slim looks around and realizes the prettiest girl in this
text: place is in his arms. He can’t help but grin from ear to ear.
text: Then he looks down and sees Queen has rested her head on his
text: chest. She’s so close she can hear his heartbeat.
dialog: 63.
text: And right now it’s beating pretty fast. So is hers. Slim
text: holds Queen a little tighter. She wipes the sweat from his
dialog: brow.
text: As the song reaches a thunderous CRESCENDO Slim leans in for
text: a kiss - caught in the moment - Queen denies him.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t you owe me a drink?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Bourbon. The expensive kind.
text: Slim makes his way through the crowd. A few people look at
text: him longer than they should.
text: He makes it to the bar and finds a HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
text: slinging drinks. She recognizes Slim right away.
scene_heading: HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
dialog: Hey handsome!
dialog: Slim has never been referred to as handsome before.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Hi.
text: He is out of his depth as he tries to pick the right alcohol.
scene_heading: HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
dialog: What can I get you?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Bourbon.
text: She grabs a dusty bottle of bourbon from high on the shelf
text: and pours two shots.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t drink.
scene_heading: HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN
dialog: Maybe you should start.
text: He looks at her perplexed.
scene_heading: HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: These are on the house.
text: Slim grabs the drinks, but before he can leave she touches
text: his hand.
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: HEAVY SET BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t worry. You’re safe here.
text: They share a head nod.
text: Then Slim quickly grabs the drinks and goes to find Queen.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: The bartender recognized me.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Oh shit. We gotta go.
text: Slim looks around and sees nothing but friendly and
text: supportive faces.
text: Queen drinks the shot. Slim drinks his too. It burns the fuck
text: out of his throat. Queen pats his chest and pulls him in
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I think we good.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Trust me.
text: She looks him deep in the eyes and allows herself to let go.
text: The band plays a slower song. It’s romantic yet rough.
text: Queen and Slim sway back and forth. Holding each other tight.
text: Burying their faces in each other’s shoulders.
text: Some of the crowd backs away. Watching them. Admiring them.
text: Rooting for them. Praying for them.
text: This looks like the first dance at a small wedding. Queen and
text: Slim look like a happy couple with their whole lives ahead of
dialog: them.
text: As the song comes to a close the crowd applauds the band.
dialog: Then --
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We should go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: 45 INT. CAR - NIGHT 3 45
text: Queen has her bare feet up on the dashboard. Slim gives her
text: the side eye.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You lucky you got cute feet.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Even if they weren’t they’d still
dialog: be sitting right here.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Nah, I would’ve stopped and got you
dialog: some gym socks or something.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That’s messed up.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Honestly, I don’t think dudes even
dialog: cared about women’s feet until
dialog: Eddie Murphy made it a thing.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I know. But the difference is he
dialog: can be picky about a woman’s feet.
dialog: The rest of y’all need to be happy
dialog: somebody's even laying next to yo
dialog: ass.
text: She can see Slim is falling asleep at the wheel again.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You need me to drive?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Nah, I got it.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No, you don’t.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I’m good.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Explain something to me. Why do
dialog: dudes not like asking for help?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It’s a sign of weakness.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You say that but then turn around
dialog: and want a strong mandingo type
dialog: muthafucka.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t want that.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That's a loaded question.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We ain’t got nothing but time.
text: Queen leans back in her seat. She’s so far back she’s
text: practically lying down. Like she were at a therapy session.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I want a guy to show me myself.
text: Slim glances at her. Her legs are on full display.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I want him to love me so deeply I’m
dialog: not afraid to show him how ugly I
dialog: can be. I want him to show me scars
dialog: I never knew I had. But I don’t
dialog: want him to make them go away - I
dialog: want him to hold my hand while I
dialog: nurse them myself - and then I want
dialog: him to cherish the bruises they
dialog: leave behind.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Damn, no wonder you still single.
dialog: That’s a lot of shit.
text: She can’t help but crack a smile.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Maybe it is.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: But you deserve that.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t think we deserve anything
dialog: in this life. We get what we work
dialog: for. That’s it.
text: She watches him drive. Drinking him in.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you want?
text: He breathes deep.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I want somebody that’s ride or die.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Oh God. What does that even mean?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I just want somebody that’s always
dialog: gon love me. No matter what. I want
dialog: someone that’s gon hold my hand and
dialog: never let it go.
text: He looks over at Queen. They lock eyes. She wants to look
text: away, but can’t.
dialog: She's never heard someone describe love in such simple terms.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: She gotta be special though - cause
dialog: she gon be my legacy.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Look, I ain’t gon bend the world.
dialog: As long as my lady remembers me
dialog: fondly. That’s all I need.
dialog: As Queen lets that sink in, we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: B46 EXT. STREET - LATER B46
text: Slim pulls into a gas station.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 46
dialog: 47
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION - BATHROOM - DAY 4 46
text: Queen tries not to touch anything while washing up in a
dialog: disgusting bathroom.
text: She looks in the mirror for a long beat. Wondering how she
text: got here. Wondering what the future holds.
text: Queen looks around the bathroom and realizes she’s all alone
dialog: in the world.
text: Then - KNOCK KNOCK.
speaker_heading: SLIM (0.S.)
dialog: You okay in there?
text: For the first time in her life a man’s voice reassures her
text: that she’s not alone.
text: The sound of Slim’s voice reminds her there’s a chance
dialog: everything will be okay.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yeah, I’m good.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 4 47
text: Slim leans against the wall outside the bathroom door.
text: He watches people as they walk by. He wonders if they
text: recognize him. He wonders if they’re going to turn him in.
text: Then he spots a LITTLE BLACK GIRL walking with her MOTHER.
text: The Little Girl locks eyes with Slim. She gives him the stink
text: eye for staring at her.
text: Then she laughs at him. As if to taunt him for losing a
dialog: staring competition he never knew he was a part of. The
text: Little Girl’s sassy demeanor reminds him of Queen. This
text: brings a smile to his face.
text: As he stands there in a daze - Queen bursts out of the
text: bathroom. Almost as if she’s reborn.
text: They look at each other. Both smitten. Unsure of what the
text: future holds. Then - Queen extends her hand to him.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 48
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You wash your hands?
text: She grabs his hand with glee and they both rush to get back
text: in the car.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - LATER - DAY 4 48
text: Queen is driving now. Slim rubs his bald head.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Skinny Luther or fat Luther?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Uh, skinny Luther.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Ah fuck.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don’t trust people that like
dialog: skinny Luther.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Skinny Luther was dope. He had a
dialog: lot more energy. He sang better.
text: And his clothes fit.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You crazy as hell. Fat Luther was
dialog: the shit. Who else you know can
text: pull off a jheri curl and a three
dialog: piece suit at the same damn time?
text: She's quiet.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Right, nobody.
text: As she continues to drive she sees a few HORSES grazing the
text: land. She immediately pulls over.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: What you doing? I thought you said
dialog: no more stopping.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I changed my mind.
dialog: 49
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You can’t change your mind. We
dialog: gotta go.
text: She puts her hand on his thigh.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Relax.
text: He does. She slowly gets out of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 4 49
text: Queen walks up to the horses. Judging by her demeanor she’s
text: more comfortable around animals than she is people.
text: She goes up to one and takes the horse’s nose in her hands.
text: She becomes one with this beautiful living creature.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You crazy? What if it gets scared
dialog: and kicks you in the face?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: They're not wild.
text: Queen takes his hand and forces him to pet the horse. The
text: horse is calm and so is Slim.
text: It’s quiet all around them.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: How you know so much about horses?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: My uncle used to take me horseback
dialog: riding when I was a kid.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I told you he didn’t used to always
dialog: be like that.
text: Queen walks over to the other horse and looks in its eyes.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: He told me nothing scares a white
dialog: man more than seeing a black man on
text: a horse.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Because they have to look up at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I’ve never been on a horse.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You should try it sometime.
text: Queen starts walking back to the car. Slim doesn’t follow
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Maybe I should do it right now.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You can do it when we have more
dialog: time. I’1l take you.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What if we don’t make it?
text: The weight of his question renders them both speechless.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We will.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You don’t know that.
text: He’s right. She doesn’t.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me get on the horse.
text: Queen walks over to him.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Which one is the calmest?
text: Queen chooses the one that’s still grazing. She holds Slim’s
text: hand and helps HOIST him up onto the horse.
dialog: 50
dialog: 51
dialog: 72.
text: The horse BUCKS at first. Then Queen whispers to the horse
text: and eventually the stallion calms down.
text: Slim is nervous at first, but eventually he relaxes. After a
text: moment Slim’s posture shifts. He puffs out his chest and
text: looks out into the world like the king he is.
text: Queen looks up at him. They hold each other’s gaze for a long
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: It’s nice isn’t it?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Then -
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Hey!
text: The horse BUCKS again. But only this time Queen can’t calm
text: him down. The horse knocks Slim off his back. Slim hits the
text: ground HARD. Getting the wind knocked out of him.
text: Queen helps him up and they run to the Cadillac.
text: They hop in the car and speed off!
scene_heading: INT. CAR - LATER THAT AFTERNOON - DAY 4 50
text: As the sun starts to set, the Cadillac starts to smoke.
text: The smoke is coming from UNDERNEATH the car.
text: Slim pulls over.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - CONTINUOUS - DAY 4 51
text: Slim is under the car. It’s smoking like crazy. Queen stands
text: over him. Freaking out.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I think there’s a body shop up the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: SLIM
text: Really far up the road.
text: Queen walks to the back of the car and assumes the position.
dialog: 52
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Then we should start pushing.
text: Slim gives in and they both start pushing the car up the
text: road. They try to hurry while they still have light.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - GARAGE - 45 MINUTES LATER - DAY 4 52
text: Slim and Queen are spent. An OLDER BLACK MAN chews tobacco
text: and blinks at them.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: Your transmission’s fucked.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: That don’t sound good.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: I can have it back to you tomorrow
dialog: for about two grand.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Two grand?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We need it back today.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: Y'all in a rush?
text: He looks at them suspiciously.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yeah, we’re on our way to visit
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: Why y’all in a rush to do that?
text: He lets out a hearty laugh and then spits tobacco juice ina
dialog: cup.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I can try to get it back to you
dialog: tonight but that'll cost you a
dialog: little mo.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: How much mo?
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: Another five hundred.
text: Slim pulls Queen to the side.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That’s all of our money.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Then fuck it - let’s just hop on a
dialog: bus or something.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That's too risky.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You wanna give him all our money?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We need to get the car fixed.
dialog: Then --
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Yo, we doing this or not?
text: Queen walks over and hands him the envelope full of cash.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Here. This is all we have.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We just need the car fixed as soon
dialog: as possible.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: I’ll move as fast as I can.
text: Slim looks up and sees the mechanic’s office. He clocks a
text: ROTARY PHONE sitting on his desk.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Can I use your bathroom?
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: Yeah, it’s right through there.
text: Queen sits on a bench. Arms folded. Looking at the clock.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 53
dialog: 54
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: INT. OLDER BLACK MAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 4 53
text: Slim sits in the bathroom holding the rotary phone on his
text: lap. He takes a deep breath.
text: Then he dials. Slowly. We hear the phone ring.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE
dialog: Are you okay, boy?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah, I’m fine.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE
dialog: This ain’t like you.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I know.
dialog: Then --
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I just wanted you to know I’m okay.
dialog: And that I love you.
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE
dialog: I love you too, son.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We're tryna get to --
text: His father hangs up. Slim looks at the phone. Wondering what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SLIM'S CHILDHOOD HOME - CONTINUOUS - DAY 4 54
text: We see a POLICE OFFICER was listening to their conversation.
text: SLIM'S MOTHER, a dignified woman who never leaves the house
text: without makeup on, sits next to her husband - defiantly.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Why the fuck would you do that?!
text: The Police Officer snatches the phone from Slim’s Father.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S FATHER
dialog: Get outta my house.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: You're under arrest for helping a
dialog: fugitive.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S FATHER
dialog: Do what you gotta do.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: We're going to find them.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S FATHER
dialog: Not with my help.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 55 INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 4 55
text: The Older Black Man fixes the transmission while Slim and
text: Queen wait impatiently.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: Y'all are making me nervous. Why
dialog: don’t y’all go take a walk or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We're not leaving you alone with
dialog: this car.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: Ain’t nobody tryna steal your car.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Well I just wanna make sure.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: You got bigger problems than me.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: So you know who we are?
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: I’m old not blind.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Then why ain’t you give us a
dialog: discount?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: Cause unlike the rest of these
dialog: simple ass niggas I don’t approve
dialog: of what y’all did.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We didn’t do it on purpose.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: It don’t matter if it was on
dialog: purpose or not. You gave them a
dialog: license to kill us.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: That cop shot at me.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: You gave ‘em an excuse.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You weren’t there.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: No, I wasn’t. But if I was I
dialog: would’ve taken the ticket and been
dialog: on my way.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Can you work more and talk less?
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: I could work faster if y’all left
dialog: me the fuck alone.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I’m not leaving this car.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: What if I gave you some insurance?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t want no house keys or no
dialog: drivers license cause all that can
dialog: be replaced.
text: The Older mechanic walks to the garage door and knocks on it.
text: After a beat a SKINNY BROWN KID no more than seventeen lifts
text: it up. The young man looks like Barack Obama long before he
text: fell in love with Michelle. He wears a dirty T-shirt and
dialog: skinny jeans.
scene_heading: SKINNY BROWN KID
dialog: Yes, sir?
dialog: 56
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: You wanna take these nice folks on
dialog: a walk?
text: One look at Queen and Slim and he lights up like a Christmas
text: tree. He obviously doesn’t share his father’s views about
dialog: them.
scene_heading: SKINNY BROWN KID
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: Then -
speaker_heading: SKINNY BROWN KID (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: OLDER BLACK MAN
dialog: I need some time to fix their car.
dialog: Keep ‘em occupied until then.
scene_heading: SKINNY BROWN KID
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Slim walks over and shakes the young man’s hand.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I'm -
scene_heading: SKINNY BROWN KID
dialog: I know who you are. It’s an honor
dialog: to meet you.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What’s your name?
scene_heading: SKINNY BROWN KID
dialog: Everybody calls me Junior.
text: His father beams with pride.
text: Then Junior takes Queen’s hand and kisses it, sweetly.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - AFTERNOON - DAY 4 56
text: Queen and Slim walk hand in hand. Junior leads the way.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Where is everybody?
speaker_heading: JUNIOR
dialog: There’s nothing to do around here.
dialog: People just go to work and go home.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I know the feeling.
speaker_heading: JUNIOR
dialog: I can’t believe y’all are here. I
dialog: was just watching you on TV and now
dialog: you're right here next to me. Shit
dialog: is crazy.
dialog: Slim remembers what it was like to be Junior's age. When the
text: weight of the world wasn’t on his shoulders and everything
dialog: was exciting.
speaker_heading: JUNIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope y’all make it.
dialog: Without knowing it Junior reminds them their days could be
dialog: numbered - and every breath should be cherished.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: JUNIOR
dialog: Even if y’all don’t it’1ll be okay.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: JUNIOR
dialog: Cause then you’1ll be immortal.
text: Slim walks quietly - digesting the thought.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I like that.
text: Queen takes a deep breath. Drinking in her simple
text: surroundings. Appreciating the quiet. For once. Then --
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I'd rather live.
text: They finally arrive at Junior's secret spot. It’s a small
text: hill with a perfect view of the sunset.
text: Queen, Slim, and Junior sit on the grass and marvel at the
text: sun as it prepares to say goodnight.
text: Queen looks at the purple and orange sky - then she looks at
text: Slim. He’s so serene. He’s made peace with whatever the
text: outcome will be. Junior looks up to him. Literally and
dialog: figuratively.
text: And for the first time in her life - she sees God.
dialog: 57
dialog: 58
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT - NIGHT 4 57
text: Queen and Slim get back in their newly repaired Cadillac. She
text: turns on the car and it hums like it just came off the
dialog: factory line.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yo, Junior. Can you take our
dialog: picture?
speaker_heading: JUNIOR
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I don’t think that’s a good idea.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Come on, I want proof we were here.
dialog: This is proof Slim remembers everything. She likes that he’s
text: using her own logic against her.
text: She gives in. And they both look at Junior - ready to be
dialog: captured.
text: Queen has her hand on the wheel. Her toned arm on full
text: display. Slim leans forward. He doesn’t look at the camera -
text: he looks at her as if she were his bride to be.
text: Queen stares directly into the lens, the look in her eyes is
text: the perfect combination of fear and pride.
text: We linger on them long enough to realize they’re no longer
dialog: the people we met at the diner.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT 4 58
text: Queen is driving. Deep in thought. Slim is fast asleep.
text: They drive by a sign that reads WELCOME TO GEORGIA.
text: Queen stares at it for a long beat. It brings back an
dialog: unwanted memory.
text: She makes an impulsive turn. Jolting Slim awake.
dialog: 59
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yo.
text: She’s on a mission.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Do you mind if we make a detour?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I do actually.
text: Queen doesn’t care and makes a hard left turn. She drives
text: down a winding road. Tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Not really.
text: He sits up and wipes the sleep out of his eyes.
text: Slim can tell she needs to be held in this moment, but he
text: doesn’t know if that’s permitted. He reaches out and touches
text: the small of her back. She allows it.
text: His hand is bigger than she realized. He rubs her back softly
text: at first - then he applies more pressure to help her relax
dialog: and to make sure she feels his presence in a way she hasn’t
dialog: before.
text: Her heart is beating so fast he can feel her body pulse. His
text: heartbeat syncs up with hers. They are connected.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER - DAWN 59
text: Queen stares at a tombstone.
scene_heading: ETTA JOHNSON - BELOVED MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.
text: Slim stands a few feet behind her. Far enough to give her
text: space. But close enough to let her know she’s not alone.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: We were close when I was younger,
dialog: but when I got older I felt like I
dialog: didn’t know her anymore. She didn’t
dialog: know me either. We could go months
dialog: without talking. And when we did -
dialog: I hated it. I had nothing to say to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: She wanted a connection so badly,
dialog: but I just didn’t care. I didn’t
dialog: need her anymore.
text: She turns to look at Slim. Searching for judgement in his
text: eyes. There is none.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I used to call her the great
dialog: pretender.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: She was really good at acting like
dialog: everything was okay.
text: Queen extends her hand to Slim. He takes it and moves in
dialog: closer.
text: She kneels down and pulls up a few weeds crowding her
text: mother’s resting place - all the while still holding onto
text: Slim’s hand. Queen kisses her palm and touches the cold
dialog: tombstone.
dialog: This is what closure looks like.
text: She lets go of Slim’s hand and makes her way back to the car.
text: Slim hangs back. He stares at her mother’s grave a little
dialog: longer.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - HOURS LATER - DAY 5 60
text: Queen and Slim sit in a parked car. Slim is in the driver's
text: seat. Queen is in the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: My grandma left the house to both
dialog: of them. My mom wanted to sell it.
dialog: My uncle wanted to live in it.
dialog: Typical family bullshit.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: One night they were at the house
dialog: fighting, he was really fucked up,

speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: She bled out so quick that by the
dialog: time the ambulance got there she
dialog: was already dead.
text: Slim hangs his head. Unsure of what to say.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I had just passed the bar. I was
dialog: excited to try my first case. I
dialog: never thought that would be it.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: How could you defend the person
dialog: that killed your own mother?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I knew it was an accident.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Does it ever piss you off that he’s
dialog: alive and she isn’t?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: All the time.
text: Queen turns on the RADIO. We hear a journalist ON THE RADIO
text: reporting on a NATIONWIDE PEACEFUL RALLY in progress.
scene_heading: RADIO PERSONALITY
dialog: People are in support of the two
dialog: fugitives accused of killing a
text: police officer in cold blood.
dialog: Slim and Queen aren’t really listening to the radio. It’s
text: just background noise to them.
text: Then Slim takes Queen’s face in his reliable hands and kisses
text: her. It’s so pure and innocent - it’s unclear if sex will
dialog: follow.
text: But then he pulls her in close and kisses her again. The
dialog: second kiss is anything, but innocent. It’s the perfect
text: combination of lust and melancholy. Slim pulls Queen on top
text: of him. Rather than entering her right away - he lifts her up
text: to his face - her hands press up against the ceiling while he
text: DEVOURS her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: He joins - A SEA OF BLACK and BROWN BODIES are MARCHING in
text: PROTEST. They are full of PRIDE and VENOM.
text: They hold up signs in support of Queen and Slim. They chant

text: The PROTESTORS are surrounded by POLICE OFFICERS. The

speaker_heading: JUNIOR
dialog: I have a right to protest.
scene_heading: BLACK POLICE OFFICER
dialog: I understand that, but you don’t

speaker_heading: JUNIOR

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM

scene_heading: MR. SHEPHERD MRS. SHEPHERD
dialog: Amen. Amen.
text: Everyone starts to eat. Queen looks up at Slim and notices

text: He’s not chewing like a cow. He’s taking his time and
text: savoring every bite. This is a change he isn’t aware of, but

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
text: The house is surrounded. Come out

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MR. SHEPHERD
dialog: Go. Now!

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)

dialog: can.
text: They move quickly - but they aren’t fast enough.
text: Determined FOOTSTEPS make their way into the bedroom. The

text: We follow the FEET looking in the closet and then out the
dialog: window to see if they jumped.
text: Then we PAN UP to reveal the feet belong to the Swat Leader

scene_heading: INT./EXT. SHEPHERD HOME - BEDROOM / BACKYARD - DAY 6 79

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: All you have to do is bend your

speaker_heading: SLIM

text: and forgets to bend her knees.
text: She hits the ground HARD and lands flat on her back knocking
text: the wind out of her body and her LEFT SHOULDER OUT OF ITS
text: SOCKET. Queen grabs her arm and rocks back and forth trying
text: not to scream. She’s in excruciating pain.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck!
text: Seeing Queen in pain is the push he needed. He walks back a

speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Give me your shirt.

speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)

dialog: He knew better than to leave that

speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I see why.

dialog: He remembers why he became a cop. To help people. And at the
dialog: moment, no one needs his help more than the two people in

text: They have a staring contest for about three seconds.
text: Then he takes a few steps back and gives them room to back
dialog: up.
text: Slim puts the car in reverse and moves the car back slowly.

text: Police Officer 1 nods his head as a way to say, “go head”.

text: her face. For the first time in her life she feels completely
dialog: free. No fear.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What you doing?
text: She doesn’t respond. Queen unbuckles her seatbelt and hoists
text: herself up onto the window sill and leans on the roof of the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you crazy?! Get back in the
dialog: car!
text: She looks up at the sky. The stars seem bigger to her. Queen

speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you tryna get caught?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No, I just always wanted to do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Well, don’t do it while I’m
dialog: driving.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You should try it.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Nah, I’m good.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Pull over.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No.
text: She grabs the steering wheel and YANKS it to the left. They

speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: If I do it will you please let me

speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Swear to God.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Swear on something you believe in.

speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Okay fine, I’1l swear on you.

text: He finally gets up there and tries to hold onto the roof of
text: the car, but his hands are sweaty so he loses his grip and
text: FALLS BACK - with his arms flailing in the air.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Oh shit!
text: Before he flies out of the car he grabs a hold of the

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Fuck this, I’m coming back in.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No, you got it. You’re good. I’1l
dialog: drive slow.
text: She slows down a bit and Slim finally gets a firm hold of the
dialog: roof.
text: Queen picks up a little speed and Slim gets a whiff of the

text: It looks like an abandoned plantation.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Are you sure this is the address?
dialog: 101.
text: Slim gets out of the car and looks around. There’s no sign of
dialog: human life anywhere.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you please just get back in
dialog: the car before you get shot.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Ain’t nobody out here.
text: Slim gets back in the car. They’re both exhausted from
dialog: driving all day.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I was hoping we'd pull up toa
dialog: house so we could get some sleep.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Well, there isn’t one.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I can see that.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: They're gonna find us.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No they’re not.
text: Queen shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: How about you get in the back and
dialog: get some sleep and I’1l sit up here
dialog: and make sure nobody kills us.
text: She gets out of the car and climbs in the back.
text: The backseat is practically a bed anyway. Slim takes off his
text: jacket and places it behind her head from the front seat.
text: Queen curls up in a ball and closes her eyes. Slim stares off
text: into the night. While he looks up at the stars, he hears --
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I can’t sleep.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You want me to turn on the radio?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: No. I want you to tell me a story.
text: He turns to look at her. Confused and annoyed.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What kind of story?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Any story. I don’t care.
text: He fidgets with his hands as he begins to speak.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: When I was little I asked my mom
dialog: where babies come from. She said I
dialog: was too young to know. So I went
dialog: asked my dad. He said babies are
dialog: the product of two people that
dialog: needed something from each other. I
dialog: didn’t know what that meant. So I
dialog: said -- needed what? He said maybe
dialog: they needed to feel seen. Maybe
dialog: they needed to feel loved. Maybe
dialog: they needed to feel human.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Then I asked my grandmother and she
dialog: said -- babies come from God.
dialog: They're His way of making sure no
dialog: one ever really dies. I remember
dialog: her saying “through our children we
dialog: are reborn.”
text: Queen smiles.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I went to my older brother and
dialog: asked him and he said, nobody
dialog: knows. You're just born. That’s it.
dialog: Now leave me alone.
text: Slim chuckles at the memory.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT'D)
dialog: I wasn’t satisfied with that answer
dialog: either, but I’d run out of family
dialog: members to ask - so he got the last
dialog: word.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: So whose right?
dialog: 102.
text: Tears well up in Slim’s eyes. He wonders if he’ll ever see
dialog: them again.
dialog: 89
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: None of ‘em. Babies come from
dialog: fucking. Plain and simple.
text: They both chuckle.
text: Then Queen’s eyelids become heavy. She eventually closes her
text: eyes and falls asleep.
text: Slim stares at her. Grinning. Watching her sleep has quickly
text: become one of his favorite pastimes. After a moment he finds
text: it hard to keep his eyes open as well.
text: Soon - they’re both fast asleep. In a station wagon. In the

text: Slim is in a deep sleep. Mouth open. Head tilted.
text: Then we hear - CLICK CLACK. Slim JOLTS awake.
text: There's a RIFLE aimed at Slim’s face. Once his brain computes
text: what’s happening he scoots over into the drivers seat - this
text: causes Queen to wake up too.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What’s going on?
text: She looks at the man holding the rifle. He’s a BLACK MAN with
text: a scruffy BEARD and inquisitive eyes.
text: He’s wearing an oversized white t-shirt and his teeth are
text: covered in 14 karat GOLD grillz.
text: Queen and Slim aren’t sure if they should feel anxious or at

speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: Hell yeah.
speaker_heading: QUEEN

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN

text: Slim doesn’t want to confess to this.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: Man, I don’t know - why you giving

text: Queen and Slim try to keep up with him.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: They said you had a plane.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN

speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Why can’t you call him right now?
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: Cause I ain’t got my phone on me.

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew you wanted to hit that shit.
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Live yo life, sis!

speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Come on. For me.

dialog: Power to the muthafucking people.

text: TWO COPS step out of each vehicle. GUNS DRAWN.

speaker_heading: BOOM!

dialog: And just like that... a complex beauty with beautiful brown

text: Slim kneels down and takes her in his arms. He stands up
text: holding her lifeless body.
text: With tears streaming down his face he walks toward the police
text: slowly and deliberately. The police are stunned and confused.
dialog: What the fuck is he doing?
text: It doesn’t matter. All we know, is his death is imminent.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Stop walking!

speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop or we’ll shoot!
text: He keeps walking. Defiantly.
dialog: Then -- BOOM! BOOM!
text: Two bullets BLOW through his chest. He plummets to the
text: ground. Never letting go of her.
text: He died just as he had lived - with pride and a quiet
dialog: dignity.
text: They both lay there on the pavement. In a pool of their own
text: blood. Their bodies making an unintentional cross.
dialog: 93
dialog: 94
dialog: 110.
text: The COPS put their guns down. Feeling powerful and guilty at

text: Observing them. Not unlike a hunter observes his prey.
