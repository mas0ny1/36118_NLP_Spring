dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: ANN, having feigned unconsciousness, she now cautiously
text: searches for a way to escape.
speaker_heading: C
text: LOSE ON: ANN LIFTING HER HEAD, risking a quick look around. The

dialog: 
text: ... but there is a NARROW STAIRWAY across the COURTYARD, leading
text: down into the JUNGLE.
dialog: 
text: INCH by INCH ANN starts to EDGE FORWARD, CRAWLING on her STOMACH
text: towards the STAIRS. KONG is CHEWING NOISILY ... he SHIFTS HIS
text: WEIGHT, half turning ... ANN FREEZES.
dialog: 
text: ONG GLANCES at ANN, who has resumed her LIFELESS POSE. KONG
text: doesn't appear to notice she's moved several feet. He continues
dialog: EATING ...
dialog: 
text: ANN again starts to EDGE FORWARD ... she is STARTLED when some
text: CREEPY INSECTS swarm out of a CRACK in the FLAGSTONES, inches from
dialog: her FACE!
dialog: 
text: With only a few feet left to go, ANN quietly rises and scurries
text: towards the STAIRWAY. She clambers into the NARROW PASSAGE -

dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: ANN, flat on the ground, eyes shut, lying still.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: ... ANN SPRINGS UP, looks at KONG for a desperate moment, wonders

dialog: another PRATFALL!!
text: KONG cocks his HEAD! He GRIMACES, baring his teeth and CIRCLES
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: ANN repeats the COMIC FALL! KONG SLAPS his HANDS on the GROUND,
text: SHAKES his HEAD and GROWLS.
dialog: 
text: ANN starts to draw upon her VAUDEVILLE ROUTINE, swaying drunkenly
text: and falling, then bouncing back up ... working her timing around
text: KONG'S reactions - he grows increasingly ENGAGED.
dialog: 
text: NGLE ON: ANN BOUNCES UP ... PANTING ... BEADS of SWEAT trickle
text: down her face. Her EYES dart between the JUNGLE and KONG, she's
dialog: looking for her chance ...
dialog: 
dialog: ... but KONG is a DEMANDING audience. He wants more ... he wants
text: ANN to fall down again.
dialog: 
text: KONG PRODS ANN ROUGHLY, knocking her OFF HER FEET. She FALLS to
text: the GROUND ... WINDED.
dialog: 
text: KONG slaps his hands on the GROUND, and lets out another EXCITED
text: GROWL. He thumps the GROUND with his FISTS, and SHAKES his HEAD,
text: delighted with the GAME.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
text: ANN tries to get up - KONG pushes her over again! This time she
text: stays on the GROUND, breathing HEAVILY.
dialog: 
text: HUMP! THUMP! THUMP! KONG wants more! He tries to PROD ANN into

dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: ANN shuts her eyes ... KONG'S FIST THUDS into the ground
text: inches away from her.
dialog: 
text: THUD! Another FIST SLAMS into the GROUND!
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: KONG ROARS and beats his chest in a dramatic display of
text: ANGER and FRUSTRATION. He rips a TREE from the ground as his ANGER
text: spirals into violent MADNESS.
dialog: 
text: LOSE ON: ANN as the GROUND SHAKES with the fury of his RAGE. For
text: a brief moment KONG and ANN lock in EYE CONTACT!
speaker_heading: C
text: LOSE ON: KONG stares at the small figure in his hand who is
text: waiting for DEATH to come.
dialog: 
text: In this moment an UNFAMILIAR feeling wells inside him ... a half
dialog: formed emotion he hasn't experienced much in his long life: he
dialog: feels a connection to this tiny creature.
dialog: 
text: The SPARK of RAGE goes out in KONG'S EYES ...
dialog: 
text: KONG stares at ANN as a confusion of feelings wash over him.
dialog: 
text: ONG pulls back from ANN ... overcome by sudden UNCERTAINTY. He
text: knows only that she has somehow disarmed him ... and this has in
text: turn, DIMINISHED his power.
dialog: 
text: KONG starts to BACK AWAY from ANN - slowly at first, until DOUBT
text: and FEAR compel him to move faster. Suddenly he turns away.
dialog: 
text: ANN watches as KONG lopes off. He pulls himself up and over a
text: RUINED WALL and DISAPPEARS from SIGHT.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: She falls amongst the roots, lying as flat as possible, praying

dialog:

dialog: 
text: KONG looks from ANN to the HUGE STATUE ...
dialog: 
text: KONG POV: ANN is dwarfed by the STONE MONOLITH.
dialog: 
text: PUSH IN on KONG ... a growing sense of REALISATION as he comes to
text: understand the STATUE is in fact a reflection of himself.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: KONG looking down at his hands ... it's as if he is

dialog: 
text: ONG won't look at her.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He looks out over the JUNGLE CANOPY. ANN follows his GAZE, taking
