speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
scene_heading: DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE
text: Muffled by the wet green forest.
text: The very earth seems to tremble.
speaker_heading: A RABBIT
text: Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs
dialog: the air.
scene_heading: LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES
text: VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR
text: SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion.
text: A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death.
text: A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched
text: over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE.
text: For a moment the forest takes a breath.
text: Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep
text: Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.
text: A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.
text: It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.
text: Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias
text: indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.
text: His face might be attractive, under other conditions.
text: He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard-
text: issue field jacket.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Where the hell are those Krauts?
text: To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's "I'll Be
dialog: Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering
text: the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.
text: He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and
text: tries to go over it.
text: The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.
text: The BACK TIRES spin.
text: Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his
text: face. Assesses the situation.
text: He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever
dialog: the Jeep free. When --
text: The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.
text: The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls
text: in the mud.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Shit.
text: Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on
text: foot through the forest.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING
text: Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against
text: a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun.
text: Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN.
text: But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around
text: the corner of it.
text: Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation.
text: Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to
text: hear them but he watches their every move.
text: They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their
text: Karabiners rest slung across their backs.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Bingo.
scene_heading: AGAINST THE TREE
text: Kelly focuses himself.
text: Then he shoulders his carbine.
text: Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: "And so they buried Hector, breaker
dialog: of horses."
text: He takes his Smith &amp; Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt
text: and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the
dialog: guards.
text: Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see
dialog: him.
text: But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.
text: Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but
dialog: does not aim it.
text: Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself
dialog: an easy target.
text: Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get
dialog: himself killed.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN
text: Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans, FIRES into
dialog: the air and waves --
text: -- when from behind him comes a voice.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Eine maus findet den kase.
text: Kelly whips around to face a third German, the OFFICER.
text: His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young
text: face. Point blank range.
dialog: Only - Kelly doesn't fire.
text: He just lowers the pistol.
text: The German smiles.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Kill me Adolf.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Mien Prisoner!
text: The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come
dialog: running.
text: One of them yanks Kelly's hands behind his back and pushes
text: him into the barn roughly.
text: Kelly doesn't struggle.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you
dialog: waiting for? Kill me.
scene_heading: INT. BARN
text: Kelly sits slumped in a chair, legs tied up. One of the
text: Germans shines a flashlight in his face. Kelly squints.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Come on you pussies. Let's get this
text: over with.
text: The German Officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain
dialog: pen.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: (German accent)
dialog: You will write your mother. Tell her
dialog: how you will die now.
text: Kelly takes the pen and examines it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Genuine Third Reich issue, no less.
dialog: Nice work.
text: The Officer pokes the paper.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: You will write. How you die alone.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: My mother and I don't have that kind
dialog: of relationship.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: (hisses)
dialog: Write.
text: Kelly thinks about it for a minute - should he or shouldn't
text: he - but sighs and begins writing. After a few lines, the
text: Officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an
dialog: Infantryman.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Enough. Now you will beg for your
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What don't you understand?
speaker_heading: INFANTRYMAN
dialog: (interrupts sheepishly
dialog: in German accent)
dialog: The protocol says we should -
text: The Officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker. He seems
text: to be getting a bit hysterical.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: I am the fucking protocol.
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Beg!
text: He and Kelly glare at each other.
text: The Officer FIRES his Luger into the rafters.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Beg - for - your - life!
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You got to be kidding me.
text: The Officer grabs his throat.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Silence. Now I have a little fun.
text: Kelly laughs. The officer slaps him. Kelly jerks away.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Now that's against the rules.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: (sneers)
dialog: There are no rules in war.
text: Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in
text: the shadows.
text: Only Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly "keep talking"
text: while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (to Officer)
dialog: You've never killed anyone before,
dialog: have you?
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: I shower in the blood of my victims --
text: The GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated
text: pain and commence death throes.
text: Quick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German
text: Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand.
speaker_heading: GI
dialog: No wonder you smell so bad.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Don't shoot, please.
text: The GI's eyes widen. He looks at Kelly.
speaker_heading: GI
dialog: Will you look at the manners on this
dialog: guy?
dialog: (to German)
dialog: Remember to thank me when I kill
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: No, really, not in the neck -
dialog: But the GI does anyway.
text: The Officer SHRIEKS, grabs at his neck, and falls.
speaker_heading: GI
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't
dialog: going anywhere anyway.
speaker_heading: GI
dialog: You want me to give you a minute?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That's okay. They'll get me
dialog: eventually. If you can't get killed
dialog: in a war, when can you?
speaker_heading: GI
dialog: That's right. Look on the bright
dialog: side.
text: The GI holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: GI
dialog: Bart. Bart Bowland.
text: Kelly takes the hand of the grinning all-American type guy.
text: About his own age, but BART takes up more space.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Kelly?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (mimics)
dialog: Bart?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I mean - that's Irish, right?
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
text: (from the floor, now
text: with a decidedly
dialog: American accent)
dialog: Wow man, this is a really beautiful
dialog: scene and all, but I have to
dialog: interrupt.
dialog: (to Bart)
dialog: Why the fuck did you have to shoot
dialog: that cap so close to my neck? You
dialog: gave me a powder burn.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should
dialog: talk. You slapped me. I'm not your
dialog: bitch.
text: The Officer gets up and dusts off his uniform.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Well, what was that whole creepy
dialog: death wish thing about?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well it didn't work, now did it?
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Sometimes I get so caught up in the
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: And what was that ridiculous shit
dialog: about making me write to my mother?
text: The Officer grins.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: Inspired, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Dude, you made him write to his
dialog: mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil?
speaker_heading: INFANTRYMAN
dialog: (also with American
dialog: accent)
dialog: Can we get up now?
text: Bart helps him up and checks his regulation-issue Timex.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Might as well. There's only an hour
dialog: left anyway.
text: The German Officer crosses his arms.
speaker_heading: GERMAN OFFICER
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Admit it. You were scared.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (snorts)
dialog: Right.
text: Kelly gets up from the chair and falls over. His legs are
dialog: still tied.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST
text: The DEAD GI gets up and walks off with the GERMANS and some
text: other SOLDIERS, done for the day.
text: Bart and Kelly walk back to the stranded Jeep.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: That Willys yours?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yup. Just got her. Three summers
text: packing out at Shop Rite.
text: Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under
text: the back wheels, building up dirt.
text: Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against
text: the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas.
text: The Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: My bad. Thanks though.
text: Kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: See you.
text: Bart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked.
text: About a hundred feet away Kelly stops.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well, come on.
text: Bart walks towards the Jeep. Kelly backs it up again.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I couldn't resist.
text: Bart climbs in.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Real funny, Ernswiler. You might
dialog: still get your chance to die today.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: The customers are all REENACTORS. Some Yanks, some Germans,
dialog: a few Scottish and North African irregulars. "Boogie-Woogie
text: Bugle Boy" plays on the jukebox.
text: Bart and Kelly sit in a booth together. Bart has an easy,
text: confident manner and expansive gestures. Kelly eats hunched
text: over, like someone might try and steal his food.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Character building? Those crazy guys
text: from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: That's what you get for invading
dialog: Wisconsin.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At
dialog: Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a
dialog: guy who actually injected himself
dialog: with malaria.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That's crazy.
text: They both eat for a minute.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Where do you live, anyway?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Shaker Heights.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: That explains the death wish. Me
dialog: too. What street?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Penn Place.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (chewing)
dialog: Hmm, don't know it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's not technically in Shaker Heights
dialog: - but I go to Shaker Heights High.
text: Pause. Kelly looks at Bart.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Langely Prep.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Well, I got kicked out of Shaker
dialog: Heights High because my birdhouse
text: came unglued in honors woodshop.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Of course. I would have gone to
dialog: Langely myself only my polo pony had
dialog: the fits.
text: Bart throws his napkin on his plate.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: No matter.
text: (raises his voice to
dialog: address the room)
dialog: We're all soldiers here.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: That's right./Here, here./ Whooping,
text: cheers, etc.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive. Bart's house
text: is fancy. A nice yard and a pool. Bart hops out.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You should come over some time.
dialog: Service our lawnmower.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I would, but then I might soil my
dialog: croquet whites. You understand.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: How bourgeois. Cheerio then.
text: Kelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in spite of
dialog: himself.
scene_heading: EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DUSK
dialog: Kelly's house is a also pretty nice, nothing to be ashamed
text: of. It is smaller and weirder. The flowers and bushes are
text: overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard, some leaning
text: at precarious angles.
text: Kelly washes his Jeep in the driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois. The Jeep looks
text: good as new. He pulls a canvas cover over it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sleep tight Hot Lips.
scene_heading: INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Kelly walks in on his dad ABE making sandwiches. A great big
dialog: pile of cheese and PB&amp;J.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Sergeant Keller! How was the war?
dialog: Did we win?
text: Kelly doesn't smile at this. He looks at the sandwiches and
text: puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious it's
text: downright angry.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Let me guess. Happy Meals for the
dialog: wavy gravy wellness center?
text: Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. He looks kind. A
text: bit ill-used by life. The phrase "rode hard and put away
dialog: wet" comes to mind.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: As usual, your cynicism is refreshing.
text: He finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile.
text: Kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator. His back
text: tightens. He slams the door with his foot.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: As usual, your cheerful optimism
dialog: makes me ill.
text: Abe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly. The hostility
dialog: is nothing new.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: You should get that checked.
text: Kelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door.
speaker_heading: KELLY
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Sure thing, doc. Say hello to Leif
dialog: Garrett for me.
scene_heading: INT. ERNSWILER GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in.
text: A family of Chinese immigrants, the Lings, paints canvases
text: at long worktables. There's a MOTHER, father MAO, grandmother
scene_heading: XIOU-XIOU, SON and DAUGHTER.
text: Finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles
text: against it. All of them are portraits of animals. Some have
dialog: on hats or clothes.
text: Kelly's mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few strokes
text: with a paintbrush.
text: Eve wears jeans. She's one of those young-looking mothers
dialog: Kelly's friends would have crushes on. If he had any friends.
speaker_heading: MAO
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Son of Eve. You are very dirty.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (awkward)
dialog: A rough charge. You know.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Don't touch anything. We have to get
text: ready for the Starving Artist show.
dialog: (to Xiou-Xiou)
dialog: Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery,
dialog: not gloppy - see?
text: Eve demonstrates on the painting - a pair of monkeys in French
text: court dress. Kelly looks over his mom's shoulder.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Now you try.
text: Grandmother Xiou-Xiou dabs at the painting.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: She loves the gold. Always overuses
dialog: it. And usually her touch is so light.
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: Gold is the color of the sun.
text: Eve moves along the row, stopping to look at the paintings
dialog: in progress.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You know why we never have anything
dialog: to eat in this house?
text: But Eve has stopped behind Mao's painting. She's not paying
dialog: attention to Kelly.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Mao, what did we say about the eyes?
text: She gestures at the image of a horse done Santa Fe style,
text: lots of pastels, very abstract.
text: Mao looks at her quizzically.
speaker_heading: MAO
dialog: More - empathy?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: That's right. And didn't I tell you
dialog: to put in more cacti?
speaker_heading: MAO
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: No, no more cacti. Too busy.
dialog: Simplicity is best.
text: His family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement.
text: Eve rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh boy. I'm not having this battle
dialog: with you again.
text: Kelly breaks in.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Because your husband takes food from
dialog: his own family to feed every loser
dialog: druggie in Cleveland.
text: Eve moves down the line.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, you can always chip in here.
dialog: We're ordering pizza later.
text: At this the family nods and smiles to each other, pleased
text: with the news.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No. Some people have to work later.
dialog: (casual)
dialog: Will you drop something off at the
dialog: dry cleaners for me tomorrow?
text: Eve looks up at him for the first time. Takes in his filthy
dialog: uniform.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Sweetie, you know what we said about
dialog: paying for the war things. Nothing's
dialog: changed.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's the only thing I ever ask you
dialog: for --
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Don't be dramatic.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: But it's important to me.
text: Eve stops at Mother Ling's painting.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You're just going to have to find a
dialog: way to pay for it yourself then, I
dialog: guess.
dialog: (to Mother Ling)
dialog: No - not that way - the sky should
text: be stormier. Angry clouds.
text: Mother Ling looks up at Kelly, who's scowling. She smiles
text: and nods, understanding.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Why do I bother?
text: Kelly leaves. Eve's busy talking.
speaker_heading: EVE
text: More brown, less blue.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Kelly comes back in a grabs a sandwich off the pile.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Now Keller, who needs that sandwich
dialog: more - you or the daughter of a crack
dialog: addict trying to make a new life?
text: Kelly looks at him and bites into the sandwich.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: How about the son of a heroin addict
dialog: trying to get ready for work?
text: Kelly leaves with the sandwich. Abe sighs and picks up more
dialog: bread.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: That went well.
scene_heading: INT. KELLY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: On the walls a poster for the Civil War miniseries next to
text: one of Led Zeppelin. Some maps. A globe. Models of fighter
text: planes and a set of old tin soldiers.
text: Oh yeah, and his mom's ORIGINAL PAINTING, the one that started
text: it all, this one signed by her - a very intense looking pink
text: rabbit glaring out of the canvas with huge eyes.
text: He sits on the edge of the bed for a minute staring into
text: space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by piece.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
dialog: Ah, the graveyard shift. Musak Steely Dan.
text: Kelly unpacks cat food.
text: Thousands and thousands of little cans of it. It's hard to
text: keep the rows straight on the shelves.
text: SARAH, the night cashier, stands at her register. She's plain-
text: looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures
dialog: out who she is.
text: Not another soul in the store. Sarah wanders over to Kelly's
text: aisle as if pulled by a magnet.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So how'd your battle go today? I
dialog: still don't understand how you could
text: reenact the Battle of the Bulge in
text: seventy-two degree weather.
dialog: (plays with hair)
dialog: Didn't all those guys freeze to death?
text: Kelly doesn't stop working. He's got a system.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well, a Port-a-John fell over on a
dialog: couple of guys.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's gross.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: War is hell.
text: Kelly grabs another handful of cans.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Then why do you do it?
text: Kelly pauses. He puts two cans on the shelf very deliberately.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You're never more alive then when
text: facing simulated death.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Really? Maybe I should try it.
text: Kelly looks at her, thinks about this, and stands up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You are William J. Stone of the 1st
text: Airborne, pinned down in Noville.
dialog: The Germans have the high ground and
dialog: they're shelling your position
dialog: heavily.
dialog: (starts throwing cans)
dialog: You're holed up in a stone barn.
text: Sustaining heavy casualties. Running
text: low on ammo. The cries of wounded
text: men fill the air like the cries of
text: hungry babies.
text: Sarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food,
text: dodging cans.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Your commanding officer gets hit in
dialog: the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose
dialog: radio contact with headquarters. If
dialog: you withdraw, the Germans will flank
text: the entire Allied forces arrayed
text: along Bastogne and break the front.
dialog: What do you do? What do you do?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Stop it!
text: Kelly goes back to stocking, satisfied.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Battle of Bulge, the Southern
dialog: Shoulder, December '44.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sorry I asked.
text: Sarah stands up and starts to wander away but Kelly makes a
dialog: peace offering.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole
text: shipment in of busted Oreo's.
text: Sarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'll accidentally drop a couple pints
dialog: of milk and meet you over there.
scene_heading: INT. DAIRY BACKROOM
text: Sarah and Kelly sit on milk crates, pass the cookies back
dialog: and forth and get philosophical.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: The frozen food woman came in with
dialog: her kids. They must eat out of those
text: little cardboard trays every night.
text: One of the kids looked like cardboard.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Do you know we stock more flavors of
dialog: cat food than we do baby food?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sixteen flavors of baby food including
dialog: the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty-
text: one flavors of cat food.
text: He fishes for a cookie.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Next time you should tell that woman
dialog: to buy her kid some cat food.
text: An ANGRY WOMAN pushes open the swinging door of the backroom
text: with her loaded shopping cart.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Is this store open? I've been waiting
dialog: up front. If the store's closed, it
dialog: shouldn't have a sign that says twenty-
dialog: four hours.
text: Sarah gets up. Kelly stays right where he is, finishing a
dialog: cookie.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I have a lot of coupons and I don't
dialog: want to be here when they expire.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: Charge her double for everything.
text: Sarah smiles and hurries away.
scene_heading: INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
text: Kelly walks down the hall with his army-issue BACKPACK slung
text: over one shoulder. Besides a serious case of bedhead, he
text: looks normal.
text: No one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker.
text: As he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices LANCE --
text: short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and
text: his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down.
text: They kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of
text: each other's mouths.
text: Lance sees Kelly looking and stops kissing.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: What the fuck are you looking at, GI
dialog: Jane?
text: Kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: No really, what makes you think you
dialog: can look at me?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I honestly didn't know it was you. I
dialog: thought it was a free preview of the
dialog: Spice Channel.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: That's pretty funny. You got dental
dialog: insurance?
text: Kelly closes his locker and walks away.
text: Bridget wipes her mouth guiltily.
text: Lance shakes his head and pulls Bridget to him, grinding his
text: pelvis against hers.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Stop it.
text: She walks away.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: What? What?
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY
text: The lights are off in history class.
text: The teacher MR. NORMAN shows slides on the Civil War. The
dialog: more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own
text: photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials.
text: Mr. Norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot.
text: He clicks the remote and a photo of his WIFE, crouched over
text: and wearing shorts, drinking from a garden hose appears on
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: MR. NORMAN
dialog: Whoops!
text: He hurries through to the next slide.
text: It doesn't matter anyway. Everyone is almost asleep.
text: Except Kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more
text: Mr. Norman talks.
speaker_heading: MR. NORMAN
dialog: And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks
text: of Union soldiers fought bravely on.
dialog: They were willing to give their lives
dialog: so that others might be free.
text: Kelly shifts in his seat.
speaker_heading: MR. NORMAN
dialog: Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No.
text: But Mr. Norman doesn't start talking again.
text: He waits, looking at Kelly, smiling blandly. Until the silence
text: becomes uncomfortable. And Kelly gets mad.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Come on. Isn't this analysis a tad
dialog: simplistic? I mean, maybe for a second
dialog: grade history class, sure - but to
dialog: insist on still characterizing the
dialog: Civil War as some moral struggle?
dialog: The soldiers were drafted - the only

dialog: who couldn't afford to pay their way

dialog: Why don't you talk about the Draft
dialog: Riots? Where are your slides for
dialog: that?
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the
dialog: place cozy.
text: Kelly sits across the desk from PRINCIPAL HOLMSTEAD, a well-
text: groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: What gives you the idea that you can
dialog: or ought to question the curriculum?
text: Kelly doesn't move. He's not into this.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: Or question your teacher?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I know. I mean, who ever heard of a
dialog: classroom dialog? Not Socrates.
text: Ms. Holmstead is exasperated, but she likes him in spite of
dialog: herself. He's a smart cookie. She's got to change her
dialog: strategy.
text: She leans back in her chair.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: Kelly, you're a very bright boy. But
dialog: you're making some serious mistakes.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't need to. Everyone else makes
dialog: them for me.
text: Her chair SQUEAKS as she leans forward and looks at Kelly
text: intently.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: This anger must be masking a lot of
dialog: hurt.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I was wondering what the tissues
dialog: were for.
text: Holmstead tries again. She looks down at his file.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: I see you're not going to college
dialog: next year. What are your plans?
text: Kelly shrugs. Holmstead searches his face for any clues.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: How do I get through to you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Advertisers use status and sex to
dialog: appeal to my demographic.
text: She shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window
text: and gazes out at the front walkway of the school. Her face
text: clears. Something's clicked.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: I think we can come up with a
dialog: punishment which might actually be
dialog: more of an opportunity for you to
dialog: realize your true potential.
scene_heading: EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
dialog: School's been out for a while. The first rush had already
dialog: left.
text: Kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking
text: lot to his Jeep.
text: Lance steps out from behind an SUV and intercepts him.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: You upset Bridget.
text: Kelly hardly stops walking.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Give me a break.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: You need to apologize.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What are you going to do, make out
dialog: with me?
text: Lance runs and grabs Kelly's backpack.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Why are you fucking with me? You
dialog: little fucker. Want to play, fuckface?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You just used fuck as a verb, noun,
dialog: and adjective. Impressive.
text: Kelly tries to start walking again but Lance has hold of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got
text: in his knapsack.
text: Lance grabs Kelly's arm and yanks it back. Kelly still seems
text: unconcerned.
text: Suddenly he pulls away, but Lance keeps hold of his backpack.
text: Lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at
text: it, gleeful.
text: Lance walks away towards his car. Kelly runs after him.
text: Lance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws the
text: backpack into his SUV. They STRUGGLE for a minute, until
text: Lance pushes Kelly away, gets in the car.
text: Kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as Lance
text: drives off.
text: Finally, Kelly gives up. Lance turns out of the parking lot
text: and HONKS the horn.
text: Kelly shakes his head.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Rim job.
scene_heading: INT. ARMY NAVY STORE - DAY
text: Kelly sifts through a pile of backpacks looking for a
text: replacement. From his post behind the counter, Bart sees him
text: and comes over.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Kelly. Hey.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You work here?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Just a couple days a month, to get a
dialog: heads-up on the latest stuff. What
dialog: are you doing?
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Looking for a backpack.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Is that all? Don't bother. I have a
dialog: couple extras at home. I could give
dialog: you one if you want.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sure, I guess.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - DAY
text: Kelly stands a bit awkwardly waiting for Bart to get the key
text: from the desk to open the door in the corner. The door finally
text: swings open.
scene_heading: INT. STOREROOM
text: Bart and Kelly stand between shelves piled high with war
text: memorabilia. Uniforms in vacu-pac sealed bags, weapons in
text: shoeboxes, cannonballs and tattered and gunsmoke-darkened
dialog: flags.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Very impressive.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: My dad's real into hoarding.
text: Kelly holds up a flask in a leather case.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: BART
text: Grant's field flask.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Wow. Your dad should meet my history
dialog: teacher. He sent me to the principal's
dialog: office today for questioning his G-
dialog: rated interpretation of the Civil
dialog: War.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Forget him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I would, but now the principal's
dialog: making me give a speech on the Civil
text: War at an assembly.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (laughing in sympathy
dialog: and amusement)
dialog: What is he, some kind of sadist?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: She thinks she's doing me a favor.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Jesus, she must think you're really
dialog: screwed up. Are you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Depends on who you ask. Everyone's
dialog: got an opinion.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (grabs box)
dialog: Take this. That'll shut them up.
text: Bart opens the long box. Nestled inside is a leg bone with a
text: foot attached to it.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Stonewall Jackson's.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah right.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Can you imagine that? Losing your
dialog: leg and getting back up on your horse?
dialog: Unbelievable. What balls.
text: Kelly nods. That is balls.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: He's got so much crap crammed in
text: here he doesn't even notice when
text: it's missing. I saw a backpack in
dialog: here somewhere.
text: Bart puts down the box carelessly and paws through the piles.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND KITCHEN
text: Bart and Kelly sit at the kitchen table drinking sodas,
text: waiting for MINNIE, the housekeeper, to finish making them
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I thought he had a couple.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'd feel weird taking one out of the
text: tomb of Tutenkamen anyway.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Trust me, you shouldn't.
dialog: (burps)
dialog: Where'd your old one go?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I lost it.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: How?
text: A pause. Kelly decides to tell him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Someone took it.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You let someone take it?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I didn't let him. I told off some
dialog: idiot --
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Sounds like your mouth gets you into
dialog: trouble a lot.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm telling you, it's not me, it's
dialog: the world.
text: TABBY, Bart's older sister comes in.
text: She's older. Definitely in college, if not out. And totally
text: shockingly beautiful. Otherworldly.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Tabby, this is Kelly.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Don't give him any money, whatever
dialog: you do.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: All these little old ladies are
text: looking for him in Arizona. He took
dialog: their retirement money and bought
text: defective bazookas with it.
text: Kelly laughs. And looks at Tabby more closely.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Very funny. We're paying attention
dialog: to you, are you happy now?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Finally, my life is complete. Fait
dialog: accompli.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (to Tabby)
dialog: Minnie's making sloppy joes. Want
dialog: one?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Sloppy joe? Sloppy no.
text: She opens the fridge and gets a yogurt.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: I have to go take a shower. Will you
dialog: call me when Miner gets here?
text: Tabby leaves. Kelly's distracted.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Who's Miner?
speaker_heading: BART
text: The fiancé.
text: Bart rolls his eyes, indicating what he thinks of good old
dialog: Miner.
text: Kelly nods, doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Listen, I'm going to the flea market
dialog: on Saturday. I have a line on a couple
dialog: dealers. You could get a backpack
dialog: there.
text: Kelly glances at the door Tabby left from.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh yeah? Flea market, land of
dialog: bargains.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Especially if you know who to talk
dialog: to.
text: Kelly looks at Bart with suspicion -- and respect.
scene_heading: EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - MORNING
text: Kelly hops out of his Jeep and walks towards the front of
dialog: the school.
text: Lance is there, hanging out with Bridget and some of his Cro-
text: Magnon FRIENDS.
text: He wears a WW II CAP, overseas airborne style, obviously
dialog: Kelly's.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Hey fuckface. Like my new hat? I
dialog: just joined the Boy Scouts.
text: The Cro-Magnons grunt approvingly at this witty repartee.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: If you stay in it long enough, maybe
dialog: you'll get your fudgepacker badge.
text: Ooh. The Cro-Magnons laugh at Lance and EGG him on - "You
dialog: gonna take that?"/"He just called you a fag", etc.
text: Lance frowns and grabs Kelly.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: You're a regular Howie Mandel.
text: Still holding on to him with one arm, he SLAPS Kelly hard
text: across the face with the other.
text: Kelly's knees give a bit. Lance holds him up.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Lance!
text: Lance looks over at her and releases Kelly.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Okay babe.
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: One day you and me will be alone.
dialog: And won't that be nice?
text: Kelly is hurt but covering.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Too bad my mom won't let me date
dialog: yet.
text: Kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes. Tries to re-wet the
text: dry inside of his mouth with his tongue.
text: He turns slowly and trudges up the stairs.
text: Sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why do you mess with him?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You're right. I should give him a
dialog: break.
scene_heading: INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly watches TV in the living room. His cheek has a nice
text: bruise on it. Eve enters.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need
dialog: you to go to the art supply store
dialog: for me.
text: Kelly looks at the TV.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Get Abe to do it.
text: Eve goes to her purse and rifles through it to find her
dialog: wallet.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He was going to but he had to go
text: lead a meeting at Care House.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What a surprise.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I'll make it up to you.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Where have I heard that before?
text: Eve sighs.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: When are you going to give me a break?
text: Kelly jabs at the remote.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Let me think - maybe when I finally
dialog: forget every single word of The Little
dialog: Mermaid soundtrack I'd listen to in
text: the car waiting for him to score.
dialog: No, probably when I don't prepare
dialog: myself before I go into the bathroom,
text: expecting to find him passed out on
dialog: the floor.
text: Eve waits through this.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Actually, you know what? I know I'll
dialog: be able to put it all behind me when
dialog: I go away to college.
text: (slaps his forehead,
dialog: pretend remembering)
dialog: Only, I can't go because someone
dialog: spent my college fund on Mexican
dialog: Black Tar. So looks like I'll have
text: to try to forget at Shop Rite, where
dialog: I'll be working for the rest of my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You're right. You have every reason
text: to crawl into the corner and give
dialog: up. But please just get me some paints
dialog: first.
text: Eve comes over to Kelly. He sighs and puts his hand out.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What do you need?
text: She gives him the money.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: We need burnt sienna, cadmium red,
text: and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: What happened to your face?
text: She puts her hand up but he moves away from it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Forget it.
scene_heading: INT. ART SUPPLY STORE - DAY
text: Kelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes. He looks
text: up and sees Tabby browsing the paintbrushes.
text: He's suddenly nervous. He knocks over a few cans of thinner.
text: Almost leaves.
text: Instead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite
text: hers and waits to catch her eye.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: They're having a sale on glitter.
text: It takes Tabby a second to recognize him.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Oh, hello. What happened to you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Tennis injury.
text: Tabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether
dialog: to believe him.
text: Tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints.
text: Kelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: You paint?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well, you see... That's a difficult
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't really feel comfortable
dialog: calling anything done since the
dialog: Renaissance "painting." We might
dialog: have a more experimental interaction
dialog: with the picture plane, but our skills
dialog: have suffered from it.
text: In spite of herself, Tabby laughs at this. This gives Kelly
text: more confidence. He leans over the aisle to see what she's
text: looking at.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You're working with acrylic. Why?
dialog: Oil's much - richer.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Oh you're not one of those oil snobs
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Of course not.
text: Kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves,
text: knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's just - isn't acrylic a bit -
dialog: jejune?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Jejune? You're jejune. How old are
dialog: you anyway?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Older than my years.
text: Tabby walks to the counter with her brushes.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: And you paint?
text: Kelly looks down and partially confesses.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well, you know, my mother's kind of
dialog: an artist, so -
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: That explains it.
text: Tabby signs the slip and takes the bag. She walks out, Kelly
text: with her, matches her pace, talking.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That explains nothing. Doesn't anyone
dialog: believe in innate knowledge anymore?
dialog: Michelangelo was fifteen when he
dialog: painted the Infanta.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo
dialog: was Italian.
text: Tabby gets into her car. Kelly leans into her window.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Exactly. One world, one people. Just
dialog: like Jesse Jackson envisioned.
text: Tabby tries to conceal her smile and starts her car.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Well - Kelly. Nice talking to you.
text: She drives away. Kelly stands there watching. Then he winces.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What the hell did you just say?
scene_heading: EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly pulls up in his Jeep. He turns off the engine but
text: doesn't get out. Just sits there. He doesn't want to go in.
scene_heading: EXT. FLEA MARKET - DAY
text: Colored plastic flags droop in the sun.
scene_heading: MILITARY STALL
text: Bart sweeps his eye over everything. A SKINNY GUY wearing a
dialog: wife beater has some not half-bad stuff.
text: Kelly, bruise faded to yellow and green, examines a glass
text: mason jar of what seems to be dirt.
speaker_heading: SKINNY GUY
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: That there's actual sand from Iwo
dialog: Jima.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Or your sister's sandbox.
text: The guy shrugs.
speaker_heading: SKINNY GUY
dialog: Well, it don't come with no
dialog: certificate of authenticity.
dialog: (considers)
dialog: I could write one up for you, I
dialog: suppose. Get it notarized.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: No, that's quite all right. Actually,
dialog: I'm in the market for medals.
speaker_heading: SKINNY GUY
dialog: Sure. I got a couple purple hearts.
dialog: A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them
dialog: to you though. They were gramp's.
dialog: (wink)
text: Bart acts casual, hands clasped behind his back.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: SKINNY
dialog: They have a lot of sentimental value
dialog: -
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Yeah. How much?
speaker_heading: SKINNY GUY
dialog: A lot.
text: Bart pulls out a paper bag and offers it to the skinny guy,
text: who looks inside.
speaker_heading: SKINNY GUY
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: General Ulysses S. Grant's field
dialog: flask, my friend.
text: Kelly is shocked. The skinny guy looks at his suspiciously.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Throw in one of those backpacks and
dialog: we'll call it even.
text: The skinny guy looks at Bart, and in the bag again. He goes
text: to get the backpack. Kelly's impressed by this smooth
dialog: exchange.
scene_heading: FLEA MARKET - BETWEEN ROWS
text: Kelly and Bart weave through the maze of stands. Kelly now
text: holds the backpack.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Buying and selling US service medals
dialog: is illegal.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Exactly. That's why the resale value
dialog: is so high.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Is that what they teach you at
dialog: Langely?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Don't be so naïve. We all have our
dialog: skeletons. Some of them just pay
dialog: more than others.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: And I'm not even going to ask about
text: the flask.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets
dialog: everything right, don't they?
scene_heading: CAMPAIGN PIN STALL
text: A frowsy WOMAN in a muumuu sits fanning herself in front of
text: an extensive display of pins and buttons.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You boys look like Goldwater fans.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I've never been accused of that
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Well jeez, you don't have to be
dialog: insulted.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Anything military?
text: The woman considers this, her fan working back and forth
text: lazily.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Fish around in that cigar box.
text: Bart paws through the box. Acts casual.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What do you want for the box?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Twenty dollars.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Fifteen.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Don't be so hasty.
dialog: (fanning)
dialog: I got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins
dialog: I'm looking to unload.
scene_heading: FLEA MARKET FOOD COURT
text: Kelly and Bart, now wearing the smiling black &amp; white face
dialog: of Geraldine Ferraro, eat disgusting yet delicious flea market
text: food and watch a slow-motion bingo game.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Goldwater fan. I think that's some
dialog: kind of insult.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going
dialog: to go to school?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Ah, you have that luxury.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You don't?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I didn't have much say in the matter.
dialog: Everything has been decided for me
dialog: since birth. I'm not whining about
dialog: it. Play the hand you're dealt, right?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Easy for you to say. You got a royal
dialog: flush.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Are you crazy? My life sucks.
dialog: Everyone's always telling me what to
dialog: do. You can't fight it. Go with the
dialog: flow.
text: They eat for a minute to the soothing sounds of the BINGO
scene_heading: CALLER: TWENTY-ONE, THIRTEEN, FOUR, SEVENTY-EIGHT.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What about Tabby?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: She got to go where she wanted. Sarah
dialog: Lawrence. Six years. She's almost
dialog: done with grad school. Yale.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I didn't think people actually went
dialog: to Yale.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: I don't know. I mean, she drives off
dialog: in her car in September. For all we
dialog: know, she could just pull her car
dialog: over in Albany and sleep there until
dialog: May.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: It was a joke. Joke?
text: Bart does some fake sign language to help Kelly out.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh. Is that what one of those sounds
dialog: like? Somehow, I always imagined
dialog: they would be funnier.
text: Bart pushes Kelly, who grabs his arm like it got hurt.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sarah Lawrence? Isn't that for
dialog: lesbians?
text: Bart shrugs.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What happened to your face?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Remember the backpack incident?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Same guy?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: The one with mad cow-diseased
dialog: hamburger meat for brains? That would
dialog: be the one.
text: Interested, Bart leans forward.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What are you going to do about it?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm not going to lower myself to his
dialog: level.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Of course not. But there are
dialog: alternatives
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Alternatives?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd
dialog: Special Operations Wing?
text: Kelly shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Well do you want to get this guy or
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: All right. Let's get the fuck out of
dialog: here, then.
text: Bart tosses his wrapper at the trashcan. Kelly watches it
text: hit the rim and go in.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (on the move)
dialog: I have some things to show you.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Bart and Kelly sit amidst a spread of books, papers, and
dialog: electronic equipment.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Once we've gathered the intelligence,
text: the plan will reveal itself.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We don't plan first?
text: Bart opens a pad.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: No, it limits our scope - what's the
dialog: objective?
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Humiliation. Rage. Despair.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go-
dialog: to war for that sort of thing. I
dialog: have the declassified briefs from
dialog: the Phoenix Project around here
dialog: somewhere.
text: Bart grabs a book and starts flipping through pages.
text: Tabby enters with an armful of art supplies.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Hey. I have some stretcher bars out
dialog: in the car. Can somebody help me
dialog: bring them in?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Of course we'll drop what we're doing
dialog: because what you're doing must be
dialog: more important.
text: Bart doesn't look up. He grabs another book.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sure. I mean, I'll help.
text: Bart raises his eyebrow. Kelly shrugs off the look.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I'll find those reports.
scene_heading: INT. TABBY'S STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Tabby drops the canvas and points at the table. Kelly dumps
text: the bars and stands there looking around.
text: At the wood floors and skylights. Couch covered with a sheet.
text: Painting, serious ones, with layers of paint and mysterious
text: objects stuck to them lay against the walls. They all seem
text: faded, like a vacation photo that's been through the wash.
text: Kelly moves to the PAINTING on the easel.
text: Very yellow and pink. Kind of looks like castles.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Gold. The color of the sun.
text: Tabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: That's the Cleveland waterfront.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: As the viewer, I get to decide what
dialog: it is, I'm afraid. And it doesn't
dialog: look a thing like it.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: It's the light. I was playing with
dialog: diffusion.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well make sure you put it away when
dialog: you're done with it.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Very funny, wiseass.
text: Kelly resumes his tour of the room.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It must be nice to have a place like
dialog: this to get away to.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What about Farmer?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Farmer?
text: Tabby unrolls the canvas and measures lengths.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: The boyfriend.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Miner? What about him?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Is he an artist, too?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: No. Definitely not. Thank god.
text: Kelly is silent for a while, fiddling with a clamp light.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: You said your mom was a painter?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: She was, well - is I guess.
text: Tabby cuts the canvas.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: She used to be. But then my dad -
dialog: wasn't working anymore so she turned
text: it into a business. She has a family
dialog: of Chinese immigrants in the garage
dialog: making them for her.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Like Andy Warhol's Factory.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: More like Andy Warhol's tool shed.
dialog: It was nice before, though. My playpen
dialog: used to be in her studio.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Wow. So you really grew up with it.
dialog: What does, did, your dad do?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He's a VH-1 documentary without the
dialog: music.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: "Tragedy struck?"

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: "And then, things took a turn for
dialog: the worse."
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Well, just wait. Those burnout types
dialog: always have a triumphant comeback
dialog: tour.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I already changed the channel.
text: Tabby sits back on her heels and looks at him.
text: Bart's head appears in the open door.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Christ Kelly, I let you go out on a
dialog: little supply line assist and you're
dialog: gone for days. Come on.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Have fun, boys.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: If only it were fun. War's deadly
dialog: serious, ma'am.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: (to Bart)
dialog: And I used to think you were the
dialog: only crazy one.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi
dialog: Hannah.
text: Bart leaves. Kelly stands by the door. This is his only
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm worried about you playing with
text: diffusion unsupervised.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yes. I might have to come by and
dialog: show you the proper safety procedures.
dialog: Some time in the presence of an art
dialog: prodigy would do you good.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: I don't think I have room for a
dialog: playpen in here.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Ouch.
text: Tabby smiles. Kelly leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND YARD - NIGHT
text: Bart and Kelly walk across the yard.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: So, you have a thing for my sister?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What? No, no.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Everybody does.
text: They skirt around the pool.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We just have a few things in common.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Oh really, like what?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I can't tell you. It's my feminine
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You don't wear women's clothes when
dialog: you're alone, do you?
scene_heading: INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kelly comes out of the kitchen with a glass of water in pajama
text: bottoms and a T-shirt. The TV's on static. He sees a FIGURE
text: sleeping on the couch and starts to walk through the room.
text: Then he stops, sighs, and backtracks. He turns off the TV.
text: Then he sees the empty bottle of wine next to the couch.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Dad.
text: The figure doesn't move. Kelly doesn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Dad?
text: Kelly looks around, worried. In this house an unresponsive
text: dad isn't necessarily sleeping. Should he wake up his mom?
text: He shakes the figure slightly. It rolls over, only it's not
text: his dad. It's some scabby ADDICT. Kelly yanks his hand away.
speaker_heading: ADDICT
dialog: Wha?
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sorry.
scene_heading: EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: Abe sits on a lawn chair.
text: Kelly comes out, unfolds another chair and sits next to his
text: dad - a good distance away.
text: They both look up at the sky.
speaker_heading: ABE
text: Keller. There's a meteor shower.
text: Kelly frowns.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: A funny thing just happened. A little
dialog: trip down memory lane. I thought you
dialog: were on our couch, dead.
text: Abe laughs.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Oh, you mean Emmett? They didn't
dialog: have an empty bed for him at Care
dialog: House.
text: Kelly nods, considering this.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well that's one of your more brilliant
dialog: ideas.
dialog: (anger rising)
dialog: Have you thought about the fact that
dialog: it might be dangerous? That he might
dialog: steal something, or go into cardiac
dialog: arrest? Drink all our cooking wine?
text: Which he seems to have done.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: He just needs a place to sleep for
dialog: the night.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You're right. Besides, having him
dialog: here makes it feel like home.
text: Abe slams his hands down on the arms of his chair.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I've been straight for four years,
dialog: almost five. A third of your life.
text: Kelly claps slowly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Big whoop. I've been straight the
dialog: whole time.
text: Abe closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I hate to tell you this, but I'm not
dialog: your problem anymore.
text: Kelly gets up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No. That's the one thing I get to
dialog: decide.
text: Abe looks at Kelly.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Let me know. I can wait.
text: They look at each other. Kelly shakes his head and goes
text: inside. Abe looks up at the sky.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: (to himself)
text: Keller, there's a meteor shower.
scene_heading: EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: In a backyard tree house next door sit Kelly and Bart, Kelly
text: looking through a pair of M3 field glasses.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I have the target in sight.
speaker_heading: BINOCULAR MATTE
text: Through the twin circles Lance gets into his car in front of
dialog: his house.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I think he's leaving.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Let me see. Don't be a farb, give
dialog: them up.
text: Kelly hands the glasses over. Bart looks through them. Then
text: he puts them down.
speaker_heading: BART
text: The coast is clear.
text: The boys looks at each other.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Let me prepare to deploy.
text: Bart opens up a duffel bag and pulls out a yellow jumpsuit
text: which he puts on. Kelly looks through the binoculars.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Is this going to work?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: We've planned for every contingency
dialog: using the tried and true techniques
dialog: of the last great world power.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Save it for the press conference.
speaker_heading: THE LAWN
text: The boys climb down out of the tree house.
text: Bart is dressed in an official-looking yellow jumpsuit with
text: telephone repairmen's tool hanging from his belt and a hard
text: hat on. Kelly carries a toolbox.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Stay low. On my signal.
text: He looks at Kelly. Then he holds up one finger and gestures
text: "go." They sneak hunched over towards the fence. A LITTLE
text: GIRL comes out of the house and stops when she sees them.
text: Bart and Kelly look at each other. Bart takes the toolbox
text: and gestures to Kelly by pointing at the girl and covering
text: his mouth.
text: Kelly peels off towards the girl while Bart continues across
text: the lawn.
text: The girl starts to SCREAM. Kelly swoops up and covers her
text: mouth with his hand. He tucks her under his arm and runs
text: towards the opposite side of the house.
text: He puts the girl down, still covering her mouth.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We're the good guys. If you scream,
dialog: the bad guys are going to come and
dialog: burn down your house. Okay? So stay
dialog: here and be quiet.
text: The girl nods. Kelly takes his hand off her mouth and starts
dialog: to sneak away.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: My dad has a gun.
text: Kelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door.
text: IN FRONT OF LANCE'S HOUSE
text: Bart turns up the driveway and RINGS the doorbell.
text: LANCE'S MOTHER opens the door. Bart confers with her briefly
text: and steps inside. The door closes behind him.
text: Kelly stares so hard at the door he doesn't see the NEIGHBOR
text: come up behind him.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: Can I help you, young man?
text: Kelly starts and turns.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I was just inspecting your lawn.
text: Kelly grabs a few blades of grass.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Have you thought about Astroturf? It
dialog: takes a lot less water to keep green.
dialog: I mean, no water, technically.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: I'm not interested.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh. I see. Okay then.
text: Kelly gets up and starts to walk down the street, only -
text: Lance PULLS UP in his SUV.
text: Kelly darts behind a parked car and watches Lance go into
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: Lance comes right back out. He forgot something in his car.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: Kelly moves around the car, trying to keep it between him
dialog: and Lance.
text: Bart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie.
text: He smiles at Lance, now coming back up the walk.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Smile worker bee. I'll be your boss
dialog: some day.
text: Bart nods and tips his HARD HAT.
text: Kelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until
text: Lance's house is out of sight.
text: Then he gets in step beside Bart.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What an asshole. His mom gave me
dialog: cookies, though.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Did you get it done?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Don't ask stupid questions. Let's go
dialog: home and listen.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - DAY
text: The boys sit around an FM receiver/recorder.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: It was a five-watt FM bug, so we
dialog: should be in range -
text: Bart FLIPS the ON switch and Lance's Mom's voice fills the
dialog: room.
text: The boys smile with delight.
speaker_heading: LANCE'S MOM
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: So then I told her, "Harriet, with
dialog: potato salad like that it's no wonder
dialog: Ray-Ray's cheating on you."
speaker_heading: WOMAN
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: You didn't.
speaker_heading: LANCE'S MOM
dialog: You're right. But I was thinking it.
dialog: Instead I just told her to add more
dialog: vinegar next time, and -
text: Kelly shakes his head as the women natter away.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't think we can use any of this.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Be patient. It's voice activated, so
dialog: we'll get everything. Trust me. It's
dialog: going to be great.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: All right, then.
text: Kelly gets up to leave while Bart fiddles with the knobs.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: We reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen
dialog: hundred hours.
scene_heading: INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Abe and Eve have dinner together.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: -- And if we don't sell them there,
dialog: we'll set up on the corner of Stevens
dialog: and Lane, by the gas station. That's
dialog: a good location.
text: Eve looks at her husband and sees he's not paying attention.
text: He seems a little out of it. He's pushing his food around on
text: his plate.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Are you listening to me?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Did you make this with more chili
dialog: pepper than usual?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: The same as always.
text: Kelly comes in, walks through the kitchen and up the stairs.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Kelly. Want dinner?
speaker_heading: KELLY
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: I ate.
text: His parents eat for a minute in silence. Abe winces and puts
text: down his fork. Eve smiles tenderly at him.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: One day, we're all going to be happy.
text: Abe puts his hand over hers.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: That sounds nice.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bart moves around the room excitedly.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: It's really too perfect, actually.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What? What?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I can't describe. Just hit play.
dialog: It's all cued up.
text: Kelly hits a button. The tape clicks ON. From the speakers
dialog: comes:
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: (recorded)
dialog: I told you, that makes me nervous.
dialog: Me no likey.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: But baby, my birthday's coming up.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Still. That's not a good enough
dialog: reason.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Come on. A little action. A little
text: prime time action.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: But people might see us.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: That's the point. That's what makes
dialog: it sexxxy. Dangerous.
text: Kelly stops the tape.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Dangerous.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Exactly.
text: Bart and Kelly share a look. Kelly grins.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Let's draw up the plans.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I have a few notes jotted down.
dialog: All we have to do is fill in the details and let Operation
text: Deadmeat begin.
scene_heading: INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
text: Bridget primps at her locker while Kelly watches nervously
dialog: from his.
text: When she starts to close the locker door, Kelly rushes towards
text: her and BUMPS into her. Her books and papers spill to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh Jesus, I'm so sorry -
text: He starts picking them up.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Oh, it's okay -
text: She looks around. If Lance showed up it wouldn't be good for
dialog: either of them.
text: Kelly hands her the rest of her stuff. They part ways.
text: Kelly shoves a piece of paper into his pocket.
text: Principal Holmstead CLICKS down the hall in her heels and
text: Kelly DUCKS into a doorway just in time. He turns and pretends
text: to look at a posted announcement as she passes.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bart inspects Bridget's book report with a jeweler's loop.
text: He swings over to a piece of stationary Kelly's working on.
speaker_heading: BART
text: She dots her I's with hearts. And
text: her L's are loopier. The L is very
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm working on it.
text: They both crouch over the paper.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I feel kind of bad for her. She's a
dialog: nice girl.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Sometimes collateral damage can't be
dialog: avoided.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Stop it.
text: He pushes back from the table.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: How does that look?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (inspecting)
dialog: Pretty good. I think we're ready to
dialog: manufacture a document.
text: Kelly takes out a fresh sheet of paper.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: Begin. "Hey Daddy. It's your birthday
dialog: and you've been a very bad boy. But
text: so has the baby. Both baby and Daddy
dialog: have to get punished, only this time
dialog: -
scene_heading: INT. LANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lance, shirtless, reads aloud from the letter.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: (Cont.)
dialog: - baby makes the rules. Await further
dialog: instructions at school tomorrow --
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Bart wears his school uniform and sits in the passenger seat
text: next to Kelly.
speaker_heading: LANCE
speaker_heading: (V.O. cont'd)
dialog: -- Baby will be waiting where Daddy
dialog: least expects her. Love, Bridgie."
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Do you have everything?
text: Kelly just looks at him. Bart's already asked this question.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: We can't afford any errors.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You don't need to tell me. It's my
text: ass on the line.
text: Kelly pulls up in front of Bart's school.
text: Bart turns to him and puts a hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I wish I could be there to see it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You'll get the de-brief.
speaker_heading: BART
text: It's a day that will live in infamy.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You couldn't do any better than that?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I don't hear you coming up with
dialog: anything.
text: Bart hops out and salutes Kelly, who give him the thumbs up
text: in response and pulls away.
scene_heading: INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
text: Lance can't keep his hands off Bridget.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: What's gotten into you?
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Nothing, you bad girl.
text: Lance cackles.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Did you drink a bottle of Robitussin
dialog: before school again?
text: The bell RINGS.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: See you soon, my naughty baby.
text: Bridget looks a little scared.
scene_heading: INT. HISTORY CLASS
text: Lance slouches into a seat next to Kelly, who drops another
text: STATIONARY NOTE into Lance's open backpack.
text: Kelly watches as Lance grabs his book, sees the note, opens
text: it, and leers.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: It's my birthday! I'm going to get a
dialog: present.
text: Kelly looks down at his desk and smiles.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Damn it, fuckface. What're you smiling
dialog: about? You wish you were me.
text: Lance raises his hand.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Mr. Palmer? May I be excused?
text: Lance leaves like a house afire.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Eine maus findet den kase.
scene_heading: INT. HALL
text: Lance sneaks down the hall towards the STORAGE CLOSET and
text: whispers into the door.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Daddy's here for the Easter egg hunt.
text: He pulls open the door. Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE CLOSET
text: Lance turns on the light. No one there.
text: But propped up on the shelf next to a vase with a rose in it
text: is another note.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Ooh, push my buttons.
text: He snatches the note. His eyes widen as he reads.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You little minx.
scene_heading: INT. LANGELY PREP, BATHROOM - DAY
text: Bart crouches in the stall, looking at his watch.
text: When the second hand sweeps past the twelve, he opens his
text: cell phone and punches in a number.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (serious grownup voice)
dialog: Yes, I need to get a message to
dialog: Bridget Shumann. This is MENSA.
scene_heading: INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH, CAFETERIA/GYM - DAY
text: Lunchtime. Typical bedlam. KIDS mill around.
text: At one end of the cafeteria/gym is a small stage, the kind
text: pep rallies are held on.
text: Lance edges his way through the crowd, making a beeline for
text: the STAGE DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH, MAIN OFFICE
text: A confused Bridget stands at the SECRETARY'S desk.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: But I just got this note last period.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Well I don't have anything here for
dialog: you - let me look again. Oh yes, the
dialog: MENSA called.
text: The secretary hands Bridget the message. She looks at it.
speaker_heading: BRIDGET
dialog: Cool. They want me to be an honorary
dialog: member.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Is that like a sorority or something?
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE
text: Lance looks around eagerly.
text: He peeks through the curtains at all the kids and can barely
text: contain his excitement.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Bridgie? Come on, daddy's sick. He
dialog: needs his medicine.
text: He spots a WOMAN in the shadows.
dialog: It must be Bridget.
text: He unbuckles his pants and lets them drop to him knees.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: I brought our friend along. He's
dialog: happy to see you.
text: He rips off his shirt and shuffles across the dark stage
text: toward her.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTING BOOTH
text: Kelly looks at his watch.
scene_heading: INT. LANGELY PREP CLASSROOM
text: Bart looks at his watch in anticipation.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTING BOOTH
text: Kelly flicks a switch and presses a button.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA
text: The crowd falls silent and turns towards the mechanical sound
text: of the STAGE CURTAIN OPENING.
text: They squint from the BRIGHT STAGE LIGHTS.
text: SHOCK ripples through the crowd as they take in the tableau
dialog: revealed to them:
text: A frozen half-naked Lance on his knees before a BLOW-UP DOLL
text: tied to a chair.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: What the fuck are you all looking
dialog: at?
text: Bridget, standing in the doorway, covers her mouth in horror.
speaker_heading: STUDENT 1
dialog: Look, he's got a hard on.
speaker_heading: STUDENT 2
dialog: Eeeeew.
text: Lance stumbles off stage to HOOTS and CATCALLS, but mostly
text: hysterical LAUGHTER.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTING BOOTH
text: Kelly smiles, laughs and claps his hands with delight. Then
text: he returns to military precision. He turns all the switches
text: back to how they were and uses his shirtsleeve to cover the
text: doorknob so as not to leave fingerprints.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: Bart pours them two glasses of his dad's scotch. He's
text: overjoyed.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You're kidding me.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yup. There it was. The whole school
dialog: saw it. Wasn't too impressive either.
text: They raise their glasses to each other.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: To Operation Mincemeat.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: To the 193rd.
text: They both take swallows of scotch. Kelly retches.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: How does it feel to give better than
dialog: you get?
text: Kelly finishes his scotch.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Good. Real good.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You want some more?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (croaking)
dialog: Don't mind if I do.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: That's my boy.
text: The drink again. Kelly's feet are up. For the first time, he
text: looks comfortable.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
text: Sarah stands at her register, flipping through a magazine.
text: Kelly pulls up on the ELECTRO-SHOPPER with field goggles on.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You know what this is?
text: He puts his foot down like a kickstand.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Eighteen volts of pure freedom.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sounds dangerous.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, it is. Unless you know how to
dialog: handle it.
text: Kelly runs his hand lovingly along the frame. Then he looks
text: up at Sarah.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You ever seen the freshly waxed floor
text: in the produce section glistening
dialog: under full florescence? It's
text: breathtaking.
text: Sarah gets on behind him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hold on tight.
text: He puts his foot up and kicks it into gear.
text: The Electro-shopper takes off - barely. Kelly takes the corner
text: too sharp and clips the edge of an END CAP DISPLAY of cereal
text: boxes -- they fall to the floor.
text: The Electro-shopper inches forward.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Close call.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Have you been drinking?
scene_heading: INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING

text: CLOSE downstairs.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S STUDIO
text: Kelly throws some paints and brushes into his backpack.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack.
text: Minnie opens the door.
speaker_heading: MINNIE
dialog: Kelly? Bart's not here, he -
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm
dialog: here to see Tabby. Just to do a little
text: painting with her.
speaker_heading: MINNIE
text: She's out back in her studio.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. TABBY'S STUDIO
text: Tabby stands barefoot in the sunlight, a palette knife in
text: her hand.
text: Music's playing. Jeff Buckley. She looks over as the door
text: opens, surprised.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Kelly?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hey. I warned you I'd come.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: You did.
text: She goes back to painting. Kelly stands there for a minute,
text: waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation.
text: She doesn't. Until she looks up and sees him standing in the
dialog: same place.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Maybe I should go --
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set
dialog: your canvas up. Use one of the ones
text: in the corner.
text: Kelly looks through them and picks one.
speaker_heading: TABBY
text: Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in
dialog: the drawer.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I brought my own.
text: He takes off his backpack and opens it.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Well then.
text: Kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies.
text: He can't help but look at her. The light hits her hair and
text: she glows. She catches him looking.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Does it mess up your concentration?
dialog: Me being here?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: No.
text: She turns back to her painting.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh. That's good.
text: Kelly sets up his canvas.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Just don't talk.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Why would I?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm kidding.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Right. Irony. I like that.
text: Kelly feels the tubes of paint. Nervous. Squirts some color
text: out. Looks over his shoulder at her.
dialog: He's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being
text: there, in the studio, alone with her. Trying to figure out
dialog: how to play it.
speaker_heading: MINER
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Hey! Hey babe.
text: Miner opens the door. See Kelly. Smiles like the stockbroker
text: he is and crosses to him.
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: Miner Webber.
text: Miner holds out his hand for a good old-fashioned shake.
text: Kelly takes it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Webber Miner.
text: Miner looks confused.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Kelly. This is Kelly -
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Kelly Ernswiler. Sorry. I -
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: Quite all right.
dialog: (smiles as an
dialog: afterthought)
dialog: So, what do we have here, a little
dialog: painting class?
speaker_heading: TABBY
text: Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints.
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: Oh? What's your real job?
text: Kelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his canvas.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That would be stock boy at the Shop
dialog: Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky
dialog: says, every employee is part owner.
dialog: So you could say I'm a captain-of-
dialog: industry in training. Kind of
text: capitalist larva.
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: That's quite an image.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Only if you see the most magical
dialog: part. Do you see?
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: What?
text: Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly.
dialog: First I'll have to be a pupa though.
dialog: I figure I won't be going out much
text: then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence
dialog: of the insect world.
text: Miner stares at Kelly. He can't tell what he might be making
dialog: fun of, or if it might be him.
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: Whatever it takes to get you through
dialog: the day.
text: Kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though
text: Miner doesn't see it. He grabs Tabby's paintbrush and pulls
text: her to him.
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: I have the afternoon off. Come away
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: I'm not at a good stopping point.
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: Oh, come on. They'll still be here.
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: I know you'll still be here.
text: Kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint
text: on his canvas in exaggerated strokes.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: I really shouldn't.
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: But everyone will be coming soon.
dialog: And it will get all crazy, and we
dialog: won't have any time to ourselves.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: We will. I promise.
text: Tabby kisses Miner. He realizes there's no convincing her
text: and sighs.
speaker_heading: MINER
dialog: Like tonight? We can practice
dialog: honeymoon suite.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Maybe. Probably.
text: Miner looks at Kelly, who looks away.
text: Then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves.
text: Tabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while. Kelly moves
text: around to look at his canvas from different angles, like
text: he's copying what he thinks a painter would do.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Is he always like that?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Overbearing.
text: Tabby stops and puts down her brush.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Just because he didn't want to picture
dialog: you as a pupa?
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Oh, he will - later. When he's alone.
dialog: Whether he wants to or not.
text: Kelly paints.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Not that though. How he wanted you
dialog: to stop.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: He wants to be with me. What's so
dialog: bad about that?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Just because some one wants to be
dialog: with you doesn't mean they're good
dialog: for you.
text: Kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. He has a
text: hard time making eye contact with Tabby.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No one should ever ask you to stop.
dialog: If you stop, you might not be able
dialog: to start again. Or you might start
dialog: again, only things will be different.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Well, that's sweet -
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's not sweet, actually. It's just
dialog: the truth.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Hey, I can take care of myself.
text: She picks up her brush.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: When's the wedding?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: At the end of the month. But don't
dialog: ask me about it. It makes me nervous.
text: Kelly looks at her seriously.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Why? Is something wrong?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: No.
text: Awkward silence.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: What are you painting?
text: Kelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Really, there are so many layers of
dialog: - imagistic symbolism - that I really
dialog: don't feel comfortable summing it
dialog: up, but, well - it's a recurring
text: dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket
dialog: ship.
text: Tabby stops painting.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What do you mean, "how?" Sidesaddle.
text: She's riding it sidesaddle. She's
dialog: got a fish tail, for chrissake. I
dialog: haven't decided yet if she's got
text: scuba gear on or not.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Do you have any idea what you're
dialog: talking about?
text: Kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's
dialog: gesture.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Does that matter?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Well, some people actually say what
dialog: they really think.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What if they don't know what they
dialog: really think?
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: It doesn't matter. It's called being
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sounds boring.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Not boring. Scary and wonderful and
dialog: exciting.
text: Kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette. His gestures
text: slow down. He's taking this in. Then he shakes it off.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hey. I'm trying to create here. Stop
dialog: distracting me.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Kelly comes in to return the art supplies.
text: Xiou-Xiou's alone working. She looks up and smiles at Kelly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Mom's got you working late?
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: No.
text: Kelly walks over and sees what she's working on. A beautiful
text: spare Chinese landscape.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Wow. You're really good. Why do you
dialog: make those stupid animals for mom?
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: Each painting is a lesson. Here -
text: She gets out a piece of paper for him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm making a lot of art these days.
dialog: I guess that means a lot of lessons.
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
text: Each line has a whole drawing
text: contained in it. Each drawing has a
text: whole life contained in it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, that's all?
text: Kelly watches her for a minute, the delicate whoop and swirl
dialog: of her strokes.
text: He dips a brush into the ink and watches Xiou-Xiou's
text: restrained and confident movements.
text: Eve leans against the doorframe.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Hey you two. I'll try not to act
text: surprised. It might spoil the moment.
text: Kelly puts down the paintbrush.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I can't do this. I have to go.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Keller, I think I'm missing some art
dialog: supplies. Have you seen them around
dialog: the house?
text: Kelly avoids her eyes as he leaves.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No, I haven't.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I don't know what to do with him.
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: You son is not yet cooked. Give him
dialog: time.
text: Eve looks over Xiou-Xiou's shoulder.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: When are you going to let me give
dialog: you your own show? We could do it
dialog: for real.
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: No problem. When you offer me an
dialog: eighty-twenty split.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kelly eats with the Bowlands - Bart's mom, MATHILDA, his dad
text: HARRISON, and Tabby and Bart.
text: The Bowlands dress up a bit for dinner, like any good Wasp
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (to Harrison)
dialog: -- But I told you I want to take
dialog: German --
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: German's a Cold War language. You
dialog: can't get any kind of State Department
dialog: position without more diverse
dialog: linguistic training than that. You'll
dialog: take Chinese.
text: Bart frowns.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: Are we on the same page?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: Same page.
text: Everyone eats in silence.
speaker_heading: MATHILDA
dialog: (to Tabby)
dialog: So darling, when are you going to
dialog: bite the bullet and do the seating
dialog: arrangement?
text: Tabby puts down her fork.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: I can't deal with that stuff, ma. I
dialog: don't care who sits next to whom. I
dialog: should have eloped.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: After all, Mrs. Bowland, sometimes
dialog: when you bite the bullet, it explodes
dialog: in your mouth.
text: Mathilda looks surprised. This could go either way.
speaker_heading: MATHILDA
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Why, I've never thought about it
dialog: before but that is a rather strange
dialog: expression, isn't it? You wouldn't
dialog: say, "Sooner or later you've got to
dialog: put the grenade in your pants," would
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: But have you ever noticed how in
dialog: movies they always bite the grenade
dialog: before they throw it?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah, but they never take a bite out
dialog: of their pants.
text: Everyone but Bart LAUGHS.
text: Tabby throws Kelly a grateful glance, for getting her out of
dialog: a conversation she didn't want to have.
speaker_heading: MATHILDA
dialog: What an unusual conversation! Do you
dialog: have similar discussions at the dinner
dialog: table with your family, Kelly?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Basically. I ask why all the furniture
text: is missing and my Dad reminisces
dialog: about dropping acid and watching
text: Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.
text: All but Bart LAUGHS again.
speaker_heading: TABBY
text: He talks about art.
speaker_heading: BART/MATHILDA
dialog: You do?
text: Kelly looks down at his plate.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: My mother's kind of an artist, so -
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: You come from a creative family, do
dialog: you?
text: Mathilda salts her food.
speaker_heading: MATHILDA
dialog: I wish my boys would talk to me about
dialog: my passions. I can't get them anywhere
dialog: near the subject of my garden.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I noticed your magnolias. Very fine
dialog: specimens.
speaker_heading: MATHILDA
dialog: They are fine, aren't they?
text: Mathilda beams.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: Is there nothing you can't discuss?
text: If anyone notices the slight edge to Bart's voice, they ignore
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks.
text: Minnie has a way with the white sauce.
scene_heading: INT. BART'S ROOM
text: Kelly and Bart play PlayStation II "Medal of Honor" in Bart's
text: bedroom. Bart is sulking, almost imperceptibly.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: My dad has this friend who's a
text: director. He's shooting a documentary
dialog: for the History Channel.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: He needs some guys to do a reenactment
dialog: of some European theater battles for
dialog: him.
text: Kelly stops playing and looks at Bart.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We're going to be on the History
dialog: Channel?
text: Bart's eyes stay on the screen.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I haven't asked you yet.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh, come on.
text: Kelly jabs at his controller.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Well, if you want to. Next weekend.
dialog: But you have to take it seriously.
text: Kelly gives Bart a derisive glance.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What do you mean? Of course I will.
text: The flickering TV light illuminates Bart's pinched look.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: From what I've seen, you play fast
dialog: and loose with your characterizations.
dialog: This has got to be straight up.
text: This annoys Kelly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm not "fast and loose." I play the
dialog: emotional truth. I make it real.
text: Bart glances at him.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Like back in the dining room?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What does that have to do with it?
text: Bart shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (mimics)
dialog: "I noticed your magnolias. Very fine
dialog: specimens." That was real?
text: Kelly's video game character dies. He drops the controller.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What is this about?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: You just seem to have your own agenda,
dialog: that's all.
text: Bart plays on. He's keeping a lid on everything while Kelly
text: gets more and more agitated.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: My own agenda? What other reason is
dialog: there to do anything?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I'm just saying. I know the difference
dialog: between fantasy and reality.
text: Kelly looks at Bart in disbelief.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are you saying I don't?
text: Bart won't meet his eyes.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I don't know.
text: Bart pauses the game.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Why didn't you tell me your dad was
dialog: a burn-out?
text: Kelly gets up and grabs his jacket.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Why do you steal from yours?
text: He leaves. Bart un-pauses the game and continues playing.
scene_heading: INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
text: Kelly drinks from the fountain and wipes his mouth on his
dialog: sleeve.
text: Principal Holmstead's smiling face greets him when he
text: straightens up.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Kelly! I told some of your teachers
dialog: about your presentation. We're all
dialog: really looking forward to it.
text: Kelly frowns at the Principal's back as she CLICKS away.
text: Sarah appears. They walk down the hall together.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What presentation?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't want to talk about it. As a
dialog: matter of fact, do me a favor and
dialog: pretend you never heard anything
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Okay. Um.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What, Sarah?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's nothing. I -
text: Kelly starts to pull ahead.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith
dialog: this weekend.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Aw Sarah, that's really great, I
dialog: mean. It's just that - I'm busy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh. Yeah, I figured. Okay. I'll see
dialog: you in the dairy section, though.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Right.
text: She stands there looking lost.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly smoothes the cover over his Jeep. Bart pulls up to the
text: curb in his BMW.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I tracked you down. There's someone
dialog: I'd like you to meet.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY
text: A few OLD SOLDIERS sit sunning in chairs in the industrial
text: feeling living-room.
text: Bart and Kelly sit across from CHARLIE HAYES, an old black
text: guy, playing dominos.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: Are you one too?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And what do you see in that?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery
dialog: - the big stuff. Things we don't
dialog: have anymore.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I see.
text: Charlie sorts his tiles and scowls. He leans in to Kelly's
text: face, giving him the eye.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And do you think it's brave getting
text: trench foot and syphilis, eating
text: another ration of spoiled frank and
dialog: beans out of a dented can?
text: Kelly is taken aback by this.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well, no -
text: Charlie leans back and nods, thinking about Kelly's response.
text: He no longer seems angry.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun,
dialog: would it?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No, sir.
text: Charlie sets down a tile and pulls at his chin.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Parts of it were kind of fun though.
dialog: I got separated from my platoon and
dialog: lived for two weeks in the forest of
dialog: the Ardennes living off what I could
dialog: kill.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I felt very close to the land.
text: Bart gives Kelly a significant look. Kelly doesn't notice.
text: He's looking closely at Charlie.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
text: Kelly sits in the car. Bart pumps gas. They talk through the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I met him when my mom made me go
text: around caroling with the Youth Group.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You don't really believe that stuff
dialog: about Berlin? And Hitler's compound?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Of course it matters. Doesn't the
dialog: truth matter?
text: Bart grins.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I don't know. You tell me.
text: Kelly avoids this by getting out of the car.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple
dialog: bucks.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I told you not to play him for money.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I was trying to be nice. He's your
dialog: friend.
text: Bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Exactly. You should know better.
dialog: What do you want.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Mountain Dew -
text: Just then he glances towards the gas station and sees EVE,
text: set up in the adjacent abandoned lot. She's got the van parked
text: there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around
text: on display.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: -- Oh shit.
text: But Eve has seen him. She shields her eyes with her hand and
text: calls to him.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Kelly!
text: Kelly backtracks towards the car.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: That woman's calling you.
text: Eve walks over to them. Kelly can't get out of it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (low)
dialog: Bart. Meet my mom.
text: Eve smiles brightly.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: What a nice surprise. It's so nice
dialog: to finally meet you.
text: Bart is surprised but recovers his manners quickly, just
dialog: like he's been taught to.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Likewise. So, doing a little business?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: A little is right. But I work it as
dialog: much as I can.
text: Eve laughs.
text: Kelly shifts his weight from foot to foot. Eve looks at both
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: So, what have you boys been up to?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Bart took me to meet his friend
text: Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You don't know him.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: You boys should swing by Care House.
dialog: There are some Vets there.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: We can't.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh. Well - okay.
text: Eve watches a car pull into the lot next to the van.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I should go. But you boys should
dialog: come over to our house some time.
dialog: (to Bart)
dialog: I know your family must get tired of
dialog: him.
text: Kelly visibly bristles at the thought of his parents
dialog: entertaining Bart.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway.
text: Eve looks at Kelly. Then she runs back over to the van.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: There you go. Now you know everything.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What's your problem? She's pretty
dialog: cute.
text: Kelly rolls his eyes and gets back in the car.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Don't you want your soda?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Forget it.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kelly watches Bart pick through parts of his uniform.
text: After the encounter with mom, he's retreated into himself.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: So filming's on Saturday. Can you
dialog: make it?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are you kidding?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Good. It's gonna be really cool.
dialog: He's got an explosives expert coming.
text: Kelly doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What's up?
text: Kelly runs his hand through his hair. He can't bring himself
dialog: to say what's really on his mind.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Remember that stupid speech?
text: Kelly picks up Bart's Colt and sights with it. Bart frowns.
text: He knows Kelly's avoiding the real stuff.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm supposed to give it next week.
text: Bart polishes his combat boots.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Maybe you should talk to my dad about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You think he'd go for that?
text: Bart keeps his head down, polishes intently.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Of course. He loves you. He was
dialog: talking the other day about helping
dialog: you out.
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: Want to go to Dartmouth?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: He was. If you applied for Spring
dialog: Semester, he could "pull some
dialog: strings."
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (shakes his head slowly)
dialog: I don't think that would work for
dialog: me. Considering -- my background.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Yeah, probably not.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm not properly socialized. I
dialog: wouldn't fit in.
text: Bart checks his bandoleer and cartridges.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: That's bullshit.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No, it's not.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Tell that to my family. They're like
dialog: your fucking fan club.
text: Bart pauses, darts his eyes at Kelly.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Even Tabby likes you.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: So much she ratted me out to you.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Well, she's inviting you to the
dialog: wedding.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh.
text: Bart watches Kelly's face.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: But you probably won't enjoy that
dialog: much, will you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about. Weddings? I love weddings. I
dialog: always get drunk and make out with
dialog: someone's cousin.
text: Bart throws his olive drab socks at Kelly's head.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher
dialog: and tell him to expect a little
dialog: action.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Fletcher, eh?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: He's twelve. Let me give some advice.
text: He's very into sharks at the moment.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kelly waves to Minnie and goes out the front door.
text: There he pauses, trying to decide what to do. Then he scowls.
text: He goes around the corner. Towards Tabby's studio.
scene_heading: INT. TABBY'S STUDIO
text: Tabby sits on the couch facing away from the door. Kelly
text: enters.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Why did you tell --
text: Tabby turns toward him. She's crying.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What? Oh, I'm sorry.
text: He knows he should leave, but Kelly just stands there.
text: Kelly runs his hand along his pants in a nervous gesture.
text: Tabby dabs at her face.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Miner and I broke up.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Honestly? I didn't think you two
dialog: were right for each other.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: You did, huh?
text: Kelly walks over to her painting.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Like this painting. Stare at it too
dialog: long and you can't see it anymore.
dialog: But if someone else sees it for the
dialog: first time, they can tell exactly
dialog: what it is.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: I don't need any more bullshit right
dialog: now.
text: Kelly stops, taken aback. He walks away from the painting.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He could never understand you.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: I'm not as complicated as you think.
text: Kelly walks to the window and looks out.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I never said you were complicated.
text: Tabby laughs/cries at this.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He just wasn't the right one.
text: Tabby nods. She's starting to calm down a little.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: There's more to it than that.
text: Tabby looks at her shredded tissue. Kelly sits down on the
text: couch next to her.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm really sorry. I really am.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Kelly pats her knee awkwardly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Don't cry.
text: Tabby turns her face to Kelly's.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: You like me, don't you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Of course.
text: Tabby closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: No, I mean -- you like me.
text: Kelly looks scared. He wants to retreat. But he calms himself
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Yeah. I think you're amazing.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Well, do something.
text: Long pause. Then -- Kelly kisses her. She kisses back and
text: they fall against the couch together.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BART
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: All right, all right. I'm going.
text: Bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler. He
text: looks up and freezes.
text: Kelly comes out of Tabby's studio. He shuts the door carefully
text: and walks around the pool.
text: Kelly doesn't see Bart.
text: Bart doesn't say anything. He just watches Kelly go.
scene_heading: INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly throws parts of his soldier's kit onto his bed from
text: corners of the room. The canteen underhand. The Jeep cap as
text: a free throw. This is the best day of his life.
text: Until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door, still
text: crusted with mud.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Damn it. Damn it.
text: He flops on his bed. But he can't help it. Soon he's smiling
text: again. He gets up, gathers up the uniform, and tears out of
dialog: the room.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Kelly comes down the stairs two at a time, singing.
text: Eve and Abe watch surprised from the table. Abe looks pale.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bart sits in his desk chair, frowning.
text: Mathilda knocks and opens the door.
speaker_heading: MATHILDA
dialog: Minnie's starting dinner. Is Kelly
dialog: coming over?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Not tonight, ma.
text: Mathilda pauses and looks at her son.
speaker_heading: MATHILDA
dialog: Okay, then.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY
text: An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR and CAMERAMAN unload equipment from a
dialog: van.
text: The DIRECTOR looks off into the distance, trying to visualize.
text: Kelly pulls up next to the van. He wears a spotlessly clean
dialog: uniform.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Are you with the 101st or the 82nd?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well, 82nd today. It's not my usual
dialog: division. Technically, my patches
dialog: indicate -
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Whatever. Make yourself comfortable.
dialog: We'll be a while setting up. Some of
text: the other boys are over by craft
dialog: service.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh?
text: Kelly doesn't go anywhere.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
text: The snack table. It's over there.
dialog: Someone will come get you when we're
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Right. Is Bart Bowland here yet?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Ok. Thanks.
speaker_heading: CRAFT SERVICE
text: Kelly and a half dozen other SOLDIERS stand or sit in the
text: grass around the table. They talk and rest on their backpacks.
text: A MAKEUP ARTIST makes the rounds.
speaker_heading: MAKEUP ARTIST
dialog: (to Kelly)
dialog: And you are?
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Kelly Ernswiler, private first class.
speaker_heading: MAKEUP ARTIST
dialog: All right, Kelly. Let's take a look
dialog: at you.
text: She gets out some pomade and runs a comb through his hair,
text: slicking it back.
speaker_heading: MAKEUP ARTIST
dialog: That's it, handsome.
text: Kelly grins. When she walks away he messes up his hair again.
text: He scans the crowd. No Bart.
text: The A.D. walks over.
dialog: A.D.
dialog: Okay, everyone. We're going to start
dialog: positioning. Then we'll go through a
dialog: few rehearsals.
dialog: (points at soldiers)
dialog: You, you and you - go over there by
dialog: that tree. You and you guys, behind
dialog: the hill.
dialog: (looks at clipboard)
dialog: Okay, who's got the Jeep?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That MG? She's mine.
dialog: A.D.
dialog: Great. We'd like to use it. Can you
dialog: drive it beyond the hill over there?
text: Kelly tries to act casual.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Sure. I don't think that would be a
dialog: problem.
text: He walks towards his Jeep and pauses.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Have you seen Bart Bowland? Has he
dialog: checked in?
dialog: A.D.
dialog: Don't know. We've got enough people.
dialog: It doesn't matter.
text: Kelly nods, wondering a bit. But it's soon forgotten.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: (to Jeep)
dialog: Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to
dialog: be famous.
dialog: A.D.
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Okay people. Listen to my voice.
dialog: From now on, you do whatever this
dialog: voice says. Take your place.
text: BEHIND THE HILL
text: Kelly waits with his rifle next to his Jeep, bored.
text: He sees a FIGURE in the shadows of the trees.
text: He raises his rifle and points it at the figure.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Password.
text: Bart steps out of the barn.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hey! Where the hell have you been?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: No where.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: They put you over here with me? That's
dialog: great. I think we'll get some close-
dialog: ups. They want me to drive old Lippy.
dialog: Isn't that awesome?
text: Bart doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What the hell's your problem?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I ought to fucking kill you.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You had to do it.
text: Kelly shakes his head, avoiding Bart's eyes, trying to keep
dialog: it normal.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You just do whatever the fuck you
dialog: want. And consequences don't matter,
dialog: do they?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Are you out of your mind?
text: Bart looks at Kelly. Sees nothing but a kid in an old Army
dialog: uniform.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What the fuck do you think she's
dialog: going to do, run off with you?
text: The blood rises to Kelly's face.
text: But he still won't look at Bart.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy.
dialog: She's a Yale grad student. Talk about
dialog: living in a fucking fantasy world.
text: Kelly's hands turn white around the rifle.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No. You'd rather have me be miserable
dialog: like you are.
text: Bart comes closer. Uncomfortably close.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (biting sarcasm)
dialog: Once again, you've displayed your
dialog: uncanny ability to nail the truth of
dialog: a character.
text: Kelly finally raises his head.
text: And looks Bart right in the eyes.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Stop talking out your dad's mouth
dialog: and use your own for once.
text: Bart lunges at Kelly.
scene_heading: EXT. FILM SHOOT

text: The groups are in position.
text: The A.D. stands by the cameraman.

dialog: here?
text: Bart and Kelly continue to fight.
dialog: A.D.
dialog: (to cameraman)
dialog: Hey, roll this. Get this. Are you
dialog: getting this?
text: The cameraman puts his camera up to his eye and films.
text: Kelly finally pushes Bart off him, gets in his Jeep and drives
dialog: away.
dialog: A.D.
dialog: (to cameraman)
dialog: Follow him. Are you getting it?
text: Bart sits on the ground, out of breath.
dialog: A.D.
dialog: We can use this. We'll cut it
dialog: together.
text: The A.D. directs the camera at Bart.
dialog: A.D.
dialog: Get close on him.
text: Bart pushes the camera away.
scene_heading: INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KELLY'S ROOM - DAY
text: Kelly lays in bed staring at the ceiling. There's a cut across
text: his eyebrow.
text: Eve comes in carrying her car keys and sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Well, you're going to have to. Your
text: father's at the hospital.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Which one of his loser friends ended
dialog: up there?
text: Eve plays with her keys. Then she stops.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: They think he has stomach cancer.
text: Kelly feels the sensation of falling, like a dream.
text: Then he snorts and rolls over, away from his mom.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh this is just perfect.
text: Eve looks at the back of Kelly's head. She's tired but still
text: trying to deal.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Why would you say something like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: Because it seems to fit.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: "Seems to fit." Do you understand
dialog: what I just said?
text: Kelly gets up. Puts his feet on the floor. His shoulders are
dialog: slumped.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Why, do you want to say it again?
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Kelly -
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I have to go to work.
text: He gets up and holds the door open for her. Eve looks at
text: him, heart heavy. She leaves.
text: Kelly sits on the bed. Then he looks at the rabbit painting.
text: He grabs it off the wall and SLAMS it backwards against the
text: floor so he doesn't have to look at it.
text: The painting falls back against the bayonet fixed to Kelly's
text: rifle and TEARS.
text: He KICKS it.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
text: Kelly angrily wrestles with giant boxes of paper towels.
text: He RIPS open the box and they roll everywhere.
text: Sarah watches from checkout. She comes over to help him pick
dialog: them up.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I forgot to tell you this box was
text: booby-trapped.
text: Kelly doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: The concert was lame. The opening
text: act singer ripped his leather pants
text: during a stupid dance routine and
text: stormed off stage.
text: (pause, looks at his
dialog: cut)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Lance?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No.
text: Kelly gathers an armful of paper towels.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Listen, I'm busy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sure. I understand.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I doubt it.
text: Sarah puts a couple of rolls on the shelf.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Um, I don't have a perfect life, if
dialog: that's what you're asking.
text: Kelly stops what he's doing.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: No, Sarah, actually, I'm not asking.
dialog: I never ask you anything but you
dialog: just talk anyway. Have you ever
dialog: noticed that?
text: Sarah drops the rolls she had in her hands.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Fuck you.
text: She leaves. Kelly shakes his head.
scene_heading: INT. TABBY'S STUDIO - MORNING
text: Kelly, still in his work clothes, comes in without knocking.
speaker_heading: KELLY

text: Tabby opens her eyes.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Kelly?
text: Kelly goes and takes his painting off the easel.
speaker_heading: KELLY

scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND YARD

speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: We talked.
text: Tabby smiles sadly.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: I'm really sorry.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Don't be.
text: They stand there in the yard. Tabby wraps her arms around
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: My dad's got cancer.
text: Tabby looks at Kelly, pained.
speaker_heading: TABBY
dialog: Oh, Kelly.
text: She takes a step towards him. He backs up.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I guess we all get what we deserve.
text: Kelly looks at Tabby for a second, then turns and walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY
text: Kelly drives along an open stretch of road. He throws the
text: painting out of the Jeep.
text: He comes to a turn and takes it much too fast.
text: The Jeep SKIDS, teeters on two wheels, and goes over the
text: embankment.
scene_heading: BOTTOM OF DITCH
text: Steam trails up from the Jeep's radiator. The front end is
text: completely smashed.
text: Kelly bangs his fist against the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: KELLY

scene_heading: EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
text: Kelly rides an old bike up to the bike rack and locks it.
scene_heading: INT. HISTORY CLASS
text: Kelly comes in late.
speaker_heading: MR. NORMAN
dialog: Kelly! There you are. I was just
dialog: telling the class about our special
dialog: treat today. Mr. Ernswiler is going
dialog: to be giving the three first-period
dialog: history classes a little talk about
dialog: the Civil War.
text: Kelly closes his eyes. He had forgotten - or tried to forget.
speaker_heading: MR. NORMAN
dialog: Let's all make our way in an orderly
dialog: fashion down to the auditorium, shall
dialog: we?
text: The class bolts for the door.
speaker_heading: MR. NORMAN
dialog: Orderly, I said orderly.
text: Mr. Norman looks at Kelly pleasantly.
speaker_heading: MR. NORMAN
dialog: Well, what are we waiting for? I'm
dialog: so looking forward to hearing your
dialog: views.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM
text: Kelly sits in a chair on the stage next to Mr. Norman.
text: A scattering of KIDS sit out in the auditorium.
text: Principal Holmstead stands at the podium.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: For those of you who haven't had the
dialog: chance to get to know Kelly, you
dialog: should know he has a very interesting
text: hobby. He takes part in reenactments
dialog: of World War II battles right here
dialog: in Ohio.
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE KID
dialog: I did that too. When I was seven.
text: Scattered LAUGHTER. Kelly frowns.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: He has an unusual first-hand knowledge
dialog: of history. We recently discovered
dialog: that this extends beyond World War
dialog: II to the Civil War, which he is
dialog: going to discuss with you today.
dialog: Kelly?
text: Kelly rises to scant applause. He stands at the podium,
text: looking out at the crowd.
text: He looks down and thinks. He looks back up. The silence
text: stretches. Kids start giggling.
text: Finally he leans into the microphone.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He walks off stage.
speaker_heading: HOLMSTEAD
dialog: (to Mr. Norman)
dialog: Well, go after him.
scene_heading: EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
text: On his knees Kelly fumbles with his bike lock, getting madder
text: and madder. Just as he's about to get it undone --
text: Lance appears.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: What, they re-assign you to the
dialog: bicycle brigade?
text: Kelly frowns at the lock.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I'm busy.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Too bad, cause I'm not. Remember
dialog: that little show I put on for the
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Oh, come on. Pants down? Doll? Hard
dialog: on?
text: Kelly looks up at Lance.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh that. I heard about it.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: And did you hear me and Bridget aren't
dialog: going out anymore because of it?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I haven't been following the story.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Yeah well, let's get this over with.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: It is over.
text: Lance pushes Kelly away from his bike. Kelly falls back on
text: his hands.
text: He squints up at Lance and moves back towards his bike.
text: Lance KICKS him back with his foot and looks at him.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Just let me go home.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Did you call me a homo?
text: Lance KICKS him again. Kelly breathes hard.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: This isn't a good time for me. Let's
dialog: re-schedule.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: No time like the present.
text: Lance picks Kelly up and SLAPS him hard on the face.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: First you should probably get me to
dialog: write home to my mother.
text: Lance PUNCHES Kelly and he reels. Then Kelly lunges for him
text: and they fall to the ground. Kelly swings wildly but Lance
text: pins him down and gives him a few good ones.
text: Then Mr. Norman comes out.
speaker_heading: MR. NORMAN
dialog: Stop it!
text: Mr. Norman rushes over to them.
text: Kelly scrambles up and rips at his bike lock, gets on his
text: bike and rides away.
text: Mr. Norman tries to take a panting Lance by the arm but Lance
text: shakes him off.
speaker_heading: LANCE
dialog: Get off me.
scene_heading: EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly rides by his house and keeps going.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. CLEVELAND WATERFRONT - DAY
text: Kelly sits on the loading dock of an abandoned factory.

text: ruffles his sweaty hair.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly's at the front door.
speaker_heading: MINNIE
dialog: Bart's not here. Sorry.
text: She closes the door. Kelly wheels his bike down the driveway.
text: He sees Bart sitting out by the pool with a couple of LANGELY
speaker_heading: BOYS.
text: Bart sees Kelly and ignores him, laughs at something one of
dialog: the guys says.
scene_heading: INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY
text: Kelly sits on the toilet, putting a bandage on a red scrape
text: down his arm.
text: Eve appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Oh Kelly. What happened?
text: Kelly looks up at her. He's still got the cut eyebrow, which
text: has split back open, and some dried blood under his nose.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Jesus. Let me see that.
text: Eve comes over and tilts Kelly's head back to look at the
text: cut. This is the first time she's touched him.
text: She gets some antiseptic and ointment from under the sink
text: along with Band-Aids and goes to work.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Ow.
text: Kelly lets her dab at his face. He closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: I'm going over to see dad.
text: Kelly opens his eyes and pulls away.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oh.
text: Eve puts a butterfly bandage across Kelly's eyebrow.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: And you need to come.
text: Kelly pulls his head away.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I don't want to.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: At this point that's not an option.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Now's not a good time, ma.
text: Eve looks at Kelly sadly.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: It's never a good time.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You can't make me.
text: Eve shakes her head.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (voice rising)
dialog: It's not about you anymore --
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Don't you get it? It was never about
dialog: me.
text: Eve rises to her feet. He's just sent her over the edge.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What is wrong with you? When are you
dialog: going to stop blaming us, blaming
dialog: him? I'm sick of you being angry. I
dialog: want to be angry! They just took out
dialog: half of your father's stomach -
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Enough.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: (screaming and crying)
dialog: You will not tell me what's enough.
dialog: You don't know about anything. All
dialog: you do is fight fake battles, in the
dialog: woods, on the playground. But this,
dialog: right here, us - this is the real
dialog: one, the only one worth anything.
text: She stops and breaks down.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: The man I love is dying.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: That's between you and him.
text: Eve looks at her son. Her face looks older.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: If I made a mistake, if you felt
dialog: left out, I'm sorry. But I can only
dialog: deal with one thing at a time.
text: Eve leaves. Kelly sits on the toilet, lost.
scene_heading: INT. KELLY'S ROOM - MORNING
text: The sun shines in through Kelly's window.
text: He's laying in bed awake - has been for a while.
text: He gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately. He
text: puts on his best shirt and tie, sensing trouble when the
dialog: tie's too short.
text: He pulls the suit out of his closet.
text: The jacket doesn't fit. The sleeves don't even go down to
text: his wrists.
text: And he can hardly button the pants. He rips off the jacket.
text: He pulls everything out of his closet. Nothing there.
text: He sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands.
text: He looks at his DRESS UNIFORM, hanging on the back of the
text: closet in its dry-cleaning bag, right where his mom left it.
text: He shakes his head. No, he couldn't do that.
text: Then he sighs.
scene_heading: EXT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH - DAY
text: It's decorated for a wedding. Flower garlands trail up the
text: banisters.
text: GUESTS trickle in.

speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters
dialog: next to me if you can help it.

dialog: Oh, hello. So nice to see you. Thank
dialog: you for coming.
text: Bart comes outside, also dressed as an usher.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: (to Bart)
dialog: Where's the priest?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: He should be here any minute. Calm
dialog: down.
text: Bart walks down the steps and looks down the street.
text: Kelly's walking towards him. IN HIS DRESS UNIFORM.
text: Bart walks down the street to meet him.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?
text: Kelly looks down. He can't meet Bart's eyes.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I was invited.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: I uninvited you.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It's not your wedding.
text: Bart looks at Kelly and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Why are you wearing that?
text: Kelly doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: (softening)
dialog: I can't let you come in.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Because you know why. Just go home.
text: Kelly finally looks up at Bart and nods.
text: A Town Car pulls up.
text: Tabby gets out in her wedding dress. Has there even been a
dialog: more glorious woman? Will there ever be again?
text: Her MAID OF HONOR leads her around to the side of the church.
text: Kelly watches every step.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: She looks beautiful. Tell her - give
dialog: her my congratulations.
text: Kelly walks off.
text: Bart watches him go.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, KELLY'S ROOM - DAY
text: Kelly sits on the edge of the bed, head in hands.
text: He sees the torn rabbit painting. After a minute, he picks
text: it up and looks at it.
scene_heading: INT. EVE'S STUDIO
text: Xiou-Xiou sits painting. Kelly enters with the rabbit.
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: Oh! Son of Eve. You startled me.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Grandma Ling. Can you fix this?
text: She examines it and takes out a wet sponge. She wipes it
text: across the back of the canvas.
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: Your mom made it for you. I can fix
dialog: it.
text: She works silently for a minute. Kelly watches her. She cuts
text: a small piece of canvas to repair the hole.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Did you come here to work on your
dialog: own stuff? Don't waste your time on
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: I never waste time.
text: She turns the painting over and gets out some paints to touch
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: See. Everything can be mended.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You're trying to tell me something,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: XIOU-XIOU
dialog: Oh no. I could not tell you anything.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL, ABE'S ROOM - DAY
text: Eve sleeps in a chair next to Abe, in bed sleeping. He looks
text: pale but otherwise fine.
text: Kelly stands in the doorway, still in his uniform.
text: Abe comes to and sees him standing there.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Hey. Kelly.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hey dad. How you feeling?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Not bad.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: They gave me some stitches downstairs.
dialog: (points to eyebrow)
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Did you get punched?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: A couple times, actually.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I know the feeling. Come on in and
dialog: watch some television. Don't worry,
text: this one's bolted to the wall. As
dialog: you can see, my reputation precedes
dialog: me.
text: Kelly comes into the room and sits in a chair.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Any battles this weekend?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: A few.
speaker_heading: ABE
text: Busy, busy.
text: Abe and Kelly look up at the television in the corner.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Answer me this: how come no one ever
dialog: reenacts the Vietnam War?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: It'd be pretty depressing, wouldn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I guess it would.
text: Both continue to look up at the television.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Plus that, you'd have to have
dialog: protesters and stuff.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: Folks dressed up like your mom and
dialog: me. People reenacting fleeing to
dialog: Canada, burning draft cards. I guess
dialog: that would ruin the spirit of the
dialog: thing, now wouldn't it?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I could make it work.
text: Abe looks at Kelly.
speaker_heading: ABE
dialog: I bet you could.
text: Kelly nods. Eve wakes up.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: Kelly, is that you?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: You were expecting some one else?
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR
text: Kelly and Eve get snacks from the vending machine.
speaker_heading: KELLY
text: He looks good.
text: Eve looks at Kelly, her face full of love and sadness.
speaker_heading: EVE
dialog: He looks just like you.
text: Kelly nods slowly, taking this in. And it is finally too
dialog: much.
text: He breaks down and cries. For the fear and the misplaced
text: rage, the fights and the stubbornness.
dialog: But finally, relief.
text: They walk back down the hall together. Eve reaches out and
text: puts her hand on Kelly's neck.
scene_heading: EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY
text: Kelly rides his bike past the house and stops when he sees
text: the car packed up in front.
text: Bart comes out with a box of stuff.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Hey. You going away already?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Yeah. The have this intensive summer
dialog: orientation thing.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Is that good?
text: Bart puts the box in the car.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Well, it's optional, but dad thinks
dialog: it would be "a good way to meet
dialog: people."
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: He's probably right.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: He usually is.
text: They stand there.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Well, go Big Green.
text: Kelly gives him a little ra-ra with one hand. Bart smiles.
dialog: Kelly's been doing his research.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Thanks.
text: Kelly lifts his foot up to the pedal of his bike.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Have fun. And get laid, will ya?
text: Bart laughs a little and shakes his head. Kelly is gone.
text: Harrison comes out.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: Is that everything?
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: Everything you'd let me bring.

speaker_heading: HARRISON

speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: How come you don't work here anymore?
text: The Electro-shopper's getting rusty.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I've got a summer internship at an
dialog: ad agency.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Fancy.
