scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY (1960) 1
text: A country lane c. 1960 with MISS SHEPHERD at the wheel of a
text: van barrelling along, her face set and anxious. Distantly we
text: hear the sound of a police siren (or bell it would be in
text: 1960). She pulls the van into a side road or clearing and
text: waits, ducking behind the seat as she sees the police car
text: pass the end of the road. MISS SHEPHERD rights herself,
text: checks the side of the van. Wipes her hand on it. Blood. She
text: crosses herself. Then starts up the van and drives off the
dialog: way she has come.
text: As she turns the corner, we see that the police car has
text: stopped at the end of the road. A solitary policeman,
text: UNDERWOOD, gets out of the car and watches the van disappear.

scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL. NIGHT 2
text: A glamorous pianist in a décolleté evening gown (along the

text: ALAN BENNETT at his desk, writing.
speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT (V.0.)
text: The smell is sweet, with urine only
dialog: a minor component, the prevalent
text: odour suggesting the inside of
text: someone's ear. Dank clothes are
text: there too, wet wool and onions,
dialog: which she eats raw, plus what for
dialog: me has always been the essence of
text: poverty, damp newspaper.
text: The sound of the lavatory flushing. ALAN BENNETT looks
text: towards the toilet door.
dialog: 4/6
scene_heading: THE LADY IN THE VAN - FINAL SCREENPLAY 2.
speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT (V.O.)(CONTD. )
text: Miss Shepherd's multi-flavoured
text: aroma is masked by a liberal
dialog: application of various talcum
dialog: powders, with Yardley's Lavender
dialog: always a favourite, and currently
dialog: it is this genteel fragrance that
text: dominates, the second subject, as
dialog: it were, in her odoriferous
dialog: concerto.
text: MISS SHEPHERD comes out of the lavatory, pulls down her
text: skirt, and leaves through the front door. We see something of
text: the inside of the house and its contents, still at this date,
text: c. 1976, fairly uncluttered.
speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT (V.O.)
dialog: But as she goes the original theme
text: returns, her own primary odour now
text: triumphantly restated and left
text: hanging in the house long after she
text: has departed.
text: Out of the window we see Miss Shepherd's van parked in the
text: drive and MISS SHEPHERD herself rearranges some plastic bags
text: beneath the van. She is tall and though her changes of
dialog: costume will not be described in detail, she is generally
text: dressed in an assortment of coats and headscarves but with a
text: variety of other hats superimposed on the headscarves. Old
text: raincoats figure, as do carpet slippers and skirts which have
text: often been lengthened by the simple process of sewing on
text: additional strips of material. She is about sixty-five.
speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT
dialog: (at the desk, speaks)
dialog: Tell her.
text: As he watches through the window, A.B. - his other self -
text: comes out of the house.
scene_heading: EXT. 23 GLOUCESTER CRESCENT. DAY. 4/6
text: A.B. approaches the van.
dialog: A.B.
dialog: (at the van)
dialog: Miss Shepherd. In future I would
dialog: prefer it if you didn't use my
text: lavatory. There are lavatories at
dialog: the bottom of the High Street. Use
dialog: those.
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: They smell. I’m by nature a very

speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a testimonial for a Clean

speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT (V.O.)
dialog: The writer is double. There is the
dialog: self who does the writing and there
dialog: is the self who does the living.
text: And they talk. They argue. Writing
dialog: is talking to one’s self, and I've
dialog: been doing it all my life, and long
dialog: before I first saw this house five
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. 23 GLOUCESTER CRESCENT. DAY 9
text: Five years earlier, possibly with a subtitle, though the
text: unkempt nature of the house and a ‘For Sale’ sign indicates

text: A.B. comes round the corner of Inverness Street into

speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: A.B.
dialog: Fifteen?
speaker_heading: ESTATE AGENT
dialog: Number 10 fetched seventeen.

speaker_heading: ESTATE AGENT (CONT’D)
dialog: Come on. I thought you had a play
dialog: on in the West End. These houses
dialog: have got so much potential. Once
dialog: you get rid of the junk. Well there
dialog: you have it: Gloucester Crescent.
dialog: Good street. On the up and up.
text: A.B. and the ESTATE AGENT walk up Gloucester Crescent. The
text: street is alive with refurbishing activity. As he speaks
text: workmen bring out a nice marble fireplace out of No. 63 and
text: shove it in the skip, breaking it in the process. More

text: A.B. leaves the house
dialog: A.B.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT. DAY 12
text: The van stalled nearby, opposite a Convent. From MISS
text: SHEPHERD'S POV we see A.B., with a WHSmith bag, through the
text: van windscreen which is grimy, with the dashboard hosting a
text: variety of objects like a half-eaten tin of baked beans, a
text: packet of biscuit also half-eaten, various tissues, packets
dialog: of soap flakes etc.
text: A.B. stops to look at a cross (with a painted crucified
text: Christ). MISS SHEPHERD appears at his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: You're not St John, are you?
dialog: A.B.
dialog: St John who?
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: St John. The disciple whom Jesus
dialog: loved.
dialog: A.B.
dialog: No. My name's Bennett.
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: Well, if you're not St John I need
text: a push for the van. It's conked
dialog: out, the battery possibly. I put
dialog: some water in only it hasn't done
dialog: the trick.
dialog: A.B.
dialog: Was it distilled water?
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: It was holy water so it doesn't
dialog: matter if it was distilled or not.
dialog: The oil is another possibility.

scene_heading: THE LADY IN THE VAN - FINAL SCREENPLAY 5.
dialog: A.B.
dialog: That's not holy too?
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: Holy oil in a van? It would be far
dialog: too expensive. I want pushing round
dialog: the corner.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENT. DAY 12b
text: A.B. starts to push. MISS SHEPHERD goes though her repertory
text: of hand signals: 'I am moving off .. I am turning left' .. the
text: movements done with boneless grace and in textbook Highway
dialog: Code fashion.
dialog: A.B.
dialog: Are you wanting to go far?
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: Possibly. I'm in two minds.
scene_heading: EXT. GLOUCESTER CRESCENT. DAY 13
text: A police car passes. MISS SHEPHERD stops the van and crouches

dialog: A.B.
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: I need the other end.
dialog: A.B.
text: That's half a mile away.
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: I'm in dire need of assistance. I'm
text: a sick woman, dying possibly, just
dialog: looking for a last resting place,
dialog: somewhere to lay my head. Do you
dialog: know of anywhere?
dialog: A.B. goes
speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT (V.O.)
dialog: Bye bye madam. Mind how you go.
scene_heading: INT. 23 GLOUCESTER CRESCENT. STUDY. DAY 14
text: A.B. is back in the study, empty except for the desk and

scene_heading: THE LADY IN THE VAN - FINAL SCREENPLAY 6.
speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT (V.O.)
dialog: A proper writer might welcome such
dialog: an encounter as constituting
dialog: experience. Me, I have to wait and
text: mull it over.
speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT
dialog: She saw you coming.
dialog: A.B.
dialog: She's old.
speaker_heading: ALAN BENNETT
dialog: You wouldn't get Harold Pinter
text: pushing a van down the street.
dialog: A.B.
dialog: No. Unlike me. But then, I’m too

speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Pretty house, not as big as ours,

dialog: A.B.
dialog: No. It's attached to the house
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: No, you. You're...single.
dialog: Sickert once lived in the street,
dialog: apparently; Dickens’ abandoned
dialog: wife. Now it's the usual north
dialog: London medley: advertising,

dialog: A.B.
dialog: Well, I've got a play on in the

dialog: On hello darling. You look a

dialog: A.B.
dialog: Well yes this is Camden Town.
text: During the course of the film the house should gradually fill

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMDEN HIGH STREET. DAY 18
text: A.B. gives sixpence to MISS SHEPHERD, who is sitting on the

text: There is also a pile of pamphlets, one of which A.B. takes.
text: She is just chalking in some rudimentary birds.
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: Yes I’m here most days, I teach...
dialog: and the pavement is my blackboard.
dialog: I also sell pencils. A gentlemen

dialog: You’re not the writer?
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD

speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD

scene_heading: THE LADY IN THE VAN - FINAL SCREENPLAY 12.
speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: I need a ruler. I must measure the

dialog: tips on Christian parking.
speaker_heading: RUFUS

speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD
dialog: What with all this to-do, I think

speaker_heading: MISS SHEPHERD

dialog: A.B.
dialog: I suppose I did. I always call her

speaker_heading: MISS BRISCOE
dialog: We all have names. Perhaps if you
dialog: called her by her name and she
dialog: called you by yours? Alan,
dialog: Mary...You never know, it might be
dialog: easier to talk things through.
dialog: A.B.
dialog: Through? There is no through. How
dialog: do you talk things through with
dialog: someone who has conversations with
dialog: the Virgin Mary? You talk things
dialog: through with Isaiah Berlin, maybe,
dialog: who in comparison with Miss
dialog: Shepherd is a man of few words, but
dialog: you do not talk things through with
dialog: her because you don't get through.
speaker_heading: MISS BRISCOE
dialog: Alan. I'm getting a bit of
dialog: hostility here. I realise for you
dialog: this may be a steep learning
dialog: curve...
dialog: A.B.
dialog: No. It is not a steep learning
dialog: curve. I have never been on a so
dialog: called learning curve. I’m about as
dialog: likely to be found on a learning
dialog: curve as I am on the ski slopes at
dialog: Zermatt. And besides, her name
dialog: isn't Mary.
speaker_heading: MISS BRISCOE
dialog: Oh?
