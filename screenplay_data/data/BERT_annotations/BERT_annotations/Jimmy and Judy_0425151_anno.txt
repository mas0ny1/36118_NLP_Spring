scene_heading: I/E. BACKYARD - SUBURBAN HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: POV of a HOME VIDEO CAMERA shooting into the window of
text: teenage girl's bedroom.
dialog: 
text: The door inside opens. In walks JUDY OAKS-KELLEN (18), a
text: blond haired, mousy girl, wearing only a T-shirt and panties.
text: As she heads to the mirror we hear...
dialog: 
text: Sound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing.
dialog: Whoever operates the camera is definitely CHOAKIN' THE
speaker_heading: GOPHER.
dialog: 
text: Judy combs her hair in the mirror, oblivious.
dialog: 
text: The camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA OPERATOR (O.C.)
dialog: Oh, mmph.
dialog: 
text: He's climaxed.
dialog: 
text: The sounds have stopped, but the tape keeps rolling. Judy
text: stops combing her hair as...
dialog: 
text: Camera shuts down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - THE TRACK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy
text: runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea
text: that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight.
dialog: 
text: She's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely
text: miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids
dialog: pass her.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks
text: over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns
text: red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face.
dialog: 
text: We can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's
text: cruel, harsh, and very intense. Exhausted and humiliated,
text: Judy holds back tears as...
dialog: 
text: Camera shuts down.

scene_heading: I/E. JIMMY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD/KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Late summer evening. Camera Operator wipes dirt from the
text: lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as
text: he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a
text: glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a
text: bit awkward, but not at all unappealing.
dialog: 
text: He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles
text: his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing
text: it at the back of his house.
dialog: 
text: Through the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother
text: (JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new
text: millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone,
dialog: preparing dinner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing
dialog: the nasty last night. Thanks for
dialog: that one. By the way, who the fuck
dialog: is Nancy?
dialog: 
text: Camera whips over to JIMMY'S DAD in the LIVING ROOM, well
text: dressed, rich looking and fat in his late 40's, watching
text: baseball on TV, tired after a long day's work. He drinks
text: from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube,
text: munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling
dialog: her friends that you're hung like a
dialog: light switch.
dialog: 
text: Dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch.
text: Jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes
dialog: the reach and... yes! Both balls
dialog: at the same time! One heck of a
dialog: double play!
dialog: 
text: Eyes on the TV, Dad takes his hands out of his pants and
text: sniffs them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
text: And the sniff to finish it off.
dialog: 
text: Satisfied, Dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he
text: continues to watch TV. We zoom out to see both Mom and Dad,
text: each through different windows.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dark and in silhouette, Jimmy flips on the camera by remote.
text: It's too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail, but
text: Jimmy's clearly having sex with a PROSTITUTE in his bed. She
text: is young, black, and looks very much like a prostitute.
dialog: 
text: As he pounds into her...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Do you like that nigger? Come on
dialog: nigger, do you like it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: (humors him)
dialog: Oh yeah baby, I like it.
dialog: 
text: By remote, Jimmy shuts down the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's behind the camera interviewing the Prostitute who
text: sits up in his bed holding the sheets to cover herself. With
text: the lights on, we can see that she's clearly unattractive.
text: Jimmy asks his questions with a gentle confidence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Okay, so. What was going through
dialog: your mind when I called you a
dialog: nigger?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: This costs you an extra fifty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
text: She pauses. You can tell she just wants to leave, but is
dialog: toughing it out for the extra fifty bucks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Well, what did it feel like?
dialog: 
dialog: Long pause.
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: It felt like nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: You ain't the first person to call
dialog: me a nigger when we was fucking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (not surprised)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: Johns call me nigger all the time.
dialog: Especially white guys. Nothing
dialog: new. Just dirty talk.
dialog: 
text: Long, awkward pause. Jimmy Doesn't know what to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: That it?
dialog: 
dialog: No reply from Jimmy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: What about you? You like calling
dialog: me nigger? You get your nut off?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: Then why'd ya call me that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.) (O.C.)
dialog: Have you ever wondered what it was
dialog: like to treat someone so completely
dialog: cruel that it was unthinkable?
dialog: 
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I was trying to do the unthinkable
dialog: and unimaginable when I called you
dialog: that. I wanted to see if was even
dialog: possible for me to do that.
dialog: 
text: They pause.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: Yeah, so?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy speaks softly and confidently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I think I want to die. Like I
dialog: don't deserve to live anymore. And
dialog: that I will never want to do
dialog: something like that to someone
dialog: again.
dialog: 
text: The prostitute finds Jimmy's answer endearing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: Why ya wanna die?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Because everyone hates me.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: They hate me because I seek beauty
dialog: and appreciate destruction. They
dialog: hate my mind, my thoughts, my
dialog: imagination. They hate everything
dialog: about me. And I hate them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: (trying not to care)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yep. Everyone. Everyone that
dialog: knows or who has ever met me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: Your parents don't hate you. Look
dialog: at this room in this big 'ole house
dialog: you got.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: My parents provide me with food and
dialog: shelter because they have been
dialog: conditioned by society into
dialog: thinking it's the appropriate thing
dialog: to do. In reality they can't stand
dialog: to be in the same room with me.
dialog: They're fascists, brainwashed, and
text: unforgiving.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.) (cont'd)
dialog: They dismiss my feelings of ill
dialog: regard towards them on simple
dialog: rebelliousness of youth, but that's
dialog: only because they are patently and
dialog: intentionally unaware of their own
dialog: hypocrisies.
dialog: 
text: Prostitute looks bored/frustrated again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (accidental condescension)
dialog: Do you understand me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: You wanna know what I think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yes, I really do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: I think you're a spoiled ass white
dialog: boy, thinks you everything, but you
dialog: don't know shit. All you do is
dialog: bullshit complain and there's folks
dialog: out there that'd kill for all this.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy doesn't react.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: I don't feel sorry for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: No one is asking you to. Thank you

scene_heading: I/E. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jimmy hides hidden camera style inside his car in the high
text: school parking lot, bleachers in the distance. School is
text: letting out as he zooms in on Judy.
dialog: 
text: She's looking at the ground as she's taunted by a group of
text: Other Harassing Teenagers, a tear streaming down the side of
text: her cheek.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag. She
text: falls to the ground, then picks up her broken glasses as
text: camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl).
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Nearby, a big, Dumb Looking Bully Type (18) taunts her as she
text: cries. His taunts are biting and as excessive as the Mean
text: Girl's, then he dumps a cup of soda on Judy's head as she's
dialog: crying.
dialog: 
text: Judy screams at the top of her lungs. The group runs off
text: laughing. Jimmy whip pans to the Mean Girl as she laughs
text: with her friends, then whips pans back to Judy, now on her
text: feet, blood running from her nose and onto her white shirt.
dialog: 
text: Camera shuts down.

scene_heading: I/E. JUDY'S HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A scene we've seen before. Jimmy is off camera videotaping
text: Judy through her bedroom window. We hear him FLOGGIN' THE
text: DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror.
text: She stops when she hears...
dialog: 
text: A Grown Man, (45), walks into the doorway of her bedroom.
text: This is JUDY'S DAD. He comes in and doesn't say a thing to
text: her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues
text: combing her hair as though he's not even there.
dialog: 
text: He comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her,
text: giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right.
text: The masturbation sounds STOP.
dialog: 
text: Judy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her
text: Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down
text: to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom
text: light. The room goes dark.
dialog: 
text: Camera flips down, then OFF...
dialog: 
text: Then COMES BACK ON AGAIN
dialog: 
text: Once again we're looking through the camera pointing at the
text: window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white
text: of "Nite Shot" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her
text: dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found.
dialog: 
text: Whatever's going on between them, it's going on out of frame,
text: away from the view of the window. Camera shuts down.

scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jimmy films once again, hidden camera style, long lens from
text: far away. Frame is close on Judy sitting at the dining room
dialog: table.
dialog: 
text: As camera pulls back, we HEAR but don't see Judy's Parents
text: talking to Jimmy's Mom and Dad at the table. Judy is bored,
text: completely uninterested in their conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
dialog: So Melissa talked Gary into the SL
dialog: instead of the seven series. I
dialog: couldn't believe it.
dialog: 
text: Judy looks over at camera, catching the fact that she's being
text: videotaped. Jimmy keeps filming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
dialog: They paid way too much.
dialog: 
text: As Jimmy zooms in, she clandestinely flips off the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY'S DAD
dialog: I strictly buy American anyway.
dialog: 
text: Judy gets up. Her mom stops her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY'S MOM (O.C.)
dialog: Where you going honey?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Bathroom.
dialog: 
text: As Judy leaves the table she walks towards camera as it shuts

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Judy sits on Jimmy's bed, staring into the camera. She's
text: uncomfortable sitting there. It's poorly framed.

speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Can we start already?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: One second.
dialog: 
text: Camera shuts off.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jimmy films Judy again, better framing this time. Judy looks
text: annoyed and uncomfortable in front of the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Who do you hate most in the world
dialog: and why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (kind of bitchy)
dialog: Why? Who cares?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: God, I just wanted to come up here
dialog: to say "hi" and get away from my
dialog: parents' bullshit for like two
dialog: seconds and you have to put the
dialog: stupid camera in my face.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy takes delight in Judy's displeasure of being filmed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Now we're onto something.
dialog: 
text: Judy wants to go and then doesn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You're weird Jimmy. You were weird
dialog: when we were kids and now you're
dialog: just getting weirder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Is that why you had a crush on me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: Yeah right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: You didn't have a crush on me?
dialog: 
text: Judy fidgets, he's got her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You're a loser. You're twenty one
dialog: and you're still living with your
dialog: parents.
dialog: 
text: She's waiting for a response. Jimmy doesn't bite.
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I heard that you got kicked out of
dialog: college because you tried to talk
dialog: your roommate into killing himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Where'd you hear that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: From everyone.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy waits. Judy's curious how he'll respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: You wanna know the truth?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: He asked me if he should kill
dialog: himself. I told him to look inside
dialog: himself for the answer. I didn't
dialog: tell him to. I didn't tell him not
dialog: to. I said he shouldn't be afraid
dialog: of the unknown. If he was going to
dialog: kill himself, I wanted him to do it
dialog: for the right reasons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I swear to God, you're a fucking
dialog: psycho.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Like you're normal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: More than you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: If I'm such a freak, what are you
dialog: doing in my room?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I was bored.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy waits, assessing the situation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I wanna show you something?

dialog:

text: television in the shot. The screen is static.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I can't believe I'm doing this.
dialog: 
text: Nothing's happening. Judy's getting antsy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (offended; turns to
dialog: camera)
dialog: Can you start the tape?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy clicks the VCR with his remote, as Judy turns back to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Don't think this means I like you
dialog: or anything.
dialog:

text: That's Mrs. Holzclaw's car. She's

scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENTRANCE (ON JIMMY'S TV) - DAY
dialog: 
text: Same location, different day. On TV, again hidden camera

dialog: 
text: She's placed into an ambulance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I took care of her too.

scene_heading: END JIMMY'S REVENGE TAPE

scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: The TV is off. All we see is Judy's back. She hasn't once
text: turned around to face the camera during any of the clips.
dialog: 
text: She sits still.
dialog: 
text: She trembles but doesn't turn around. She collects herself
text: but still doesn't turn around. Jimmy holds the camera
dialog: steady.
dialog: 
text: Still she doesn't turn around.
dialog: 
text: She fidgets in her seat but still doesn't turn around.
dialog: 
text: She now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is in a

dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: No movement.
dialog: 
dialog: No movement.
dialog: 
dialog: No movement.
dialog: 
text: She begins to breath heavily.
dialog: 
text: Then no movement.
dialog: 
text: She leans her head down towards the floor.
dialog: 
text: Then no movement.
dialog: 
dialog: Still no movement or any reaction for that matter. It's like

dialog: 
text: Jimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging.
dialog: 
text: Still no movement.
dialog: 
text: It looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head

text: position facing the TV.
dialog: 
dialog: Then... no movement.
dialog: 
text: Still no movement.
dialog: 
text: Then Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets
text: off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor
text: crying hysterically.
dialog: 
text: Judy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out
text: a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard,
dialog: and loud.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera.
dialog: 
text: She rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into
text: the camera. She tries to collect herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Why did you do that?

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I had to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: the party.
dialog: 
text: A generic "Happy Twentieth Anniversary" sign hangs above the
text: front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style
text: studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing

text: overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing.
dialog: 
text: Gifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed

text: People at the party all turn to camera, a look of shock on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Hey, great party, huh? I'm making
dialog: a tape for my parents. Want to say
dialog: something to them?
dialog:

speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy turns the camera at his mother who is completely
text: shocked to see him like this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Hey Mom. Happy anniversary. You
dialog: want to say anything to yourself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD
dialog: That's enough.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad runs into the room and throws a blanket over
text: Jimmy's head, body and the camera. All we see is black and
text: flashes of light from under the blanket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: Get out! Now!

dialog: 
text: Camera is being removed from the camera bag. As the lens
text: pans quickly, we catch a glimpse of Jimmy smirking, holding
text: the camera. He's way too close to the lens.
dialog: 
text: He flips it around until it locks on DR. WALTERS, MFCC (40),
text: Jimmy's not very accomplished therapist. Walters seems to
text: have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests he's
dialog: the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to. He
text: sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office.
text: Jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first
dialog: session together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Jimmy, we discussed this. You
dialog: can't tape our sessions. It's not
dialog: allowed.
dialog: 
text: The camera doesn't move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: You know, you can't film someone
dialog: who doesn't want their image and
dialog: voice recorded. Technically,
dialog: you're actually breaking the law.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy (O.C.) doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Does your defiance make you feel
dialog: more powerful?
dialog: 
text: Still no answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Filming people makes you feel like
dialog: you're in control of the situation
dialog: doesn't it?
dialog: 
text: Still no answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: I can sit here as long as you can.
dialog: You're not going to be able to
dialog: force me to participate in your
dialog: little game here.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: No movement from the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Jimmy, this isn't something that
dialog: friends do to each other is it?
dialog: 
text: Dr. Walters sits in front of the camera, trying to stay
text: perfectly still and calm.
dialog: 
text: Dr. Walters is so nice and so calm, that we start to feel
dialog: sorry for him.
dialog: 
dialog: No movement.
dialog: 
dialog: No movement.
dialog: 
text: Dr. Walters fidgets.
dialog: 
text: Then holds still.
dialog: 
text: Then fidgets, trying to stay calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Jimmy, put the camera away, please.
dialog: 
dialog: No movement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: You're wasting your time and mine,
dialog: Jimmy. We could be doing something
dialog: productive.
dialog: 
text: The camera shakes a bit. Jimmy's laughing.
dialog: 
text: Dr. Walters is doing his best to stay calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: That's enough.
dialog: 
dialog: No movement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Put it away.
dialog: 
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Now Jimmy!
dialog: 
text: Dr. Walters gets up and comes towards the camera. He grabs
text: it just above the lens and tries to take it away.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Come on Jimmy.
dialog: 
text: A fierce battle of tug of war breaks out. We see Dr. Walters
text: becoming increasingly pissed off.
dialog: 
text: The back and forth is suddenly getting violent, until...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. WALTERS
dialog: Gimme the Goddamn fucking camera!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: No. No filming. I'm leaving, I

dialog: herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Do what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Say it like you did before but it
dialog: doesn't have to be exactly the
dialog: same.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You mean paraphrase it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: That's what I said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I didn't hear you.
dialog: 
text: Judy stares off camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Are you ready?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm waiting for you.

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Tell me when.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You want me to paraphrase it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 
text: Judy thinks for a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I can't remember what I said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Then just ad-lib.
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Ad-lib?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Judy thinks for a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I don't know what that means.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (getting frustrated)
dialog: It means make it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Do you want me to make something up
dialog: or paraphrase what I did the first
dialog: time?
dialog: 
text: This isn't working. The camera drops from Judy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Let's take a break.
dialog: 
text: Camera shuts down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Camera's on a tripod. Jimmy sits in a chair, the back of his
text: shoulder foregrounds Judy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm not good on camera. It makes
dialog: me nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Forget about the camera. Talk to
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Tell me what you said earlier.
dialog: About me about how you felt when
dialog: you saw the video.
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (relaxes)
dialog: It felt like someone had been
dialog: reading my mind.
dialog: 
text: She stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Go on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: It was like someone had jumped into
dialog: my head and watched what was being
dialog: projected.
dialog: 
text: Now Judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And earlier, what you said about
dialog: God.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy zooms in the camera by remote. Judy's distracted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Tell me.
dialog: 
text: Judy refocuses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I said that it felt like God had
dialog: sent someone to protect me, and to
dialog: look out for me.
dialog: 
text: She looks at Jimmy as if he is an angel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: And I said that you are the only
dialog: person in my life who has ever
dialog: looked after me like that.
dialog: 
text: Judy tries to stifle tears, but they're starting to flow
text: again. As camera zooms in further, Judy catches sight of
text: Jimmy's finger on the remote and BLOWS HER FUCKING TOP,
text: leaping from her chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: God, I hate it when you film me
dialog: crying!
dialog: 
text: Judy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the
text: tripod, she finally frees it and points it at Jimmy.
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: How do you like it, huh? How do
dialog: you like having a camera shoved
dialog: right up your ass?
dialog: 
text: Camera's framed poorly, moves around a lot, goes in and out
dialog: of focus, etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Do you like it? Do you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don't like it or dislike. I'm
dialog: used to it.
dialog: 
text: Judy moves the camera directly in his face. The lens is
text: millimeters away from his nose. We see an extreme close up
text: of his nostrils.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Generally I'd place the camera
dialog: further away from my nose, but if
dialog: this is your preferred shooting
dialog: style then I guess I'll have to
dialog: adjust to it.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How's this work for you?
dialog: 
text: Judy pulls back and continues filming him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Give me a break.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
text: Now Judy's the interviewer. Her framing is not quite as
text: adept as Jimmy's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: So... why do you have to film
dialog: everything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don't film everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Why do you like to film me crying?
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Then why do you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Because it's rare that I get to
dialog: find someone that lets their
dialog: emotions go. When a person is
dialog: crying, I mean truly crying, or
dialog: truly laughing or smiling or
text: frowning or gasping. For a few
dialog: seconds or minutes I get a chance
dialog: to see that person's soul. And
dialog: really, now that you've forced me
dialog: to think about it. I think it's a
dialog: very rare and beautiful thing to be
dialog: afforded that opportunity.
dialog: 
text: Judy is shaken and speechless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Anything else?
dialog: 
text: Judy's moved and forgets herself. Camera drops from Jimmy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Why me?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy helps her put the camera back up on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Because.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy sits still. Judy doesn't know what to do with that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why do you think?
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't have an answer.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and
text: turns the interview around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Why you and why me? Why are we
dialog: together right now?
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't know what to say.
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Go ahead say it. I want you to. I
dialog: know what you're going to say so
dialog: just say it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Tell me.
dialog: 
text: Judy fidgets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (bullies her)
dialog: Tell me!
dialog: 
text: Judy fidgets again, then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (blows her top)
dialog: Because we're both fucking weird!
dialog: 
text: Judy pauses. The pressure of the camera from Jimmy makes her
dialog: feel like she has to give him more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Because we're the two weirdest kids
dialog: in the world. And God made us for
dialog: each other and I fucking love you,
dialog: and you did all this because you
dialog: love me too, and fuck everyone and
dialog: everything that doesn't get it!
dialog: 
text: Judy's out of breath. Camera still points at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: That's right, right?
dialog: 
text: Judy stares back at the camera, longing for an answer from
text: Jimmy. She told him she loved him. Camera shuts down.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Do you hate your parents?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yes, but I understand them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What's to understand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Lots of things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Like what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I understand that my ascension into
dialog: young adulthood triggered their
text: descent into mid-life crisis.
dialog: Generally when an only child leaves
text: the nest, the parents begin
text: reassessing their own lives. They
dialog: see us as a younger, better version
dialog: of themselves.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (cont'd)
dialog: They feel abandoned by our need for
dialog: privacy and insecure because we no
dialog: longer seek their approval. They
dialog: used to take us to baseball games
dialog: and cover our scrapes with
dialog: bandages, but once we no longer
dialog: need Mom to nurture our bruises or
dialog: Dad to be our hero it puts their
dialog: roles and subsequent sense of self
dialog: worth into question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: How do you know all these things?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: When you don't have any friends,
dialog: don't play sports, don't go out,
dialog: have no one talk to, nowhere to go,
dialog: no one to listen to you, or no one
dialog: to help you figure things out, you
dialog: sort of have to figure things out
dialog: by yourself. And without any of
dialog: those things I have nothing but
dialog: time to think about stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: You are SO smart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You are so beautiful.

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: No one has ever told me that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: You take yours out.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: It's already out.
dialog: 
text: Judy tilts the camera down.
dialog: 
text: IN A FLASH we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of Jimmy's
text: fly, a smiley face sticker covers the head. The camera
text: quickly shakes and spins off the image as Judy screams bloody
dialog: fucking murder.
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jimmy laughs. Judy forgets the camera is on. She drops it
text: into her lap, fabric from her clothes covers the frame.
dialog: 
text: We can hear Jimmy and Judy laughing hysterically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: I can't believe you did that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: That's why I did it. Now come on.
dialog: I showed you mine, let me see
dialog: yours.
dialog: 
text: We hear the rustling of Judy's clothing. Camera falls to her

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Wow. Give me the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Here, I'll pull over.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy pulls over to the side of the road then takes the
text: camera. Jimmy frames up Judy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Let me see 'em.
dialog: 
text: Judy has a naughty and flirtatious smile.
dialog: 
text: In the blink of an eye she suddenly lifts up her shirt and
text: exposes her bra, then pulls her shirt back down.
dialog: 
dialog: Jimmy protests.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: That doesn't count. Come on, for
dialog: real this time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm embarrassed.

dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Don't be. You can trust me.
dialog: 
text: Judy's not sure. Jimmy looks into her eyes, pouring it on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: You can. You can trust me with
dialog: your life.
dialog: 
text: Judy looks at him with a sense of admiration then hope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Please.
dialog: 
text: Judy gets the same sexy, naughty smile and lifts up her shirt
text: exposing the bra, keeping it there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Will you take off your bra?
dialog: 
text: Judy looks nervous but gives in. She unhooks her bra from
text: the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she
text: can. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on them. It's
text: too much for her. She quickly pulls her shirt back down.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy tilts up to a close up of Judy's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: I just realized something.
dialog: 
text: Judy's eyes are starting to well up as she tries not to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: What's the matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I just showed you my breasts and I
dialog: saw your penis and we haven't even
dialog: kissed.
dialog: 
text: She starts tearing up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You haven't even asked me to be
dialog: your girlfriend and I did that.
dialog: I'm a slut.
dialog: (wiping her eyes)
dialog: I don't want to be a slut.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (sniffling)
dialog: Yes. Will you turn off the camera?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I want this moment to be captured
dialog: forever. I'd rather not kiss you
dialog: at all than waste the opportunity
dialog: to document the most beautiful
dialog: moment of my life.
dialog: 
text: Judy leans towards Jimmy, then suddenly attacks him and
text: shoves the camera to the side. They are making out

dialog: 
text: Jimmy finally has the camera in position. He has one of his

speaker_heading: JUDY

dialog: You do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Very much so. I always have.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Me too.
dialog: 
text: Long pause filled with sexual tension takes over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Do you want to pull over again?

dialog: 
text: Judy films Jimmy as he FIRES a twelve gage pump action shot
text: gun off into the distance. After each shot he pumps then
text: FIRES again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Are you getting this?
dialog: 
dialog: No response.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy FIRES another shot. His muscles are flexing as he
text: pumps the gage. He looks extremely violent and determined.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Come on. Are you getting this?
dialog: 
text: A very turned off Judy replies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: This is where you wanted to take
dialog: me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah, what's the matter?
dialog: 
text: We can hear Judy crying. The camera shakes out of control.
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: I wanna go home.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy looks over towards the camera/Judy. He knows that he's
dialog: fucked up and he feels like complete shit.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy walks over to her, takes the camera and shuts it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jimmy is standing in front of a mirror and is videotaping his
dialog: own reflection.
dialog: 
text: He is talking to himself and into the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don't fuck this up. Please don't
dialog: fuck this up.
dialog: 
text: Now he is pleading with himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Just try to be normal.
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Just be normal! God damn it why do
dialog: you have to fuck everything up?
dialog: 
text: He hasn't convinced himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Be normal. Be normal. Be normal!

scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jimmy films Judy who lies next to him in the bed. Her face
text: is sweaty and red and he is still a tad out of breath. Jimmy
text: is capturing her literally seconds after they had sex.
dialog: 
text: She's somewhat bewildered, then she notices the camera.
text: She's starting to get used to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: So how do you feel now, right at
dialog: this moment?
dialog: 
text: Judy just sighs, basking in the afterglow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (trying)
dialog: That was soooo good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: You were good. What got into you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I don't know. I've just really
dialog: been wanting you lately. Really
dialog: bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Why's that?
dialog: 
text: Judy chuckles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm embarrassed. I can't say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Now you have to tell me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: It was after yesterday.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy is more than surprised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yesterday?
dialog: 
text: Judy speaks as if she is going to reveal a big secret. Very
text: quiet and cute in her mannerisms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yeah, it was after I saw you shoot
dialog: that gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: You were crying. I wanted to kill
dialog: myself after I did that. You were
dialog: scared and you were shaking. It
dialog: was the most awful thing I ever
dialog: did. I didn't think I'd ever see
dialog: you again.
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Judy thinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I was scared at first. Really
dialog: scared. I didn't expect it to be
dialog: so loud and you looked so mean.
dialog: But then I got home and started
dialog: thinking about it. About how your
dialog: muscles looked and how dangerous it
dialog: all seemed. It made me like... all
dialog: excited, and like...
dialog: 
text: Judy looks for the right word.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Horny?
dialog: 
text: Judy laughs with embarrassment. Camera shakes as Jimmy hands
dialog: it to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Here. Hold this.
dialog: 
text: Judy turns the camera back on Jimmy as he leaps out of bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Where you going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: One sec!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's bare ass flashes us as he heads out the bedroom door.
dialog: 
text: Judy holds the camera as we hear Jimmy in the hallway. He
text: opens a closet door, fumbles through it, then busts back into
text: the bedroom, holding the shotgun he used out on the lake.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy zooms in on Jimmy's naked upper body as he stands in
text: front of her and begins pumping the gun and pulling the
text: trigger. Obviously the gun is not loaded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: That is so hot!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: My dad keeps it in his closet.
dialog: Here.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy gives Judy the gun. Now she's holding the gun and the
dialog: camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: It's heavy.
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Judy points the gun at Jimmy. She lowers it, aiming right at
text: his crotch just below frame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Now I see the appeal. Give me the
dialog: camera.
dialog: 
text: Judy hands Jimmy the camera. Camera moves and shakes as she
text: hands it over.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy frames her up nicely. Now we see Judy topless,
text: pointing the gun directly at the lens of the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: What do you think of this?
dialog: 
text: She brings the gun down, then takes the barrel of the gun and
text: places it between her breasts, squishing them together,
text: covering her nipples as she rubs the barrel between her
dialog: breasts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Do you like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Judy takes the barrel of the gun from her breasts and near
text: her mouth. She starts rolling her tongue over the top of the
text: barrel slowly and seductively, then stops. It looks as if
text: she's about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of
dialog: the gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: That is SO hot.
dialog: 
text: As she is about to start to move her mouth and lips over the
text: gun, then suddenly we hear a garage door open.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy throws the camera sideways down on the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Fuck! It's my parents!
dialog: 
text: We are now seeing sideways rotated images of Jimmy and Judy
text: panicking, throwing on their clothes as fast as humanly
dialog: possible.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy grabs the camera off the bed and turns it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - PARENTS' BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents' bedroom. He
text: has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the
text: camera through the crack.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad enters the room. He has no idea that he is being
text: filmed and that Jimmy is in the closet.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top
text: drawer and pulls something out. It's too dark in the room to
text: tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble
text: some sort of undergarment.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame.
dialog: 
text: After a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a
text: sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking.
text: He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see
text: that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of
text: fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on.
dialog: 
text: When he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off
text: the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins
text: to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of
text: the hose over his hands and fingertips.
dialog: 
text: He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to
text: get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the
text: room for a few seconds.
dialog: 
text: Now Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long
text: brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on,
text: with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he
dialog: has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest,
dialog: hairiest, Cher look-a-like.
dialog: 
text: Someone else enters the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD
dialog: Hi sweety.
dialog: 
text: Holy shit. It's Jimmy's Mom, and she's wearing a leather
dialog: dominatrix outfit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM
dialog: Are you ready for me, you fucking
dialog: slut?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD
dialog: Not quite.
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM
dialog: I don't feel like waiting. Hurry
dialog: up bitch. What do you have left to
dialog: do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD
dialog: I just need to put on my makeup.
dialog: 
text: As Jimmy's Mom exits frame, we see Jimmy's Dad go to the
text: mirror. He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a
dialog: little makeup bag.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Mom re-enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's
text: hat, carrying a riding switch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM
dialog: Come on slut.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to
text: the bed. By the way Jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if
dialog: they've gone through this routine a thousand times.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Mom drifts off screen as Jimmy's Dad gets up on all
text: fours. Suddenly, we hear a SMACK as Jimmy's Mom hits Jimmy's
text: Dad on his ass with the switch.
dialog: 
text: He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING
text: him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and
text: gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the
text: air until she stops.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad
text: pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while
text: he waits for her return.
dialog: 
text: She comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an
text: enormous strap on dildo.
dialog: 
text: Disappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself
text: ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed.
dialog: 
text: From behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's
text: dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as
text: she rips his fishnets off screen.
dialog: 
text: There's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's
text: Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up.
text: Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from
text: the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She
text: jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder.
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Camera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening.
text: Mom's just started doing Dad from behind with the strap on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hi mom. Hi dad. What are you guys
dialog: up to?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting. He looks
text: completely absurd screaming at Jimmy wearing his sequined
text: dress and wig.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD
dialog: What the fuck are you doing here?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Mom goes hysterical and begins screaming at Jimmy's
dialog: Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM
dialog: (to his dad)
dialog: I told you he would find out you
dialog: fucking freak! No wonder he's a
dialog: fucking psycho. Look a his father.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad is beside himself with fury and throws off his
dialog: wig.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD
dialog: Turn off the that fucking camera!
dialog: Turn off that fucking camera right
dialog: fucking now god damn it!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy is loving it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Gee dad, what do you say the two of
dialog: us go out to the front yard and
dialog: throw some ball together? We'll
dialog: have a nice friendly game of catch.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad attacks Jimmy. He swings at the lens. He's one
text: angry drag queen daddy. He begins strangling Jimmy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD
dialog: You little mother fucker. Turn off
dialog: that fucking camera!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating
dialog: Jimmy's Dad with it.
dialog: 
text: Judging from the punishment she's inflicting upon her drag
text: queen husband, the dildo apparently is made from the finest
dialog: and heaviest of materials.
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM
dialog: Stop it! You're going to kill him.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad lets go. The dildo's doing the trick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD
dialog: Bitch!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Mom keeps swinging the dildo at Jimmy's Dad even
text: though he's let go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM
dialog: Fuck you! You think you know me?
dialog: You don't know me! You piece of
dialog: shit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Mom!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Mom now directs her attention on Jimmy. She screams
text: at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the
dialog: camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM
dialog: You little beast! You want to film
dialog: something? Film this!
dialog: 
text: She continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and
text: closer to the lens.
dialog: 
text: The camera goes crazy. Loud sounds are heard throughout the
text: room. Evidently Jimmy has been tackled. We hear wrestling
text: and grunting. It seems that Jimmy's Dad has tackled Jimmy,
text: or maybe his Mom, or both, but the camera is too shaky to
dialog: tell just what has happened.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's Dad is still fighting. He seems to have them all
text: pinned against the floor. He's crushing his mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
dialog: Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy! Please
dialog: someone call me Nancy. My name is
dialog: Nancy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)
dialog: (crying hysterically)
dialog: Nancy, Nancy, Nancy... Jimmy
dialog: please call him "Nancy" for the
dialog: love of God. Call your daddy
dialog: Nancy. Call him Nancy...!
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We hear Jimmy's Mom screaming/repeating herself. We see a
text: hand go over the lens. Jimmy and his mother and father are
text: all in a wrestling match on the floor.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy with great enthusiasm begins to sing as the camera
dialog: shakes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Take me out to the ball game, take
dialog: me out to the crowd, buy me some
dialog: peanuts and crackerjacks...
dialog: 
text: The wrestling match continues as we see more hands come
text: towards the lens. Jimmy's Mom suddenly stops screaming, as
text: if she's been knocked out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)
dialog: Give me that fucking tape!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I don't think so Nancy. Nancy,
dialog: Nancy, Nancy...
dialog: 
text: After some very intense fighting, someone is finally able to
text: shut the camera off.

speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST/MEADOW - RUNNING NAKED - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jimmy has the camera and is chasing a naked (just from
text: behind) Judy through the woods. The camera shakes and
dialog: rattles, but we can definitely tell this is all in good fun.
dialog: 
text: Judy screams as she is being chased through the woods. She
dialog: couldn't feel more free.
dialog: 
text: She begins to tire and slows down. She can no longer run and
text: turns towards the camera. As she turns around, camera shows
text: her from the waist up. She has a beer can in her hand and
text: she is a little drunk.
dialog: 
text: For the first time, she's completely at ease with her own
text: body and looks perfectly natural being naked in the
text: wilderness. She walks towards the camera smoothly and
text: seductively. Her long hair blond hair blows gently in the
dialog: wind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm so glad you're out. Next time
dialog: your dad wants to take it in the
dialog: ass, DON'T FILM HIM!
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I know. Ironic that I was the one
dialog: sent to the nut house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I thought I was going to die
dialog: without you. What if you and I
dialog: could live here together? Forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Right here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm serious. Maybe not here, but
dialog: eventually we'll buy some land, and
dialog: we can live together on it, and be
dialog: naked whenever we want.
dialog: 
text: She takes a big swig of her beer. Then burps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Excuse me. What do you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I think you're drunk.
dialog: 
text: Judy walks towards the camera. She puts her mouth inches
text: away from the lens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I think you're right mister.
dialog: 
text: Judy giggles, then dances around playfully in the woods. She
dialog: has never felt so alive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I don't want this to ever end. I
dialog: want to be here forever. I want to
dialog: dance and be naked and be free, and
dialog: I want us to ball our brains out
dialog: everyday, and I want to feel the
dialog: air on my body and I want to get
dialog: drunk and not care about anything
dialog: in the world. I just want us to be
dialog: together in this moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I know a place like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You do?
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yep. We can go there one day if

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: We can? Where is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Erlanger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (doesn't buy it)
dialog: Erlanger!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yeah Erlanger. Everybody was
text: talking about it in the nut house.
dialog: That's ALL anybody fucking talked
dialog: about was this dude who lives up
dialog: there named Uncle Rodney. He
dialog: supposedly has a commune where we
dialog: can do this kind of thing every
dialog: day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Uncle Rodney's commune?
dialog: 
text: Judy smiles, almost laughing. It all sounds pretty
text: ridiculous to her, but plays along anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: That's funny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: No, I'm serious.
dialog:

text: Jimmy, surprising him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Okay, now it's your turn.
dialog: 
text: Shot from the waist up, we now see that Jimmy's naked as
text: well. He's at a loss as to what he should say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: How does it feel to be a free man?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy thinks. A drunk Judy is losing her patience.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Come on, come on, come on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Okay, go.

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I want to go one day without
dialog: masturbating. I want to liberate

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: That's gross!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And I love you. I love you so much
dialog: it hurts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: It hurts?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Like God is stabbing me in heart
text: with a thousand knives at the same
dialog: time and you're the only one who
dialog: can make the pain go away. Do you
dialog: love me that much?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: that we will be together always and
dialog: forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You mean get married?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Something more powerful than

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Transcendental.
dialog: (grabs the camera)

dialog: 
text: Jimmy hands Judy the camera as she starts to frame him up,
text: but they're really engaging each other's eyes over the top of
text: the eyepiece.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It's transcendental because it
dialog: transcends everything. Life, love,
dialog: law, people, things... A bond so
dialog: strong that our souls will become
dialog: one and it can never end, even in
dialog: death. If you swear on the bond,
dialog: it means you'd rather die than

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog:

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Twenty years from now, when we're

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Well you freak me out sometimes.

speaker_heading: JUDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: So everybody makes fun of me, huh?

speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yeah. Can't you give the thing a

text: Jimmy's fuming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: And you don't want to deal with it?
dialog: Well fuck them and fuck you too if
dialog: you think that. I couldn't give a

dialog: And right now me filming you

dialog: 
text: Jimmy starts crying.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: How does it feel Jimmy? How does
dialog: it feel to have someone taping you
dialog: while you're crying?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy doesn't answer. He tries to compose himself enough to

dialog: 
text: Judy pushes harder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Tell me. Look at the camera and

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Yes. I can most definitely try.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And you can never, ever, ever ask

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Mother fuckers.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the TEENAGE DRIVER of the car appears, as if out of

dialog: 
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The frame catches up to him just as he spits a huge LOOGIE
text: into the car, hitting Judy right in the face.
dialog: 
text: Judy screams. The car full of Three Teenagers laugh
text: hysterically at her expense.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy hands Judy the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Here, you're definitely going to
dialog: want to tape this.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy calmly gets out of his car as Judy tapes him through
text: the window. We can hear her breathing heavily as she tries
text: not to cry softly off camera.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy has gone to the rear of the car. We hear the trunk
text: open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full
text: of laughing teens. Jimmy enters the frame carrying a
dialog: baseball bat.
dialog: 
text: We see him talking calmly to the driver of the car, the Kid
text: who spat in Judy's face. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHAM!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with
text: the bat. The Kid falls over into the front seat of the car.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins
text: bashing in the windshield.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Oh my God.
dialog: 
text: Now rage has taken over Jimmy over entirely. He's bashing in
text: the windshield with all of his might.
dialog: 
text: The teenagers all go running from the car. A crowd starts to
text: form in the parking lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Oh, God Jimmy...
dialog: 
text: Jimmy has now completely bashed in the windshield and moves

dialog: windows.
dialog: 
text: Now a sizeable crowd is formed. Jimmy is seemingly oblivious
text: to them and continues bashing the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: I love you Jimmy.
dialog: 
text: Now it's to the point of overkill. But Jimmy won't stop.
text: It's as if the rage he's been carrying inside of him his

dialog: 
text: We hear sirens in the distance as Jimmy continues to bash the
text: car. The car is in near shambles as we hear police sirens in
dialog: the distance.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy stop, please stop. Jimmy...
dialog: oh god, Jimmy stop. God damn it,
dialog: fucking stop!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy doesn't. He pounds the car harder as a police cruiser
text: pulls up. Two policemen get out of the car. They are
text: temporarily paralyzed with indecision.
dialog: 
text: We see one of the officers trying to speak with Jimmy. He
text: just ignores them. The policemen are oblivious to the fact
text: they are being filmed.
dialog: 
text: One of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in
text: Jimmy's face.
dialog: 
text: Now Jimmy is completely freaking out. We hear him scream,
text: but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed. One
text: of the cops draws his gun as Jimmy swings aimlessly towards
text: them. He gets sprayed again with the mace and is now
text: completely blinded. A huge crowd has now amassed outside of
dialog: the grocery store.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Oh, God Jimmy, oh God...
dialog: 
text: Now the entire parking lot is filled with cop cars. Lights
text: are flashing all around Jimmy. He is surrounded but sill
text: continues to swing the bat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy...
dialog: 
text: Three cops tackle Jimmy from behind. Judy throws down the
text: camera and runs out the door. The camera is face down on the

dialog: 
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We hear Judy get out of the car, leaving the door open so we
text: can hear the entire scene with much more intensity. The
text: sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming.
dialog: 
text: We hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are
text: pulling up. More screaming and sounds on the radio is heard.

dialog: We're going to need an ambulance

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What did you do in there all day?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: Masturbated mostly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Seriously, what did you do? What
dialog: was a day in the life of Jimmy in
dialog: the nut house?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Well, besides masturbating, I
dialog: talked and talked and talked and
dialog: fucking talked until they were
dialog: satisfied. But basically I told
dialog: them what they wanted to hear. I
dialog: said shit like...
dialog: 
text: Jimmy does an over the top mock sincerity speech.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: "Now that I'm finally able to talk

dialog: and harmful to others."
dialog: 
text: Judy laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Then I figured it out. I had to
dialog: cry as much as possible. Whenever
dialog: someone would cry they'd call it a
dialog: "break through." So I'd be like.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy does an imitation of himself in therapy. He looks
text: directly into the lens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You start out slow, then you build
dialog: it up like this... "Now I know
dialog: that using violence is not the
dialog: answer."
dialog: 
text: Jimmy is getting progressively sappier and more over the top
text: with his self impersonation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Then you go like this:
dialog: (snaps back into the
dialog: impersonation)
dialog: I was wrong, I know I was wrong and
dialog: I'll never do it again. I don't
dialog: want to hurt people or myself.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy does an obnoxious fake cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo-hoo-hoo,
dialog: waaaaaaa.
dialog: (snaps out of it)
dialog: Then you always give them the
text: obligatory hug at the end. After a
dialog: couple of weeks, then they
dialog: officially diagnose you with
dialog: something, give you a prescription,
dialog: then you're done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: 
text: Jimmy pretends he is reading from a text book 50's industrial
dialog: spoof style.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: ODD is a disorder characterized by
dialog: an overwhelming pattern of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: 
text: Jimmy goes into a cartoonish like crazy person character.

dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: Jimmy yells.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ooow, jeez, they're hot! I burnt

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I didn't mean to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Was it because you jerked off so

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JUDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: No, no, no! That has nothing to do
dialog: with it. After I saw my dad being

dialog: kind of blocked it out, but when I
dialog: was in there they kept talking to
dialog: me and talking to me about it. Now
dialog: I can't stop it from coming into my
dialog: head. Every time I get wood, the
dialog: instant replay machine in my brain
dialog: projects this image of my Mom
dialog: pounding into my Dad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: God, that's awful. I didn't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yeah well, you know you didn't give
dialog: too much of an effort to get in my
dialog: pants anyhow. You just sort of
dialog: made your sex face and grabbed my
dialog: crotch.
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Judy takes another drink off the bottle of whiskey and
dialog: smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: How do you like this?
dialog: 
text: While she is driving she pulls down her tank top and quickly
text: exposes her breasts through the top of her shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Now we're talking.
dialog: 
text: Judy tries to position her body so her breasts are in frame.
text: She begins pushing one up, then sticks out her tongue,
dialog: teasing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: That is so hot.
dialog: 
text: Judy smiles and looks over at the camera. One hand on the
text: steering wheel and one on her breast, when...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Watch out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOOM!
dialog: 
text: A loud THUMP hits the car, shaking the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I think you hit someone.
dialog: 
text: Judy's in shock. Jimmy puts the camera on the floor of the
text: car by the passenger seat. He forgets to turn it off.
dialog: 
text: All we see is a close up of the floor and Jimmy's feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Stay here.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy gets out of the car. We hear the car door open then
dialog: close.
dialog: 
text: Judy sounds like she is having a complete nervous breakdown.
text: She's crying, but in an extremely nervous and frantic way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (calls to him)
dialog: Oh my God, what are you doing?
dialog: 
text: We have no clue what Jimmy is doing outside of the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Oh fuck, oh fuck. Oh my god.
dialog: Jimmy?
dialog: 
text: We hear a car door open and some struggling sounds coming
dialog: from Jimmy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Don't put him in here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: We're taking him to the hospital.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: No, we'll get busted.
dialog: 
text: Long pause, we hear Jimmy struggling off camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What... what are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
text: He's not breathing. He's not
dialog: fucking breathing!
dialog: 
dialog: Silence. You can feel them thinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Is he dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (has decided)
dialog: Pop the trunk for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What are we gonna do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I don't know right now, but we're
dialog: not driving around with a dead guy
dialog: in our back seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: I just want to go home. Jimmy,
dialog: let's leave him. He's dead. We
dialog: should just go.
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Pop the fucking trunk already
dialog: before someone sees us!
dialog: 
text: We hear Judy pop the trunk.
dialog: 
text: We hear Jimmy struggling.
dialog: 
text: The camera is still on the floor of the car.
dialog: 
text: More struggling as Jimmy is clearly outside putting the body
text: into the trunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (to self)
dialog: I want to go home.
dialog: 
text: We hear Jimmy slam the trunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (screams; frustrated)
dialog: Fuck!
dialog: 
text: We hear Jimmy come around to the driver's seat and open the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy, I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I'm driving.
dialog: 
text: We hear Judy get out of the car and walk around to the
text: passenger side and open the door, but she doesn't get in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Get in.
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Are you gonna fucking get in!
dialog: 
text: Judy is hysterical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: We should just leave him here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: We can't leave him in the middle of
dialog: the fucking ghetto. Get in before
dialog: someone sees us!
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Judy's losing it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: I don't want him in my fucking car!
dialog: I want him out!
dialog: 
text: Before Jimmy can respond, we see the reflection of police
text: lights. Red and blue lights flicker against the lens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Oh shit!
dialog: 
text: We hear Judy get in the car and close the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: It's the fucking cops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Just shut up.
dialog: 
text: She's hysterical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: It's the cops. It's the cops.
dialog: It's the...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Shhhhhh!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy kicks the camera. We still can't see any of this. We
text: can only hear what's happening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: You gotta play it cool, okay?
dialog: 
text: Judy's crying gets louder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Stop fucking crying. Please, I'm
dialog: begging you. Stop it.
dialog: 
text: We hear the cop open and shut his patrol car door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Oh God. He's getting out of the
dialog: car. We've got a dead homeless guy
dialog: in our trunk and he's...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
text: SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Oh, my god Jimmy, he's walking
dialog: towards us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
text: SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Just be cool.
dialog: 
text: The Cop is close, we can feel his footsteps coming towards
text: the car. Judy collects herself as best as she can.
dialog: 
text: The cop taps his flashlight against the window.
dialog: 
text: We hear Judy roll down her power window and we hear the voice
dialog: of the Cop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP (O.C.)
dialog: Good evening. License and
dialog: registration please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Certainly, sir.
dialog: 
text: The light from the Cop's flashlight reflects off the floor of
text: the car and into the lens of the camera.
dialog: 
text: The reflections stop. The wait is unbearable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP (O.C.)
dialog: Could you please step out of the
dialog: vehicle?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy gets out of the car as Judy trembles in the passengers
dialog: seat.
dialog: 
text: We only hear the sounds of Judy sniffling and repressing
text: herself from crying and idle chatter of the Cop's radio.
dialog: 
dialog: It seems like forever, then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUMP!
dialog: 
text: The car is shaking, we hear intense struggling going on
dialog: outside.
dialog: 
text: Judy unleashes a piercing, high pitched scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy!
dialog: 
text: More violent struggling is heard as Judy begins to
text: hyperventilate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POP
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A gunshot is fired.
dialog: 
text: Judy screams.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
speaker_heading: AAAAAHHHHHHH!
dialog: 
text: POP. Another shot is fired.
dialog: 
text: The car door opens, Jimmy gets in. We hear the sounds of
text: tires squealing and the engine roaring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: 
text: Judy's now totally freaked.

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What happened!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Just shut the fuck up! I don't
dialog: fucking want to talk about it!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy can't bully her into silence. She continues to freak
text: out. The camera is kicked.

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: 
text: A weird, digital, black and white image plays on the camera.
dialog: There's no light and Jimmy's got the camera back in "Nite
text: Shot" mode. He's standing outside of the car filming the
text: Homeless Man who is lying dead inside of the trunk. Judy
text: stands next to him as he films.
dialog: 
text: The Homeless Man is twisted and contorted in order to fit in

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: He's beautiful. He really is.
dialog: There's a certain serenity to death
dialog: I appreciate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: He's dead. He's in my car, Jimmy,

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: (holds back a sob)
dialog: I wanna fucking go home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yeah, well you can't fucking go
dialog: home. And you will do this. You
dialog: did do this. You killed him. You
dialog: didn't get in the car until the
dialog: cops showed up. Now we don't have
dialog: a choice. You want me to go to
dialog: jail? You want that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (softer)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Judy settles. Jimmy is out of breath.
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (half crying)
dialog: What are we going to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: We just need to make intelligent

dialog: a way to take care of it. Then
dialog: we'll go away. We'll fix it.
dialog: It'll be okay. I promise.

speaker_heading: JUDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: He's cool. And he's got his own

text: trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit.
dialog: 
text: Empty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the
text: tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due to
text: a ridiculously low ceiling.
dialog: 
text: Judy is dancing in a very sexy manner with Dinko who is
text: dancing like a complete dork. Dinko has no moves, rhythm, or
text: beat whatsoever, but dances with as much vigor as a dog on
dialog: crack.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front
text: of him. Dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to
text: be heard. He looks directly at Jimmy noticing that Jimmy's
text: turned on the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: Hey! The video-man. I remember
dialog: that shit when we was in together.
dialog: Said you video-ed everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Yep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: Hey man, it's cool if you guys stay
dialog: here for a while, but I have a

dialog: going to be some people knocking on
dialog: the door and shit. I can't have
dialog: you guys answering the door or the

dialog: Other than that man, we're going to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO (O.C.)
dialog: Right man. That's cool. Hey um...
dialog: If I tell you to stop taping
dialog: though, man, you gotta stop. I got
dialog: some hard core junkies coming over
dialog: here. Sometimes, if they see shit
dialog: like that, they fucking flip.
dialog: Crank junkies are a whole different
dialog: kind of breed man. They're fucking
dialog: hard core mother fuckers. You
dialog: don't know what they're gonna
dialog: fucking do. This one guy got
dialog: paranoid about something. He used
dialog: to climb on his roof to take a
dialog: dump. That's the only place he
dialog: would shit! How fucked up is that?
dialog: 
text: Dinko laughs at his own joke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: It's all good man. I ain't gonna
dialog: touch your old lady. Shit man,
dialog: she's so into you anyway.
dialog: 
text: Dinko gets up and moves into the kitchen area, crossing the
text: frame. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on various
text: items in the kitchen while Dinko talks.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: There's ripped open small electronics and appliances

text: trying to put it back together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: So there's this dude. Fucker
dialog: taught me everything I know about

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: You have an Uncle Rodney baby?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I want to meet your uncle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: He's not my uncle. He's not
dialog: anybody's uncle. People just call
dialog: him that. He's the one I told you
text: about from the nut house.
dialog: 
text: As Judy bends down to snort her line, camera drifts over to
text: Dinko who's holding a HUGE HILLBILLY WAD OF CASH in his hand
text: and stuffs it into a box of cereal. Jimmy zooms in on the
dialog: cereal box. There's a whole bunch more cash in there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I said one day I'd take you up to
dialog: Erlanger one day, remember?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: DINKO (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JUDY

text: THERE'S A KNOCK at the door.

speaker_heading: DINKO (O.C.)

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Dinko is at the front door dealing with a customer. We can't

text: her. He yells back into the living room from the front door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO (O.C.)
dialog: Yo, Jimmy. Is your girl into
dialog: chicks?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: Sure Dinko. Bring her in.
dialog: 
text: Dinko brings in HAZEL,(40), a frightfully thin crank addict.

text: sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull.
dialog: 
text: Dinko turns the music down so they don't have to scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yeah, I'm not into chicks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: Shut up you fat fucking junkie and
dialog: take your clothes off or you ain't
dialog: getting shit.
dialog: 
text: Hazel's not moving. She's reluctant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: I don't...
dialog: 
text: Dinko smacks her square in the face.

speaker_heading: DINKO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Jimmy.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy doesn't do anything. He just keeps filming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Jimmy, stop him!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: He's a big boy, he can do what he
dialog: wants.
dialog: 
text: This gives Dinko an added boost of confidence. Hazel is now
text: in her bra and panties and is standing in front of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: Ever made a porno?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Not with you.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: Well all right! Keep filming

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: You ready? You filming?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Jimmy!
dialog: 
text: Dinko unbuckles his belt as fast as he can. Hazel begins to

speaker_heading: DINKO

dialog: How's this? You getting good

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: (laughing it up)
dialog: Take off them panties bitch... Oh
dialog: yeah! Come on bitch. Move.
dialog: 
text: Judy is crying profusely in the background as Dinko pushes
text: Hazel to the ground. Jimmy zooms in on Dinko, framing out
text: Hazel as Dinko gets himself ready to take her from behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: That's it. Just like that.
dialog: 
text: Dinko looks directly at the lens of the camera.

speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: Fuck yeah!
dialog: 
dialog: Dinko sees something O.C. from Jimmy, we can't see that
text: surprises him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DINKO
dialog: You don't have to hold a gun to her
dialog: head man. There's plenty of other
dialog: chicks we can do that to. If
dialog: that's what you're into, then fuck
dialog: it, I'll...
dialog: 
dialog: BAM!!!
dialog: 
text: Dinko takes a shot in the throat and falls onto Hazel.
text: Jimmy's shot him.
dialog: 
text: Judy has stopped screaming. Hazel on the other hand is
text: freaking out, trapped under a squirming Dinko.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy sets the camera on top of something, stands up and
text: brings the gun to Judy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Take it!
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't know what to do. Jimmy puts the gun in her
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Finish him off! He deserves a
dialog: bullet right in the fucking face,
dialog: doesn't he?
dialog: 
text: Judy's in a weird cranked out place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (nervous, cranked out)
dialog: Yeah. Yeah. He does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Then do it.
dialog: 
text: Judy points the gun at a still squirming Dinko. She can't
text: bring herself to pull the trigger.
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We can hear Dinko choking on his own blood. He struggles to
text: move towards Judy.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's now standing behind Judy. He wraps his hand around
text: hers, helps her point the gun and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAM
dialog: 
text: Shoots Dinko right between the eyes. Jimmy helps her again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAM-BAM
dialog: 
text: Two more shots into his chest, Jimmy's hand still wrapped

speaker_heading: ELVIS

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GHETTO - COP CAR CAM (FOR VEGAS MOTEL) - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: (From Sc. 37, p. 64) On screen we see something completely
text: new. It's a black and white security cam style video image.
dialog: Just as the announcer described, this is the kind of image
text: that comes from a video camera that's mounted on the inside
text: of a Cop Car. It's static and covered with date/time text,
dialog: etc.
dialog: 
text: On TV, we finally get a chance to see what transpired when
text: Jimmy and Judy were pulled over. Judy is standing outside
text: the cop car. The moment she sees it approach, we see her
text: freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and
text: suspiciously. The cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes
text: over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy. After a few
text: moments, he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits.
dialog: 
text: The Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk. He doesn't have his

text: holster, the other shining on Jimmy's face with a flashlight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: Go ahead and open it.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy stands by the trunk of the car, but he's not really
text: obeying the Cop's commands. He's stalling. The Cop is
text: getting suspicious. We can barely hear what they're saying
text: to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by.
dialog: 
text: There's an unintelligible exchange, then... the cop steps
text: forward, raising his voice.

dialog:

text: The Cop and Jimmy are sort of at a standoff. Jimmy finally
text: leans over and puts his hands on the trunk.
dialog: 
text: The Cop comes in close to Jimmy, pulling his hand from his
text: gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt.
dialog: 
text: At that exact moment, Jimmy makes his move, LEAPING for the
dialog: Cop.
dialog: 
text: He takes the Cop to the ground and off screen.
dialog: 
text: All we see is a barely decipherable image of Judy freaking
text: out in the passenger seat because she can't see what's going
dialog: on and neither can we.
dialog: 
text: About 5 seconds go by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOOM!
dialog: 
text: A gunshot is fired.
dialog: 
text: It feels like an eternity, then...
dialog: 
text: Jimmy pops up off the ground. He's got the Cop's gun! He
text: hesitates, not knowing what to do. He pauses, hesitant, then
text: shoots down towards the ground, where the cop is lying out of
dialog: frame.
dialog: 
text: He runs around the front of the car and into the driver seat.

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Shhhh. Shut up.
dialog: (grabbing camera)
dialog: Give it to me.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy whips the camera around to zoom in on what he's looking
text: through the window. Finally, we see...
dialog: 
text: Two Florence County Sheriff's Cars with their lights flashing
text: are parked in the parking lot of the cheap motel.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy zooms in on the cops as they get out of their cars.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

dialog:

speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy speaks in hushed tones so that others in the diner
dialog: won't hear them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: They're outside our room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Oh God, Jimmy! They know where we
dialog: are. We're going to get caught!
dialog: 
text: Florence Deputy #1 knocks on the door, waits a beat, then

text: guns drawn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (to self)
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy forgets to shut the camera down. He holds it by his
text: waist as the two quickly struggle to get the hell out of the
dialog: diner.
dialog: 
text: Follow along with them, camera by Jimmy's side, mostly
text: pointing randomly at the floor of the diner or out the
dialog: window.
dialog: 
text: They head out the door to the...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARKING LOT
dialog: 
text: Action continues, the camera still rolling without Jimmy

speaker_heading: DINKO'S CAR

dialog: hell they're going to be caught by the cops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: They don't see us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I know. Just shut up! Let me

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Are they coming?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: I don't know. I don't think so.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: No. I don't think they're coming.
dialog:

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (relief)
dialog: Oh, fuck.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY

dialog: 
text: Jimmy points the camera through the front windshield. Now we

dialog: 
text: It looks like a commune for run-away teenagers with crank

dialog: 
text: Judy keeps driving as we see young people, all more or less

text: new faces are of interest to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Go over here.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Jimmy gets out of Dinko's car and heads up to him while Judy
text: films. We don't hear the conversation between Jimmy and
text: Buddy man, but clearly he's happy to see Jimmy.
dialog: 
text: Buddy gives Jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or
text: an old friend. It's all smiles between the two of them.

text: Jimmy comes running back over to the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)

text: whimpering. The voice is close, in the room with us, but we
text: can't see who's making the sounds. Uncle Rodney ignores it
dialog: completely.
dialog: 
text: Camera shakes, indicating that Jimmy is exceptionally
dialog: nervous.
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
text: Just one second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: Take your time man. I want you to
dialog: feel comfortable. More
dialog: importantly, I want you to get this
dialog: right.
dialog: 
text: Finally, the camera stops shaking. Jimmy zooms out to a
text: medium shot revealing that Uncle Rodney has HAZEL lying next
text: to him on the bed with her head on his lap.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney gently strokes her hair like he's petting a dog.
text: Hazel, in the midst of EXTREME withdrawals, cries and
text: whimpers like a child, oblivious to Jimmy, the camera, and
dialog: everything else in the world except for Uncle Rodney.
dialog: 
text: She is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that she
dialog: can barely speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I'm ready whenever you are.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney looks down upon Hazel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: Just a second. I have to take care
dialog: of my baby.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney admires his work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: She's beautiful isn't she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: (begging, pleading)
dialog: Please...
dialog: 
text: Hazel, entrenched in a crystal methamphetamine psychotic
text: episode, can only gasp in unintelligible spurts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: Some people come here too far gone.
dialog: Like Hazel here. The only thing I
dialog: can do for her is ease her pain.
dialog: 
text: Hazel rolls her body back and forth on the bed, all the while
text: keeping her head in Uncle Rodney's lap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Please...
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: (to Hazel)
dialog: Shhhhh... How about a baby one?
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney's tenderness in dealing with Hazel calms her.
text: He's having way too much fun treating her like a baby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAZEL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small plastic
text: bag of powder. He then places it to Hazel's nostril.
dialog: 
text: She quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: (to Hazel)
dialog: There you go...
dialog: 
text: Hazel begins whimpering again. It wasn't nearly enough to
dialog: satisfy her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: There's something about addiction
dialog: that brings out something beautiful
dialog: in a person. Addiction is pure.
dialog: Addiction reduces a person to an
dialog: infant. And there's nothing more
dialog: pure and beautiful in the world
text: than an infant.
dialog: 
text: He puts his finger to Hazel's nostril again, but this time,
text: without any meth on the tip. She snorts with all of her
text: might then starts crying. Uncle Rodney is toying with her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
text: Hazel is no longer an adult. She's
dialog: an infant and I'm the surrogate
dialog: mother who provides her with much
dialog: needed breast milk. It's a role
dialog: that both of us have accepted and
dialog: embrace.
dialog: 
text: He leans over and grabs a syringe, already filled, then
text: gently holds Hazel's arm and expertly injects the liquid into
dialog: her vein.
dialog: 
text: Nothing happens for several seconds.
dialog: 
text: Hazel's breathing accelerates. Suddenly she sits up, her
text: eyes go wide. Hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a
text: roller coaster.
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: That's my girl!
dialog: 
text: Then, she makes eye contact with Jimmy.
dialog: 
text: A curious, frightened look comes over her face. Clearly, she
text: recognizes him.
dialog: 
text: She suddenly JUMPS from the bed and runs out of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
text: She's a little jumpy.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney smiles, amusing himself with his own joke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: Let's begin shall we? And
dialog: please... I'm going to use this
dialog: tape for my fans, so let's try to
dialog: get this right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: I apologize if any of this
dialog: frightens you or makes you
dialog: uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I'll be fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: No. You won't be fine. What I'm
dialog: going to teach you will be
dialog: frightening. The truth is an
dialog: acquired taste but once you get to
dialog: it, it's all you'll ever want.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney starts in on his mantra. It's obvious that he's
text: well versed in his meandering rant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: Those kids out there... we, the so
dialog: called "undesirables" - you and me,
dialog: we know the truth. You know that
dialog: society doesn't want you, your
dialog: parents don't want you, corporate
dialog: America sure as fuck doesn't want
dialog: you... You wouldn't be here
dialog: otherwise.

dialog: If this government had a choice,
dialog: they'd gas us all in a heartbeat,
dialog: exterminate us like the Jews,
dialog: enslave us like niggers, cuz don't
dialog: kid yourself, WE ARE the new
dialog: niggers in this country. No one
dialog: respects us... No one sees what we
dialog: have to offer... No one has
dialog: compassion for us.... They don't
dialog: care, or they're too naive to see
dialog: that we're a by-product of a
dialog: wasteful society that has failed to
dialog: educate, embrace, influence, or
dialog: inspire any of us. We're societal
dialog: garbage. The counter culture no
dialog: longer exists. It's dead... It's
dialog: been replaced by us--
dialog: 
dialog: Long pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: The garbage culture... thrown
dialog: aside, imprisoned,
dialog: institutionalized, systematically
dialog: abused, executed, and enlisted into
dialog: wars started by government ass-
dialog: fuckers just to kill us off. JUST
dialog: TO KILL US OFF. And every week one
dialog: of you shows up here,
text: disillusioned, addicted, angry,
dialog: pissed 'cuz they tossed you
dialog: aside... into the garbage. Every
dialog: time someone like you shows up here
dialog: the garbage culture gets a little
dialog: bit stronger and they get a little
dialog: bit weaker. Until the "them" and
dialog: the "they" of this country run out
dialog: of places to put us, to put its
text: garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS
dialog: into their cities from out of the
dialog: confines of the spaces that they
dialog: have set aside for us.
dialog: 
dialog: A pause, then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: (biblical)
dialog: And we will SET FIRE to their
dialog: world! And we will burn it, until
text: a living HELL REIGNS over what was
dialog: their former world, and we will
dialog: fornicate in their ashes!
dialog: 
text: Rodney stops, almost out of breath.
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: That's what's here for you. That's
dialog: what's here...
dialog: 
text: Rodney settles himself down and takes a few deep breaths as
text: Jimmy begins zooming out. Uncle Rodney lights a cigarette to
dialog: calm himself.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy keeps filming, not knowing whether Rodney is finished
dialog: or just taking a break.
dialog: 
text: Camera shuts down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Someone (Buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a lot
dialog: of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones
dialog: Jimmy was interviewing before. It's certainly a weird bunch.
text: They all look alike, dress similar, and have the same type of
text: crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions.
dialog: 
text: Most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers
text: while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums.
dialog: They all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be
dialog: allowed.
dialog: 
text: Camera pans to Jimmy, so we realize that he's not filming.
dialog: Our best guess would be that it's Buddy who's filming. Jimmy
text: screams at the camera over the noise of the Bongo drums.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Where's Judy?
dialog: 
text: Buddy's hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit.
dialog: We now see Jimmy see Judy.
dialog: 
text: She dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of
dialog: other drunk, happily intoxicated teenagers. Say what you
dialog: might about the attendees to the event, this party is a
text: FUCKING RAGER and Judy is happy to be the center of
text: everyone's attention.
dialog: 
text: Everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat
text: faster and become more intense. It's an all out jam session.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing
text: around Judy. Camera follows him with a zoom as he does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Who knows how much later. Minutes or hours, the party rages
text: forward. The camera spins around. The party has reached a
text: new level of drunken absurdity. Most of those who are
text: dancing are drunk, stoned or both.
dialog: 
text: In the background, while it's too dark and hectic see
text: anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a
text: variety of sexual activity. Some have threesomes. Some are
text: probably having oral sex. Still others dance around them in
text: the foreground.
dialog: 
text: Camera zooms in on Uncle Rodney.
dialog: 
text: Standing just behind him, we see of flash of someone
text: recognizable. It's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely
dialog: familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness
text: going on.
dialog: 
text: She turns her head to look over at Rodney.
dialog: 
dialog: Now we can clearly see that this person is...
dialog: 
text: HAZEL - with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of
text: rolling on crank.
dialog: 
dialog: AND she's saying something to Uncle Rodney that's definitely
text: pissing him off.
dialog: 
text: Bodies wipe the frame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT
dialog: 
text: Moments later. Camera catches Judy who hasn't missed a step
text: along the way to being a high, drunken mess. The rhythm of
text: the drum beats is ever present.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around
text: her shoulder, saying something to her, but we can't hear it
text: over the noise. Jimmy approaches and they start talking.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy doesn't notice, but there are about four or five of the
text: kids, especially a couple of Rodney's Bigger Guys standing
text: not too far behind Uncle Rodney watching the conversation
dialog: intensely.
dialog: 
dialog: It's really difficult to put your finger on it exactly, but
text: something doesn't seem right here.
dialog: 
text: Uncle Rodney lets go of Judy and puts his arm around Jimmy.
text: With the noise of the drums and the fact that we're zoomed in
text: from a distance, we can't hear anything they're saying.
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Now Uncle Rodney and Jimmy are having a conversation as they
text: move towards the camera. Though Jimmy can't see it, we can
dialog: see that Rodney's Bigger Guys, the ones that were standing
text: behind Uncle Rodney are now pushing Judy along behind Jimmy
text: and Rodney. Though Uncle Rodney seems to be having a very
text: light and friendly conversation with Jimmy, we continue to
text: get the feeling that something ominous is afoot.
dialog: 
text: Finally, they approach camera and we can hear them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: I'm so glad you guys came down
dialog: here. We never would have guessed
dialog: you'd come and see us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You've been awesome. Judy loves it
dialog: here.
dialog: 
dialog: Uncle Rodney's got Jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed
text: side hug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: I knew she would. By the way.
dialog: 
text: Rodney's face drops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: I know what you did to Dinko.
dialog: 
text: This hits Jimmy like a lead weight. Before he can react at
text: all, and before he realizes that anything is happening, Jimmy
text: is suddenly thrown into a headlock by Uncle Rodney.
dialog: 
text: Off camera, something similar is happening to Judy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?!
dialog: Jimmy, Jimmy!
dialog: 
text: Judy screams his name over and over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Jimmy! Jimmy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDDY (O.C.)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Shut it, bitch!
dialog: 
text: SMACK! Judy's been hit by Buddy off screen.
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Camera shuts down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - DARK WOODS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: We hear intense struggling and laughter. By the sounds we
dialog: hear, we gather that Jimmy and Judy are being dragged off
text: into the woods against their will by Buddy and Rodney's
dialog: Bigger Guys, but it's too dark to tell if that is what in
dialog: fact is happening.
dialog: 
text: Someone unidentified is running the show and operates the
text: camera. It's impossible to see, but it's definitely Buddy's
dialog: voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDDY (O.C.)
dialog: Here, here, here. Right here.
dialog: 
text: Judy is screaming and crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy?
dialog: 
text: Two or three guys, it's too dark to tell, start laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (screams)
dialog: Please somebody help us!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy grunts, trying to break free.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Judy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.)
dialog: Shut up, asshole! You wanna
dialog: fucking talk!
dialog: 
text: MUNCH. Somewhere in the darkness Jimmy's been kicked in the
text: gut. The camera hits the ground. It lands right in front of
text: Jimmy. We can still barely see what's going on, but we're
text: close enough and there's enough flashes of light from
text: flashlights to see that Jimmy is face down and bloody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: Fuck you!
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jimmy gets kicked again just once. Then suddenly, a barrage
text: of kicks come at Jimmy one after the other after the other.
dialog: 
text: Leaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at Jimmy's
text: face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly.
dialog: 
text: The process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds.
dialog: 
dialog: We can't tell how much damage has been sustained, but Jimmy's
text: not moving. He's either unconscious or dead.
dialog: 
text: With one last kick, the camera is knocked aside and we don't
text: see Jimmy's face anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.)
dialog: Is he fucking dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy! Jimmy say something!
dialog: 
text: They mock her in a high pitched wining voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDDY (O.C.)
dialog: (mocking)
text: Jimmy. Jimmy say something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RODNEY'S BIG GUY #2 (O.C.)
dialog: Get her clothes off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Noooooo! Noooooo!
dialog: 
text: Judy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as
text: we hear them tearing at her clothes. Then they pick her up
text: and start pulling her away from camera.
dialog: 
text: Her screams get quieter and quieter... fainter and fainter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: (extremely faint)
dialog: Jimmy!
dialog: 
text: Finally there's silence. The camera isn't moving. It's on
text: the ground and in the dark. Camera shuts down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - PARKING AREA - DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It's completely pitch black dark. We can see nothing. We

text: breathing heavily and nervously.
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEGIN NITE SHOT
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, we see everything, albeit in a weird black and
text: white grainy fashion. Jimmy's flipped the camera into Nite
text: Shot, using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see
text: in the complete darkness. He's strapped the camera to his
dialog: wrist.
dialog: 
text: The image is Jimmy's POV as he searches through his trunk for
text: something. Pulling aside a duffle bag, we see the 9mm pistol
text: that Jimmy stole from the Cop. He grabs it as camera shuts
dialog: down.

dialog: 
text: By the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy
text: took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens
text: of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in
text: sleeping bags and in tents.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera.
dialog: 
text: He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag with her
text: back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to Judy's,
text: but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over passed
text: out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken anyone.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes
text: a loud clanking sound of glass on glass.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking
text: up. No one does.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY.
dialog: 
text: Kneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on
text: her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the
text: camera. The girl flips over.
dialog: 
dialog: It's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely
text: intoxicated that she doesn't wake up.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips
text: the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the
text: inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another
text: passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of
dialog: the tent.
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy
text: among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: No luck.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's not too far from Uncle Rodney's trailer. He decides
text: to make his way up.
dialog: 
text: He walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of
text: bodies until he gets up to the entrance...
dialog: 
scene_heading: OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
dialog: 
text: There's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile
text: by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at
text: the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like
text: hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent
dialog: beating.
dialog: 
text: Moving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle
text: Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very
text: slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
dialog: 
text: It's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses
text: forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to
text: see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy is scared shitless.
dialog: 
text: In the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle
text: Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a
text: spooning position. There's no doubt this time.
dialog: 
dialog: It's definitely JUDY!
dialog: 
text: They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying
text: together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step
text: is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them.
dialog: 
text: Once Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he
text: stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared
dialog: himself for this particular situation and doesn't know
dialog: exactly what to do.
dialog: 
text: He continues filming them until he finally musters the
dialog: courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the
text: face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps
text: the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder
text: and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: THWACK! An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmy's poking
dialog: hand. Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney!
dialog: 
text: The camera shakes out of control. Uncle Rodney screams at
text: the top of his lungs:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNCLE RODNEY
dialog: Who the fuck...!
dialog: 
text: Intense and furious wrestling ensues as Uncle Rodney flies
text: out of frame then, in a split second:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAM!
dialog: 
text: A gunshot goes off. We hear a Uncle Rodney collapse,
text: followed by more gun shots. The camera has fallen from
text: Jimmy's hand and dangles by the wrist strap. Camera comes to
dialog: rest on...
dialog: 
scene_heading: UNCLE RODNEY'S BLOODY FACE
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's shot and killed him.
dialog: 
text: Outside, footsteps hit the deck. Buddy opens the door of the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAM, BAM, BAM!
dialog: 
text: Three more rounds are fired, hitting Buddy square in the

text: Buddy on his back then whip pans it back to Judy in the bed.
text: Finally we hear Jimmy speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy, Judy, wake up. Fucking wake
dialog: up!
dialog: 
text: Outside we hear voices of some of Rodney's Other Teens.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy acts fast. Judy has been drugged and is mostly
text: unconscious and groggy, but Jimmy picks her up and gets her
text: on her feet, shouldering her out the door. Shot continues
dialog: to...

dialog: 
text: Another DISTANT SHOT, then Jimmy gasps in pain. He's been
text: shot, but decides to run, trying to carry a groggy Judy
text: anyway. Their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and
text: bullets whizzing by them. One hits Dinko's car.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy opens the door, then places the passed out Judy and the
text: camera in the passenger seat, climbs over her, throwing the
text: camera into Judy's lap.
dialog: 
text: We see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we hear

dialog: we've seen him at all since he was beaten up by Uncle
text: Rodney's group. He's a wreck. His face is puffy. His lip
text: is cut up. His eye is swollen. He looks like a flyweight
text: boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight.
dialog: 
text: He drives with one arm because the other one is in a bandage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Hey baby.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy looks like a beaten man, both physically and
text: emotionally. His bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma
text: are seemingly non-existent.
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: For the first time, we are seeing Jimmy without his armor.
text: He looks like any other 21 year old kid who is down,
text: vulnerable, and confused. Not to mention the fact that he
text: has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Baby?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Come on. Not the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Nooooo. It reminds me of when we
dialog: first met. Just you, me, and the
dialog: camera. God, do you remember how
dialog: you used to freak me out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah, those were the good old days.
dialog: How much money do we have?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: I don't know, why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How do you feel about Canada? It's
dialog: closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Are we going together?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy looks over at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I think I should take you home.
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I could write you a letter. Or I
dialog: could make a video saying I made
dialog: you do everything. They'd believe
dialog: you. You could tell them it was
dialog: all my fault. You could tell them
dialog: I was going to Mexico and I'd
dialog: really go to Canada.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy swallows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We swore on the bond we'd never be
dialog: apart... but...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 120.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (cont'd)
dialog: I'll let you out of it... If you
dialog: want to be out of it, I'll let you
dialog: out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: You're never leaving me, and I'm
dialog: never leaving you. That's all
dialog: there is to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Judy leans in and kisses him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Owww.
dialog: 
text: Judy comes back into the passenger seat and just films him.
text: She likes looking at him through the lens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: You're so handsome, you know that?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy smiles as best he can with his face all messed up.
text: Then his eyes get droopy and close.
dialog: 
text: He's not responding. He's as punch drunk as you can get.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy?
dialog: 
text: Jimmy's obviously in a concussion induced daze. The car
text: starts to drift. Judy drops the camera on the seat as we
text: hear her leap forward to take control of the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (snaps to)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY (O.C.)
dialog: Jimmy, stop the car. You're too
dialog: fucked up to drive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Huh? Oh... okay.
dialog: 
text: Camera shuts down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERA ON:

dialog: 
text: Judy drives. There isn't much talking going on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You wanted to ask me something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Do you love me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: You know I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
text: The car drives. Judy just cruises along, music playing on
text: the radio. Jimmy (O.C.) looks in the mirror but keeps the
text: camera trained on her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: You know I love you, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: We're fucked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
text: Look in the rearview mirror.
dialog: 
text: Judy looks up immediately. Her face drops.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy flips the camera around out the back window. There's a
text: Ohio State Trooper with its lights flashing tailing them. A
text: lone trooper is on his radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: That's it baby. We're done.
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't answer. She's short circuited.
dialog: 
dialog: 122.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Just pull over. It's not worth it.
dialog: 
text: Judy holds still for a second, not saying a word.
dialog: 
text: The cop car CHIRPS its siren.
dialog: 
text: Judy looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy, what are you doing? You know
dialog: this is...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Don't do this.
dialog: 
text: Judy looks up into the rearview mirror. Her eyes are welling
text: up. She looks out the front windshield.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy senses that she sees something. He flips the camera
text: around through the front only to see a row of cop cars
text: blocking the highway up ahead.
dialog: 
text: He flips the camera back at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (freaks)
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: 
text: Judy looks straight ahead, determination on her face.
dialog: 
dialog: She won't answer. Then...
dialog: 
text: She turns the wheel hard to the right, almost carrying Jimmy
text: into her, and takes the car onto a side road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I love you too.
dialog: 
text: Judy is on her own mission.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
text: It's over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (soft)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: It is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: The car stops short. Jimmy turns the camera to point out the
text: windshield. They're stuck. The road has come to a dead end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: It's a dead end.
dialog: 
text: Judy ignores Jimmy. She throws the car into reverse and
text: tries to turn it around and head back the way she came.
dialog: 
text: A faint sound of a helicopter fades up slowly from the
dialog: background.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Do you hear that?
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't respond. She's determined.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (lying)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Come on, it's over. I'll do what I
dialog: said before. I'll tell them I made
dialog: you do it. It'll be okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: No. I want us to be together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: (screams)
dialog: Well we fucking can't, so pull the
dialog: fuck over!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Yes we can. I won't give you up.
dialog: I won't let you go. No way.
dialog: 
text: Jimmy pans the camera out the front windshield. In the
text: distance, we catch sight of a road block that's been set up
text: at the end of the dirt trail. They're screwed. There's
dialog: nowhere to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't answer.
dialog: 
dialog: 124.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy?
dialog: 
text: She still doesn't answer.
dialog: 
text: Then the car thrusts itself forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy! Stop it.
dialog: 
text: Judy's got a look of determination in her eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy, what are you doing?
dialog: 
text: Judy doesn't respond. O.C., she's murmuring something to
text: herself that Jimmy can't hear or understand while she has the
text: throttle to the floor as they barrel toward the roadblock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy!
dialog: 
text: Judy keeps going. Jimmy flips the back camera towards her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy! Stop!
dialog: 
text: Judy's murmurs grow louder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY (O.C.)
dialog: Judy!
dialog: 
text: Jimmy braces himself as the car continues toward the
dialog: roadblock.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Judy's murmurs get loud enough or us to hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: We'll be together. We'll be
dialog: together. We'll be together.
dialog: We'll be together...
dialog: 
text: They head straight in between two cars that form the
text: roadblock. Cops jump out of the way as the car hits head on
dialog: into...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ROADBLOCK
dialog: 
text: Impact sends the camera flying against the windshield,
text: CRACKING IT.
dialog: 
dialog: 125.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sounds of metal twisting and glass shattering is all
text: encompassing as the camera shakes in a violent frenzy!
dialog: 
text: Camera settles on Judy's face, bloody, unconscious against
text: the steering wheel, her neck snapped, eyes open in a death
dialog: stare.
dialog: 
text: Camera stays focussed on Judy for the longest time as she
text: leans against the steering wheel. Music plays on the radio.
text: It's JOHNNY CASH's cover of Tom Petty's "I won't Back Down".
dialog: 
text: OVERHEAD SHOT of a news helicopter flying above the final
dialog: scene.
dialog: 
text: Looking down from above, we see what the helicopter sees:
dialog: 
text: A scene of about twelve State Trooper cars, lights flashing,
text: with Jimmy and Judy's car wrecked. Ambulances are there.
text: Jimmy and Judy's lifeless bodies are pulled from their car as
text: Johnny Cash's song shifts from background to score.
dialog: 
text: The helicopter continues its circular pattern as the song
dialog: continues and we...
dialog: 
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 
dialog:
