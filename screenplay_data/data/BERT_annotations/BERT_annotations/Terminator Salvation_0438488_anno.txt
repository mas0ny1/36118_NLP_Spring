dialog: 
text: START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man,
text: 20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a
text: resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Yea, though I walk through the valley
dialog: of the shadow of death, I will fear
dialog: no evil: for thou art beside me; thy
dialog: rod and thy staff they comfort me...
dialog: 
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot,
text: staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This
text: OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding
text: chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING
text: MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of
text: SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks
text: and shuts his bible.
dialog: 
text: One of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for--
dialog: 
text: DR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant,
text: attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head.
text: She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her
dialog: some privacy with Marcus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERENA
dialog: Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm
dialog: with Project Angel. You consented to
dialog: donate your body to science...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it.

speaker_heading: SERENA
dialog: You've been chosen for our research.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Chosen? Lucky me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERENA
dialog: We just need a couple of signatures...
dialog: 
text: Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he
text: notes that her hands are SHAKING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You don't need to be scared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERENA
dialog: I'm not. It's nerve degeneration.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering
text: her sparse hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Cancer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERENA
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: You're not the only one with a
dialog: death sentence.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS meets her eyes. She studies him a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERENA (cont'd)
dialog: What you're doing is important,
dialog: Marcus. Our work is still highly
dialog: experimental... but you may be
dialog: helping people in ways you can't
text: begin to imagine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I'm a regular hero.
dialog: 
text: With that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the
text: words "PROJECT ANGEL" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form.
dialog: 
text: SERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise. She touches his
text: hand for a moment.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST (V.O.)
dialog: Marcus, this is your last
dialog: opportunity to make a confession...
dialog: 
text: MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths,
text: struggling not to succumb to fear.

speaker_heading: PRIEST (V.O.) (cont'd)

dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON MARCUS' EYES, looking up toward--
dialog:

dialog: 
text: As the lethal injection takes hold, his POV moves to BRIGHT
text: LIGHTS overhead, losing FOCUS and BLEACHING TO WHITE...
dialog: 
text: From the WHITE SCREEN, a FACE emerges, backlit, blurred--

scene_heading: EXT. CORNFIELD - DUSK
dialog: 
text: CORNSTALKS as far as the eye can see, rustling in a summer

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A-10 COCKPIT - DUSK
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. CORNFIELD - DUSK

scene_heading: APPROACH with a JET WHINE--
dialog: 
scene_heading: FWOOM! A MASSIVE CONCUSSION as a BUNKER-BUSTING MISSILE
text: BORES into the earth at high-velocity, burrowing deep--
dialog: 
text: --then a HUGE BLAST - FLAME and DIRT are thrown high in the

dialog: 
text: A FLAMING BODY hits the ground IN FG, FACE TO CAMERA... we

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
text: A-10 WARTHOGS-- stubby attack planes-- SCREAM from the sky,
text: RAKING THE REMAINING FIGURES with CANNON FIRE, BLASTING THEM
text: to bits. These aircraft no longer bear traditional U.S.
text: insignia-- they're painted in WILD COLORS, graffiti lettering
text: says things like: "BOT BLASTER," "KILL FOR CONNOR," "RAGE
text: AGAINST THE MACHINES," etc... Resistance fighters.
dialog: 
text: Motley military and civilian CHOPPERS LAND in the CORNFIELD,
text: disgorging RESISTANCE SOLDIERS. These are human troops in
text: high-tech HELMETS, carrying slightly futuristic conventional
scene_heading: ASSAULT WEAPONS.
dialog: 
text: THE WARTHOGS veer off, laying NAPALM in the distance behind
text: the SOLDIERS. The troops run toward--
dialog: 
text: --AN OPENING which has been blown into the ground, the

dialog: 
text: A surviving TERMINATOR rises from the SINGED CORN, FIRES its
speaker_heading: PLASMA RIFLE--

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY/ROBOTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: HELMET BEAMS play over BANKS OF ELECTRONICS and--
dialog: 
text: --a dozen fixed, INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS-- not remotely HUMANOID--

dialog: 
text: THE SOLDIERS rake the room with GUNFIRE-- MACHINERY

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CORNFIELD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A huge ESCAPE SHIP rises straight up from an open HATCHWAY.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY/STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: THE TEAM LEADER speaks into his headset. The OTHER SOLDIERS

speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER
dialog: You will not believe the shit we

scene_heading: EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY
dialog: 
text: SAME ANGLE-- the TERMINATOR now half-sunk in mud. A FIELD
text: MOUSE has nested in its skull cavity, seeking shelter from
speaker_heading: RAINDROPS.
dialog: 
text: Months have passed, the season changed-- CORN long dead, a
text: black stubble. RAIN falls.
dialog: 
text: A PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving. The MUD
text: roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE...
dialog: 
text: EYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so
text: drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure
text: rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud
text: from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT. He opens his mouth,
text: makes a few GUTTURAL NOISES... then SCREAMS.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA PULLS UP from MARCUS' AGONIZED FACE...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PLATEAU - EVENING
dialog: 
text: BARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a
text: slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on
text: his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he
dialog: sees in the distance--
dialog: 
text: A DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEAD CITY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: MOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground,
text: partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a
text: rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN.
dialog: 
text: MOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed,
text: faded sign: "BEWARE OF DOG."
dialog: 
dialog: WIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS--
text: rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted,
text: windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell.
dialog: 
dialog: MARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this
text: block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips.
dialog: 
text: A COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up
text: a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands.
dialog: 
text: A HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind
text: the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a
text: cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears
text: open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his
text: lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame.
text: He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush,
text: feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly
text: disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away.
dialog: 
text: He rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a
text: clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken
text: glass: "SALE! GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! EVERYTHING MUST GO!"
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RUINED CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and
text: rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled
text: on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for
text: illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a
text: RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RUINED BAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken
text: stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now,
text: again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the
text: broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with--
dialog: 
text: A DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hallelujah.
dialog: 
text: He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the
text: floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES,
text: instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog: 
text: MEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs,
text: blurred, altered. SFX of HEARTBEATS, a RESPIRATOR.
dialog: 
scene_heading: --WEBS of TUBES and FIBER-OPTICS FILLS THE FRAME.
dialog: 
text: --GRIDS OF LASER LIGHT scan rapidly INTO CAMERA.
dialog: 
text: --DIGITAL DISPLAYS blink through murky LIQUID. SERENA moves

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEAD CITY - DAY
dialog: 
text: BLUE SKY. TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the
text: dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK.
text: A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her
text: expression recalls the beckoning vision.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
text: He runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a
text: chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster. Then he
text: carefully tears the poster to remove the woman's face, folds
text: the paper, slips it in a pocket and continues on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Deserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels.
text: MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT
text: NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're
text: in mostly flat, treeless plains.
dialog: 
text: From the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through
text: the darkness. Marcus hurries excitedly toward them, the
text: first living creatures he's seen. He waves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hey! Yo, over here!
dialog: 
text: The FIGURES pause, turning toward him in unison.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS (cont'd)
dialog: Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt
dialog: like I was the last man on...
dialog: 
text: He freezes in his tracks. These aren't humans. They're T-
scene_heading: 400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA
text: RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but
text: their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and
text: motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS (cont'd)
dialog: Oh God...
dialog: 
text: Marcus backs away, runs. The T-400s stare after him-- but
dialog: don't fire.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULAR MASK - MARCUS running for all he's
text: worth, heading toward the viewer. We hear a muttering VOICE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Hey mister, where you goin' in such
dialog: a hurry?
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON A BOY, scrawny and filthy, in his early to mid
text: teens. He crouches on the supports of a FREEWAY SIGN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
text: He wears layers of TATTERED, OVER-SIZED CLOTHING. He
text: scrambles quickly down from the sign.
dialog: 
text: AT AN OFF-RAMP, Marcus' pace slows as he moves to get off the
dialog: freeway, when--
dialog: 
text: THE BOY emerges from behind some RUBBLE, holding a HANDGUN in
text: one hand, a lit OIL LANTERN in the other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY (cont'd)
dialog: Whoah, whoah-- hang on there. Got
dialog: any food?
dialog: 
text: Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head. The boy looks him
text: over dubiously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY (cont'd)
dialog: You look like you been eating
dialog: pretty good.
dialog: 
text: The boy moves closer, puts down the LANTERN, frisks Marcus
text: with one hand while holding the gun on him with the other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You're human... you can see me, you
dialog: can touch me. This place is real.
dialog: 
text: THE BOY makes a dubious face, yanks a handful of PAPER SCRAPS
dialog: from Marcus' pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS (cont'd)
dialog: I thought I was in hell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (raises an eyebrow)
dialog: This sure ain't heaven.

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Those things with masks, red eyes--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
speaker_heading: (CASUALLY)
dialog: Terminators-- T-400s. What is this stuff?
dialog: 
text: THE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT--
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a
text: fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of
text: a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
dialog: 
text: THE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with
text: sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it
text: hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the
text: gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat.

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: If I'm not in hell, where am I?!

speaker_heading: BOY
speaker_heading: (CHOKING)
dialog: Texas!
dialog: 
text: The NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS--
dialog: 
text: MARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into
text: the boy's cheek. He's face to face with--
dialog: 
text: A GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the
text: shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Let him go!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
text: First put down the shotgun.
dialog: 
text: THE GIRL shakes her head angrily. She wears an aged, beloved
text: BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Do what he says.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: He'll kill us both!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I don't wanna kill anyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Do it, Star. Put it down.
dialog: 
text: She shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus'
text: head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
text: There was only one bullet in that gun.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly--

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
dialog: 
text: --BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg,

text: at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun
dialog: falling to one side--
dialog: 
text: MARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun.
dialog: 
text: Using SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from
dialog: her clothing.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand. He
text: struggles to control anger, speaks quietly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I don't like it when people point
dialog: guns at me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: It wasn't loaded.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and
text: handgun-- indeed, both are empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You took on a guy like me with one
text: bullet and an empty shotgun?
dialog: (studies them admiringly)
dialog: Pretty stupid.
dialog: 
text: He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and
text: kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught
text: FIRE and are incinerated.
dialog: 
text: THE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Can I have my gun back?
dialog: 
text: MARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up. He still
text: looks at the PICTURES in his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL (cont'd)
dialog: Where'd you get those?

speaker_heading: BOY

dialog: 
text: A SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER
text: moving in their direction.
dialog: 
text: Quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL
text: OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger.
dialog: 
text: THE BOY bolts from behind cover, grabs MARCUS by the arm--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY (cont'd)
dialog: Get down, they've seen the light!
dialog: 
text: He drags Marcus back behind the debris wall, just in time--
dialog: 
text: As the H-K nears, the LIGHT FINDS the BURNING OIL. It FIRES
text: BLUE PULSES, which CHEW up the asphalt nearby-- then it moves
text: on, failing to pick out the humans. Marcus is dumbfounded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: That wasn't a helicopter...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: It's an H-K-- hunter-killer. Where

scene_heading: EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY
dialog: 
text: A HARVESTER-- a GIANT INSECT-LIKE TERMINATOR-- is outside the
text: station. Many times the size of a human being, MULTIPLE ARMS
text: and LEGS sprout from its thorax, it has multiple CAMERA EYES
text: on long, swiveling stalks-- it carries KYLE and STAR, the
text: kids struggle frantically, caught in the harvester's jointed
text: steel appendages.
dialog: 
text: One unblinking EYE SCANS KYLE, another STAR; the harvester
text: produces a NEEDLE from one of its arms, INJECTS the boy-- who
text: instantly goes limp, unconscious. It does the same to STAR.
dialog: 
dialog: As COW emerges--
dialog: 
text: --THE HARVESTER SPRINGS on her, with startling speed. She
text: SCREAMS as the enormous terminator hoists her into the air
text: with the others, INJECTS her and begins moving toward--
dialog: 
text: --A TRANSPORT. This consists of CONTAINER resembling a semi-
text: trailer or wheeled dumpster, attached within a FRAMEWORK that
text: features movable ENGINE PODS and a mysterious ARMATURE at the
text: front. A STEEL LID in the top of the container OPENS
text: hydraulically, the Harvester DEPOSITS the HUMAN CAPTIVES
text: inside, and the LID SLAMS SHUT.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS has emerged from the garage, still carrying the AXE.
text: He stays low, hidden behind the tanker, watching as--
dialog: 
text: --PIG and BULL flee through a back entrance to the garage,
dialog: immediately attracting the attention of--
dialog: 
text: --the Harvester, which sets off in pursuit.
dialog: 
text: Marcus comes to a decision. He SPRINTS into the open, toward
dialog: the TRANSPORT, and--
dialog: 
text: --CLAMBERS up the side, hitting the thing at full speed,
text: using an engine pod to boost himself higher. He's still
dialog: short but swings the AXE and--
dialog: 
text: --hooks the AXE HEAD over the top of the container, like a
text: grappling hook. He pulls himself up and--
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE IN TRANSPORT
dialog: 
text: --about TWENTY HUMAN PRISONERS, unconscious on the steel
text: floor. Among them are KYLE and STAR. Star MOANS, opens her
text: eyes briefly and sees--
dialog: 
text: --MARCUS' SILHOUETTE above her.
dialog: 
text: Her eyes flutter shut again.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS struggles to raise the sealed lid, but there's no
text: purchase available, just a smooth seam. Suddenly--
dialog: 
text: --the TRANSPORT JERKS. MARCUS nearly loses his footing as
text: the TRANSPORT STARTS ROLLING forward. He drops to his belly,
text: seeing that the transport is approaching--
dialog: 
text: --the HARVESTER, which now carries PIG and BULL, both
text: unconscious. THE LID OPENS and the Harvester DROPS the two
text: men INSIDE-- but its camera eyes fail to register Marcus, who
text: crouches behind the open lid. As the lid BEGINS TO CLOSE,
text: the Harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the
text: transport, making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS THRUSTS THE HEAD OF THE AXE under the closing LID in
text: order to prevent it from sealing. THE LID grinds against it,
text: but remains ajar. A moment later--
dialog: 
scene_heading: --THE ENGINE PODS ROTATE DOWNWARD, FIRE and--
dialog: 
text: --THE TRANSPORT LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Within moments, the
text: airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AERIAL - DAY
dialog: 
text: MARCUS moves to the edge, looks down in astonishment at the
text: fallow plains far below. Looking to the side, he sees--
dialog: 
text: --A PAIR OF HUNTER KILLERS, swooping in quickly to provide an
text: escort for the slower moving transport.
dialog: 
text: WIND buffets Marcus, he hangs on for dear life. Clinging to
text: the top of the transport, he slowly makes his way back toward
text: the LID. As the transport BANKS, he almost loses his grasp,
text: dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 
text: MARCUS reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his
dialog: might. This thing is really heavy, plus he's fighting the
text: WIND BLAST. MARCUS hears something behind him--
dialog: 
text: THE HARVESTER has spotted him and is now prying itself loose
text: from the armature. Also buffeted by the wind, it starts to
text: move gingerly down the length of the transport toward Marcus.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS must let the LID CLOSE. He snatches up the AXE, takes
text: a couple of WHACKS at the thing, DENTING the metal, but doing
text: no serious damage. The Harvester KNOCKS the weapon out of
text: his hand, Marcus has no choice but to keep backing away.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS is driven to the back of the transport. Struggling
text: for handholds, he lowers himself out of sight, down the
text: framework along the side, getting out of the wind. Suddenly--
dialog: 
text: --STEEL CLAWS WRAP around him FROM BELOW, YANK him downward.
dialog: 
text: THE HARVESTER has crawled around the SIDE of the TRANSPORT,
text: and under the BOTTOM, in order to GRAB HIM. The hideous
text: machine now holds him in its clutches, hundreds of feet in
text: the air, its CAMERA EYES fixed on him.
dialog: 
text: THE HARVESTER produces its needle, it's coming at his face--
text: but MARCUS frees one hand, grabs the syringe, managing to
text: hold it back, inches from his skin. His strength is
text: weakening, but as the Harvester makes its final thrust--
dialog: 
text: --he JERKS the NEEDLE to one side and it BENDS against one of
text: the Harvester's own steel limbs.
dialog: 
text: Undaunted, the creature crawls up the side of the transport,
text: Marcus still in its clutches. It moves to the lid, which
text: OPENS. It lets go of Marcus to drop him inside when--
dialog: 
text: --MARCUS seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the
dialog: harvester's back, where he--
dialog: 
text: --GRABS a couple of EYE STALKS, trying to RIP them from the
text: harvester's thorax, LOOSE WIRES SPARK. The Harvester twists
text: and thrashes, it's like he's a rodeo rider. A LIMB wraps
text: around him, starting to CRUSH him in a vise-like grip, when
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY--

text: still clutching MARCUS and--
dialog: 
text: --CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both
text: suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE
text: BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the
text: engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it
dialog: now, to keep from falling.
dialog: 
text: The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance
dialog: planes.
dialog: 
text: A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily

text: PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank.
dialog: 
text: An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the

speaker_heading: BLAIR

speaker_heading: BLAIR

dialog: Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few
text: CHILDREN of varying age.
dialog: 
text: BARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY

dialog: 
text: THE WHEEL TURNS, the vehicle suddenly SLOWS to negotiate a

dialog: 
text: Just in time, he finds a SEAM in the poured concrete, it's
text: enough to give him purchase-- he struggles to climb up the
text: eight feet of freeway wall.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS makes it over the top, TRUCKS RUMBLING past below.
text: This is desolate, hilly country.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE DOWN - among the vehicles below is a CONTAINER, like
text: the one that held Kyle and Star. We glimpse the anguished
text: FACES and REACHING HANDS of CAPTIVES within.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS reacts, moves as fast as he can alongside the trucks
dialog: for a short distance until--
dialog: 
text: THE VEHICLES shoot ahead around a curve and out of sight. In
text: the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the
dialog: destination.
dialog: 
text: Marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading

scene_heading: EXT. COASTAL VALLEY - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Are you all right?

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What the hell is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: You look like you've been hit by a truck--

speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: The facility, sure. Hop in, I'll
dialog: take you there.
dialog: 
text: Marcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy? But Jeremy

speaker_heading: JEREMY (cont'd)
dialog: This round was gonna blow my
dialog: handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy.
dialog: 
text: He extends a hand. After a beat, Marcus reaches toward it--

scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - EVENING
dialog: 
text: JEREMY drives the cart down the road, past well-kept homes

text: waves to NEIGHBORS. Marcus takes it all in with disbelief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I didn't think there was-- anything
dialog: like this left... anywhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Yes. We're very lucky. Want some?
dialog: 
text: He holds the plastic bag out to Marcus, who obligingly takes

text: he spits it back out in his hand, stares at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: This isn't food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Well, of course not. Seems you got
text: a little memory loss going on.
dialog: 
text: Marcus stares at him, confused. Jeremy is starting to
text: realize just how out of it he is, speaks as if to a child.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (cont'd)
dialog: It's a foam resin. It can taste like
dialog: anything you want it to-- but of
dialog: course, we don't really need to eat.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

dialog: Most of us need the comfort of the
dialog: familiar a little while longer--
dialog: food, shelter, sex. Until we
dialog: forget the old life.
dialog: 
text: As he speaks, he notices his BAG is nearly empty. He
text: casually lifts his sport shirt and CLICKS OPEN a PANEL
text: beneath his rib cage. We glimpse CIRCUITS, FIBER-OPTICS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (cont'd)
dialog: Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of
dialog: the hardest habits to break... but
dialog: before long, none of this will be
dialog: necessary. We won't even need these
dialog: bodies.
dialog: 
text: From within he removes an identical BAG FILLED with TRAIL MIX
text: (the stuff he just ate), and replaces it with the empty bag.
text: He clicks the panel shut again, pops a NUT in his mouth.
dialog: 
text: Marcus stares at this, appalled, then blinks and looks away.
text: He reacts to the sound of PIANO MUSIC, a difficult piece
text: being played expertly-- PASSING a PICTURE WINDOW, he sees a
text: PIANIST practicing.
dialog: 
text: In front of this home, a GARDENER and WINDOW WASHER are hard
text: at work. They're both T-400s, with the eerie mask-like
text: faces. Marcus reacts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Terminators!
dialog: 
text: Jeremy winces, as if at a racial epithet. He's starting to
text: regret giving Marcus a lift, his manner is careful, as if
text: he'd picked up some homeless guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: We don't call them that here.

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: JEREMY

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Your family. You lost them?
dialog: 
text: Jeremy nods and SMILES, looking at him once more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS (cont'd)
dialog: Why are you smiling?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: `Cause I feel good. The interface

speaker_heading: JEREMY (cont'd)
dialog: We replaced the body's hydrocarbons

dialog: 
text: Nearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above. He
text: looks up, stops as he sees--
dialog: 
text: --a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES.
dialog: 
text: MARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels
text: unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made
text: of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC.
dialog: 
text: He crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a
text: SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's
text: ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT.
dialog: 
text: Marcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt--
text: and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we
text: see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc.

dialog: Listen to me. Skynet was designed to

dialog: implement solutions. As soon as it
dialog: came on line, it factored in war,

dialog: and calculated a high probability of
dialog: total human extinction within two

speaker_heading: MARCUS

dialog: 
text: --RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK,

dialog: 
text: MARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with

dialog: 
text: --INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force
text: of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE
text: lies a few feet away.
dialog: 
text: THE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down

dialog: 
text: --BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS

dialog: 
text: THE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later,
text: MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back
text: onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment.
dialog: 
text: Seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage--
text: there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE
text: partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but
text: can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK.
dialog: 
text: Kyle and Star back away from him.

speaker_heading: WHISPER.

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: Star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression.
text: She moves to Marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal--

dialog: 
text: Kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea. His expression

dialog: 
text: FIREWORKS! MISSILES blast the H-K... NAPALM erupts around

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONNOR
dialog: John Connor. I'm glad you made it.
dialog: 
text: KYLE is amazed to be meeting the man face-to-face. He shakes

dialog: Connor, too, for different reasons.
dialog: 
text: CONNOR turns away from his first meeting with his father to
text: be, a bit dizzy at the experience. He addresses Marcus.

speaker_heading: CONNOR (cont'd)

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: MARCUS

dialog: 
text: LEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS
