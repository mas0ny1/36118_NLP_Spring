dialog: Shooting script — september 2013
scene_heading: 1. INT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY
text: Behind the glass wall, which separates the baggage claim area from the
text: busy airport terminal, MARIE is awaiting the arrival of a passenger.
text: She is holding a simple bouquet of flowers. She scans the crowd of the
text: newly arrived passengers. Marie’s gaze reveals a sense of worry. Her
text: eyes fix on a man who has his back towards her. She looks more
text: carefully, uncertain that he is the man she is waiting for. The man is
text: waiting along with the other passengers for his suitcase. Marie changes
text: position so that perhaps she’1l be able to see his face. She briefly
text: sees his profile. He’s AHMAD, forty-four years old. She spontaneously
text: raises her hand to catch his attention but changes her mind. She takes
text: off her wristbrace and stuffs it into her purse. She prefers to watch
text: him for a few moments from afar. Marie is intensely watching Ahmad; he
text: has not yet seen her. One by one, the passengers take their suitcases
text: and leave. Only Ahmad is still waiting next to the empty carousel for
text: his suitcase. Ahmad wanders through the baggage claim area looking for
text: a representative to report his missing suitcase. He speaks to a member
text: of the airport staff. Marie tries to get his attention from afar by
text: waving her hand. She signals to a passenger who is holding a suitcase
text: and walking by Ahmad to get him to look at her. The passenger speaks to
text: Ahmad. He now turns his head and sees Marie through the glass wall.
text: Happy, he walks towards her. They both come face-to-face on either side
text: of the glass wall. They cannot hear each other. From the expression on
text: their faces, it is clear that they have not seen each other in a long
text: time. She understands that his luggage has not arrived with the flight.
scene_heading: 2. EXT. OUTSIDE CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - PARKING LOT - DAY
text: It’s pouring rain. Marie and Ahmad run side by side through the parking
text: lot. They are laughing complicitily. They jump into the car, both
text: soaking wet.
scene_heading: 3. EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - PARKING LOT - INT. SAMIR’S CAR -
speaker_heading: DAY
text: Marie opens the door and sits behind the wheel. The water is dripping
text: down her face. Ahmad also gets in, struggling to catch his breath.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You still smoke?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: No, I’m getting old.
text: Marie reaches over to take a box of tissues. She dries her face, then
text: offers one to Ahmad, who does the same. Marie tosses her bag in the
text: back. Ahmad does the same with his backpack and the bouquet. He notices
text: the back of the car is loaded with all sorts of things. Several clothes
text: covered in plastic dry-cleaning bags are hanging from the ceiling of
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: You bought a car?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No, I borrowed it.
text: Marie starts the car. Ahmad is surprised by the music that comes on.
text: She turns the radio off and attempts to dry her hair with the car’s
text: heater which is still warming up. Then, she struggles to put the car in
text: gear. Her wrist hurts, so, she tries with her left hand.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: My wrist hurts.
text: Ahmad shifts the gear for her.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: You're getting old too.
speaker_heading: MARIE
speaker_heading: (1smiing)
dialog: Look out your side and see if I have
dialog: enough room.
text: Ahmad looks out the passenger-side window and Marie starts to back up.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You have room...
text: The car hits something.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Stop! What are you doing?

scene_heading: 4. EXT. HIGHWAY - INT. SAMIR’S CAR - DAY
text: The rain has eased up. Ahmad and Marie drive through a tunnel and
text: continue on a highway leading to the city.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Do the girls know I’m here?
speaker_heading: MARIE
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Didn't you tell them?!
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I thought you might let us down at the
dialog: last minute, like the last time.
text: Ahmad falls silent. Marie looks at him and smiles. As if she’s trying
text: to soften her harsh comment.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Put it in fourth.
text: Ahmad shifts the gear for Marie.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’m here now, let them know. I’d like
dialog: to see them.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: We're going to see them now.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: We're picking up Lucie and going home.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Didn’t you book a hotel for me?
speaker_heading: MARIE
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You were supposed to.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I wasn’t sure you'd come.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What do you mean you weren’t sure?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I wasn’t sure.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Listen, something came up last time.
dialog: Just two days before I...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Don’t worry about it. Don’t start
dialog: making excuses, we don’t have all day!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Just because I cancelled my trip once?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Not just for that.
text: They both fall quiet and go on driving for a while in silence.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: The girls would like to have you.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I don’t want to disturb.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You won't disturb us. You'll have to
dialog: come for your suitcase anyway, when
text: it’s delivered.
text: Ahmad doesn’t reply.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: At least, come and change your clothes
dialog: so you don’t catch a cold.
text: Ahmad still doesn’t reply and wipes the steamed-up windshield.
scene_heading: 5. INT. SAMIR’S CAR - EXT. THE STREET OF LUCIE’S SCHOOL - DAY
text: Students exit a school. Ahmad sits alone in the car, watching the
text: students file out through the window. A police officer knocks on the
text: window. Ahmad gets out of the car and goes towards her to dissuade her
text: from writing the ticket. She tells him to move the car. Ahmad sits in
text: the driver’s seat.
scene_heading: 6. INT. SAMIR’S CAR - EXT. THE STREETS AROUND LUCIE’S SCHOOL - DAY
text: Ahmad is behind the wheel and can’t find a place to stop. He is forced
text: to go down a one-way a street and turn onto another street to circle
text: back to the school. The sun shines into his eyes. As he lowers the sun
text: visor, a few pieces of paper fall out. He tries to pick them up as he
text: is driving. Among the documents, he sees an identification photo of a
text: man in his early thirties. He stares at the picture and drives for a
text: moment while holding it in his hand. He tucks the papers back in their
text: place. He turns onto the street where the school is located. The crowds
text: of students have thinned out. He sees Marie standing by the side of the
text: road looking worriedly for her car ans Ahmad. She sees him and gets in.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She was going to give you a ticket... I
dialog: went around the block.
text: Marie does not respond. She seems upset.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: She’s left.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Did she know you were coming to pick
dialog: her up?
text: She asks him to get going and takes out a cigarette and lights it. She
text: rolls down the window to let the smoke out. Ahmad realizes she’s upset.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Maybe she went home because you were
dialog: late?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It’s not her first time.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I don’t know. Last night she came home
dialog: at 11.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: They all go through this at her age,
dialog: it’s normal.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It’s not normal.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Why what’s wrong with her?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: She’s been givng me hell for two
dialog: months over nothing. Maybe you could
dialog: talk to her, try and see what’s wrong
dialog: with her?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: If she still remembers me after all
dialog: this time.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: She loves you.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: After all this time?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Where are you going? Turn right!
text: Ahmad, who has forgotten the way, follows Marie’s directions.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I was daydreaming.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You've forgotten everything.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I was distracted.
scene_heading: 7. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARIE’S HOUSE - DAY
text: A long, wide street cuts through a residental neighborhood of similar
text: stand alone houses near a railline. Ahmad pulls over in front of the
text: house. Marie gets out of the car to go inside.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Marie-Anne...
text: Marie pauses and turns to Ahmad. Ahmad takes the papers and documents
text: from above the sun visor and holds them out to Marie.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You shouldn't leave this here. It’s
dialog: risky.
text: Marie takes the documents and puts them in her purse. She senses that
text: Ahmad has already seen the picture. Ahmad also gets out.
scene_heading: 8. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE - THE FRONT YARD - DAY
text: The front yard of Marie’s two-story house is separated from the street
text: by a metal fence and a gate. Ahmad looks at the yard from between the
text: gaps in the fence. A ten-year-old girl, LEA and a six-year-old boy,
text: FOUAD are busy playing in the yard. Lea and Fouad are struggling to put
text: into place the chain of an old bicycle, probably belonging to Lea.
text: Marie who has entered the yard, starts picking up the hanging laundry.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Is Lucie home?
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: No.
text: She goes in the house. Ahmad discreetly enters the yard.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: You broke it.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Pull harder...
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: I can’t. I’1]1 hurt my hand.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (to Fouad and Lea)
dialog: No, not like that. First put one side
text: on, then the other.
text: The two children have only now noticed Ahmad’s presence. Surprised,
text: they stop pulling on the chain. Ahmad takes the chain from them.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I'll show you. This goes there...It’s
dialog: dried out.
dialog: (to LEA)
dialog: We need some oil. You know where to
dialog: find some? It used to be in the
text: cupboard in the shed.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: Ahmad!
text: Ahmad is happy that Lea has recognized him so quickly. He holds her
text: tightly in his arms. Surprised and curious, Fouad looks at them.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: My dear Lea... You're doing good?
dialog: You've grown so much, sweetie.
text: Ahmad holds out his hand to Fouad.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Hello, Sir.
text: Fouad does not shake his hand.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (jokingly to Lea)
dialog: Your friend is ignoring me. What's
dialog: his name?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: His name is Fouad.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Hello, Fouad.
text: Fouad shakes his hand.
scene_heading: 9. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Marie’s house is two-stories. On the first level is the kitchen with a
text: window facing the backyard, Marie’s room, the study with the computer
text: and the children’s room. On the second floor, which is reached via a
text: narrow stairway, there is only one bedroom with a window, which faces
text: the front yard and street. Although the house is old, it is clear that
text: it has been recently renovated. The paint on the walls has not yet
text: fully dried and a ladder and painting supplies can be seen throughout
text: the house. Marie climbs the stairs to the small upstairs room she has
text: prepared for Ahmad. In the bedroom is a small wooden bunk bed,
text: presumably belonging to her daughters. She lays the clothing she has
text: brought for Ahmad on the bed. While she is making the lower bed, shes
text: watches through the window Ahmad who is busy fixing the bike with
text: Fouad. She opens the window facing the yard.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Come inside, Ahmad. And you, Fouad,
dialog: come get your things in the bedroom.
scene_heading: 10. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - DAY
text: Marie goes to the bedroom to dry her hair. Ahmad and Fouad come inside.
text: Lea comes out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: LEA
text: It wasn’t in the shed.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Then you changed its place while I was
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: There’s some in my father’s car.
text: Ahmad heard what Fouad said but does not react. He notices the freshly
text: painted walls. As he wanders through the house, it is clear that he has
text: memories of this place. Lea and Fouad are standing watching him.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (to Lea)
dialog: Where’s the shelf that was here? The
dialog: old wooden shelf...
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: We moved it.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: There were books of mine on it.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: All your stuff’s put away in the shed.
text: Marie, facing the mirror in her bedroom is trying, despite her aching
text: wrist, to blowdry her hair. Ahmad peeks into the bedroom, leaning
text: against the doorframe.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Watch the paint.
text: Ahmad straightens up.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Wasn’t the other color better?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It’s not done yet. My wrist made me
dialog: stop.
text: Ahmad enters the room.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: You should’ve waited for me to come. I
dialog: I could’ve done it while I’m here. It
dialog: would’ve kept me busy.
text: He takes the blowdryer from Marie to help her. Standing close to her,
text: he dries her hair while she brushes it with her other hand.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Didn’t you want to go to a hotel?
dialog: Ouch! You’re burning me.
text: Ahmad holds the blowdryer further back and falls silent. Marie
text: continues brushing her hair.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It’s fine, thanks.
text: Ahmad turns off the blowdryer. Marie gets up. She picks up the phone
text: and walks out of the room while dialing.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I left some clothes upstairs. Go
dialog: change before you catch a cold.
text: Ahmad remains in the room. As the phone rings, Marie walks towards
text: Lea’s room. She sees Fouad, standing in the hallway, keeping an eye on
dialog: the bedroom.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to Fouad)
dialog: What are you doing here? Go on. Get
dialog: your things and go upstairs. You’ll
dialog: sleep there and Lucie here.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I don’t like it upstairs.
text: Ahmad comes out of the bedroom and walks towards the stairs.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It’s just while Ahmad’s here, then
dialog: you'll come back downstairs. Hurry up,
dialog: please.
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Lucie, call me back, please. I have a
dialog: surprise for you.
text: Marie hangs up. Fouad is upset as he grabs his things and pulls his
text: sheets off the bed.
scene_heading: 11. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY
text: Ahmad is looking out the window. Everything brings back old memories.
text: Fouad pushes the door open with his body and walks in holding all of
text: his bedding. Exasperated, Fouad dumps his things on the bottom bunk and
text: climbs up to make the bed on the top. Ahmad is staring at Fouad as he
text: struggles to make his bed. Ahmad helps him, scrutinizing his
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Is that your father’s car outside?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Do you live here?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: With your father?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Since school started.
text: Ahmad is taken aback by Fouad’s answer. He sits on the edge of the
text: lower bed. Fouad is still struggling with the sheet.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Don’t bother making your bed. You can
dialog: sleep downstairs in your own bed.
text: Fouad takes the sheet and climbs down the ladder of the bed. He again
text: gathers his things to leave the room.
scene_heading: 12. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - DAY
text: Fouad comes down the stairs. Marie is getting ready and sees Fouad and
text: comes towards him.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Why are you coming down?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: He told me to.
text: Surprised, Marie walks upstairs.
scene_heading: 13. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY
text: Marie opens the door. Ahmad is sitting on the edge of the bed. Marie
text: realizes how upset he is. She enters the room and closes the door.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: There aren’t enough beds for the three
text: of them downstairs.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You live with someone?
speaker_heading: MARIE
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You didn’t tell me.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: What do you mean? I wrote it in my
dialog: email.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What email?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I don’t know which one. One of them.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I didn’t get any.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: So, why did you want to stay at a
dialog: hotel?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I didn’t want to disturb you.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: In any case, I wrote you.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I didn’t get anything.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You didn’t wonder why I asked you to
dialog: come for the divorce?
text: Ahmad is quiet. Marie leans against the wall. Their eyes meet. After a
text: long silence, Ahmad finally speaks.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Does he know I’m here?
speaker_heading: MARIE
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’m leaving then.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: He won’t come by while you’re here. Or
dialog: he’ll let me know, for sure.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: When did you send that email?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It must still be in your inbox.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I guess so. Do you want me to show it
dialog: to you?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I asked you to book a hotel for me.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I did last time and you didn’t come. I
dialog: had to cancel.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: How much did it cost you?
text: Marie is hurt. She moves towards the door.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What time do I have to be in court
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You said you’d stay to talk to Lucie..
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: When will she be home?
text: Marie shrugs.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I can meet up with her tomorrow.
text: Marie opens the door.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I was hoping you'd keep your promise
dialog: for once.
text: Marie leaves the bedroom. Ahmad is upset and remains seated on the edge
text: of the bed. Marie hears his answer as she goes down the stairway.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I didn’t promise anything.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: My mistake. Sorry.
scene_heading: 14. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Marie comes down the stairs. A can of paint has spilt on to the floor.
text: The footstool, which Lea had brought from the shed, is next to the
text: spilt paint. Marie is furious, she sees paint covered footprints
text: leading towards the garden where the children are playing. Marie storms
text: into the yard.
scene_heading: 15. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE - YARD - DAY
text: Marie comes to the yard. She sees Fouad’s shoes, which are covered in
text: paint. He is putting dishwashing liquid on the dry bicycle chain. She
text: lunges towards him.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Fouad! Can’t you watch where you walk?
text: Fouad is looking at the bicycle chain and does not look up.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Why do I spend hours cleaning? For you
dialog: to make a mess? Look at me!
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: dishwashing liquid)
dialog: We went for this.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to Fouad)
dialog: I don’t give a damn!
text: Fouad lifts his head and looks Marie in the eyes. They are both staring
text: at each other. Suddenly Fouad moves towards the front gate to leave in
text: a huff. Exasperated, Marie tries to stop him. Fouad stubbornly throws
text: himself on the ground and Marie struggles to get him back inside.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Get back here! Come here!
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I wanna go home!
text: Lea goes towards Fouad to help her mom and convince Fouad to come back
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: 16. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - EXT. YARD - DAY
text: Ahmad is standing near the window, watching the scene below. In the
text: yard, Marie is still struggling with Fouad. She finally wrestles him
text: into her arms and drags him inside.
scene_heading: 17. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND THE CHILDREN’S ROOM - DAY
text: Marie is struggling to contain Fouad who is flailing his arms and legs
text: in resistance. She manages to bring him inside and sets him down on the
text: bed. Lea is scared, she follows them.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I'm sorry!
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I don’t care!
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Please, Fouad, calm down.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: You're not my mom.
text: Fouad refuses to calm down. With no other choice, Marie leaves Fouad in
text: the room, she locks the door behind her. Upset, Lea stands in the
text: corner of the hallway. Fouad beats against the door with his fists.
scene_heading: 18. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY, BATHROOM AND TOILET - DAY
text: Marie has rolled up her sleeves. Despite the fact that she is running
text: late she decides to quickly clean the paint spill before leaving. Ahmad
text: comes down the stairs.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You should go, you're late.. I711 clean
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Not with your wrist, go.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I thought you were leaving.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’ll wait for Lucie. We’1ll see after.
text: Marie gets up and rolls down her sleeves. She goes to the bathroom and
text: washes her hands and face. The occasional sound of Fouad beating his
text: fists against the door can still be heard.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: You'll keep an eye on them?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Go, don’t worry.
text: Ahmad goes towards the children’s room. He unlocks the door and enters.
text: Lea is still standing in a corner of the hallway, looking sad.
scene_heading: 19. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - CHILDREN’S ROOM - DAY
text: As Ahmad enters, Fouad tries to escape. Ahmad grabs him and drags him
text: back in. Worried, Lea has come to the doorway.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Where are you going? Wait!
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Let me go.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I'll let you go. But first tell me
dialog: where you want to go.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I’m leaving!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: My house.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Where’s your house?
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: Paris. He can’t go, it’s too far.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Shut up! No one asked you.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: None of that in this house! Got it?
text: Again Fouad tries to flee.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Lea, leave and close the door. We need
dialog: to talk.
text: Lea closes the door and leaves. Ahmad forces Fouad to sit on the bed
text: and gently sits down next to him.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What’s wrong Fouad? What is it?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I want to go.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You want to call home?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: There’s no one in my home.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What’s the matter with here? Is it
dialog: because she told you off? But you were
dialog: misbehaving. You spilt the paint, you
dialog: caused trouble. Didn’t you spill the
dialog: paint?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: It’s not the paint.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What is it, then? Is it because I’m
dialog: here? Do you want me to leave?
text: Fouad does not respond. He has calmed down a bit.
scene_heading: 20. INT. DRYCLEANER’S - DAY
text: Long rows of clothing covered in plastic hang from rods running
text: parallel along the ceiling. Large laundering machines are on and
text: running. NAIMA, the young employee is covering freshly ironed clothing
text: with plastic bags. On the glass door of the drycleaner’s, a piece of
text: paper is taped which reads: “Experienced drycleaner’s help wanted.
text: Inquire within.” Marie quickly comes inside.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: Hello, Ma’am.
text: Marie sees SAMIR’s feet among the rows of clothing. While holding some
text: dry-cleaned clothes on his arm, Samir comes to the front counter. He is
text: the man whose picture Ahmad had seen in the car. He acts coldly towards
text: Marie. Marie takes the car documents out of her purse and puts them on
text: the counter. Samir puts the clothing on the counter and on a piece of
text: paper, writes down the list of items and the cost for their cleaning.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: The plane was late.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: He’s here?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Yes.
text: Marie places the car documents in front of Samir.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Where did you park it?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Right there.
dialog: (pointing to the
dialog: documents)
dialog: You shouldn’t leave this in the car.
dialog: It’s risky.
text: Samir takes the receipt for the clothing along with the clothes and the
text: car documents from the counter to leave the drycleaner’s.
scene_heading: 21. EXT. STREET - SIDEWALK - DAY
text: While holding the clothing on his arm, Samir is walking with Marie on
text: the sidewalk towards his car.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Did you go to the hospital?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: How was she?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Same as usual. Fouad’s not with you?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Was he supposed to come?
speaker_heading: SAMIR

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: He asked me to pick him up. He didn’t
dialog: want to stay there.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I got upset with him. With both of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I’1l come and take him home with me
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No reason to make a fuss.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: He’d never called me to go fetch him
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I'd never yelled like that.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Anyway, I promised I’d go fetch him.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Ok. I shouldn’t have. We’ll make it up
dialog: tonight.
text: They have now reached the car. Marie unlocks the car and opens the back
text: door. Samir hangs the clothing on the rod above the backseat. He closes
text: the door and takes the keys from Marie to get in behind the wheeland
text: starts the car. Marie notices he is upset. Before the car drives off,
text: she taps on the glass. Samir rolls down the window.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: If you want to come over, let me know
dialog: first.
text: Marie takes off down the sidewalk. Samir is deep in thought. He puts
text: the car in gear. While driving, he watches Marie. Samir’s car slowly
text: passes her.
scene_heading: 22. INT. PHARMACY - DAY
text: Marie enters a pharmacy, goes behind the counter and greets her
text: coworker, a middle-aged woman. She then goes to the back room, puts on

scene_heading: 23. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EXT. - YARD - NIGHT
text: In the backyard, Ahmad is roasting corn. Lea is helping him and takes a
text: bite of one of the freshly grilled cobs. Ahmad fans the other corncobs
text: on the grill.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Corn, hot corn!
text: Lea mimics the sounds of his words. They laugh. Ahmad hands her another
dialog: corncob.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Here, take this for him.
text: Lea takes the corncob into the kitchen. In the kitchen, Fouad is
text: sitting at the table, cutting the corn stalk with a knife. Lea holds
text: the grilled corn out to him. He ignores her.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: Take it.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I don’t want it.
text: Lea notices Fouad’s finger is bleeding.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: You cut your hand.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: No I didn’t.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: Yes, you did. You're bleeding!
text: Lea walks towards the door to the backyard.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: Ahmad! He cut his finger!
scene_heading: 24. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: In the bathroom, Ahmad picks Fouad up, holds his finger under the tap
text: and washes it. Lea now comes into the bathroom with the first-aid kit.
text: Lea opens the kit. Ahmad pours some disinfectant over Fouad’s finger.
text: Fouad, who is clearly in pain, tries to be brave. They hear the front
text: door opening. Intrigued, Ahmad leans toward the bathroom door to see
text: who has entered the house. For a brief moment he sees LUCIE, Marie’s
text: sixteen-year-old daughter, as she quickly climbs the stairs to the
text: bedroom. He is relieved.
scene_heading: 25. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND THE STAIRS - NIGHT
text: Ahmad goes upstairs. He knocks on the door and hides waiting to
text: surprise Lucie. He knocks again. Lucie opens the door and comes out.
text: Ahmad covers her eyes from behind. Lucie is startled.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Ahmad!
text: Ahmad removes his hands and they hug each other. From downstairs, Fouad
text: is standing in front of the bathroom and watching them.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: How did you know it was me?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I knew you were coming today.
text: Ahmad is surprised at Lucie’s response.
scene_heading: 26. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Ahmad, Lucie, Lea and Fouad are sitting around the kitchen table and
text: having dinner. A complete Iranian feast, which Ahmad has prepared.
text: Fouad has cleaned his plate and turns to Ahmad.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Can I have some more?
text: Ahmad takes Fouad’s plate and serves him seconds.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Did you like it?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Very much!
text: Ahmad also serves a second helping for Lea. He wants to reserve Lucie’s
text: plate but she doesn’t let him.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: No, it’s enough.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Come one, have some. You won’t get
dialog: real Ghormesabzi again soon. Unless
dialog: you two marry two nice Iranian guys...
dialog: and you, Fouad, an Iranian girl!
text: Lea laughs. So does Fouad.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: How long will you stay?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It depends on how long our talk will
dialog: last after dinner.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: (abruptly)
dialog: What are Iranian girls like?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Iranian girls.. They look like me.. but
dialog: they're girls!
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: How does that sound?... Like this...
text: Ahmad jokingly takes on the mannerisms of a woman. Fouad and Lea laugh.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: What are we to talk about?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Have your dinner and I’ll tell you.
scene_heading: 27. EXT. MARIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Lucie is seated on the steps of the house leading down to the backyard.
text: Ahmad pours some water on the ashes of the barbecue and places it in a
text: corner. He picks up the cornhusks strewn on the ground and throws them
text: away. While doing all this, he is speaking to Lucie.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You always come home so late?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Just to sleep.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I have nowhere else to spend the
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Why don’t you want to sleep here?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Same as you. You’d rather go to your
dialog: friend’s tomorrow.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: This isn’t my home.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: But your friend’s place is?
text: Ahmad approaches Lucie and sits down next to her.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’m not comfortable here.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Neither am I.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It’s not the same. For me, it’s hard
text: to face the guy who’s about to marry
dialog: my ex.. it’s only normal.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Now, she’sjust your ex?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Well, yes.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: You lived here with her for years and
dialog: now she’s just your ex?!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Everything’s changed since then. We
dialog: got separated... You’re old enough to
dialog: understand that.
text: Lucie gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I’m old enough not to be preached at.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’m not here to preach. Your mom asked
dialog: me to talk to you and see what’s got
dialog: into you. I don’t know why she thinks
dialog: you'd tell me more than you tell her.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: She knows perfectly what’s got into
dialog: me. I don’t want to see that jerk
dialog: whenever I come home.
text: A long silence between them ensues. Lucie goes into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Lucie, wait!
scene_heading: 28. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Lucie wants to leave the kitchen. Ahmad comes into the kitchen from the
dialog: backdoor. He wants her to stay.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Come and sit here.
text: Lucie sits unwillingly.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Isn’t he a good guy?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I don’t know him.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Why do you call him a jerk, then? What
dialog: has he done?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: He hasn’t done anything. He has
dialog: nothing to do here.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Anyway, you have to accept the fact
dialog: that it’s your mom’s right to live
dialog: with whoever she wants.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Whoever she wants? Even a guy with a
dialog: kid and a wife in a coma?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (curious)
dialog: Fouad’s mom?
text: Lucie nods. A moment of silence.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: And if she married someone else, would
dialog: you mind?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: It’d be the same.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: So your problem isn’t him.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Then, what is it?
text: Lucie falls silent for a moment. Fighting back tears, she answers
dialog: Ahmad.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I’m sixteen years old and since I was
dialog: born, my mom’s changed guys three
dialog: times. And it’s always the same story.
dialog: They come, stay for a few years, and
text: then they leave.
text: Ahmad understands what Lucie means and has nothing to say in response.
text: He too is upset. He gets up with the excuse of clearing the dishes. He
text: has his back to Lucie. Perhaps to stop Lucie from seeing his reaction.
text: And again there is silence.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Would you talk to her?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Talk her out of this marriage.
text: Ahmad laughs at what Lucie has said; a bitter laugh. The sound of the
text: front door opening is heard.
scene_heading: 29. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Marie enters the house. From between the door to the children’s room
text: she sees Fouad and Lea who are not yet sleeping and talking to each
text: other. She is pressed to know if Lucie has come home. She throws her
text: purse and coat on her bed and enters the kitchen.
scene_heading: 30. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Marie is elated to see Lucie. Lucie immediately gets up to leave the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Good evening.
text: Lucie mumbles to her mother.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: (imitating Ahmad and
dialog: in Persian)
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Lucie, can you sleep downstairs
dialog: tonight? Fouad will go up with Ahmad.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I kept you some food. Haven’t you had
dialog: dinner?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No.
text: Lucie leaves. Marie sees the food that Ahmad has kept for her. She
dialog: wasn’t expecting Persian food.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Oh la la ! Thank you.. Where did you
dialog: get the herbs?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: We went shopping with the kids.
text: Marie sits at the table and starts to eat. Ahmad gets busy placing the
text: dishes in the dishwasher.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Do you want me to heat it up if it’s
dialog: cold?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No.. You're still a great cook!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: The one thing I’m stil great at. What
dialog: time must we be there tomorrow?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (Giving her a spoon)
dialog: You don’t eat Ghormesabzi with a fork.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Did you talk to her?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You can guess. She doesn’t like you
dialog: remarrying.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She’s worried that you’1l live with
dialog: him for a while and that he’1l take
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Tell her to be sure that this one
dialog: won't leave.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I don’t think I’m the right person to
dialog: convince her to be happy you’re
dialog: getting married.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (a bit angry)
dialog: I ‘m not asking her to be happy. I
dialog: just want to know what she’s after.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Stopping this marriage.
text: Marie laughs nervously.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It made me laugh too.
text: Marie now stops laughing while chewing the food she has in her mouth.
dialog: Ahmad wants to leave.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Try to convinve her before you make
dialog: your decision.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: My decision’s made.
text: Ahmad leaves the kitchen. While eating her food, Marie is deep in
dialog: thought.
scene_heading: 31. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The lights are out. Street light shines in through the window. Ahmad is
text: lying down on the lower bunk and Fouad is on the top. Both are having
text: trouble falling asleep. Fouad is looking at Ahmad from in between the
text: spaces in the slats of his bed; Ahmad’s hand, Ahmad’s mouth. He is
text: trying to find out if Ahmad is asleep, but he can’t see his eyes. Fouad
text: shifts restlessly. The bed squeaks. Ahmad hears him moving.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Fouad?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: If you're not comfy, we can switch
dialog: beds.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I'm ok.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Then, why aren’t you asleep?
text: Fouad does not answer.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Close your eyes and go to sleep.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I have to pee.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Go, then. Go...
text: Fouad doesn’t move, Ahmad realizes that he is afraid of going down by
text: himself. He gets up to accompany him.
scene_heading: 32. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Ahmad and Fouad walk downstairs towards the restroom. Ahmad turns on
text: the light. Fouad goes inside and closes the door. Ahmad waits in the
text: dark hallway for him to come out. Marie’s bedroom is next to the
text: restroom. Ahmad notices the light pouring out from under Marie’s
text: bedroom door. He hears a noise from inside the room. He strains to hear
text: the muffled sounds of a conversation between two people. He is ill-at-
text: ease. He doesn’t want to stay there. He walks back upstairs.
scene_heading: 33. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ahmad is distraught and cannot sleep. He is concerned that Fouad has
dialog: not returned.
scene_heading: 34. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Samir is lying on the bed. Marie cradeling his head and putting eye
text: drops into his eyes. As she is doing this, they are quietly speaking to
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Did you talk to her doctor too?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: No, just the nurse.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What did she say?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: The scratches on her stomach.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: They happened after my last two
dialog: visits.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Maybe it has nothing to do with your
dialog: visits. Maybe it was involuntary.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You’d like it to be involuntary?
text: Marie is shocked by what Samir has said. She closes the eye-drop bottle
text: and sits on the edge of the bed. Samir closes his eyes to diminish the
text: sting. From Marie’s silence, he realizes that he has upset her.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Do you hear yourself? You can’t say
dialog: whatever you want and then just
dialog: apologize.
text: Marie wants to continue the discussion but is interrupted by the sound
text: of someone knocking on the door. Marie gets up and opens the door.
text: Fouad is behind the door. It is clear that he is scared of the dark.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: It’s dark. I can’t go up.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Why do you want to go up?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I asked him to go upstairs with Ahmad.
text: The girls are together.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Maybe he is not comfortable sleeping
text: with a stranger.
text: Samir gets up from the bed and comes towards Fouad.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Get your things. We’re leaving.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I’m spleepy. I want to go to bed.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You asked me to come get you!
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I want to stay.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You can sleep in my bed.

scene_heading: 35. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN AND HALLWAY - MORNING
text: The next morning, Lucie, Lea and Fouad are sitting around the kitchen
text: table finishing off their breakfast. The sink is full of water and

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Ahmad leave it.. we’re running late.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
text: The sink is clogged.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It can wait. We have to be there by 9.
dialog: Hurry up, kids.
text: Marie leaves the kitchen. Ahmad opens the drainpipe. All the water from
text: the sink pours into the bucket which Ahmad has placed underneath the
text: sink. Ahmad clears the clogged pipe and dirties his hands in the
text: process. Samir, who has just woken up, enters the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Hi.
text: Lea and Fouad answer him. Lucie ignores his presence.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (to Ahmad)
dialog: ‘Morning... Samir.
text: Ahmad whose hands are dirty, gets up to greet him respectfully but does
text: not offer his hand to shake.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: My hands are dirty, sorry.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: It’s blocked again?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It’s unblocked. I’1l just screw it
text: back on.
text: Samir joins the children seated at the kitchen table. As soon as he
text: sits, Lucie grabs her last bite and without saying anything leaves the
text: kitchen and walks in the hallway. She comes face-to-face with Marie who
text: is getting dressed.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Get ready, Lucie, we'll drop you off.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: No need, I'll go by myself.
text: Lucie goes to her room. Marie comes to the kitchen. Ahmad is still busy
text: reattaching the drainpipe. Samir is eating his breakfast. Without
text: sitting down at the table, Marie grabs a bite to eat.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Ahmad, we're late.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It’s finished.
text: Ahmad turns on the water to verify the pipe he has reattached does not
text: leak. Marie notices Samir who is pretending to be busy with his
dialog: breakfast.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to the kids)
dialog: Get moving, kids.
text: Lea and Fouad finish their breakfasts and leave the kitchen to prepare
dialog: for school.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
text: It’s leaking.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: There’s always been a leak.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I told you the joint has to be

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to Ahmad)
dialog: Did you eat anything?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (thinks Marie is
dialog: talking to him)
dialog: Not yet.
text: Ahmad turns off the tap. He takes the bucket from under the sink and

text: Samir is wearing some work clothes and is standing on a step ladder
text: painting a wall. As he paints, he looks out the window and sees Marie
text: give the car keys to Ahmad. Samir has a strange feeling, as if seeing
text: them together bothers him. Lucie comes into the room to get something.
text: She has her backpack on her shoulder and is ready to go to school. She
text: wasn’t expecting to see Samir. Samir climbs down the ladder to help her
text: and pulls the plastic cover away from her things. Without paying any
text: attention to him, Lucie searches the computer desk for something and
dialog: does not find it. This is a good excuse for Samir to start a
text: conversation with her.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Looking for something?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: No.
text: Lucie goes out. Samir is left alone.
scene_heading: 38. INT. SAMIR’S CAR - EXT. STREET OUTSIDE LEA’S SCHOOL - DAY

speaker_heading: AHMAD

speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (mimics Ahmad’s
dialog: smirk)
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: AHMAD

text: is Italian. SHAHRYAR, the middle-aged and friendly owner, is taking a
text: customer’s order. The restaurant is bustling, most of the tables are
text: full of diners. Ahmad and Lucie enter the restaurant. They walk towards

dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Excuse me, where’s the bus stop to
dialog: Tajrish?
text: Shahryar looks up. He is shocked to see Ahmad.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?!
text: Shahryar gets up from behind the till and comes towards Ahmad. They
text: both hug each other warmly and start joking and laughing.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian and
dialog: pointing to Lucie)
dialog: Do you recognize her?
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: She’s grown up.
dialog: (to Lucie)
dialog: Do you remember when you were little,
dialog: he’d put you on his bike and bring you
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: That was Lea.. this is Lucie! You’ve
dialog: always mixed them.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: How tall she’s become.
dialog: (to Lucie)
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I'm good.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: You haven't had lunch?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Why else would we bother to come
dialog: here?!
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Sit, I'll be right with you.
text: Ahmad and Lucie move towards a table to sit down, Shahryar walks
text: towards the kitchen. Valeria, Shahryar’s Italian wife, is busy in the
dialog: kitchen...
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Italian)
dialog: Valeria, your friend’s here.
text: Valeria sees Ahmad. Ahmad walks towards her. She is happy to see Ahmad.
speaker_heading: VALERIA
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Ahmad... Hello. How are you?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Hello, dear Valeria.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: You remember Lucie?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: VALERIA
dialog: Hello.. what a beautiful lady you've
dialog: become!...
text: Valeria warmly embraces Lucie.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You two are still together?
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: There is this tiny thing in common
dialog: between us to keep us from separating.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: The colors of our flags.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (to Valeria)
dialog: What is he saying?
speaker_heading: VALERIA
dialog: He talks too much.. let him. How’s your
dialog: mom?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: She’s good.
text: Valeria goes to the kitchen. Ahmad and Lucie sit at the table. Ahmad
text: picks up the menu to look it over.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Did you go to court?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: SO, it’s over now?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It was already over. You still like
dialog: ravioli?
text: Ahmad sets the menu down. He notices Lucie’s sad eyes, staring off into
dialog: the distance.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What is it?
text: Lucie does not respond.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You know, this guy... I don’t think
dialog: he’s that bad...
text: Lucie again does not respond.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: He must be going through a difficult
dialog: time. Put yourself in his shoes.
dialog: Between his wife and his concern for
dialog: his son...
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: How does she want to marry a married
dialog: man?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: But you said his wife’s in a coma.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: But she’s not dead; she might not die...
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: That’s his problem. That’s no one
dialog: else’s business...
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Do you know why his wife’s in a coma?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: No, how would I know?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: My mom didn’t tell you?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: She committed suicide.
text: Ahmad is shocked by what Lucie is telling him. He remains silent
text: saddened by what he has learned.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Because of her depression?
text: Lucie, who has until now fought back her tears, suddenly loses control
text: and start to cry. She tries to prevent the other diners from hearing
text: her but many of them turn to see why she is crying. Ahmad tries to get
dialog: her to calm down.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Lucie. look at me...
text: Worried, Shahryar comes to their table.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: What’s the matter?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Lucie.. get up, we’ll get some fresh
dialog: air.
text: Ahmad takes Lucie’s hand and gets her up from the table.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: Take her to the back.
text: Ahmad leads Lucie to the small back room of the restaurant where she
text: can compose herself. Concerned by Lucie’s outburst, Valeria looks
text: questioningly at Shahryar. Shahryar shrugs.
scene_heading: 44, INT. SHAHRYAR’S RESTAURANT - BACK ROOM - DAY
text: A small room with a bed and Shahryar’s personal things. In a corner are
text: boxes of soft drink, mineral water and food supplies. Ahmad sits Lucie
text: down on the bed and unties her scarf and puts it aside.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Do you know why she doesn’t tell
dialog: anyone that this guy’s wife has
dialog: committed suicide?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Calm down.. calm down for now, we’1l
dialog: talk later.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Because she doesn’t want anyone to
dialog: find out.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: That it’s because of their affair that
dialog: she tried to kill herself.
text: Although he’s shocked, but Ahmad pretends to not take Lucie seriously.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You shouldn’t speak of these things
dialog: with such certainty.. especially at
dialog: your age.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Then, don’t say I’ve grown up if you
dialog: don't think so.
text: Lucie gets up to leave. Ahmad holds her and stops her.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Sorry.
text: Lucie sits down. More silence.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I don’t want them to be together.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You think it’s up to you and me? I’m
dialog: nobody in this story.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: If they get married then 1/11 never..
dialog: I'll never set foot in that house
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Your mother is pregnant.
text: Lucie looks at him in disbelief.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: You're lying.
text: Lucie, emotionally drained, stands up and leaves the room. Ahmad
text: follows her.
scene_heading: 45. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHAHRYAR’S RESTAURANT - DAY - CONTINUED
text: Lucie exits the restaurant and starts walking down the sidewalk. Ahmad
text: walks next to her.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Wait...
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: You know why she went with that
dialog: asshole?... Cause he looks like you!
dialog: He reminds her of you!
text: Ahmad has no answer to give Lucie. Lucie leaves. Ahmad stands there for
dialog: a moment.
scene_heading: 46. INT. LIGHTING STORE - DAY
text: An old shop in Paris. A large number of old and new chandeliers and
text: other lamps are hanging from the ceiling of the shop. All around the
text: store are table lamps in various sizes and shapes. Samir and Marie are
text: looking at the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling to pick something
dialog: out.
scene_heading: 47. INT. SAMIR’S CAR - EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Several chandeliers and lamps are placed on the backseat. Samir is
text: sitting behind the wheel and Marie in the front seat. They drive
text: through the busy streets of Paris. Samir is deep in thought. Marie
text: senses it and quietly waits for him to speak. Without looking at him,
text: Marie gently reaches over to hold his hand and closes her eyes. A
text: moment later, Samir has to remove his hand in order to shift gears.
text: Marie opens her eyes. They drive on in silence.
scene_heading: 48. EXT. STREET - INT. RER STATION - NIGHT
text: Ahmad comes up the stairs in a metro station. It is raining. He takes
text: the gift he has bought out of its plastic bag and pulls the bag over
text: his head to prevent his head from getting wet. He crosses the busy
text: street, reaches the sidewalk and hugs the wall as he walks to stay as
dialog: dry as possible.
scene_heading: 49, INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Marie walks towards the front door. She opens the door. Ahmad, who is
text: soaked from the rain, comes inside.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You're soaked!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It started pouring...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Want a coffee?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: No, I’ve just come to get my
dialog: suitcase. I can’t miss the last train.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It’s right here. At least, wait till
text: the rain stops.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
text: It’s not stopping soon.
dialog: Ahmad’s words have worried Marie even more.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Is Lucie back?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No.
text: Worried, Ahmad leans against the hallway wall.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Watch the paint.
text: Ahmad looks at his coat which is not stained with paint. He notices his
text: suitcase in the hallway. He walks towards it and sees the lock is
dialog: broken.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It was broken when they delivered it.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Did you call her friends?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I’ve called them so often looking for
dialog: her that I’m embarrassed to do it
dialog: again.
text: Ahmad finds his towel among the things in his suitcase and dries his
text: face. He tries to close the suitcase but it will not close properly.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Did you talk to her today?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Yes. Can I have a piece of string or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You have a couple of suitcases left in
dialog: the shed. You can take one of them.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Are the kids sleeping?
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: Marie goes inside.
scene_heading: 50. INT. MARIE’S YARD - SHED - NIGHT
text: Ahmad is in the shed looking for his suitcases, which he had left there
text: from a few years ago. From among the clutter piled up in a heap, he
text: pulls out two dusty suitcases. He unzips the larger suitcase. Some
text: clothing, a few black and white pictures of Ahmad from when he lived in
text: Paris and other personal items are in the suitcase. Seeing his old
text: belongings changes his mood.
scene_heading: 51. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Marie is standing by the window facing the backyard. The intensity of
text: the rain can be seen. Samir is standing on the kitchen table and is
text: installing a chandelier. Ahmad comes in the back kitchen door with his
text: empty suitcase and heads towards the hallway. Marie and Samir briefly
text: look at the suitcase he’s holding. Ahmad leaves the kitchen in the
text: dominating silence.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Turn it on, please.
text: Marie walks towards the switch and turns on the light. The chandelier
text: is lit up. Samir comes down from the table. He notices how restless
text: Marie is. Ahmad enters the kitchen with the plastic bag holding the
text: gifts he has brought from Tehran and the gift he has bought for Fouad.
text: He places the gifts on the kitchen table and sits down.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Will you tell the kids to come here
dialog: before they go to sleep, so that I can
dialog: give them their gifts?
text: Marie is about to leave the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Should Fouad come too?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: But, he wasn’t supposed to get one.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I got him something today.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Can I ask you not give it to him?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Why?
text: Marie is also astonished and is looking at Samir.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: He’s done something wrong. He needs to
dialog: be punished...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: They should both be punished, then.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I can only speak for my son.
text: Samir’s words have upset Marie.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What’ve they done?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: They took the gift out of your
dialog: suitcase.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: But the gift was still in there.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I put it back. But we can’t let them
text: off the hook.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: The suitcase was open, they got
dialog: tempted...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (impatiently wanting
dialog: to leave)
dialog: I'll ask them to apologize.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: This way they’1l learn that there will
dialog: always be a way to get away with any
text: situation by apologizing.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: But I’ve already told them I’ve
dialog: brought gifts.. I can’t pretend now I
dialog: didn’t.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to Samir,
dialog: frustrated)
dialog: Can you please let go? I’ve already
dialog: scolded them enough.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (a bit upset)
dialog: I was just asking if it was possible.
text: Ahmad is in a dilemma. He doesn’t know how to respond, but Marie goes
text: to get the kids. Ahmad and Samir are standing opposite each other in
text: the kitchen. There is silence and the tension between them is palpable.
text: They avoid making eye contact with one another. Samir cannot stand this
text: situation any longer and gets up from the table with the excuse of
text: closing the window that Marie had left open when she was smoking her
text: cigarette. He sees the light in the shed, which Ahmad has left on. He
text: passes through the backyard in the rain and turns off the light in the
text: shed and comes back to the kitchen. Marie enters the kitchen with Lea
dialog: and Fouad.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (friendly)
dialog: Good evening, kids.
text: Ahmad takes the plastic bag to take out the gifts.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No, first you both have to apologize.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: I apologize.
text: Everyone is waiting for Fouad to apologize but he is quiet.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I didn’t take it from the suitcase.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: But you were with her when she did it.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: But I didn’t take it.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: It doesn’t matter who took it. You
dialog: were together, you could’ve stopped
dialog: her.
text: Fouad is silent and does not respond. Angry, Samir stands up, walks
text: towards him and stares into his eyes. Ahmad is uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: “I apologize”.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: I apologize.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (commandingly)
dialog: “I apologize”!
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: (with no other
dialog: choice)
dialog: I apologize.
text: Samir goes back to his seat and sits down. Ahmad gives Lea and Fouad
text: the two boxes. For Lea a remote controlled helicopter and for Fouad a
text: giftwrapped box. The children thank him but they are not very pleased
text: with the scolding they have received.
scene_heading: 52. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - CHILDREN’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lea and Fouad are in their beds.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: You pretended like it was me.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I just said I didn’t take it.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: That means it was me!
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: It was you.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: But you told me his suitcase was open.
dialog: Otherwise, I wouldn’t have gone.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: You didn’t have to listen. You didn’t
dialog: have to go.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: I know why you're mad. You didn’t get
dialog: a helicopter. You got colored pencils.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: You're crazy.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: You’re insane.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Shut up!
text: Lea is upset at him. She gets up, takes her blanket and leaves the room
text: to sleep in another room.
scene_heading: 53. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Marie holds the dress which Ahmad brought for her up to her body and
text: shows it to Ahmad and Samir. Both men are looking at Marie.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I got the size you used to wear.
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: It still wear the same size.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I have a gift for Lucie too. I’ll give
dialog: it to her later.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: She’s never been so late.
text: Samir gets up from the table.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I'll go look for her.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I don’t know.. nearby... in the streets,
dialog: at the station.. where are the keys?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You had them.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Can I come with you, if you don’t
dialog: mind?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (with no other
dialog: choice)
dialog: Sure. If you want.
text: Samir leaves the kitchen.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She might not want to come back with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Why did she cry at the restaurant
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Who told you?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I called Shahryar and he said she
dialog: suddenly burst ito tears. She’s never
dialog: been this late. What have you told her
dialog: that has made her stay out until now?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: You hadn't told her you were pregnant?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I thought she’d let it go if she knew
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: That’s why she’s not back. You weren’t
dialog: supposed to tell her.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I didn’t know. What kind of secret is
dialog: that, anyway? She’d have found out
dialog: someday!
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: Not when she’s so upset.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Her problem is not your being
dialog: pregnant.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What is her problem?
text: Ahmad seems reluctant to answer. Marie stands in front of him, waiting
dialog: for a reply.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (a bit upset)
dialog: What’s her problem?... huh?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (with no other
dialog: choice)
text: She seems to know everything.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Everything about what?
text: Samir comes to the kitchen door.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I can’t find the keys.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Well, look for them!
text: Samir is surprised to see Marie so up. Ahmad is visibly uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: We’1l talk later.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What do you mean by “knowing
dialog: everything”? I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She says that his wife committed
dialog: suicide because of your affair.
text: Marie gets even angrier upon hearing this. Ahmad, who feels that he has
dialog: said what he needed to say, tries again to leave.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: She committed suicide because...
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’11 call you tomorrow and we can
dialog: speak then.
text: Samir enters the kitchen to take his coat.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (angrier)
dialog: The keys are not here.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I got them.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: So why you are here?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What do you mean? Does somebody mind
dialog: my being here?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No, but...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Forget it.
text: Samir leaves the house and Ahmad tries to go outside with him.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (to Samir)
dialog: Wait, I’m coming.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Ahmad.. his wife had been depressed for
dialog: some time.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Every time I’d take my clothes there,
dialog: I’d see her.. You could tell that she
dialog: was unwell.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Why was she unwell?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What do you mean why?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Nothing, forget it.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Look, either don’t say something or if
dialog: you do, say it clearly.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You said every time you saw her, she
dialog: felt unwell...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I didn’t say she felt unwell, I said
dialog: she was unwell!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Forget it. This is just getting worse.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You'd really like to hear that it was
dialog: my fault if that woman committed
dialog: suicide?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I don’t want to hear anything. You
dialog: asked me to go and talk to your
dialog: daughter. I’m just telling what she
dialog: thinks. That’s all.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: She’s wrong. She must come and have a
dialog: conversation with me and I'll tell
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Do you want to tell her what you told
dialog: me? Do you think she’s going to buy
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Don’t you believe me?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Does that matter? She’s the one who...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What’s so unbelievable about it?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I also find it hard to believe that
dialog: the mother of a five-year-old would
dialog: commit suicide because of depression.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Look who’s talking! Have you forgotten
dialog: the state you were in? This woman
dialog: committed suicide another time when
dialog: her baby was nine-month-old! Was it
dialog: also my fault? I was with you, back
dialog: then!
text: Ahmad falls silent upon hearing this.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Her depression started right after the
dialog: birth. Do you want to know what meds
dialog: Samir would come and get for her?
scene_heading: 54. INT. AND EXT. SAMIR’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Ahmad and Samir are in the car, driving up and down the streets of
dialog: their neighborhood searching for Lucie.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: How long are you staying in town?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I haven't booked my return yet.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Couldn’t you have sent a lawyer to
dialog: take care of the divorce instead of
dialog: coming all this way?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Sure, but I wanted to come. I wanted
dialog: to see the kids, and Marie-Anne too...
dialog: to end on good terms.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
text: But it doesn’t seem to be the end.
dialog: There’s still something going on.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: No.. What makes you think that?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
text: When two people meet four years later
dialog: and start fighting again, it means
text: things are still unresolved.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: We were arguing about Lucie.
text: They are both quiet now, searching the streets in silence.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Lucie’s problem is me.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: No.. it’s a misunderstanding.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: About what?
dialog: Ahmad does not wish to answer.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Anything personal that I shouldn’t
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I that case, I want you to tell me...
dialog: You may know Marie is carrying my
dialog: child. It’s not good for her to be
dialog: stressed out all the time, smoking so
dialog: many cigarettes...
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’m worried about her too. She didn’t
dialog: use to smoke.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I won't let this girl destroy her
dialog: mother. If she has a problem, sh
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She has no problem. I told you, it’s a
dialog: misunderstanding.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What is this fucking misunderstanding
dialog: that has been screwing our lives for
dialog: months?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Marie-Anne can tell you.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Leave her out of this.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She is making assumptions about your
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: She thinks she committed suicide
dialog: because of our relationship?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: So you know...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I overheard your conversation.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: She did that because of a stupid story
text: with a customer.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I heard she was depressed.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Otherwise, she wouldn’t have tried to
dialog: kill herself for nothing. What can I
dialog: do if Lucie doesn’t believe me?
dialog: I can send her my employee. She saw
dialog: the whole thing.
scene_heading: 55. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Samir and Ahmad enter the house through the front door. Marie hears the

text: Samir and Ahmad’s expression, she realizes that their search has been
text: fruitless. Samir places the umbrella in a corner and walks in.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: We should call the police. They may
dialog: find her.
text: Concerned, Ahmad stands in the doorway. Marie approaches him.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Has she already stayed out all night?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No, it’s the first time.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Maybe she went to her father’s.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: To Brussels?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: He’s not in Paris anymore?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No, he’s back in Brussels.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You think she can be there?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (doubtful)
text: She’s on bad terms with him too.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Do you want me to call?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to Ahamd)
dialog: It’s better if you do it.
text: Samir brushes past Marie and goes to the bedroom. Ahmad is
text: uncomfortable with the request Marie has made.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I doubt she’d have gone to Brussels.
text: Marie notices that Ahmad would perfer not to call Lucie’s father.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Fine, Ill do it.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Ok, give me his number.
text: Marie goes to get the number.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Shahryar called twice. He wants you to
dialog: call him back.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Where’s the phone?
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: In the kitchen.
text: Ahmad goes to the kitchen.
scene_heading: 56. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Lea is lying down under the blanket on her mother’s bed. Samir is
text: feeling down and is seated on the edge of the bed. Marie comes in,
text: worried. She is looking for her address book. Everyone is quiet. Marie
text: sees that Samir is deep in thought, he running his fingers through his
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Where did she get this idea?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What idea?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: About Celine’s suicide.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I don’t know...
text: Marie finds her address book and starts to leave the bedroom. Before
text: exiting, she realizes that her reaction has upset Samir. She walks
text: towards Samir and sits next to him affectionately. Lea, who has not yet
text: fallen asleep, turns around and sees their backs facing her. Samir
text: takes the eye-drops and drops some medication into his eyes.
scene_heading: 57. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN AND HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Ahmad is holding the phone and speaking to Shahryar.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Okay, thanks.... Okay, I will... Bye.
text: Marie is standing there holding the phonebook and is waiting for Ahmad
text: to get off the phone to give him the number.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Her father’s number. But try not to
dialog: worry him. He’s fragile...
speaker_heading: AHMAD
text: She’s at Shahryar’s.
text: Marie is shocked and quiet.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
text: She went to the restaurant and he took
dialog: her in.
text: Marie, who until now had tried to control herself, suddenly becomes
dialog: angry.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: But he called twice! Why didn’t he
dialog: tell me? He heard how worried I was!
dialog: Why didn’t he tell me? I’ve been
dialog: worried sick all night!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’ll explain.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Explain what? What do you want to
dialog: explain?
text: Samir, curious about the commotion, comes into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What’s the matter?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: I’ve already asked you to go through
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (even more firmly)
dialog: And I ask you not to raise your voice
dialog: in front of me.. okay?
text: Suddenly, everyone is quiet. Samir tries to control himself.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Why didn’t he tell me she was there?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (to Marie)
dialog: Lucie made him promise.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: He promised to hide a sixteen-year-old
dialog: girl in his house and not tell anyone?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What do you mean hide?!
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Why has he taken her to his house?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: He felt sorry for her.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Didn’t he feel sorry for her mother?!
text: Ahmad holds his tongue not to start a fight. Marie suddenly gets up to
text: leave the kitchen. She takes a few steps and as if forgetting
text: something, she comes back.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to Samir)
dialog: The keys.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: She has to come back home.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Marie...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: She has to come here, sit her ass down
dialog: and listen!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Right now!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She thinks we don’t know she’s there.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I don’t care! I want her to come and
dialog: see the mess she’s put me in! I want
dialog: her to know that I didn’t cause this
dialog: woman’s suicide!
text: Fouad, standing in the doorway, has heard everything.
scene_heading: 58. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Marie rushes to put on her raincoat. Samir is standing next to the door
text: and Lea is on the bed. Although her eyes are closed, it is clear that
text: she is not sleeping.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: If you go to get her now, she won't
dialog: come home with you.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Then, I’1l call the police to bring
dialog: her back. I swear I will.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: The police will bring her back one
dialog: night. What about tomorrow night?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Either she comes back here or she goes
text: and lives with her father in Brussels.
text: Marie comes towards the door to leave. Samir blocks her path.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: She won’t come back as long as I’m
dialog: here.
text: They stare at each other in silence.
scene_heading: 59. INT. SHAHRYAR’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The house is mostly dark, only one light is on in the kitchen.
text: Shahryar’s house is not very large. It has been decorated like an
text: Iranian home. The television is on and Shahryar is sitting on a sofa
text: opposite it. He is watching a football game. Two commentators fiercely
text: debating a referee call. They each present their own points of view.
text: The penalty sequence is repeated several times in slow motion and
text: graphics. The referee’s call cannot be confirmed. The doorbell ringing
text: interrupts the sound of the show. Shahryar gets up and walks towards
text: the door. He opens the door for Ahmad. Ahmad walks in with his
text: suitcase. Both men speak quietly.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Hello.. come in.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (in Persian)
dialog: Is she up?
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: (in Persian)
text: She has fallen asleep.. come in.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
text: Hardly here and already in trouble.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: When did she come to you?
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: It was late. I thought she had come
dialog: looking for you.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You should have called right then. Her
dialog: mother was so worried.
speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR
dialog: How can I call you? You don’t have a
dialog: phone! I called the house looking for
dialog: you but you weren’t there. I was
dialog: afraid if I told her mother, that she
dialog: would find out and leave in the middle
dialog: of the night... What’s wrong with her?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
text: She’s imagining things.
scene_heading: 60. INT. SHAHRIAR’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Without making any noise, Ahmad turns on the dim bedside lamp which is
text: near Lucie’s bed. He wants to gently wake Lucie up. He is still unsure
text: but without a choice, puts his hand on her shoulder and gently shakes
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Lucie...
text: Lucie opens her eyes and is surprised to see Ahmad next to her bed.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Sorry to wake you.. your mom is waiting
dialog: for you.
text: Lucie who it seems has just realized where she is, is staring at Ahmad
dialog: without saying anything.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She wanted to come and get you. I
dialog: asked her to not come, I promised I
dialog: would take you back. Come on, get up.
text: Lucie sits up.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Where’s your jacket?
text: Lucie has only now realized what is happening.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I won’t go. I don’t wanna go back
dialog: tonight.
text: Lucie’s pleas leave Ahmad less certain. He doesn’t know what to do.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Then I’1l call her and you can tell
dialog: her that you’ll go back tomorrow
dialog: morning, okay?
text: Lucie doesn’t respond. Ahmad leaves the room to get the phone. Lucie is
text: sitting on the edge of the bed by herself. Ahmad comes back with the
text: phone and dials a number and waits.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Marie-Anne? Hold on, please.
text: He gives the phone to Lucie and signals to her to speak.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Yes?... I’m staying here tonight.
text: She listens for a long time to the other end. From Lucie’s face, it is
text: clear that her mother is speaking relentlessly and perhaps threatening
text: her. Lucie still does not speak. Ahmad is worried and is looking at
text: her. Marie has said what she wanted to say and hangs up.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Why did you hang up?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: She did.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Let’s go.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Get out of bed. Let’s go talk.
scene_heading: 61. INT. SHAHRYAR’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Ahmad closes the kitchen door behind him. Lucie goes to the sink and
text: washes her face. Ahmad sits at the table and waits for her. Lucie sits
text: at the table opposite him.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I want you to listen carefully. I
dialog: don’t know how much you remember of
dialog: the last few months I was living with
dialog: your mother. Do you remember anything?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Uhum.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Do you remember the state I was in?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I was always feeling down. I wasn’t
dialog: working, I stopped going out, I just
dialog: didn’t want to exist anymore. So, when
dialog: your mom says that woman committed
dialog: suicide because she was depressed, I
dialog: can understand what it means. Even
text: with a young child...
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Did you often think of killing
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Yes, sometimes?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: You never thought of drinking
text: detergent in front of Lea and me to
dialog: die?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: What? No!
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: You think that a woman who goes to her
text: husband’s shop and downs a bottle of
text: detergent in front of her son and
dialog: collapses only means to die?
text: Ahmad is silent. Lucie is trying not to burst into tears as she did
dialog: earlier that day before finishing what she had to say.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Why didn’t she take pills and die in
dialog: her bed?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Look, we can spend the night imagining
dialog: things. But it’s all speculation.
dialog: We'll see Samir’s employee tomorrow.
dialog: She has things to tell you.
text: Lucie is struggling to maintain her composure. Ahmad is deep in
text: thought. There’s a brief silence between them.
scene_heading: 62. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MORNING
text: Fouad is dressed, he takes his toothbrush from among the other
text: toothbrushes and comes out of the bathroom.
scene_heading: 63. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Marie and Samir are in each other’s arms, lovingly.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Tell her I’ve left and she can come
dialog: back. It’s better if Fouad and I don’t
dialog: stay here for a while.
text: Marie pulls herself away from Samir’s embrace. Samir leaves the
text: kitchen. Marie remains alone in the kitchen
scene_heading: 64. INT. METRO CAR - DAY
text: Samir and his son are sitting next to each other towards the back of a
text: metro car. The metro approaches a station. Samir takes Fouad’s bag and
text: goes towards the exit door. Fouad is sitting stubbornly in his seat.
text: The door opens and Samir gets off assuming that Fouad is behind him.
text: Suddenly he realizes that Fouad has not gotten off. Scared, he quickly
text: returns to the car and runs towards Fouad.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Come on, let’s go!
text: Fouad is being stubborn. Samir takes his hand. Fouad resist but Samir
text: manages to take him out of the car by force and drags him over to the
dialog: wall for a serious talk.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What is that about? Why don’t you get
dialog: off? Look at me!
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I want to go back to Marie’s.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: We have to go home for now.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: You told me our home was there,
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Yes, but some things have changed.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: It’s because of the man who came?
text: Samir does not respond.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Because I misbehaved yesterday?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Why doesn’t Lucie like you?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Because she thinks I want to take her
text: mommy away from her.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: But she doesn’t like her mommy.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Of course she does. All children love
dialog: their mommies. Just like you miss your
dialog: mommy.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
text: But Mommy’s not home anymore.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Would you like to go see her? Do you
dialog: want to go to see her tomorrow?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: She scares me.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Your mommy?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
text: She’s dead.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Don’t say such things, Fouad. If she
dialog: was dead, they wouldn’t have kept her
text: in the hospital, with the machines.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: If they take them away, she’1ll die?
dialog: Why don’t they take them away?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Because we don’t know if she wants to
dialog: stay alive like this or if she wants
dialog: to die.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: She wants to die.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: She killed herself. It means that she
dialog: wanted to die.
text: Fouad’s words have upset Samir. He hug Fouad.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Sorry, Daddy.
scene_heading: 65. INT. SHAHRIAR’S RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Naima is seated at one of the tables in the restaurant. Her gaze
text: reveals her state of anxiety. Ahmad and Lucie are seated opposite her
text: and they watch her curiously.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Did his wife work there too?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: Yes, for a few days. Samir had brought
text: her to clear her head.
text: Naima takes the garment out from its cover and places it in front of
dialog: Ahmad and Lucie.
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: And that day, she had a fight with a
dialog: customer over this stain. The customer
dialog: said that the dress had been stained
dialog: at the cleaner’s. Samir’s wife said
dialog: no, it had it before it was brought in
dialog: to the cleaner’s.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: That’s all?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: To make things better, I told her to
dialog: leave the dress and come and get it
dialog: the next day. The customer said that
dialog: the next day would be too late,
dialog: because the dress belonged to a guest
dialog: of the hotel where she worked and the
dialog: guest was catching a flight that
dialog: afternoon. She said we had a couple of
dialog: hours to get the stain out.. and I said
dialog: okay... Suddenly Celine started
dialog: screaming at me, saying it wasn’t for
dialog: me to say, that this dress had the
dialog: stain before we got it and it’s not
dialog: our problem. The customer started
text: yelling and even cursed. Samir’s wife
dialog: got upset and threw the dress on the
dialog: sidewalk. I didn’t know what to do..
dialog: They pushed each other around a bit,
dialog: and the customer decided to call the
dialog: police.. So I asked her to let me leave
dialog: so that when the police comes, I
dialog: wouldn’t be there...
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You work illegally?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: Yes. But Céline said “you have to stay
dialog: and tell the police that when you got
dialog: the dress, it was already stained”. So
dialog: I called Samir without her seeing me
dialog: to and asked him to come quickly. When
dialog: he came and heard the story, he got
dialog: very angry with his wife and said
dialog: sorry to the customer and said he’d
dialog: pay for the dress. He asked her to
dialog: call the police and tell them that the
dialog: issue was resolved. The customer said
dialog: she'd do it only if his wife
dialog: apologized to her. And then Celine
dialog: started screaming and yelling at me
dialog: saying I had no right to call Samir
dialog: behind her back. I didn’t say
dialog: anything. I just took my purse to
dialog: leave, but Samir came and took my
dialog: hand, like this... He said I had to
dialog: stay. Instead, he asked his wife to
text: leave. In front of the customer, in
dialog: front of me, he threw her out.. and I
dialog: stayed.
text: Now all three are quiet. Upset, Ahmad looks at the stain at the back of
text: the dress and Lucie stares at Naima who is upset.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: How many days before her suicide was
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: I think four or five days... Can I go?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Thank you.
text: Naima gets up. She takes the dress, says goodbye and leaves. Ahmad gets
text: up and accompanies her to the door. Lucie is still seated, lost in
text: thought. Ahmad returns to the table.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: That’s what depression’s like. Small
dialog: things can suddelnly set you off.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: (on the verge of
dialog: tears)
dialog: The day before her suicide, I
dialog: forwarded her all the love letters my
dialog: mom and Samir had emailed each other.
text: Ahmad is astonished. He is looking in disbelief at Lucie who has now
text: revealed her secret and does not even have the energy to cry. There is
text: silence between them.
scene_heading: 66. EXT. SHAHRYAR’S RESTAURANT - SIDEWALK - DAY
text: Lucie exits the restaurant. They stand on the sidewalk together, she is
text: upset and looking at Ahmad.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What are you going to do now?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I'll go to Brussels.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Don’t be silly. You won’t last a
dialog: minute there. You have to go back to
dialog: your mom's.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I can’t wake up every morning and face
dialog: the guy whose wife is dead because of
dialog: me!I can’t look his son in the eyes.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Come sit down.
text: Ahmad seats Lucie down on the chair in front of the restaurant. He sits
text: opposite her.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Do you want me to help you?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: You're not going to tell my mom...
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Listen...
text: Lucie gets up.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: No, I don’t want her to know.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Sit down!
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I shouldn’t have told you.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Hold on, listen.. You either keep this
dialog: to yourself and suffer for the rest of
dialog: your life, or you talk to your mom.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: What'd that chage?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It might change her decision to marry
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: He decision’s made, she’s pregnant.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: What if she finds out about this after
dialog: her child is born? Then, it’d really
dialog: be too late.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: If I'd felt like telling her, I
dialog: would’ve done it.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: It’s not about you feeling like it or
dialog: not. You have to ask yourself if it is
dialog: important for your mother. She has the
dialog: right to know.
scene_heading: 67. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Marie is busy putting away the groceries. From the hallway, Ahmad
text: quietly stands in the kitchen doorway. Marie doesn’t notice his

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You’re here?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I was upstairs with Lucie.
text: Ahmad comes into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: How was your meeting?
speaker_heading: AHMAD

speaker_heading: MARIE
text: With Samir’s employee.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Yeah. It was fine.
speaker_heading: LEA

text: Ahmad helps Marie put away the groceries.
speaker_heading: AHMAD

speaker_heading: MARIE

speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: How did she know, then?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Did she know?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Yes
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe she reads your
dialog: emails.
dialog: (showing a bottle)
dialog: Where do you keep this?
text: Marie takes the bottle of dishwashing liquid from Ahmad to put it ina
text: cupboard. Ahmad’s words have peaked her curiosity.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Did something happen?
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Shall we go for a walk?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No, I’m tired. What’s the matter,
dialog: Ahmad?
text: Ahmad goes to the door to close it so that they may speak in private.
text: Ahmad sits down.

text: Marie sits down opposite him. Marie is staring at him,
scene_heading: INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS ROOM - DAY
text: Lea is sitting next to Lucie on the edge of the bed. A brief silence
text: Lea looks at Lucie’s worried face.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: You want to go live with Dad?

speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: I£ you go, I’1l come with you.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: You have to stay here with Mom.
speaker_heading: LEA
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: I want to be with you.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: It’s not a good idea.
speaker_heading: LEA
dialog: Dad’s wife is a bit weird.
text: There is silence between them. Ahmad calls Lucie from downstairs.
text: Worried, Lucie gets up and leaves the room. Lea is watching her.
scene_heading: 69. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - KITCHEN - BACKYARD - DAY
text: In the hallway, before Lucie comes into the kitchen, Ahmad quietly
text: gestures to Lucie no to be worried and that her mother only wants to
text: speak with her. Lucie goes towards the kitchen. Marie is standing like
text: a zombie in the backyard behind the kitchen and smoking a cigarette.
text: Lucie slowly walks in and stands in a corner of the kitchen. She is
text: looking at her mother. A heavy silence. Marie realizes Lucie is in the
text: kitchen. She comes back inside. She is consumed by anger, her hands are
text: shaking with rage.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Is what Ahmad said true?
text: Lucie nods. Marie suddenly loses control and lunges towards her. She
text: has burst into tears, she takes Lucie by the arms and shakes her
text: violently while crying and screaming at her.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Why did you do that to me? What did I
dialog: ever do to you?
text: Lucie shows no reaction. She too is crying. She does not defend herself
text: against her mother’s beating. It is clear that she is feeling sorry for
text: Marie. Ahmad who has heard the commotion, rushes into the kitchen to
text: separate Lucie from her mother’s grip. Marie is too angry to let Lucie
text: go. He manages to free Lucie and pulls Marie to a corner of the
text: kitchen. Lea has also come down and is witnessing this fight. Marie
text: suddenly starts punching her own stomach. Ahmad holds her hands to
dialog: prevent her from doing this.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Stop it, Marie! Calm down!
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You little shit!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Marie! Easy...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Get your hands off me!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You promised not to do that.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to Lucie)
dialog: Get out of this house! Get out!
text: Again Marie tries to lunge at Lucie. Ahmad struggles to stop her and
text: sends Lucie out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: (to Lucie)
dialog: Go.
text: Marie aimlessly walks around the kitchen. Ahmad comes towards her to
dialog: try and calm her down.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: She’s in enough pain. I asked her to
dialog: tell you. She could’ve stopped me from
dialog: talking to you. I could’ve asked her
dialog: to keep the secret. You’d have
dialog: preferred not to know anything for the
dialog: rest of your life?
text: Marie suddenly lashes out at Ahmad.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Will you shut up!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Remember you’re the one who wrote
dialog: those emails. She only forwarded them.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I don’t want to hear you. I hate it

speaker_heading: AHMAD

speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I’m not lecturing you! You asked me to
dialog: come here and talk to Lucie!
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (screaming and

dialog: Fuck off! I didn’t ask you here for
dialog: Lucie! I asked you to come here after
dialog: four years just to sign that fucking

dialog: forever!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: Listen. Why didn’t you ask me to come
dialog: last year? Why do I have to be here in

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Screw you.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: without even knowing you’ re

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Read your emails!
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: And you didn’t book me a hotel. And
dialog: you made me sleep next to his son.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I sent you an your email...
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You made me come here just to get

speaker_heading: MARIE

speaker_heading: SHAHRYAR

scene_heading: 78. INT. SAMIR’S HOUSE - DAY
text: A small house located above the dry cleaner’s with windows facing the
dialog: street. It is clear that life has not flowed in this house for some
text: time and everything is a mess. From the vanity drawer, Samir takes out
text: the half-full perfume bottles belonging to his wife. Marie is standing
text: a bit further away.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What’s all this?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Her perfumes. I’m taking them to the
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
text: A silence ensues.

text: Samir places the perfume bottles on the table. Marie
text: perfumes. She takes one of them and looks at it.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: That is your cologne...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: She liked it.
text: something suspicious in Marie’s expression.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Why don’t you sit?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I have to go.
text: Marie is not feeling like she usually does. He is waiting for her to
dialog: speak.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I don’t like it when hide your
dialog: feelings.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I’m not hiding anything.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You mean you are not happy?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Is it not good news that there is
dialog: still hope that she can react to
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What do you want me to say?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You're stuck between your wife and me.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You ralized that overnight?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I’ve felt it for a long time.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You didn’t say things like that until
dialog: last week.
text: The weight of Samir’s coment sinks in.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I always felt it but I wasn’t brave
dialog: enough to tell you earlier. Maybe I
dialog: wasn’t sure of what I felt.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What do you feel?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: That I am only here to fill the
dialog: void left by your wife.
text: Samir is hurt by Marie. A brief silence.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Whose void am I supposed to fill in
dialog: your life?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (upset)
dialog: No one’s.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I’m not here to make up for your
dialog: failed marriage ?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: If that was the case, I wouldn’t be
dialog: carrying your child.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: That was an accident.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I could’ve not kept it.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You kept it because you wanted to
dialog: erase that man, to convince yourself
dialog: that it was over, that you’d turned
dialog: the page and you were starting
text: something new with someone else. But
dialog: the problem is that you're still not
dialog: convinced. Otherwise, you wouldn’t
dialog: have brought him home, you’d have let
text: him go to a hotel.
text: Marie is staring at him.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Ever since he’s come back, you've
dialog: changed. I don’t even recognize you
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I feel this way because I’ve found out
dialog: why your wife...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Leave her out oh this, please.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: She knew...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You sound like your crazy daughter.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: If she’d known, she’d have said
dialog: something to me at some point.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: She never asked about me?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Ask what?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I don’t know. Why I came so often...
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: For her, you were just a customer.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What about you? Didn’t she suspect
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: No. I wish she had. At least, it’d
dialog: have meant she cared enough to try and
dialog: find out if there was someone else.
text: Marie is silent for a moment. Samir places the perfumes inside a box.
text: Marie gets up to walk towards the door.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Lucie sent her our emails.
text: Samir is shocked, staring at Marie. There is a heavy silence between
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: How'd she get her email?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Your wife gave it to her.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: But they never met...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Lucie called her at the shop and told
dialog: her she had emails we had sent each
dialog: other and that she wanted to forward
dialog: them. Your wife accepted.
text: Samir stares at Marie in disbelief. Again, there is silence between
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: When did she call her?
speaker_heading: MARIE
text: The day before her suicide.
text: Samir drops his gaze and stares at the perfumes. Marie leaves his
dialog: house.
scene_heading: 79, INT. DRY CLEANER’S - DAY
text: Samir enters the dry cleaner’s from the back door. He is preoccupied.
text: Naima is writing up an order for a customer. He waits for the customer
text: to leave. He is looking at Fouad who is still drawing in his notebook.
text: As soon as the customer leaves, he calls Naima.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Naima... come here a second.
text: Naima walks towards Samir.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: After the fight with Celine... you
dialog: know, when I asked her to go... did
dialog: she ever come by the shop when I was
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: No
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What about when she wanted to go
dialog: upstairs? Would she pass through
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: I didn’t see her the last few days.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: She was always up there?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: She only came down the day it
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Not the day before?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Someone says that they called here and
dialog: talked to my wife.
text: A costumer comes and Naima goes to her.
scene_heading: 80. EXT. STREET OPPOSITE PHARMACY - INT. PHARMACY - DAY
text: Upset, Marie is filling the prescription for a customer. She spots
text: Samir who is waiting for her outside the pharmacy. She quickly gets the
text: prescription for the customer and sends her to the register to pay. She
text: comes out of the pharmacy. Her co-worker who is ringing up the
text: customer, is frustrated with Marie’s sloppy work. She glances outside
text: and sees Marie and Samir talking.
scene_heading: 81. INT. MARIE’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A small lamp is on. Marie is lying on her bed by herself and she is
text: staring out into space. The door gently opens. Lucie comes in. Marie
text: realizes Lucie is there but shows no reaction. Lucie comes towards the
text: bed. She pulls the blanket to the side and lies down next to her mother
text: who has her back towards her. She pulls the blanket over herself. For a
text: moment, they lie like this side by side. Lucie turns towards her
text: mother. She holds her from behind. Marie takes her hand and presses it
text: to her chest.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I’m sorry, Mom.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Promise not to lie to me again.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: When did I lie to you?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: When you say you’d forwarded the
dialog: emails.
text: Lucie is shocked at hearing this but she does not respond. From her
text: look, it is clear that she is debating whether to speak or to remain
dialog: silent.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You promise?
text: Lucie remains silent.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Why do you think it was a lie?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Because she wasn’t at the shop the day
dialog: before her suicide.
text: Again Lucie is silent. She lets go of her mother and turns onto her
text: back. She stares at the ceiling. Marie is surprised at her reaction and
text: turns her head towards her. She looks at Lucie. Lucie speaks in
text: response to Marie’s inquisitive gaze.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: I spoke to her.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LUCIE
dialog: Yes. She had an accent.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: His wife is French.

scene_heading: 82. INT. DRYCLEANER’S - EXT. SIDEWALK - MORNING
text: Samir is waiting for Naima to arrive, it is clear that he is extremely
text: upset and angry. A brief moment passes. Naima enters.
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: ‘Morning.
text: Naima goes to the back, takes off her jacket and hangs it up along with
text: her purse. Samir stands opposite her and stares into her eyes. Naima is
dialog: worried,
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Why did you do it?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Why did you pretend to be my wife and
dialog: gave her email?
text: Naima is scared. She does not react. Samir is angry, still waiting for
dialog: her to answer.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
text: Naima is silent.
dialog: Fouad,
dialog: just woken
dialog: I’m not asking for an apology. I’m
dialog: asking why!
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: She didn’t like me.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: She hated me.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Had you done something?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Then why did she hate you?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: She thought there was something going
dialog: on between us.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: She thought that? Why would she?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Why would she think that?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: Because you hired me even though I was
dialog: illegal.. she was suspicious.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Did she say anything to you?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Where are you getting this crap then?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: She was always after me, so I
dialog: thought...
text: up, has opened the back door and come inside.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You thought?... Get out. She never
dialog: asked me to fire you.
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: But she kept doing things to get you
dialog: to fire me..
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: Lots of things.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What kind of things?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: The day of the fight, the customer
dialog: called the police, she wouldn’t let me
dialog: leave, she wanted me to stay.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: She wanted the police to find out
dialog: about me.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: That’s it? That’s why she’s ina
dialog: coma?... Get out.
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: That dress.. I took it out of the
dialog: machine. I took it, I ironed it, I
dialog: wrapped it up... there was no stain!
dialog: She made the stain, I’m sure. I’ve
dialog: been here for a year, I’ve never seen
dialog: a stain like that.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: How much do I owe you?
text: Again Naima does not respond. Samir comes to the counter. He takes out
text: some money from his pocket. He puts several bills on the counter and
text: goes out to the sidewalk. Fouad is staring at Naima who is upset and
text: walks towards her jacket and purse.
scene_heading: 83. EXT. DRYCLEANER’S - SIDEWALK - DAY
text: Samir is on the sidewalk. He is clearly upset. Carrying her purse on
text: her shoulder, Naima comes out of the drycleaner’s. For a moment she
text: pauses, then goes back towards the Samir.
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: I wanted her to know there was nothing
dialog: between us. You were always upset,
dialog: thinking about someone else , she
dialog: thought it was me. The day of the
dialog: fight, you asked me to stay, you took
dialog: my hand and you asked her to leave. I
dialog: saw her eyes for a second, I knew what
dialog: she was thinking.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Because of what you did, this kid’s
dialog: mother has been a vegetable in a
dialog: hospital bed for the past eight
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: It’s not because of what I did.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You gave her email to that brat.
speaker_heading: NAIMA
dialog: If she had read the emails, she would
dialog: have understood everything. Why’d she
dialog: have come and drunk the detergent in
dialog: front of me? She’d have gone to the
dialog: pharmacy and killed herself in front
dialog: of her. Or upstairs, in front of you.
dialog: Why in front of me?
text: Samir has no response. Sad, Naima walks off and grows small in the
text: distance. Samir is even more frustrated than before.
scene_heading: 84. INT. DRY CLEANER’S - DAY
text: Samir reenters the shop. He closes the front door. He moves to the back
text: of the shop and walks through the racks of clothing. From among the
text: clothes, he finds the dress Naima was talking about. He brings it down.
text: He takes its cover off. He searches for the stain, looks at it
text: carefully and smells it.
scene_heading: 85. INT. SAMIR’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Samir and Fouad are in the bathroom. Fouad is sitting on the edge of

dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Naima.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: No
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: She did something wrong.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: But she said sorry.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Some things are unforgivable.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Like what?
text: Samir doesn’t know how to explain what's happening to Fouad. He just
text: looks at him. He holds up his other hand and continues to clip his
text: nails. He sees the band-aid on his finger.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: What happened to your finger?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: Nothing.
text: Samir takes off the band-aid.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I want to go back to Lea’s.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: We can’t go for now.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: When then?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Not as long as we don’t know about
dialog: Mommy.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: When will we know?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I get bored here by myself.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Why don’t you come down to see me?
speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: I don’t like it downstairs.
text: Samir looks down and continues clipping his nails. It is clear that he
text: is trying to hide the tears he feels after what Fouad has said.
scene_heading: 86. INT. PHARMACY - EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
text: Samir walks along the sidewalk. He reaches the pharmacy. Without
text: stopping, he sneaks a peak inside the pharmacy. Marie is busy filling
text: the prescription for an old male customer. Samir passes the pharmacy,
text: and turns onto the next street. He stops a few yards away. He paces
text: back and forth for a bit. He is hesitant. He goes back the same way he
text: came, this time without looking inside the pharmacy. He goes back
text: towards the drycleaner’s. He ears Marie’s voice from behind him.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Samir!

speaker_heading: FOUAD
dialog: And then I’1l go with Marie?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Go get your things. Make a drawing for
dialog: Mommy, ok?
text: Samir accompanies Fouad to the back door. Fouad leaves. Marie sits on a
text: chair by the counter.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Do you think she got our emails?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: If she’d read them, she would’ve at
dialog: least said something to you.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Since the fight with the customer,
dialog: we'd stopped speaking. It lasted until
dialog: the end.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Even if she’d read them, yesterday you
dialog: said she wouldn’t have cared.
text: Samir is silent.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Would she have cared?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: Maybe.I don’t know. I’d rather talk
dialog: about now. That was then. It’s over.
dialog: What I know now is that you're
dialog: carrying our child. We just have to
dialog: forget.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Is that possible?
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: It should be.
speaker_heading: MARIE

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It still hurts a bit.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: You went to see a doctor?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It’s normal. It’s the lack of calcium.
text: The baby’s taking it all.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: How far along are you?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: A bit more than two months.
speaker_heading: AHMAD

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: AHMAD

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It’s pointless now.
speaker_heading: AHMAD
dialog: I want to explain why I didn’t...
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: No.. I don’t want to look back anymore.

speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: None?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: None that I registered.
speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: You mean the scratches on her stomach,

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Possibly. As I told you, these tests

speaker_heading: SAMIR
dialog: But she’d never scratched herself

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I really can’t say. The nurses may
