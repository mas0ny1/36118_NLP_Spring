scene_heading: ROLL CREDITS - DRIFTERS
text: Soon the silhouette of a PLANET fills the screen -
text: The sun breaks slowly across the arc of the planet -
speaker_heading: END CREDITS -
text: As the light increases we see the planet is EARTH -
text: A TITLE reads "EARTH - 2070 A.D."
text: Soon afterward the moon can be seen in the distance -
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE(V.O.)
dialog: Ahh, the space age. Must have been
text: a thrilling time to be alive. All
dialog: the hopes for a better tomorrow, all
dialog: the dreams of inhabiting new worlds...
text: Soon a SPACESHIP enters the frame - only the rear of the craft is visible at first
text: as it heads into space -
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE(V.O.)
dialog: It's amazing they even made it out
dialog: this far, considering what they had
dialog: to work with. Guess it really was
dialog: one giant leap...a hundred years ago.
text: Soon the side of the ship becomes more and more visible -
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE(V.O.)
dialog: But I guess after that first leap,
dialog: things just weren't as exciting.
dialog: How much do you need to know about
dialog: a place like the moon? It's cold,
dialog: silent...
text: The camera begins to PAN the side of the ship -
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE(V.O.)
dialog: But it sure was a beautiful place to
dialog: visit, or so they said. At least if
dialog: you could afford it...guess it all
text: boils down to money in the long run -
text: As the camera PANS across the side of the ship, we see it's name - STAR PRINCESS ,
dialog: written in a slick, commercial
dialog: style -
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE(V.O.)
dialog: Me, I just felt lucky to be along
dialog: for the ride.
scene_heading: INT SPACESHIP LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: We see DAWN MURPHY, an attractive girl in her late 20's gazing out the window of
dialog: the lounge -
text: Just then MAC, a fully articulated human android, dressed in a futuristic,
text: concierge-like outfit, approaches Dawn -
text: She turns to face him, and his eye scans a small, computerized PIN on her jacket -
text: he looks up to her -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: How are you this evening, Dawn
dialog: Murphy?
text: Dawn smiles at the android, looks around as if a little embarrassed, then looks
text: back out the window -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Congratulations on your...recent
dialog: award.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Is there anything I can help
dialog: you with?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: No, just enjoying the view.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Well, there's no better to way
dialog: to see the world, than with us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: So I've been told.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Well if you need anything, please
dialog: feel free to ask me. Just a
dialog: reminder we have fabulous cuisine
dialog: available 24 hours in the earthrise
text: room, and a large selection of
dialog: vintage wines here in our ship bar.
text: Dawn then looks at Mac -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Thank you, I'm fine.
text: Mac smiles at Dawn -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Enjoy your trip with us.
text: Mac then heads off - Dawn turns and looks at him -
text: We see the lounge of the ship - sleek and luxurious, decorated in rich fabrics and
text: material - behind the bar we see the bartender JACK, a burly man in his 40's,
dialog: cleaning some glasses -
text: Mac walks by a table where a couple is sitting - they are DELBERT MILES, 49, an
text: overweight man with slicked back hair and a gaudy ring on his hand - across from
text: him is MONICA MILES, 22, a buxom, somewhat bored-looking blonde brandishing an
text: enormous diamond WEDDING RING -
text: Delbert puts down his drink and grabs Mac as he passes -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Hey, chief...
text: Mac stops and looks at the couple, scanning the pins on their chests -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Hello, Delbert and Monica Miles.
dialog: Congratulations on your recent
dialog: wedding -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Yeah yeah look never mind all that,
dialog: (shakes his drink)
dialog: let me get another one of these, lots
dialog: of ice, and don't be stingy with
dialog: the whiskey this time ok?
text: Jack listens in the background to the conversation -
text: Mac then looks at Monica -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Certainly, and anything for you
dialog: Monica?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm fine, thank you.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Oh, and bring out some more of
dialog: those little baked things and
text: some hot mustard.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Certainly. I will now process
dialog: your request, and I hope you're
dialog: enjoying your trip with us.
text: Mac walks away - Monica stares into her drink -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I don't like him calling me by my
dialog: name, it gives me the creeps.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Yeah, I wish he'd put a sock in
dialog: it already.
text: Delbert downs the remainder of his drink - Monica looks sullenly into her glass -
text: Delbert notices this, puts his drink down -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: What's wrong baby? You haven't
dialog: said a whole lot lately...
text: Delbert picks up her hand and kisses it - Monica doesn't respond -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm homesick.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Homesick? It's only been two
dialog: days!
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: We should have gone to Nassau. At
dialog: least we could go swimming, lie on
dialog: the beach.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Ah hell we can always do that. Listen
dialog: believe me, once we get to the
dialog: moon, your tone is going to change.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: How is it going to be different
dialog: from this? Go see some boring
dialog: footprint under glass?
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Look you were the one who wanted
dialog: to do something different, something
dialog: to tell all your friends. Any
dialog: chump can go to Nassau.
text: Delbert scans the room, littered with the beautiful people of the times -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Look around you baby, we're rubbing
dialog: elbows with royalty, oil sheiks,
dialog: this is class. You'll be envied
dialog: by everyone.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Besides I can't wait to tee off
dialog: on the sea of tranquillity. That
dialog: should shore up that prick Hank
dialog: Drexler.
text: Monica stares blankly back at him -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: You know? The guy at the club I
dialog: was telling you about?
text: Monica takes a sip of her drink, and puts it down -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I still say we should have gone
dialog: to Nassau.
scene_heading: INT SHIP BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: PAN an array of blinking controls and sensors - seated at the console is the ship's
text: first mate, RYAN TAYLOR, a good-looking man in his 30's, examining them -
text: Soon the ship's captain approaches, CAPTAIN REYNOLDS, a distinguished-looking man
dialog: in his fifties -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: How's everything looking?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
text: Finishing up the diagnostic,
dialog: everything checks out normal,
dialog: we still have to take a look
text: at the starboard suite on B
dialog: deck. We've relocated her
text: and she doesn't seem to be
dialog: that upset about it.
text: Seated across the bridge, second mate ALEX BARNES turns and addresses them -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Why should she, it's her fault.
dialog: All guests are told not to eat
dialog: in zero gravity, but she just
dialog: wanted to have fun I guess,
dialog: didn't realize what a grain of
dialog: salt can do to sophisticated
dialog: machinery.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Well, I guess she figures she's
dialog: paying for it.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Ain't it the truth. Must be good
dialog: to be rich.
text: Reynolds takes a look at his watch -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: All right, I'm headed down to
dialog: engineering. If you gentlemen
dialog: need me, that's where I'll be.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yes sir.
text: Reynolds leaves the room -
text: Barnes then gets up and stretches -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well I guess there's no time
dialog: like the present. I'll go
dialog: run a check on that room, just
dialog: to show we go that extra mile
dialog: for our guests.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Sounds like you've been talking
dialog: to Mac too much.
text: Barnes heads toward the door -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Yeah. I think he's developing
dialog: a crush on me.
text: Taylor smiles as Barnes exits - he then turns his attention to a screen -
text: POV he cursors down to a command - "LIFE POD STATUS: ENGAGE"
dialog: We see him select that option -
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Two PORTERS struggle with the luggage of ANNA KOROS, the thirtysomething heir to a
dialog: shipping fortune, who follows behind -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Now look will you please be
dialog: careful with those! They cost
dialog: more than you make in a year.
text: The two porters look at each other as one unlocks the door -
text: Anna takes a CELLULAR phone out of her purse -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: When will my original room be
dialog: ready again?
speaker_heading: 1ST PORTER
dialog: I'm sure they'll notify you as
dialog: soon as they're done ma'am.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Shuffling back and forth! I feel
dialog: like I'm traveling coach!
text: She dials the phone from the hallway watching the two men enter the room -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Put them near the window!
dialog: And be careful!
text: Anna dials the phone and puts it to her ear - she then does a double take down the
dialog: hall -
text: POV We see an impeccably groomed, movie star handsome WARREN WAYNE exit his
text: neighboring suite room and lock the door -
text: Anna's jaw drops as she slowly lowers the phone -
text: Wayne puts his key in his pocket and gracefully slicks his hand across his
text: perfectly combed hair before heading in the direction of Anna -
dialog: 
text: Anna watches him approach -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Oh my God...
text: Wayne approaches and smiles at Anna -
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Evening.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It can't be.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You're Warren Wayne.
text: Warren slows down, somewhat reluctantly -
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Uh, yes I am. And you are?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Anna Koros.
text: She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Koros, as in...Koros? Dimitri
dialog: Koros?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My grandfather. My God, I can't
dialog: tell you what a fan I am of yours!
dialog: You were magnificent in Deadly
dialog: Gamble.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Oh, thank you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Magnificent, magnificent.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well I appreciate that.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: So, what brings you out here?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Pleasure cruise?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well a little business too. In my
dialog: upcoming project Star Trackers I
dialog: play a ship's captain, and I really
dialog: wanted to get a feel for the outer
dialog: space experience. I feel it will
dialog: add more credibility to my performance.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Of course, of course...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well I guess we're neighbors for
dialog: this trip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well, so we are.
dialog: (Beat, gestures
dialog: towards window)
dialog: Sure is beautiful, huh?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (looking at Wayne)
dialog: It certainly is.
text: Wayne looks at Anna and smiles -
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well, it was nice meeting you.
dialog: Enjoy the rest of the trip.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm sure I will.
dialog: Wayne heads off -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm sure we'll see each other
dialog: again.
text: Wayne turns back and smiles -
text: As he turns away we see his smile vanish -
text: Just then the two porters exit the room -
speaker_heading: 1ST PORTER
dialog: You're all set ma'am. I'll
dialog: personally go and check on the
dialog: status of the old room right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You'll do nothing of the kind.
text: The two porters look at her as she heads toward the door -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm staying put, thank you very
dialog: much.
text: Anna then slams the door in the porter's face - the two men look at each other -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Camera approaches Barnes as he works on some circuitry in a open PANEL in the wall -
text: Quickly and methodically, Barnes works with some TOOLS - he then looks up and down
text: the length of the hallway before quickly taking a small METAL CASE out of his
dialog: pocket -
text: CLOSE on the case as he opens it - it contains a sophisticated series of CONNECTORS
text: attached to a dense white CUBE of what appears to be plastic explosive surrounded
dialog: by black metal -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Taylor continues running a check of the life pods onscreen -
text: Just then a command comes up - "FAIL MODE CONFIRMED: 96%"
text: The command seems to trouble Taylor, who faces the computer and enters some
text: commands - he pauses for a beat -
text: He sits back - once again, "FAIL MODE CONFIRMED: 96%"
text: Taylor frowns at the command - he presses a button on his wrist watch -
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Barnes begins to carefully cross-install the device in the case onto the equipment
text: in the circuit panel - soon his watch beeps -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(V.O.)
dialog: Hey Barnes.
text: Barnes stops working for a beat, then answers his watch -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Yeah go.
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Taylor looks at the monitor -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I'm getting a very strange command
dialog: on the life pod status check. Did
dialog: anything come up on the last
dialog: diagnostic?
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Barnes seems angry at the news - he shakes his head, bites his lip and quickly
dialog: removes the few wires he has attached -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: No, I just ran it! Why are you
dialog: running it again?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(V.O.)
dialog: Well it's a good thing that I
dialog: did.
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Taylor looks at the screen -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It's telling me fail mode
dialog: confirmed. Did you see this?
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: There must be some mistake. You
dialog: sure you hit the right commands?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yes I'm sure I hit the right
dialog: commands.
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Why don't you reset and run it
text: again. The pods check out ok.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(V.O.)
dialog: You're certain of that?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Trust me.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Even checked 'em with my own
dialog: eyes.
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: All right, I'll give it a shot.
text: Taylor presses the button on his watch and resets the commands -
text: Just then Dawn Taylor enters the bridge - Taylor turns and faces her -
text: The two look at each other for a beat -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: They said it would be ok to come
dialog: up here.
text: Taylor gets up and approaches - Dawn extends her hand -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: I'm Dawn Murphy.
dialog: They shake hands -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Oh right, right you're on that
dialog: research grant.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Ryan Taylor, first mate. Welcome
dialog: aboard. First time in space?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside,
dialog: there's nothing like the real thing.
dialog: How about you?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: This is my second commercial flight.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I used to run satellite freighters
dialog: but that got old fast.
text: Dawn looks around the bridge -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: So you were looking for a new
dialog: challenge.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well, plus the money ain't that
dialog: bad.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: So, tell me, do you think everyone
dialog: gets their million dollars' worth
dialog: on this trip of a lifetime?
text: Taylor and Dawn look at each other and smile -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well, let me put it this way. Most
dialog: of the cost is due to safety reasons.
dialog: Most people are not familiar with
dialog: space travel, so we have to take
dialog: extra precautions in the event they
dialog: do something careless.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Like open an airlock by mistake?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well I don't think there's a
dialog: chance of that happening. It's
dialog: usually the moon walks. Sometimes
dialog: you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Well I hope I don't do anything
dialog: careless.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I'm sure you'll be all right.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Actually I've logged about 200
dialog: hours of simulated space walking
dialog: at the institute, mostly related
text: to starship construction.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Still, I hope I behave on the
dialog: moon.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I'll stick close to you.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well then you'll have nothing to
dialog: worry about at all.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You're dealing with a trained
dialog: professional. I guess.
text: Dawn and Taylor smile at one another -
scene_heading: INT LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the table where Delbert and Monica were sitting - the table is strewn with
text: balled-up NAPKINS, PEANUT SHELLS, CRUMBS, TOOTHPICKS, SMEARED MUSTARD, and EMPTY
speaker_heading: GLASSES -
text: Carlo looks at the table with disgust, and shakes his head -
text: Jack approaches Carlo in the now desolate lounge - Carlo moves the glasses and then
text: folds up the entire tablecloth -
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: Look at this...Jesus.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, I guess money don't buy
dialog: class.
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: No. But it buys a lot of other
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Like that piece of ass he was
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: Well...I don't mind. I can put
dialog: up with it. I'm taking six months
dialog: off after this, and I won't have
dialog: to deal with people snapping their
dialog: fingers at me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not me. I'm in for the long haul.
dialog: In nine months I'll have enough to
dialog: take a few years off.
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: Well, more power to you. Me, I
dialog: start to bug out after too much time
dialog: out here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't have a problem with it.
dialog: Besides, you get to meet a lot
dialog: of interesting people.
text: Carlo holds up the tablecloth -
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: Yeah. A virtual pantheon of
dialog: stars.
text: Carlo walks off - Jack watches him -
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, it's early yet.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Various groups of well dressed individuals sit amongst various tables in the posh
dialog: dining room -
text: At one table Capt. Reynolds sits with Dawn and some other guests -
text: Delbert Miles shoves a forkful of food in his mouth -
text: Just then CARLO, a mild - mannered waiter in his 30's, approaches Delbert from
dialog: behind -
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: More wine sir?
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Yeah.
text: Carlo begins to carefully pour a glassful - Delbert takes the bottle out of his
text: hand and proceeds to fill the glass to the brim -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Just leave the bottle.
text: Carlo watches for a beat - Delbert puts the bottle down and looks at Carlo -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Don't worry I'll take care of
dialog: you at the end of the night.
text: Next to Delbert, Monica picks at her food - next to her, a wealthy Arab OIL BARON
text: peripherally ogles her cleavage -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oh no...I think there's carrots
dialog: in here...
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Send it back if you don't want
dialog: it.
text: Delbert looks at Carlo -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: She's allergic to carrots. Is
dialog: there carrots in that?
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: Uh, I don't believe so, no, but
dialog: I can -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Yeah go check it out. I don't
dialog: need her turning purple on me,
dialog: though it would match her
dialog: dress.
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Go to hell.
text: Carlo nods, and walks away -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I'm just kidding baby.
text: Across the table Warren Wayne smiles as he listens to the conversation, and wipes
text: the corner of his mouth with his napkin -
text: Just then Anna appears from out of nowhere and props up a chair -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: So...
text: Wayne looks at her as she looks him directly in the eye, after having had a few
dialog: drinks -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What was it like doing a love
dialog: scene with Pamela Jarvis?
text: The others listen to the conversation -
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well, uh, I just don't know what
dialog: to say...
dialog: (Beat, nervous laugh)
dialog: I guess there's worse ways to
dialog: make a living.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I did a love scene once for an
text: interactive instructional disc.
dialog: The guy had B.O. and I told him
dialog: so. Next day he wore so much
dialog: cologne I almost threw up.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Oh. Really?
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Why don't you tell them the good
dialog: side?
text: Monica looks at Delbert, then at the others -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: That's where I met Delbert. He
dialog: came down to the set, then he
dialog: wanted me on more discs, then he
dialog: put me in the magazine.
dialog: (giggles)
dialog: Then he married me!
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well, see? It wasn't so bad
dialog: after all.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I bet Pamela had nothing bad to say
dialog: about you.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: No, I think hygiene is important.
dialog: It helps you get into the part.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Very professional of you.
text: Dawn sits and talks to Captain Reynolds - the conversation is inaudible over the
text: din - just then Reynolds checks his watch and says "excuse me" to Dawn - he stands
dialog: up -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Excuse me ladies and gentlemen,
dialog: can I have your attention please?
text: The people at the table turn and face Reynolds - the din gets quieter -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Could I have your attention
dialog: please?
text: The voices die down in the room -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: On behalf of myself and the crew,
dialog: I'd like to welcome you all aboard
dialog: the Star Princess. I guarantee
dialog: this will be a trip you will
dialog: never forget.
text: The others look at Reynolds - Delbert downs another drink -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: In approximately 36 hours we will
dialog: be landing 300 yards from the very
dialog: spot where the Apollo 12 lunar
dialog: module first set down in 1969.
dialog: From there you will be able to
dialog: leave the ship and be an eyewitness
dialog: to history. The actual flag, the
dialog: actual first footprint, all carefully
dialog: preserved for you to view. It's
dialog: going to be a tremendous experience,
dialog: and I'm glad all of you decided to
dialog: come along for the ride.
text: Reynolds smiles at the crowd and gestures to Mac -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Now many passengers want to know
dialog: the nuts and bolts of how we carry
dialog: out the operation. So for all you
dialog: technology fans I'm happy to
dialog: announce we have Mac on board.
dialog: Mac is our mobile automated concierge,
dialog: and has been programmed to have an
dialog: encyclopedic knowledge of every detail
dialog: of the ship's operations. He's here
dialog: to make you happy, so feel free to
dialog: ask him anything.
text: Mac smiles at the guests -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: So once again, thanks for coming
dialog: aboard, and enjoy your stay on
dialog: the star princess.
text: The sound of "here here" and clinking glasses is heard as Reynolds makes his way
dialog: out the room -
text: Just then Delbert nuzzles up to Monica and paws her -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: (slurring)
dialog: I'm horny.
text: Monica shoves his hands away -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Get your hands off of me!

dialog: Ain't it the truth.
text: The two say nothing for a beat -
text: Taylor leans back in his chair, yawns, and stretches -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: So, are you on for the next one?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I don't know. Everything's up
dialog: in the air at this point, no pun
dialog: intended.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Why, didn't they say?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well that hotel begins construction
dialog: in January, there's going to be a
dialog: lot of shuttle work.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You want to go back to shuttle work?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: It's steady, good benefits.
text: Barnes looks at Taylor -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You gotta think of your old age.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: That's very pragmatic of you,
dialog: Barnes.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: Taylor gets up -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Man, I'm hungry. I'm going to
dialog: call the steward, you want anything?.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Nah, I already ate.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Why don't you just go down there?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What, and leave you here all by
dialog: your lonesome?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Uh...
text: Barnes gestures to the consoles -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I think I can handle it.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well, maybe I will.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You sure you don't want anything?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: No. I'm all set. Thanks.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I can hardly wait.
text: Barnes watches Taylor as he exits -
text: The door closes - just then Barnes turns around and crouches underneath the console

speaker_heading: COMPUTER -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The door opens and Taylor walks in - he surveys the room -
text: Dawn approaches the bar - Taylor sees her -
text: Just then Mac approaches Taylor -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Officer Taylor, how are you
dialog: this evening?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Mac. What's shaking?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I don't understand.
text: Taylor heads to the bar -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You are currently stationed
dialog: for bridge duty at this time.
text: Taylor looks at Mac -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yes Mac I know that.
dialog: Taylor walks away -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Jeez...hall monitor.
text: Mac watches him leave, then heads over to another passenger offscreen -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes works feverishly on the computer keyboard -
text: A SCREEN appears, reading CREW LOCATION -
text: There is a list of crew members, starting with the captain -
text: A diagram of the ship appears - Barnes highlights the captain - the diagram
text: indicates the captain is located in his room -
dialog: Barnes smiles -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Nighty night, captain.
text: Barnes then highlights Taylor's name - the diagram indicates he is in the lounge
dialog: area -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Have one on the house for me.
scene_heading: INT REYNOLDS' ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the PIN on Reynolds' jacket, hanging from a
speaker_heading: HANGER -
text: Reynolds walks over to a chair dressed in his bathrobe - he lowers himself into the
text: chair and takes a book off the
dialog: table -
text: He then feels his head for a second, then puts the book down and goes over to his
text: uniform - he feels the pockets, shakes his head -
text: He looks around the room, and exits his quarters -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on a pair of READING GLASSES folded and lying on a counter - in the
dialog: background Barnes continues to work -
text: As we get closer top Barnes we see small beads of sweat on his forehead -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well...I suppose you can't have
dialog: your cake...
text: A screen then appears before Barnes - it reads:
scene_heading: "BEGIN RECONFIGURATION?"
text: Barnes pauses for a beat -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: ...without breaking a few eggs.
text: Barnes then hits "enter" - a 60 second COUNTDOWN begins on the screen -
dialog: 59...58...57...
dialog: Barnes sits back -
text: Suddenly the bridge door SLIDES OPEN -
dialog: Barnes SPINS his chair around -
text: Reynolds enters the bridge in his bathrobe, brandishing his key -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Why was this door locked?
text: Barnes stands up and stares at Reynolds -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Isn't it past your bed time, sir?
dialog: Reynolds approaches Barnes -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: What did you say to me?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: It's a little late for you to
dialog: be up.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Look answer my question!
text: Just then Reynolds spots the hybrid computer linked to the main system -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: What's going on here!
text: Reynolds storms over to the monitor -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: What the hell is that?
text: Barnes approaches from behind -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: That's mine. I was just having
dialog: a little fun.
text: Reynolds turns and looks incredulously at Barnes -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: A little fun? Have you lost it
dialog: Barnes! You realize how sensitive
dialog: this equipment is?
text: Barnes nods, and stares down Reynolds -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: All too well, captain.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Well shut it off at once!
text: Reynolds turns and looks at the computer as it counts down -
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: What's the meaning of this
dialog: countdown?
text: CLOSE on a SILENCED GUN appearing in Barnes' hand -
speaker_heading: BARNES(O.S.)
dialog: I can't tell you that...
text: CLOSE on Reynolds staring at the computer - Barnes approaches from behind -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: ...it's not on the agenda.
text: Just as Reynolds begins to turn around - BLAM! a bullet RIPS through his chest -
text: Reynolds stares at Barnes for a beat, then staggers back and collapses onto a
dialog: console -
text: BLAM! another blast - soon Reynolds hits the ground falling offscreen - Barnes
text: approaches him and BLAM! shoots again -
text: CLOSE on the COMPUTER - 15...14...13...12...
text: Barnes then aims at Reynolds' head offscreen - BLAM! Blood SPATTERS against the
dialog: wall -
text: CLOSE on Barnes face as he looks in the direction of the computer -
text: CLOSE on the computer: 5...4...3...2...1...
speaker_heading: CLOSE on Barnes -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Blastoff.
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: Suddenly -
text: BOOOMMMM!! A blinding flash fills the corridor -
scene_heading: EXT SHIP - NIGHT
text: An explosion RIPS through the outside of the ship - huge chunks scatter from the
dialog: heat of the fireball -
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Terrified passengers grab on to handrails for dear life as they are sucked into
dialog: space -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The room shudders violently - people scream as bottles fly across the room, glass
text: breaks, lights flicker -
text: Terrified passengers run toward the exit -
speaker_heading: EXT SHIP -
text: Suddenly a CHAIN reaction of explosions send a series of LIFE PODS scattering into
dialog: space -
scene_heading: INT LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: The drop in pressure sends debris hurling around the room, violently slamming into
dialog: passengers -
scene_heading: INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: An EXPLOSION sends ovens, overhead fixtures and boiling cauldrons CRASHING DOWN,
text: killing the cooks, all screaming in vain -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor fights to get his bearings - he runs to the dining room door but it SHUTS
dialog: rapidly -
scene_heading: INT ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Several ENGINEERS scramble to get out as an EXPLOSION rips through the room -
text: A burst PIPE spews toxic gas into the room - the engineers struggle to breathe,
text: clawing at the doors -
scene_heading: EXT SHIP - NIGHT
text: A few scattered explosions occur around the now severely disabled craft which
text: drifts erratically through the void -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Moaning and groaning can be heard throughout the darkened, smoky room -
text: Taylor looks around, surveying the damage -
text: He sees Dawn hunched in the corner, coughing - he rushes over to her -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Are you all right?
text: Dawn looks up at Taylor -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: I don't know. I guess so.
text: Taylor addresses his wrist communicator -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Bridge?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Captain?!
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Hello Bridge!
text: Taylor taps the device - he then rushes over to the INTERCOM on the wall, bangs it
dialog: with his fist -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Bridge!
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Bridge, do you copy!
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes scans a DIAGRAM of the ship on the screen, noting which sections are still
dialog: functioning -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(V.O.)
dialog: Bridge! Can anyone hear me?!
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute
dialog: here.
text: Barnes looks at the diagram and smiles faintly -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: A little sloppy. But it will do.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor speaks into the intercom -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: If anyone can hear me please
dialog: respond!
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: That's very professional sounding
dialog: of you, Taylor.
text: Taylor looks around the room -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on a small MONITOR with a wide view of the dining
dialog: room -
text: Barnes speaks into a small MICROPHONE on the console -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: We hope you're enjoying your trip.
dialog: And we apologize to those currently
dialog: hurtling through space. Guess them's
text: the breaks.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM -
text: Carlo looks around the smoky room apprehensively, then looks at Taylor -
text: Taylor looks at Carlo -
text: Dawn looks at Taylor, who speaks into the intercom -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Barnes, can you hear me, are you
dialog: all right?
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for
dialog: asking. You don't have to talk to
dialog: the intercom, I can hear you fine.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What is the condition of the bridge?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: The bridge is fine, Taylor, how
dialog: are things down there?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Transmit the code 3 emergency and
dialog: take us offline. Override the
dialog: airlock sensors and hurry! We're
dialog: running out of time, we have to get
dialog: to the pods!
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Much as I'd like to help you and
dialog: our valued guests, I'm afraid I
dialog: can't.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What are you talking about!
dialog: Can you transmit the code 3 -
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Yes I can transmit the code 3
dialog: emergency!
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I just don't think it's a prudent
dialog: move at this juncture.
text: Dawn approaches Taylor with a worried look on her face -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: What's he talking about?
text: Taylor looks at Dawn, then back toward the room -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Barnes have you flipped your wig?
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes gets closer to the mike to be emphatic -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: It's a weave, Taylor, and you
dialog: know that. We've always been
text: straight with one another.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Now do you want the good news
dialog: first or the bad news?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You better start making sense!
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Ok, I will. The bad news is the
dialog: ship is history. Life support will
dialog: last another 36 hours, maybe.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Then we've got to get to the
dialog: lifepods!
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I'd advise you to shut up and
dialog: let me finish Taylor. You
dialog: needn't worry about the lifepods
dialog: because they're all gone,
dialog: jettisoned. Save for one.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The people in the room react to this news -
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: And I think we know who's getting
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Why are you doing this!
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: I was getting to that. Now please
dialog: don't try my patience Ryan.
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Now we're all businessmen and a
dialog: common rule of business is to
dialog: make payment for services rendered.
dialog: Given that, I'm willing to provide
dialog: a service to each and every one
dialog: of you.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: I'm willing to transmit that code 3
dialog: emergency. If you're lucky a rescue
dialog: team might just get to you in time.
dialog: Of course by then I'll be long gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: In exchange for what!
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Well Carlo, you're not really part
dialog: of the equation...
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: But those other high rollers around
dialog: you are. I will provide this
dialog: service in return for the personal
dialog: authorization codes of each and every
dialog: bank account. Once I have those
dialog: codes, and I've completed the
dialog: transfer, I'll signal the alarm. But
dialog: not a minute before.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor listens to this as Delbert approaches -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: What the hell is he talking about?
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: What part didn't you understand, fat
dialog: man? It's a hold up, pure and simple.
dialog: I want your money. Cooperate and I'll
dialog: let you live. And this offer is non-
dialog: negotiable.
text: Dawn walks over to Taylor -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAWN
text: It doesn't make any sense.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: (to Barnes)
dialog: It's suicide Barnes! How do you
dialog: think you're going to get away
dialog: it!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: They'll track him down in a
dialog: heartbeat.
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: I understand your concern, but
dialog: those are my problems, not yours.
dialog: But for the record, the transfer
dialog: trail will take them years to follow.
dialog: By then it won't matter, because I
dialog: won't exist, at least not on paper.
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Why would we give you anything
dialog: without a guarantee of our safety!
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Well, I guess that's just a
dialog: question of faith, huh? Of
dialog: course, if money means more
dialog: to you than a chance at survival...
dialog: I'd say you're my kind of
dialog: guy!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It's still not going to work!
dialog: They'll detect you upon re-entry
dialog: in an emergency vessel!
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Who said I'll re-enter in the pod?
dialog: I got friends out in space, Ryan,
dialog: friends willing to get me back
dialog: unnoticed. Thank God for deregulation
dialog: huh?
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Now I think I've given you all
dialog: the information you need to make
dialog: a sound decision. But I'd advise
dialog: you to hurry.
text: Barnes leans closer to the microphone -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I'll give you fifteen minutes
dialog: to organize your information. I'll
dialog: take any further delay as a sign
dialog: you've rejected the offer, and
dialog: then of course, it's rescinded.
text: Barnes then reaches over to a button -
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: Over and out.
text: Barnes then presses the button -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: They guests all look at one another - Taylor concentrates, saying nothing -
text: Warren approaches him -
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: This is insane. This can't be
dialog: happening.
dialog: Dawn approaches Taylor -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the screen showing the dining room -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(O.S.)
dialog: I think we should do what he
dialog: tells us.
text: Barnes leans back and watches them, smiling -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dawn approaches Taylor, who inspects the sealed door -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: How do we know he's not
dialog: bluffing?
text: Taylor sees any attempt at opening the door is futile -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We don't.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Well maybe there's a way out
dialog: of here.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Fat chance of that. Even if we
dialog: had C4 and a laser torch these
dialog: doors wouldn't budge.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: That son of a bitch...that stupid
dialog: son of a bitch.
dialog: 
dialog: Carlo and Dawn talk with Taylor -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Given a malfunction, how would
dialog: a rescue team get you out if
dialog: the doors won't open?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Probably come through the wall
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Well maybe we can do something
dialog: like that.
text: Taylor looks at Dawn -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I don't think you know what you're
dialog: talking about. Besides, what could
dialog: we use for tools? A steak knife? A
dialog: corkscrew?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Just considering our options...
dialog: sir.
text: Dawn and Taylor look at each other -
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: We couldn't try anything anyhow.
dialog: He must be watching everything
dialog: we do.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You're right.
text: Taylor looks at the CONTROL PANEL next to the door -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: If only I could override this
dialog: thing.
text: At the other end of the room Mac approaches Delbert who nervously lights a
dialog: cigarette -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: On the behalf of the Star Princess
dialog: we apologize for any inconvenience
dialog: you might experience -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Get outta here, will ya!!
dialog: 
text: Mac backs off and walks away - Monica approaches Delbert -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Well now what are we gonna do!
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: How am I supposed to know?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: You're Delbert Miles! You have
dialog: more clout than some whacked out
dialog: pilot! Talk to him!
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Talk to him...Jesus...
text: Nearby, Jack places a TABLECLOTH over a dead guest -
speaker_heading: DELBERT(O.S.)
dialog: I tell you one thing, I'm not
dialog: giving him shit, not a password,
dialog: not an access code, not the time
dialog: of day.
text: Jack turns around and looks at Delbert -
dialog: Warren and Anna approach Delbert and Monica -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I think we should do what he
dialog: asks.
text: Delbert looks at her incredulously -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Oh you do, huh? Well let me
dialog: tell you something lady, if you
dialog: think that cracker is on the
dialog: level, you're nuts.
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: That's a risk we can't afford
dialog: to take.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: I can. Use your head, do you
dialog: think he wants anyone around to
dialog: say what happened?
dialog: Jack approaches -
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: There's a chance he'll keep
dialog: his end of the bargain, if we
dialog: only cooperate.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Jack steps up and looks at Delbert -
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look. We're talking about life
dialog: and death here. I don't know
dialog: why we're even having this
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Well what would you know about it?
dialog: You don't have anything to lose.
text: Jack gets closer to Delbert -
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're gonna give him those bank
dialog: codes, you know why? Because I'm
dialog: telling you to, that's why. I'm
dialog: not losing my life over some greedy
dialog: pig.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
text: Just then Jack SHOVES Delbert violently - Delbert CHARGES Jack and they scuffle
text: briefly before being separated by Warren -
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Come on! Stop it! Stop it!
text: Delbert and Jack back off from one another, still staring each other down -
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Let's just stay calm, ok?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't believe this crap!
text: Mac approaches Taylor, Dawn, and Carlo -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I am receiving a high level
dialog: of negative feedback from our
dialog: guest's comments. Many expletives
dialog: at a higher than usual decibel
dialog: level.
text: Taylor looks at Mac, then approaches the others -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Look, people, listen to me. As the
dialog: first mate, I know a lot about this
dialog: ship. Now I don't know what's going
dialog: on outside these doors, I don't know
dialog: where the captain is, I don't know
dialog: who's left out here. What I do know
dialog: is that if what he's saying is true,
dialog: we're in serious trouble. So I
dialog: suggest we collect the information
dialog: he wants, and give it to him.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: That's still no guarantee of anything!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We don't have a choice! Now let's
dialog: write them down, OK?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Supposing we could get out of this
dialog: room? Is there anything we could
dialog: do to reach the bridge?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It depends on the condition of
dialog: the ship. If I could get to
dialog: one of the suit compartments
dialog: I could check the exterior air
dialog: locks for a possible entry.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Can't we access the mainframe to
dialog: check the ship's condition?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: With what? How am I going to
dialog: interface with it? I need to
dialog: be able to talk to the system
dialog: and to have the system talk to
dialog: me.
text: Dawn looks at Taylor, who looks down at the ground -
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: We're screwed. Totally screwed.
text: Suddenly something dawns on Taylor -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: A way to talk to the system...
text: Taylor then looks up at Mac -
dialog: Dawn watches Taylor -
dialog: Taylor turns to Carlo -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Carlo, get me the cable off the
dialog: menu register.
dialog: Carlo walks off -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We're going to have to be quick.
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes dials up a number in front of a video screen -
text: Soon the screen shows a FREIGHTER PILOT'S face -
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: Barnes?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: That's me.
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: Break it down to me, what's
dialog: going on?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Seems like they're cooperating.
dialog: Hopefully I'll be out of here
dialog: and on my way very soon.
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: Well don't drag your ass. There
dialog: won't be much of a window for
dialog: us to link up. We'll be in your
dialog: orbit trajectory in less than two
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with
dialog: the plan remember? Just have those
dialog: hangar doors open and ready, I
dialog: can take it from there.
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: Will do. What about the distress
dialog: signal?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I don't know. I really haven't
dialog: made up my mind yet. We'll see
dialog: how nicely they behave.
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: Well that's your call. Doesn't
dialog: make a damn bit of difference to
dialog: me. Just as long as I get my cut.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Oh you'll get it, believe me.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: So I'll see you in a few.
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: 10-4 good buddy.
text: Barnes reaches over to a button -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Yeah yeah, 10-4...
dialog: Barnes disconnects the message -
text: He then gets up and approaches Reynolds, lying dead on the ground - he stares at
dialog: him for a beat -
text: He reaches into the bloody robe pocket and pulls out a
speaker_heading: CIGAR -
text: He smells the cigar, wets the tip, and lights it -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Shame to waste a fine corona.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Carlo removes some cables from a computerized MENU MONITOR for the restaurant and
dialog: approaches Taylor -
text: Taylor takes the cables and approaches the others -
text: Anna has finished writing down everyone's authorization codes on a piece of paper -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Is that all of them?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes. That's all of them.
text: Taylor picks up the piece of paper -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: I can't believe we're doing
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well we are, so get used to it.
text: Taylor then approaches the Wall-mounted CAMERA LENS -
text: The others watch him -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Barnes. Can you hear me?
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Taylor's face can be seen on the monitor -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(V.O.)
dialog: Barnes?
text: Barnes takes a puff of the cigar, and looks at the monitor -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger
dialog: Wilco. Please proceed.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(V.O.)
dialog: We have the codes here. How do you
dialog: want to receive them?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well, preferably in tens and
dialog: twenties...
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor stares at the camera as the others watch -
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: That was a joke Taylor, lighten
dialog: up! Why don't you just hold them up
dialog: to the lens. I'll write them down,
dialog: and once I'm through verifying them,
dialog: I'll get back to you.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Will you transmit the distress signal?
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Once I'm done verifying them. Can't
dialog: be too trustworthy nowadays.
text: Taylor slowly holds up the piece of paper to the lens -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the monitor showing the piece of paper listing the authorization codes of
text: the passengers nest to their names - the list takes up the entire screen -
text: Barnes examines the list and begins entering the first number on the list onto
dialog: another screen -
text: He then hits enter - the screen reads "CONNECTING WITH NETBANK..." -
dialog: Barnes sits back -

text: Taylor gestures to Carlo to come over - Carlo approaches and Taylor carefully hands
dialog: him off the paper to hold up -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Here. Take this.
text: Carlo does so and Taylor walks over to Mac -
text: Dawn undoes the front of the WALL PANEL with a knife -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: OK...it's open.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Seen one like it before?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Sure. It complies with all
dialog: standard construction codes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Great.
text: Taylor then turns and looks at Mac -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Mac, I have a favor to ask you.
text: Mac looks at Taylor -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Certainly. If you need anything,
dialog: please feel free to ask me. Just a
dialog: reminder we have fabulous cuisine
dialog: available --
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yes I know all that. Mac, I need
dialog: you to help us out with a little
dialog: technical problem.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Certainly. I have a full working
dialog: knowledge of the ships operations.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Right, I understand that...
text: Taylor looks at Mac's face - Jack approaches -
text: Dawn begins to connect one end of the wire to the wall console -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I need you to actually do something
dialog: for me. I need to access your CPU,
dialog: directly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: That will not be necessary. You can
dialog: simply speak to me. I understand
dialog: most languages fluently.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't.
dialog: I need you to tell it something.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Alteration of my central processing
dialog: unit should be done only by an
dialog: authorized service dealer.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I know but we're in a bind.
text: Mac waits a beat before saying anything -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Alteration of my central processing
dialog: unit should be done only by an
dialog: authorized service dealer.
dialog: 
text: Dawn then turns and looks at Mac -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Yes Mac, but the guests are
dialog: requesting it.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: It will reduce the level of
dialog: negative feedback.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: That is one of my priorities.
text: Taylor looks at Dawn -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: That is what I thought...
text: Taylor and Jack look at Mac's face -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Now which one was it again?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's the left one, I think.
scene_heading: EXT STAR PRINCESS - NIGHT
text: The ship drifts aimlessly in space, with the moon in the distance -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
dialog: Barnes continues to verify the authorization codes -
text: CLOSE on the MONITOR - Barnes types in the number - the screen then reads -
text: "CONNECTING TO NETBANK...", then a pause, then "NETBANK: BEVERLY HILLS CA 90210"
scene_heading: "CLIENT NAME: WAYNE, WARREN."
dialog: 
text: Barnes watches as a series of options appear: BALANCE, TRANSFER, WITHDRAWAL,
speaker_heading: DEPOSIT -
text: Barnes selects BALANCE - there is a pause, then: AVAILABLE FUNDS - $40,386,020 -
dialog: Barnes sits back -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I tell you, I should have been
dialog: an actor.
dialog: Barnes then types in some commands -
text: The screen then reads:
scene_heading: "TRANSFER TO NETBANK _ _ _ _ _ - _ _ _ " -
text: As Barnes types in the number, they appear as X'S -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the cable connected to the wall console -
text: The camera slowly pans, following the cable -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(O.S.)
dialog: Ok, the first thing we need to
dialog: know is the status of this floor.
text: Taylor then gently moves the other end of the cable toward Mac's face - as we
text: approach we see Mac's LEFT EYE removed, with a socket for the corresponding cable -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Here goes nothing.
text: Taylor slowly inserts the cable into the socket -
text: Everyone waits for a beat -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Now Mac, can you tell me the status
dialog: of this deck?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: One moment please...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: one moment please...
text: Dawn examines the EYEBALL then looks at Taylor -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Do you think it's working?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It should. Mac?
text: Mac sits, motionless, with the cable hanging out of his
dialog: eye -
text: The others watch apprehensively -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: This corridor is accessible,
dialog: and we hope you enjoy it. I'm
dialog: sorry to say we are having
dialog: technical problems with...all
dialog: exits on this level. We apologize
dialog: for this inconvenience.
text: Taylor and Dawn sigh with relief -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: But the corridor outside this door
dialog: is open, correct?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Yes. You can enjoy some wonderful
dialog: views from there.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Screw the damn views! Get us out
dialog: of here you piece of crap!
text: Taylor and the others glare at Delbert for a beat - Taylor then continues to focus
dialog: attention on Mac -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Mac, what about the suit
dialog: compartments on this level? Can
dialog: they be accessed?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I'm sorry. The suit compartments
dialog: are in a non-oxygenated, zero
dialog: gravity atmosphere. I'm afraid
dialog: that's off limits to all passengers.
dialog: Taylor sits back -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Damn it. If only we could get to
dialog: those suits...
dialog: Dawn then thinks of something -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Why can't we?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I don't know the condition of
dialog: the compartments. Depending
dialog: on damage, debris...could be
dialog: a fatal mistake.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Unless you could hold your breath.
text: Taylor looks at Jack -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: And suppose you couldn't hold
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Suppose you didn't have to hold
dialog: your breath?
text: Taylor looks at Dawn -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: We could send Mac. If he can
dialog: retrieve one suit, we could go
dialog: back for the other.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You're right.
text: Taylor then looks at Jack - he raises his wrist -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Jack, let me have your walkie.
dialog: Put it on channel 10.
text: Taylor than looks around, walks over to a chair, and SMASHES it on the ground,
text: picking up one of the steel legs -
text: Taylor then looks at Mac -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Open the door, Mac.
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the doors to the dining room opening -
text: Mac exits the dining room -
dialog: 
text: Taylor places the chair leg between the two doors creating an opening wide enough
dialog: to slide through -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Ok Mac...
dialog: (shows Mac his walkie)
dialog: I'll talk to you on this. I
dialog: want to find a way to get to
dialog: the bridge, then I want you
dialog: to come back.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Certainly. Anything I can do
dialog: to be of service.
text: Mac heads down the hall -
text: Dawn and Taylor watch him -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: He certainly is polite.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: (to Mac)
dialog: Close every door behind you!
text: Mac looks at Taylor, then heads around the corner -
scene_heading: INT DAMAGED HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The doors open, and Mac enters the damaged hallway - loose WIRES buzz and crackle,
text: debris and bodies litter the
dialog: hallway -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(V.O.)
dialog: How is it looking, Mac?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I would recommend a maintenance
dialog: crew in this sector.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor talks on his walkie -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Is it safe for human transport?
speaker_heading: MAC(V.O.)
dialog: That's affirmative.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: It must be oxygenated if we can
dialog: hear him.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah, let's hope he can find a
dialog: way through.
dialog: Taylor cues his walkie -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Mac please check the status of
dialog: the suit compartment on this level
dialog: I want you to go in there and get
dialog: a suit.
scene_heading: INT DAMAGED HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Mac approaches the door at the other end -
text: The door does not open automatically - Mac stares at it for a beat -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I will manually open the door,
dialog: and will report this problem to
dialog: maintenance.
text: Mac raises his hand to the PANEL on the wall -
text: As he does the wrist walkie gets near A LIVE WIRE jutting out of the wall -
dialog: As Mac punched in a number -
text: The cable TOUCHES the walkie, and a SURGE of electricity rips through Mac -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor hears a loud CRACKLE emit from his walkie -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What the hell was that?
scene_heading: INT DAMAGED HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Mac gets BLASTED against the wall of the hallway -
text: He reels for a beat, then staggers a few steps -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I have experienced a critical
dialog: error...I have experienced a
dialog: critical error...I will review
dialog: my previous commands.
text: Mac enters the commands on the panel, and the door opens -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM -
dialog: Taylor cues his walkie -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Mac. Mac!
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes finishes tallying the total he has transferred -
text: CLOSE on the monitor showing the grand total - $368,422,006.32
text: Barnes sits back, smiles, and takes a puff of his cigar -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Not bad for a day's work.
text: Suddenly there is a bell indicating someone trying to enter the bridge -
dialog: Barnes swings around -
text: He checks the monitor and sees it is Mac, waiting outside the bridge door -
text: Barnes grabs up his gun and approaches the door -
text: He opens the door, all the time aiming his weapon -
text: Mac stares at him -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Where the hell did you come
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Hello second mate Barnes. I was
dialog: instructed to come to the bridge.
dialog: 
text: Mac reels for a beat, leans on the hallway wall -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Is there anything I can do for
dialog: you?
text: Barnes looks around the hallway, then looks at Mac and smiles -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Sure. Come on in pally. Take
text: a load off.
text: Mac enters the room -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor listens to his walkie as the others stand around
dialog: him -
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Mac. Mac can you hear me?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: I don't understand. It was working
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe the walkie shorted out.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: How?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Mac, can you hear me?
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes sits down with a smile on his face, and listens to Mac -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: So how did you get here, Mac?
dialog: I'm impressed.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I had to pass through several
dialog: restricted areas. I am sensing
dialog: a high level of passenger
dialog: dissatisfaction, which
dialog: is my duty to report.
text: Barnes revels in this encounter -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Weren't you down in the dining
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I was there. Officer Taylor
dialog: accessed my CPU directly to
text: open the airlock doors. They
dialog: are not functioning properly.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Oh he did, did he?
text: The smile fades from Barnes' face -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Yes he did. Yes he did.
text: Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You didn't do anything to the
dialog: monitors, did you Mac?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I did nothing to the monitors.
text: Barnes watches the screen carefully -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: And what are they doing now, Mac?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: They are awaiting further
dialog: information.
text: Barnes looks at Mac -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Were you going to give it to them?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I am here to provide service to...
dialog: to all our guests. There is a high
dialog: level of passenger dissatisfaction.
dialog: It is my duty...to report this.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well you did the right thing Mac.
text: Barnes gets up - he sees the wrist walkie on Mac -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: So, you were communicating with
dialog: officer Taylor over the wrist
dialog: walkie?
text: Barnes inspects the walkie, notices it is on channel 10 -
text: he laughs and shakes his head -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: On channel 10?
speaker_heading: MAC
text: The device has stopped responding.
text: Barnes looks up at Mac -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well, we're going to have to
dialog: do something about that aren't we?
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor listens to the walkie -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Mac, can you hear me? Come in?
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Taylor, you surprise me.
text: Taylor looks up in disbelief -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes talks into his walkie - Mac sits in the background -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Never send an android to do a
dialog: man's work.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Taylor and the others listen carefully -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I don't know what you're
dialog: talking about!
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Sure you do. Sending Mac out
dialog: on a little recon work. How
dialog: pathetic. Problem is it seems
text: Mac blew a few fuses.
dialog: (laughs)
text: Or maybe he's just a little drunk.
dialog: Were you partying with a robot
dialog: Taylor?
dialog: Taylor begins to lose his patience -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Look we gave you what you asked
dialog: for. It checks out didn't it?!
dialog: What more do you want from us!
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I told you not to try anything
dialog: smart! I guess you're too much
dialog: of a maverick to follow a simple
dialog: order! And that's just too bad for
dialog: all of you now, isn't it?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR(V.O.)
dialog: Look you said it doesn't matter
dialog: to you anyway! Why do you want
dialog: to kill more innocent people! Why!
dialog: Barnes gets up -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I suppose you want a diatribe about
dialog: my agenda to get even with the
dialog: world, or some crap.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Taylor and the others listen -
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: Well it's not that complex. I
dialog: don't give a damn about the haves,
dialog: and I don't give a damn about the have-
dialog: nots. And I sure as hell don't give
dialog: a damn about any of you.
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: It's business. Period. If you
dialog: followed directions, you might have
dialog: had a chance. But all that's all
dialog: over now.
text: Barnes then heads over to the console and adjusts some equipment -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I'll tell you what I will do,
dialog: though. I'll make sure you all see
dialog: the moon. Unfortunately it will have
dialog: to be a one way trip.
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARNES(V.O.)
dialog: So in closing I'd like to thank all
dialog: of you for your generous contributions
dialog: and thanks for flying the Star
dialog: Princess. Watch your step on the way
dialog: out. Bye bye.
text: Taylor lowers his walkie - the others respond with sunken faces -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes throws the walkie on the console, smiling to
text: himself - he then approaches Mac and puts on a look of mock seriousness -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Mac, you really earned your wings
dialog: this flight.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: My...wings...
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Yes, your wings.
text: Mac reels for a beat, then continues -
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I am here to provide service to...
dialog: to all our guests. There is a high
dialog: level of passenger dissatisfaction.
dialog: It is my duty...to report this.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I hear you Mac and I appreciate it.
dialog: Frankly I don't know what I'd have
dialog: done without you on this one.
speaker_heading: MAC
text: There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: And I intend to correct that at once.
dialog: I'll tell you something Mac...
text: Barnes puts his arm around Mac -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: You're really gonna go far in this
dialog: business.
scene_heading: EXT SPACESHIP - NIGHT
text: An AIRLOCK ENTRANCE can be seen - suddenly Mac SHOOTS out of the entrance and flies
dialog: away from the ship -
text: Mac disappears into the void, arms and legs akimbo, looking ridiculous -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the monitor with a view of the exterior as Mac disappears into space -
text: Barnes HOWLS with laughter, bending over, slapping the console -
text: He gets up, laughing even harder, SHOUTING with laughter -
text: He then opens a panel and begins flipping switch after switch after switch -
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The lights go out in ascending order down the hall -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Suddenly the lights begin to shut off and the send of an ENGINE RUNNING DOWN can be
dialog: heard -
text: The occupants all look at one another -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh my God, what is he doing?
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: He's shutting off the air!!!
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: That lousy, stinking son of a
dialog: bitch!
text: Delbert picks up a chair - charges toward the CAMERA -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: That lousy -
text: Delbert flings the chair - SMASSSSHHHHH!!!! The chair shatters the camera -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the camera monitor going blank -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Monica rushes over to Delbert, whose rage disguises his panic -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Delbert! What's gonna happen?
text: Delbert pulls his arm away but Monica grabs it again -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Delbert!
text: Delbert looks at her -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I'm scared. I'm really scared!
text: Delbert looks back at her, unable to hide his fear -
text: Jack looks at Taylor -
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are we going to do?
dialog: Taylor concentrates -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: He might still be playing a
dialog: game with us. But at this
dialog: point the odds are slim, he's
dialog: already killed too many others.
dialog: Dawn approaches Taylor -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: So...what's the next step?
text: Taylor and Dawn look at each other -
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: What's the use...we're gonna
dialog: die...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't say that! It ain't over
dialog: till it's over!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It's a question of getting to the
text: lifepod. Before Barnes does. But
dialog: even then, the pod has a maximum
dialog: capacity of seven adults.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: And there's eight of us.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Well we'll just cram in!
text: Taylor glares at Delbert -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It doesn't work that way! There's
dialog: only so much oxygen, only so much
dialog: fuel, only so much mass it can handle
dialog: on re-entry!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: If I could get to the bridge I could
dialog: send the distress signal.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Even if we do, it might be too late.
text: Taylor looks at the room -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Then I have no other choice.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I have to get to the suit
dialog: compartment.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought you said it was
dialog: too risky.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I'm not letting him get away with
dialog: this. It's our last chance.
text: Taylor heads toward the door -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Everyone just stay put.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Wait.
dialog: Dawn approaches Taylor -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: I'll go with you.
text: Taylor looks at her -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I can't let you do that.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Look I know what I'm doing.
dialog: I have experience and training
dialog: in space walking.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Simulated space walking.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: You might need assistance, you
dialog: don't know what your facing.
text: Dawn looks around the room, then looks at Taylor -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: I'll go crazy sitting here. I'd
dialog: rather risk it.
text: Taylor looks at her for a beat -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: All right come on.
text: Taylor looks at the others -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Everyone just stay calm. Everything's
dialog: going to be all right.
text: Taylor looks at Jack -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Jack, keep it together in here.
text: Jack looks at him -
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll do my best.
text: Taylor and Dawn leave through the opening in the door
text: Carlo watches them - there is a look of real anxiety on his face -
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: We're going to die.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Will you shut up already?
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: I'll tell you one thing, I'm not
dialog: gonna just lie down and die for
dialog: this crackpot. The hell with
dialog: that!
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: And what are you going to do,
dialog: genius?
text: Delbert looks at her -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: I haven't quite made up my
dialog: mind yet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll tell you what you're gonna
dialog: do. You're gonna stay put like
dialog: Taylor said.
dialog: Delbert approaches Jack -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Again with the orders from you!
dialog: You got a Napoleon complex chief,
dialog: and I'm getting sick of it!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you going to do about
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Will you two please stop it! I
dialog: don't want to spend my final hours
dialog: listening to you bitch!
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: I'll tell you what I'm going to
dialog: do.
text: The others look at Warren -
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: I'm going to have myself a drink.
text: Warren walks over to the bar -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Dawn and Taylor make their way down the darkened hallway strewn with debris and
dialog: collapsed ceiling panels -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Watch your step.
text: Taylor approaches a sealed door - he looks at it for a
dialog: beat -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It's through this door.
text: Taylor then looks at Dawn -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I don't know what we're facing.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: I understand.
text: They look at each other for a beat -
text: Taylor takes a deep breath -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Are you ready?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Ready as I'll ever be.
text: Taylor nods at her - he then looks at the door -
text: Taylor's hand approaches the emergency lock release -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Here goes nothing.
text: Taylor hits the button -
text: CLOSE on the doors - they SWOOSH open -
scene_heading: INT SUIT COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The pressurized room BLASTS Taylor and Dawn into the small room filled with
text: several large recessed LOCKERS - there is NO SOUND WHATSOEVER -
text: They struggle to anchor themselves as they slam around the room and come
text: dangerously close to a GAPING HOLE in the wall leading out to space -
text: Dawn grabs onto a railing for dear life, her face contorting from the lack of
dialog: oxygen and the brutal cold -
text: Taylor RIPS OPEN one of the lockers containing a SPACE
text: SUIT - the door swings open and shut violently as Taylor struggles to hold on -
text: Dawn struggles to get closer to another one of the lockers -
text: FROST rapidly begins to form on her hand and the railing -
text: Taylor slips and slams backward - but through sheer will power grabs hold of the
text: locker door, and pulls out the suit's HELMET - he lets go and flies backwards,
dialog: holding the helmet -
text: He slams into Dawn and hands her the helmet - she, too, let's go to grab it and is
dialog: propelled around the room -
text: Taylor then opens another locker and repeats the procedure, this time grabbing
dialog: another helmet -
text: By this time dawn has gone to the first locker and removes the suit, struggling to
dialog: get into it while keeping her bearings -
text: Taylor puts on the helmet and follows suit, grabbing another suit out of the second
dialog: locker -
text: Almost at the point of bursting, Dawn begins to lock the helmet down -
text: Taylor continues to do the same, getting the arm of the suit stuck in the locker -
text: Dawn floats over to the railing - she grabs it and positions herself -
text: Taylor finally frees the stuck jacket and continues getting into the suit -
text: CLOSE on Dawn as she uses her free hand to press some commands on the other forearm
dialog: of the suit -
text: A small LIGHT goes on in her helmet - soon she begins to HUNGRILY GASP in the
text: incoming oxygen - soon a look of relief crosses her face -
text: Taylor continues to struggle with the suit - Dawn heads over to him -
text: Taylor LOCKS DOWN his helmet -
text: Just then Dawn reaches over and presses the buttons the forearms of Taylor's suit -
text: The small light goes on in Taylor's helmet - he, too, begins to suck in the air, as
dialog: if for dear life -
text: Slinking back from exhaustion, Taylor looks over at Dawn -
text: Dawn looks back at him - slowly, a smile crosses her face -
text: Slowly, Taylor smiles back at her - he presses a button on the forearm of his suit -
text: we hear his voice through the HELMET SPEAKER -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Are you all right?
text: Dawn looks at the suit, and presses the button on her forearm - she then looks at
dialog: Taylor -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: We did it.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: So we did.
text: Taylor then heads over to the gaping hole in the wall -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Now that's what I call an emergency
dialog: exit.
text: Taylor inspects it and looks out into space - he then turns and looks at Dawn -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You're ready for the real thing?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: At this point I'm ready for
dialog: anything.
text: Taylor smiles at her - he slowly makes his way out of the hole - Dawn follows,
dialog: closely behind -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on Carlo, who stares despondently at the ground -
text: Delbert paces as Monica watches him -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: I tell you, something's not right
dialog: here.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: How do we know they're not going
dialog: to use the pod for themselves?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because, Taylor wouldn't do that,
dialog: that's why.
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: What makes you so sure?

speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Getting drunk is no solution.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Don't worry about me.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: To the other side. There's

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What the hell is that?

text: POV Taylor grabs a chunk OF C4 PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE attached to a pipe on the ship -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Explosive?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: One of Barnes' duds, luckily
dialog: for us. Take this out of the
dialog: equation right now...
text: Taylor puts the C4 into a STORAGE POUCH on his suit -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: That psychotic bastard...
text: Taylor looks back a Dawn -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Come on, let's go.
text: Dawn follows him - they look at each other -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Taylor?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What do you think's going to

text: Taylor looks back at Dawn -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by
dialog: nature.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Yeah, but you didn't answer my
dialog: question.
text: The two continue to make their way across the ship -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Do you want some advice?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Don't worry about what will happen,
dialog: just concentrate on what is
dialog: happening. You'll live longer.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Words to live by.

dialog: Barnes laughs -
text: He then goes over to the monitor -
text: He presses a button and looks at the monitor - the screen is blank -
text: Barnes smile fades -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Those idiots...
text: Barnes then presses another button -
text: POV the monitor shows a WIDE VIEW of the hallway outside the dining room -
text: Barnes scrutinizes the image - he sees something he doesn't
dialog: like - he hits a button -
text: POV the monitor ZOOMS IN to reveal the doors to the dining room open about 18
dialog: inches -
dialog: Barnes frowns at this discovery -
scene_heading: EXT STAR PRINCESS

speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: It's time we lock coordinates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I know, I know.
text: Barnes keeps checking the security monitor - he is now exploring the exterior of
dialog: the ship -
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: So, what are we waiting for?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Cool your jets...I'm doing a little
dialog: damage control.
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)

scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

text: Warren then lets out a drunken laugh -
text: Anna watches him, then follows suit, cackling -
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I never though I'd be stuck in
text: a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Well get used to it, 'cause here
dialog: we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
text: Warren approaches her, walking like a robot -
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Tell me, miss Koros, how are you
dialog: enjoying the trip so far?
text: Anna cracks up at Warren's crude imitation of Mac -
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Can I get you anything? Some
dialog: more cheese puffs perhaps...
text: The two of them laugh drunkenly -
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: I'm perfectly serious. I'm here
dialog: to satisfy your every request here
dialog: on the cruise of a lifetime. Just
dialog: ask, anything you want, anything
dialog: at all.
dialog: 
text: Anna's laughter subsides, and she looks at Warren seductively -

speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Oh my God. What happened?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
text: The room is filled with poison
dialog: gas. The hydraulic system must
dialog: have blown.
text: Taylor looks at the men for a beat - he then heads over to a console -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: That sick bastard...
text: Taylor hits an AUXILIARY POWER switch on the console - the screen on the monitor
dialog: lights up -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
text: A schematic of the ship. Looking
dialog: for a lifeline to the pods.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: We don't have enough suits to
dialog: get the others out.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: That's why we need a safe passage.
dialog: remember what you said earlier,
dialog: about getting through the wall?
dialog: That might just be our ticket.
text: Taylor brings up the floor plans of the ship - functioning areas are in green, the
dialog: others in red -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No look, see that. One deck up
dialog: will take you across the damaged
text: lower decks. There's a bulkhead
dialog: here, then over that, one deck down,
dialog: is a storage room. That room
text: is adjacent to the dining room.
dialog: We get through that wall, we get
dialog: them out to here -
text: Taylor points to the LIFEPOD AREA on the map -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: How are we going to blow the
dialog: wall?
text: Taylor looks at Dawn for a beat -

dialog: drawers -
dialog: Dawn watches him -
text: Taylor then grabs up a FLARE from one of the drawers -
text: He heads down to Dawn and hands it to her -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Take this flare.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: A flare? A flare won't do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No...
text: Taylor takes the C4 out of the pouch on his suit -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: But this will. Just attach it
dialog: to the flare.
dialog: Taylor hands the C4 to Dawn -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
text: The flare is self igniting, it
dialog: has a short fuse, so be careful.
dialog: And remember...
text: Taylor breaks off a tiny piece of the C4 -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: A little dab'll do ya. Now you
dialog: know how to get there, right?
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Why? Where are you going?
text: Taylor looks at her for a beat -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I'm not going with you.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: What? What are you talking
dialog: about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: There's only room on that pod
dialog: for seven. That's you and the
dialog: others. I'm counting on you
dialog: to get them out of there.
text: Dawn stares at him, dumbstruck -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: And what are you going to do?!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I'm going to try and buy you
dialog: some time. I can get to the
dialog: bridge from here.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: But how are you going to escape?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Don't worry about me. There's
dialog: still a chance I can issue a
dialog: distress signal.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: But you can't be sure! It's
dialog: suicide. You have to come with
dialog: us!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I can't!
text: Taylor takes Dawn by the shoulders -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Listen, Dawn. You have to
dialog: stay focused. Don't unravel
dialog: on me. Now you've got to get
dialog: them to safety! I'm counting
dialog: on you.
text: Dawn looks at Taylor -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Don't worry about me.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I'll be all right.
text: They look at each other -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Now hurry up. We're running
dialog: out of time.
text: Dawn heads over to the door -
text: Taylor approaches a PANEL on the wall -
text: Dawn pauses at the door -
text: Taylor and Dawn look at each other for one last beat -
text: Dawn gestures to the COMMUNICATOR in her helmet -
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: Keep in touch.
text: Taylor gestures to his communicator -
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I will once I get past the
text: bulkhead.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: DAWN
dialog: You too.

scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the monitor showing the face of the ship's pilot -
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: You're not helping my heart
dialog: condition any, Barnes! Now just
dialog: what the hell are you dragging your
dialog: ass for?
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: The others decided to get cute with
dialog: me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
text: Barnes looks out the window -
speaker_heading: BARNES
text: This ship is going down in a
dialog: blaze of glory!
speaker_heading: PILOT(O.S.)
dialog: Well blaze your ass out of there!
dialog: You've completely altered your
dialog: trajectory, are we linking up or
dialog: not?!
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Don't worry about me, I'm changing
dialog: coordinates now.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I've come to far to be tripped up
dialog: by some Dudley do-right...
dialog: motherfuckers!
scene_heading: INT AIR VENT - NIGHT
text: Taylor makes his way through the air vent, slowly and carefully -
scene_heading: INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Delbert, Monica, Jack, and Carlo sit in the room -
text: Carlo struggles to take a breath -
speaker_heading: CARLO
dialog: It's getting hard to breathe...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just don't move around too much.
text: Carlo looks at him, and heads to the MEN'S ROOM -
text: Jack watches him and shakes his head -
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks for taking my advice.
text: Monica stands up, looking agitated -
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: It's getting too cold in here.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I can't stand this anymore!
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Baby, take it easy.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: How can you sit there with your
dialog: fat stomach and tell me to take
dialog: it easy! I want to go home! I
dialog: want to be warm! I want to get
dialog: out of here!
text: Delbert approaches her -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: Look, calm down, getting all

text: Delbert hugs her and Monica cries - together they sit down at a table while she

text: Delbert hugs her -
speaker_heading: DELBERT
dialog: It's ok...

dialog: shoulders -

scene_heading: EXT STORAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)

speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I told you, I had to teach a few
dialog: people a lesson!
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)

dialog: -
scene_heading: INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Barnes addresses the monitor -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Now I got enough air and supplies
dialog: to make another complete orbit in
dialog: the pod! You're just gonna have to
dialog: pick me up later.
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: This is a major screw up on your
dialog: part, goddamn it!
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Well then why don't I tell you
dialog: something, good buddy? I don't
dialog: need to listen to shit from you!
dialog: Now you want to call it off fine,
dialog: I'll take the risk of re-entry
dialog: but you're out of the picture,
dialog: understand?
dialog: The pilot says nothing -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Now we'll regroup in 24 hours, tell
dialog: whoever you need to you're extending
dialog: the trip, and pick me up accordingly.
dialog: Is that clear?
dialog: The pilot says nothing -
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: Is that clear?
speaker_heading: PILOT(V.O.)
dialog: That's clear.
speaker_heading: BARNES
