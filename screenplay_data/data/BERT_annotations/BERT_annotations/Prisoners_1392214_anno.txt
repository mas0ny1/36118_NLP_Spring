scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DAWN/THANKSGIVING
text: A deer hops through waist-high grass, not far from..
text: KELLER DOVER, camouflage, hunting rifle in hand. A
text: serious man, imposing, still built like a prize fighter
dialog: at 37.
text: He doesn’t move a muscle; letting his son take the
dialog: shot...
text: RALPH DOVER, 15, aims his rifle, a little shaky, still
text: learning. He squeezes the trigger -- POP POP --
text: The deer stumbles towards us, shot in the neck. It backs
text: up and collapses. The high grass hides its final moments
text: in a canopy of swaying tendrils.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER
text: Still early morning. A pick-up truck barrels down the
text: highway. On the tailgate, in painted letters it says:
text: KELLER DOVER REMODELING & REPAIRS.
text: From above we see the shot deer lying in the pick-up’s
text: flatbed.
scene_heading: INT. KELLER’S TRUCK - TRAVELING
text: Keller drives. Ralph sits in the passenger seat. The

speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: Most important thing your Grandpa
dialog: ever taught me. Be ready.
dialog: Hurricane, flood, whatever it ends
dialog: up being. No more food gets
dialog: delivered to the grocery store,
text: gas stations dry up. People turn
dialog: on one another and all of a sudden
dialog: all that stands between you and
dialog: being dead is you.
text: He looks at Ralph. Ralph nods, idolizes his father even
text: if he barely understands him. Keller nods back, not

text: AN OLD YELLOWED RV as it weaves through CONYERS,

text: The RV turns onto Fairmount Circle, creeping past modest
text: houses with slush covered lawns, past KELLER DOVER’S
text: HOUSE, his pick-up truck parked in the driveway.
text: The RV disappears around the bend as...
text: The Dovers' front door opens and Keller’s daughter, ANNA,
text: 6, walks out into the cold, followed by his wife, GRACE,
text: a fragile looking beauty with a whisper thin voice:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Wait, Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Are we taking the truck?
text: Ralph comes out, cradling a couple hunks of venison

speaker_heading: RALPH

dialog: Happy Thanksgiving. Keller, you

speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: No Ma‘am, this one’s Ralph’s.

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No problem.
text: Keller and Franklin work to insert the leaf in the dining

speaker_heading: ANNA

speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: (yelling to the

dialog: Hey, get away from that thing!
text: That old RV is parked up ahead on the side of the road,
