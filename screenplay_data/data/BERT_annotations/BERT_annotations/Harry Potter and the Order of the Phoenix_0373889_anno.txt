scene_heading: EXT. - LITTLE WHINGING - NIGHT
text: It is sunset. We drift through the clouds, approaching NUMBER
text: FOUR, PRIVET DRIVE. We sail over the roof of NUMBER FOUR and
text: continue on past it into the street.
text: We drift down into an abandoned playground. A lone figure
text: sits on the only unbroken swing.. It is HARRY POTTER. He
text: appears deep in thought.
text: Had he been watching more carefully, he would have seen the
text: old MRS. FIGG watching him from her front porch.
text: MRS. FIGG adjusts her porch chair in order to watch Harry
dialog: better.
text: The sound of harsh laughter reaches Harry's ears. He looks
text: up. Dudley and his gang of followers are walking down the
text: street, telling crude jokes and laughing.
text: They ignore Harry and continue on out of sight. Harry gets to
text: his feet and follows them.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Harry rounds the corner, only to find himself surrounded by
dialog: Dudley's gang.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Oh, it's you.
speaker_heading: GANG THUG #1
dialog: What should we do with him, Big D?
text: Harry laughs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll
dialog: always be Ikkle Duddicums.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Shut up!
text: One of Dudley's gang steps in as if to punch Harry. Harry
text: glares at him.
text: The gang member pauses, then steps back again.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in
dialog: your bed, are you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
text: MRS. FIGG stands up and goes to the edge of her porch.
speaker_heading: MRS. FIGG
dialog: You boys go home now, or I'll be
dialog: calling your parents!
text: They pause and edge away from Harry.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: I heard you talking in your sleep,
dialog: last night. Crying. "No, don't kill
dialog: Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad,
dialog: help me, heeelp me! He's going to
dialog: kill me! Boo-hoo!"
text: Dudley's gang laughs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you...
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Why should I?
text: Harry whips out his wand and points it at Dudley.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Because if you don't I'll turn you
dialog: into the idiot pig you are!
text: Dudley's gang laughs at Harry. Dudley, on the other hand, is
dialog: terrified.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Don't point that thing at me!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not so brave now, are you
dialog: Duddykins? Now tell your little
dialog: friends to go away.
text: Dudley quivers, then finally complies.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: G-go home!
speaker_heading: GANG MEMBER #3
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Get out of here!
text: Suddenly nervous, they turn and edge away, soon vanishing
text: into the night.
text: Harry tightened his grip on his wand, glaring fourteen years
text: of hatred and rage at Dudley.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (cont. )
dialog: Don't you ever speak about that
dialog: again. You understand?
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: Don't point that thing at me!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I SAID, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? !
text: Suddenly, a cold wind blows through the street, causing
text: everyone to shiver. Harry exhales and his breath is tinged
dialog: with frost.
text: The street lights flicker, die, and frost over.
text: Dudley is turning in a circle, terrified.
speaker_heading: DUDLEY
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Quiet!
text: The stars go out, plunging them into darkness.
text: Dudley yells in fear.
text: Harry turns to the end of the street. Gliding as smooth as
text: death over the street, tattered robes drifting in the wind,
text: comes a DEMENTOR.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dudley! Run!
text: He turns, grabs his cousin by the arm and drags him down an
text: alleyway. Beyond the mouth of the alleyway is the next
text: street, and Number Four, Privet Drive.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on!
text: They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway in
text: front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to
text: find the other dementor cutting off the way back.
text: Harry spots a fire escape ladder, leading onto the roof of
dialog: the house.
text: He taps Dudley on the back, and starts to point to it, when
text: Dudley turns and punches Harry in the jaw. Dazed, Harry
text: stumbles backwards and falls to his back. His glasses slide
text: from his face. His wand clatters away from him.
text: Crying, Dudley runs away from Harry, towards the first
dialog: dementor.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dudley, no!
text: Harry feels the ground for his glasses but cannot find them.
text: His hands scrabble on the ground in desperation.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lumos !
text: Three feet away from him, his wand lights up. Harry snatches
text: it up and turns.
text: The dementor closes the distance to Harry swiftly, and is
text: suddenly right before him.
text: Harry raises his wand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: 'Expecto Patronum!'
text: A wisp of misty light protrudes from the tip of his wand, but
text: not enough. Harry stiffens and gasps.
text: The dementor closes in for the kill.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: (V.0.)
dialog: Bow to death, Harry...
speaker_heading: LILY POTTER
dialog: (V.0.)
dialog: Haaaaaaaarry!...
text: Harry falls onto his back, and the dementor closes the
dialog: distance.
text: Dudley SCREAMS in the black. Harry glances at him.
text: Dudley is on his back, hands pulled apart by the other
text: dementor, and the great cloaked head lowering to deliver the
dialog: kiss.
text: Harry raises his wand in desperation.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ‘EXPECTO PATRONUM!'
text: There is a blinding explosion of light as Harry's PATRONOUS
text: bursts forth, blasting the dementor backwards and away.
text: The light INTENSIFIES, PULSATING from Harry’s wand, expanding
text: to fill the alley with wave after pulsing wave of PURE LIGHT.
text: The dementors flee.
text: The stars, and street lamps flicker to life again.
text: Dudley lays on the ground, whimpering and shaking.
text: FOOTSTEPS from behind Harry. He turns, wand at the ready, to
text: see UNCLE VERNON and AUNT PETUNIA running up to him. He
text: starts to lower it.
text: But they are staring dumbfounded into the sky, watching the
text: Dementors soar away.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What the hell are those?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dementors.
text: Petunia kneels on the ground next to Dudley.
speaker_heading: PETUNIA
dialog: What happened, Duddikins?
text: Vernon turns on Harry, who hastily lowers his wand.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What the hell is a dementoid?
text: Petunia seizes Dudley and attempts to look into his mouth.
speaker_heading: PETUNIA
dialog: They didn't--?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No.
text: Vernon shoves a large finger at Harry.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I want some answers!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We were attacked.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: By those...things?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: They’re evil. If they get the
dialog: chance, they'll suck your soul out
dialog: through your mouth.
speaker_heading: PETUNIA
dialog: They guard the wizard prison,
dialog: Azkaban.
text: Vernon and Harry look dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: How do you know that?
text: Petunia shakes her head, looking panicky.
text: Vernon helps Dudley unsteadily to his feet, patting him on
dialog: the shoulder.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave ‘em
dialog: the ol' one-two?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You can't give a Dementor the 'ol
dialog: one-two.'
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Why is he all right then?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Because I used magic to save his
dialog: life!
text: The street-lights die, plunging the street into darkness.
text: Several cloaked people appear around them on the street. The
text: Dursleys yell in surprise.
text: They move closer. Harry stands, brandishing his wand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lumos !
text: Ten wizards stand around them, wands out. Mad-eye Moody,
text: Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Elphias
text: Doge, Dedalus Diggle, Emmeline Vance, Sturgis Podmore, and
dialog: Hestia Jones.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Who are all you lot?
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Quiet, Dursley.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Harry, douse the light. We're
text: exposed here.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Nox.
text: Darkness returns to the street, which is now lit only by the
text: light of the moon.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: We're your advanced guard, Harry.
dialog: Dumbledore just sent us as soon as
dialog: he heard about the attack. We're
dialog: taking you to safety. We're just
text: waiting for the all clear.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How’d he know? It just happened!
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: You didn’t think Dumbledore’d let
dialog: you wander around on your own, did
dialog: you?
text: Lupin indicates Tonks.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Harry, I don’t believe you've met
dialog: Nymphadora Tonks.
text: She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Tonks, would you go get Harry's
dialog: broom from the house?
text: She nods and departs.
text: Harry looks at Lupin.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's been going on? What's Lord
dialog: Vol-
text: Three of the advanced guard jump.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: We're not talking about it here,
dialog: it's too risky.
text: Moody's eye stuck backwards in his head.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Blast it.
text: He pulls his eye from it's socket with a horrible sucking
dialog: sound.
speaker_heading: TONKS
dialog: Mad-eye, dear, you do realize
dialog: that's disgusting?
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: I want 365 degree visibility on the
dialog: return trip.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How are we getting there?
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Brooms.
text: Red sparks fly into the air in the distance.
text: Tonks returns with the broom, handing it to Harry.
speaker_heading: KINGSLEY
text: There's the first signal.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Right, let's go.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: On your broom, Harry.
text: Moody is moving around them.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Form up! Form up around Harry. Make
dialog: it snappy!
text: The advanced guard surrounds Harry.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: We'll be flying in close-quarters
dialog: formation. Tonks will be right in
dialog: front of you, keep close to her at
dialog: all times.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Don't stop, and whatever you do,
dialog: don't break formation. If any of us
dialog: are killed, the rest of you, keep
dialog: flying.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: If that were to happen, the
text: survivors, fly to the east. The
text: rear guard is standing by. They
dialog: will find you.
speaker_heading: TONKS
dialog: Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: We must be ready. This would be the
dialog: perfect moment for Voldemort to
dialog: strike Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Uh, is that very likely?
speaker_heading: KINGSLEY
dialog: No one's going to die.
text: Blue sparks blast into the sky.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: There's the second signal!
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Mount your brooms, everyone. Here
dialog: we go!
text: Seconds later, there is an explosion of green sparks in the
dialog: sky.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: The third signal, everyone. Let's
dialog: go!
text: They kick off from the ground, which is swiftly left behind.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Stay in formation!
dialog: 10.
text: They are not as high as the clouds yet.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: We need more height!
text: It is only seconds later, that another warning is shouted
dialog: their way.
text: A dementor soars towards them, tattered robes snapping in the
dialog: wind.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Contacts to the south!
speaker_heading: KINGSLEY
dialog: Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take
dialog: Harry! We'll slow them down!
text: The rest of the advanced guard peels away from the group.
text: Harry checks the sky around them. It appears to be clear.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: There's the other one, Alastor!
text: The other Dementor emerges very close by from a cloud.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Expecto--!
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Harry, leave it to us!
text: And Lupin peels away, rocketing towards the Dementor.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No!
text: Lupin goes straight at the Dementor, which smoothly flips
text: upwards, bypassing Lupin, but Lupin twists his broom around,
text: his wand drawn, and points it at the Dementor's retreating
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: 'Expecto Patronum!'
text: Lupin's PATRONOUS explodes from his wand tip, pulsing out
text: through the clouds at the Dementor. The light blasts into it,
text: and the Dementor, shrieking eerily, retreats back towards the
text: rest of the advanced guard.
text: Lupin rockets past Harry, Tonks, and Moody.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Get Harry to the safe house!
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Come on, Potter! Keep moving!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But I can help!
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Potter, getting yourself killed
dialog: won't do a thing. Now move!
text: Glaring at Moody, Harry wheels his broom around and the three
text: of them set off again, leaving the battle behind.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: We're not far, now!
text: Soon after, Lupin and the rest of the advanced guard return,
text: intact and without injury.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Did you get rid of them?
speaker_heading: KINGSLEY
dialog: They're gone, Alastor.
speaker_heading: TONKS
dialog: We're there!
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Prepare for descent! Form up around
dialog: Harry!
text: They cut through the clouds, gliding lower as they went.
text: Tonks touches down right before Harry did, the rest gliding
text: down while maintaining their formation around Harry.
text: All business, they draw their wands.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Stay here, Harry.
text: Several of the advanced guard move to the perimeter, to
dialog: secure it.
speaker_heading: KINGSLEY
dialog: Clear!
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Right, Harry, this way.
dialog: 12.
text: Harry follows him, Tonks and Lupin trailing after, wands at
text: the ready, eyes flicking to the buildings surrounding them.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Here, read this.
text: He hands Harry a piece of paper. It has written on it: "The
dialog: Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at
dialog: Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, London."
text: Harry looks at the gap between the houses, and suddenly a
text: door appears, followed by the rest of a large, gray, rather
text: imposing house.
text: Moody takes the paper from Harry and set it afire with his
dialog: wand.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: Come on, inside. Hurry.
text: LUPIN and TONKS step up, close to Harry, one on either side.
text: The guards at the perimeter close in a semi-circle around the
dialog: door.
text: LUPIN taps the door with his wand, and it cracks open.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch
dialog: anything.
scene_heading: INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT
text: Harry enters the musty entry hall. To one side is a staircase
text: leading up to the next level. At the base of the stair is a
text: dirty, graying sheet hanging on the wall, as if it were
dialog: covering something.
text: Behind him, the other members of the advanced guard are
text: entering. To make room, Harry steps to one side, and runs
text: into an umbrella stand, which clangs loudly as it hits the
dialog: ground.
text: To steady himself, he reaches out and pulls the sheet from
text: the wall. Behind it is a portrait of an unpleasant, old,
text: thin, woman.
speaker_heading: MRS. BLACK
dialog: Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants,
dialog: freaks, begone from this place! How
dialog: dare you befoul the house of my
dialog: fathers?!
dialog: 13.
text: SIRIUS BLACK comes running into the entry hall. He skids to a
text: halt next to Harry, looking up at MRS BLACK.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Shut up, you miserable old hag!
dialog: Quiet!
speaker_heading: MRS BLACK
dialog: Blood traitor, abomination, shame
dialog: of my flesh!
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Yes, yes, do shut up!
text: He throws the sheet over the picture, and the yells die away.
text: Panting, SIRIUS looks at Harry and grins. He wraps Harry in a
text: huge bear hug. Harry laughs.
text: Pulling away, Sirius smiles at Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Was that your--?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Mother, yes. Dear old mum.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But...why here?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: This house has been my family's for
dialog: centuries. It's mine now.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm the last of the Blacks. I
dialog: offered it up as headquarters for,
dialog: well, and Dumbledore accepted. It's
dialog: about the most useful thing I've
dialog: been able to do for a long while.
text: MRS WEASLEY enters the hall.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: Hello, Harry dear.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Mrs. Weasley!
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
text: Sirius, the meeting is about to
dialog: start!
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: Harry, dear, go on upstairs-
dialog: quietly, if you please. They're all
dialog: up there.
text: Harry looks up the stairs.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry!
text: Harry looks up the stairs and sees RON and HERMIONE standing
text: on the landing. He mounts the stairs to both of them,
text: grinning.
text: Hermione throws herself on Harry in a large hug, laughing.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Let him breathe, Hermione!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are
dialog: you furious with us, I bet you are!
speaker_heading: RON
speaker_heading: HERMIONE!
text: Hermione lets Harry go and takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Good to see you, mate.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Come on, inside.
text: They enter an adjacent bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: They sit down on separate beds.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Sorry we haven't written, Harry,
dialog: but Dumbledore made us promise not
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: We wanted to, mate, we really did,
dialog: but he thought they would get
dialog: intercepted.
dialog: 15.
text: There is an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: He thought you would be safest
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, real safe. Attacked by
dialog: Dementors, that's safe, that is.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: He was so angry when he heard. It
dialog: was...scary...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So, why's he keeping me in the
dialog: dark?
text: Hermione and Ron look awkward.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Didn't you bother asking?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: We've only seen him twice, and not
dialog: for very long. He's really busy.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So I get to spend the summer with
dialog: the Dursleys while you two are
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't
dialog: let us anywhere near the meetings.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You've still been here!
text: Hermione and Ron are looking aghast at Harry.
text: Harry looks away. There is a silence.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's been going on?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: We've already told you, we're not
dialog: privyed to the meetings. But we do
dialog: know a few things.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Some of the Order are following
dialog: known Death Eaters, like Lucious
dialog: Malfoy.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And they're guarding something.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s this Order everyone's
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: The Order of the Phoenix.
dialog: Dumbledore started it last time to
dialog: fight You-Know-Who. He only
dialog: reorganized it after last term.
text: Moments later, MRS. WEASLEY opens the door to their room.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: You can come down now, the
text: meeting's over.
text: They stand up to go.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley enter the
text: KITCHEN, which has been set up with long tables and chairs.
text: At the far end of the long table, MR. WEASLEY and CHARLIE
text: WEASLEY are talking quietly over a parchment.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: Arthur-
text: MR. WEASLEY looks up, sees them, and nods to Charlie, who
text: rolls up the parchment hastily, and rises from his seat,
text: moving across the room.
text: Harry sits down at the table, across from Sirius.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
text: Well, the Ministry is furious with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You did magic in front of your
dialog: muggle cousin.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: SIRIUS (cont'd)
dialog: You'll have to go to an
dialog: disciplinary meeting tomorrow.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay.
text: Harry stands up.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm not really hungry. I think I'll
dialog: go to bed.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You surprise me, Harry. I figured
dialog: the first thing you'd do is start
dialog: asking about Voldemort.
text: Harry pauses, then turns around. The room has gone very
text: still. Mrs. Weasley is glaring at Sirius.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I wanted to, but I didn't think
dialog: you'd tell me anything.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: And that was quite right, Harry!
dialog: You're much to young--
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: He has a right to know, Molly.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: It's not your decision!
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I know what Dumbledore said, but he
dialog: needs to know something.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: He's not a child, Molly.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: He's not an adult either!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He's not James.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: (stiffly)
dialog: I'm fully aware of who he is,
dialog: Molly.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: I only have Harry's best interests
dialog: at heart.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: He's not your son.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: Who else does he have, then?
text: Sirius stands, glaring at Mrs. Weasley.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: He's got me. He's like a son to me.
text: Harry stares at Sirius in surprise. Mrs. Weasley turns and
text: storms out.
text: Sirius sits, heavily.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: What do you want to know, Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
text: He's hiding for the moment, because
text: the Ministry is ignoring his return
dialog: and he doesn't want that to change.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You really messed things up for him
dialog: last year, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: The last person You-Know-Who wanted
dialog: to alert was Dumbledore.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And what's his plan?
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
text: He's building up his army again,
dialog: just like before.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And you're stopping him from
dialog: gaining followers?
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: We're doing our best, but it's
dialog: proving to be...difficult.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You see, when the Ministry of Magic
text: insists that Voldemort isn't back.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But...why?
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Fudge likes being Minister of
dialog: Magic. If it turns out that
text: Voldemort came back under his
dialog: watch, he'll be sacked.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But you're telling people, right?
dialog: Sirius laughed.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Well, they think I'm a mass-
dialog: murderer, Lupin is a werewolf,
dialog: Tonks and Arthur would lose their
dialog: jobs at the Ministry...
speaker_heading: LUPIN
text: But Dumbledore is doing all he can.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: If he keeps it up, he might end up
dialog: in Azkaban. And that would give You-
dialog: Know-Who a clear field to--
text: MR WEASLEY stops short and looks as if he'd nearly said too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You-Know-Who wants something.
dialog: Something he didn't have last time.
dialog: A weapon.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What kind of weapon?
text: Lupin and Sirius exchange looks.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say
dialog: anything more.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Harry sleeps. He dreams.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Harry moves slowly down a dark hallway. It has many, bolted
text: doors down its long sides.
text: Soon he is running. Then, suddenly, he is being pulled along,
text: the doors rushing past faster and faster. Harry can see the
text: end of the hallway, it is a blinding light, still only a
text: speck.
text: It grows larger as he rockets towards it, then he flies right
text: into it and the light explodes all around him, engulfing him.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Harry wakes with a CRY, sitting straight up in bed. He's
text: covered in sweat, looking disturbed.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - DAY
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY, MR WEASLEY, LUPIN, RON, HERMIONE, and GINNY are
text: standing in the hall, waiting, as Sirius and Harry descend
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: MRS WEASLEY
dialog: Morning, dear! Did you have a good
dialog: sleep?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, my scar kept hurting.
text: MR. WEASLEY and LUPIN exchange nervous glances.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: (bracingly)
dialog: Probably just nerves...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah...nerves...
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: Good luck, Harry!
text: She hugs Harry.
text: After the hug, Harry stands back, but is suddenly hugged by
dialog: Hermione.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: They'll have to let you off,
dialog: Harry... You were defending
dialog: yourself! I checked the laws.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Thanks, Hermione.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What does he get a hug for?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: (cooly)
dialog: When you have to go to a
dialog: disciplinary hearing at the
dialog: Ministry of Magic, I'll hug you
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Oh, sure, that's why.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Ronald Weasley, are you jealous?
speaker_heading: RON
text: (glancing at the smirking
dialog: Ginny and Mrs. Weasley)
dialog: Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just
dialog: doesn't seem fair that you hug one
dialog: friend more than the other, is
dialog: all...
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Would you like a hug?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (miffed)
dialog: No, I'd hate to force you...
text: Harry grins and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Well, come on, Harry. Time to go.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Bye.
text: He waves, and he and MR WEASLEY depart.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY
text: The street is not very crowded, as the sun rises in the east.
text: Harry and Mr. Weasley hurry along the sidewalk and come to a
scene_heading: PHONEBOOTH.
text: Mr. Weasley looks around cautiously.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Good, good, not very many Muggles.
text: He opens the PHONEBOOTH and slips inside. He beckons to
dialog: Harry.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Well, come on Harry, in we go.
text: Harry slips inside the booth, and Mr. Weasley, with some
text: difficulty, closes the door behind them.
text: Mr. Weasley picks up the phone and listens in the wrong end
dialog: for a moment.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: I do love using the Fellytone! Now,
dialog: let's see, what's the number
dialog: again...
text: He punches in SIX, TWO, FOUR, FOUR, TWO.
text: There is a tap on the glass of the box. Mr. Weasley glances
text: out of the window to see a MUGGLE MAN standing outside. The
text: MAN taps his watch impatiently.
text: Mr. Weasley holds up a finger, as to say, "just a second."
text: The MAN sighs and turns around, tapping his foot.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: Welcome to the Ministry of Magic.
dialog: Please state your business.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
text: Pleas stand by.
text: There is a pause, and then the whole phone booth begins to
text: sink down into the ground.
text: The MAN, his back to the booth, is completely oblivious.
scene_heading: INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - DAY
text: The booth sinks lower into the ground.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Usually I Apparate, but you're too
dialog: young, so I thought we'd take the
dialog: scenic route.
text: The booth SHUDDERS to a halt, and the door slides open,
text: revealing a large lobby, filled with busy-looking wizards and
dialog: witches going to and fro.
text: Harry and Mr. Weasley exit the phone booth and enter the
dialog: lobby.
text: The door to the PHONE BOOTH closes, and it slides up again,
text: out of sight.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: THe MUGGLE MAN stands tapping his foot.
text: The booth reemerges topside and stops, looking very innocent.
text: The man turns around, blinks, and glances around for the two
dialog: people that had been inside it before.
scene_heading: INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - DAY
text: Mr. Weasley walks through the crowd of wizards.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Keep close, Harry!
text: A stooped, timid-looking, white-haired wizard pushes his way
text: through the crowd towards Mr. Weasley.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Ah, Perkins, good morn-
speaker_heading: PERKINS
dialog: Arthur, they've changed the time of
dialog: Potter's hearing.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Blast! Dumbledore thought they
dialog: might try that.
speaker_heading: PERKINS
dialog: It started at eight!
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Good lord, that was five minutes
dialog: ago! Come on, Harry!
text: They break into a run. They jog down hallway after hallway,
text: then Mr Weasley leads Harry onto a large lift.
text: There are several other witches and wizards on it.
text: It descends shudderingly for a few moments, then stops.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: Department of Mysteries.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Department of Mysteries?
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Yep, I've got no idea what they get
dialog: up to in here, it's top secret.
text: The lift doors open. Harry and Mr. Weasley exit, running down
dialog: corridors.
text: Harry skids to a stop and looks down a dark hallway. Mr.
text: Weasley stops as well, and glances back at Harry.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: Come on, Harry!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I've been there before...
text: Mr. WEASLEY looks nervous, then grabs Harry's robes and drag
dialog: him along.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: Now, Harry, I find that highly
dialog: unlikely...
dialog: 25.
text: A few moments later, they arrive.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: There you are, Harry, in you
dialog: go...good luck...
text: Harry enters the chamber.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: One side of the courtroom is an elevated zigarat-shaped
text: series of seats carved from black stone.
text: The whole room is dark, save a light shining through from the
text: ceiling down on the center of the room, where a single wooden
text: chair sits, covered in chains.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: You're late.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Er...sorry.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: No matter, the accused will take
dialog: his seat.
text: Harry does so, glancing nervously at the chains on it.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Very well, we are ready to begin.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Witness for the Defence, Albus
dialog: Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
text: Harry turns in his seat.
text: Dumbledore stands by the door of the COURTROOM, looking up at
dialog: the Minister.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Ah...you...er...got our message
dialog: that the time had changed, did you?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: (cheerfully)
dialog: Must have missed it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: However, due to a fortunate
dialog: mistake, I arrived at the Ministry
text: three hours early.
dialog: 26.
text: DUMBLEDORE conjures up a SQUASHY, CHINTZ armchair next to
text: Harry's and sits down with a mild squeak.
text: He steeples his fingers and looks up at the Minister with an
text: expression of polite interest.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Well. The...ah...charges.
text: He consults his notes.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: The charges against the accused
dialog: shall now be read into the record:
dialog: That the accused did with
dialog: deliberation and fore-knowledge of
dialog: the illegality of his actions,
dialog: produce a patronus charm in full
text: sight of a Muggle.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: (To Harry)
dialog: You are Harry James Potter?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: And you conjured a patronus on the
dialog: night of the eleventh of August?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes, but-
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Within full sight of a Muggle?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes, but-
speaker_heading: SUSAN BONES
dialog: You produced a Patronus? A fully-
text: formed Patronus, with a clearly-
dialog: defined shape?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN BONES
dialog: That is most remarkable, Mr.
dialog: Potter.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: It doesn't matter how impressive it
dialog: was!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But I did it because of the
dialog: Dementors!
speaker_heading: SUSAN BONES
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: My cousin and I were attacked by
dialog: Dementors. That's why I had to use
text: the Patronus, to drive them away.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's the truth!
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Of course it is.
speaker_heading: SUSAN BONES
dialog: Dementors in Little Whinging?
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly
dialog: lying.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Actually, we have a witness to the
dialog: presence of the Dementors in
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: We haven't got time to-
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I may be wrong, but I do believe
dialog: that it says somewhere in the
dialog: Wizagammot Charter of Rights that
dialog: the Accused has the right to
dialog: present witnesses to prove his or
dialog: her case? In fact, I do believe I
dialog: wrote that particular bit myself.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Very well. Weasley, fetch the
dialog: witness.
text: Percy goes to the door and lets MRS. FIGG in.
text: She stands in front of Harry and Dumbledore nervously.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Full name?
speaker_heading: MRS. FIGG
dialog: Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of
dialog: Little Whinging.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: So...what is your story?
speaker_heading: FIGG
dialog: I was sitting on my porch when I
dialog: saw the two Dementors gliding
text: towards the two boys.
speaker_heading: SUSAN BONES
dialog: What did the Dementors look like?
speaker_heading: FIGG
dialog: Well, they were big and wore great,
text: tattered cloaks.
text: There is some murmuring among the Wizengamot at that.
speaker_heading: SUSAN BONES
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: FIGG
dialog: I-I felt them. It was
dialog: horrible...like I would never be
text: happy again.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Very well, you may go.
text: MRS FIGG hurrys from the COURTROOM.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Not very convincing.
speaker_heading: SUSAN BONES
dialog: Oh, I disagree. She described their
dialog: effects very completely.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: So two Dementors just happen to be
dialog: in Little Whinging? I think not...
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Only if the Dementors are still
dialog: taking their orders from only the
dialog: Ministry these days. I believe you
dialog: know my views on this, Cornelius.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Yes, and they're nothing but bilge,
dialog: Dumbledore.
text: UMBRIDGE shifts into the light. She is a short, ugly, toad-
dialog: like woman.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you
dialog: just accused the Ministry of Magic
dialog: of ordering an attack on this boy?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: If the Dementors are taking their
dialog: orders from the Ministry
dialog: exclusively, then it must certainly
dialog: follow logically that someone in
dialog: the Ministry ordered the attack.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And in that case, I'm sure the
dialog: Ministry will make a full inquiry.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Dementors are irrelevant!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: On the contrary, Cornelius. If they
dialog: were there, then Harry was acting
dialog: in self-defense, which is perfectly
dialog: allowable under Clause Seven of the
dialog: Decree of Reasonable Restriction of
dialog: Underaged Wizardry.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We are all in agreement on this?
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Well, yes, if he's telling the
dialog: truth!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You have heard it from eye-
dialog: witnesses, Cornelius.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Very well, all for clearing the
dialog: accused of charges?
text: He glances around the room, noting all the hands in the air.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: All opposed?
text: Only a few hands.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Fine! Cleared of all charges!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Excellent.
text: Dumbledore gets out of his chair, vanishes it with the wave
text: of a wand, and sweeps from the COURTROOM.
text: Harry gets out of the wooden chair, glances upward at
dialog: Umbridge.
text: Their eyes meet for a split second. She glowers at him.
text: Harry exits.
scene_heading: INT. HALL - DAY
text: Harry exits the COURTROOM to find Mr. Weasley standing
text: outside, beaming.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: Harry, you've been let off! That's
dialog: wonderful!
text: The door opens again and the whole of the Wizengamot exits.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: You were tried by the full court?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think so, yeah.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Well, no matter. Let's go home.
text: Just then, Percy exits and brushes by Mr. Weasley without
text: even looking at him.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Er...is Percy mad at you?
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit
dialog: of a row. He, well, he sided with
dialog: Fudge and the rest of us sided with
text: Dumbledore, so Percy left.
text: They begin walking away from the courtroom, when they come
text: upon Fudge talking quietly with LUCIUS MALFOY, standing at
text: the mouth of the corridor Harry had recognized earlier.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Well, well, if it isn't Patronus
dialog: Potter.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The Minister here was just telling
dialog: me how very lucky an escape you
dialog: just had. Quite
text: astonishing...snakelike, in fact.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Come now, Potter, I really don't
dialog: think that private matters between
dialog: the Minister and myself are any
dialog: concern of yours.
text: Lucius moves closer to Harry.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: (lowly)
dialog: All you need to concern yourself
dialog: about are...your dreams, Potter.
text: And Lucius smiles malevolently at Harry.
text: Lucius steps back and turns to the Minister.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Shall we continue this in your
dialog: office, Fudge?
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Certainly.
text: Harry watches them go.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If he wanted to talk to the
dialog: Minister, why down here?
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Dunno, Harry. Some things are just
dialog: beyond comprehension.
text: As he speaks, Mr Weasley glances down the long, dark hallway,
text: with a worried look.
scene_heading: INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY
text: Harry stands in the kitchen of GRIMMAULD PLACE, surrounded by
text: Ron, Ginny, Fred, George, Hermione, Sirius, Lupin, Mr and Mrs
text: Weasley, and Tonks.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: I knew it!
text: In the background, Ginny, Fred, and George are dancing a
dialog: strange JIG.
scene_heading: FRED, GEORGE, AND GINNY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: He got off, he got off, he got off!
text: Hermione hugs Harry again. Ron glowers at her.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Settle down, you three!
text: The chanting and dancing dies away. Mrs Weasley exits the
dialog: Kitchen.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with
text: Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again.
dialog: Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes
dialog: in, would you?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Yeah, absolutely.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Well, I'd better be off. I've got a
dialog: bewitched vomiting toilet to deal
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: George, remember that concept.
text: Vomiting Toilet.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Right you are, Fred.
speaker_heading: MR WEASLEY
dialog: Also, I'm covering for Tonks on
dialog: guard duty later tonight, so I
dialog: won't be back until late.
text: Harry's scar explodes in pain. He yelps, and claps his hands
text: to his forehead.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Harry!
text: Harry gasps with pain and falls to his knees. Then, as
text: suddenly as it had come, the pain vanishes. Shaken, Harry
text: gasps as Sirius helps him over to a chair.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You all right, Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is
dialog: getting stronger.
text: Sirius gives a worried glance to Lupin, who looks grim.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Harry sits on his bunk, thinking. Sirius enters the room, but
text: Harry barely reacts, still gazing into space.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Harry, I've got something that
dialog: might interest you.
text: Harry looks up. Sirius sits on the edge of the bed and
text: brandishes an old, tattered photo.
text: Harry takes it.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: This was the original Order of the
dialog: Phoenix. Found it while we were
dialog: cleaning.
text: Harry looks down at all the smiling faces.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore,
text: right next to Dedalus Diggle;
dialog: Marlene McKinnon, she was killed
dialog: two weeks after this was taken...;
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS (cont'd)
dialog: then there's Frank and Alice
text: Longbottom, tortured into insanity
dialog: by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course..
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Ah, Edgar Bones, they only ever
dialog: found bits of him; Caradoc
dialog: Dearborn, he vanished six months
dialog: later...; Hagrid, of course; Gideon
dialog: and Fabian Prewett, it took five
dialog: Death Eaters to finish those two
dialog: off; me, of course...; and there
dialog: they are!
text: Harry watches his parents beam up at him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: My parents.
text: He watches the picture for a long second.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I miss them, Sirius...
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I know, Harry, I know. I miss them
dialog: too.
text: He puts his arm around Harry.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: It's not fair that I got to spend
dialog: so much time with them and you
dialog: didn't...
text: Harry closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why'd they have to die, Sirius,
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I don't know, Harry. I wish I did,
dialog: but I don't...
text: There is a long moment of silence.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I know I'm not your father, Harry,
dialog: but I'll always be there for you,
dialog: if I can help it...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 35.
text: The door cracks open, and an ugly, menacing HOUSE ELF enters,
text: looking around suspiciously.
speaker_heading: KREACHER
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: That mudblood with the scar, he
dialog: cries, why does he cry so...?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Kreacher, get out of here! Now!
speaker_heading: KREACHER
dialog: Oh, how the old Mistress would weep
dialog: to see the traitor in her house...
text: The elf exits.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who..who was that?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
text: Kreacher. He's been alone with the
dialog: house for years, he's gone a bit
dialog: funny.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You'd better get some rest.
text: Sirius gets up and exits.
text: Ron and Hermione burst into the room seconds later.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry, Ron and I, we've been named
dialog: House Prefects!
text: She hands Harry a letter.
text: There are a few seconds of parchment ripping.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: What about you, Harry?
text: But there is no PREFECT BADGE in Harry's letter.
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Are you sure? I would have thought
dialog: you would get one!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm sure. Nothing.
dialog: 36.
text: There is an awkward moment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So...congratulations Ron,
dialog: Hermione...
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Well...thanks Harry.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Come on, lets go back downstairs!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.
text: Harry lays down on his bed away from them. He hears them
dialog: leave.
text: He is alone.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - DAY
text: The HOGWARTS EXPRESS rushes past the moors of SCOTLAND on its
text: way to Hogwarts. Soon it is night again.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGSMEAD - NIGHT
text: Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione exit the HOGWARTS EXPRESS and
text: move quickly though the crowd of students to the carriages
dialog: that would take them to the castle.
text: As they prepare to climb into one of the carriages, Harry
text: stops and stares towards the front of the carriage.
text: There is a large reptilian, horse-like creature harnessed to
dialog: the front whereas always before there was nothing.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (looking)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: That...that...thing!
text: RON stares for a long moment, then looks at Harry.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Harry, there's nothing there,
dialog: mate...
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes it is, it's right there!
text: He points. Ron shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LUNA LOVEGOOD
dialog: I see them too, Harry.
text: Harry turns to her. LUNA LOVEGOOD is a spacy-looking girl,
text: yet pretty in her own right.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Er...you are?
speaker_heading: LUNA
dialog: Luna. Luna Lovegood.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, thanks Luna.
text: They clamber into the carriage, Luna following. It starts
dialog: moving.
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT
text: Harry looks out into the darkness of the HOGWARTS GROUNDS. He
text: spies Hagrid's hut in the dark. All the lights are off
dialog: within.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I hope he's all right...
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What if he were still on his...
text: He glances at Luna, who has vanished behind the latest
text: edition of the QUIBBLER MAGAZINE.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: -.-what if he's still on his
dialog: mission from Dumbledore?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, could be.
text: Moments later the carriages halt, and the students pile out.
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS GREAT HALL - NIGHT
text: Hogwarts Headmaster, PROFESSOR DUMBLEDORE, a wizzened old man
text: with a great white beard to his belt and long white hair,
text: stands to address the school.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I beg a few moments of your
dialog: attention, as I have a few start of
dialog: term announcements. Right off, our
dialog: caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has
dialog: reminded me for what he says is the
dialog: four-hundred and sixty-second time
dialog: that he had an annually updated
dialog: list of various banned items,
dialog: usually introduced by our humour
dialog: experts Fred and George Weasley...
text: Fred and George stand and take a bow to cheering, laughter,
text: and yells.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-which are posted in an extensive
text: list on the door to Mr. Filch's
dialog: door.
text: Harry grins at Fred and George.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Also, we have two staffing changes
dialog: this year. Professor Grubby-Plank
dialog: will be taking the post of Care of
dialog: Magical Creatures post as Professor
text: Hagrid is on...extended leave.
text: Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange glances.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Additionally, we have Professor
dialog: Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to
dialog: fill the post of Defense Against
dialog: the Dark Arts-
text: At this, UMBRIDGE stands and clears her throat.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could
dialog: address the school?
text: Dumbledore looks taken aback. McGonogall glares at UMBRIDGE.
text: Dumbledore sits down and invites Umbridge forward.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are
dialog: we all doing tonight? I thought I
dialog: would just say a few words. I am
dialog: here at the Ministry of Magic's
dialog: bequest, under Educational Decree
dialog: twenty-two, which states that if
dialog: the Headmaster of Hogwarts is
dialog: unable to fill any teaching post
dialog: the Ministry shall select one for
dialog: the position.
text: Dumbledore inclines his head. There is murmuring from the
dialog: students.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: The Ministry has always considered
dialog: the magical education of our
dialog: children to be of vital importance,
dialog: and the passing down of this
dialog: ancient and noble art must be given
dialog: to the next generation, lest it be
dialog: lost forever...
dialog: (pause)
text: Without progress, stagnation. But
dialog: progress for progress's sake is to
dialog: be discouraged, for our art
dialog: requires no tinkering.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: A balance must be attained, the new
dialog: and the old, permanence and change,
dialog: tradition and innovation, order and
dialog: chaos.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There are large changes coming
text: soon, changes walking the fine line
dialog: between order and chaos. Know only
dialog: that these changes are for the
dialog: best, and to prevent the
dialog: destruction of our civilization
dialog: from its own decay. Thank you.
text: Umbridge smiles at them all, but to Harry, the smile seems a
text: little forced, a little fake.
scene_heading: INT. GRIFFINDOR DORMS - NIGHT
text: Harry enters the boys DORMITORY. Within the room are a number
text: of POSTER BEDS. Harry goes to his and sits down.
text: Also in the room are DEAN THOMAS, NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, and
scene_heading: SEAMUS FINNIGAN.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: So why didn't your mum want you to
dialog: come back to Hogwarts, Seamus?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Me mam didn't want me to come back
dialog: to Hogwarts...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Well...because of you...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What did I do?
speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: She...well, she figure's you're,
dialog: well...you're lying about You-Know-
dialog: Who and Dumbledore's a right
dialog: nutter...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where'd she get that from?
text: Seamus picks up an edition of the DAILY PROPHET and tosses it

speaker_heading: SEAMUS
dialog: Well...yeah...
speaker_heading: HARRY

scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS - NIGHT

text: Hedwig sits on the PARAPET next to Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HARRY

scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS - DAY

scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS - DAY

text: corner, and pushes through the door to the DEFENSE AGAINST
text: THE DARK ARTS CLASSROOM.
scene_heading: INT. CLASS - DAY
text: The whole class looks around at Harry as he comes staggering
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sorry, Professor...
text: PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE smiles, TOAD-LIKE, at Harry.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Hmm, let's see, five points from
dialog: Gryffindor for coming in late.
text: Harry frowns, but sits down next to Ron and Hermione.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Now, as I was saying before Mr.
text: Potter interrupted with his antics,
dialog: your Defense Against the Dark Arts
dialog: education has been rather
dialog: fragmented and disjointed in your
dialog: past classes, hasn't it?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Know now that this is about to be
dialog: rectified.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE (cont'd)
dialog: I will be following a pre-approved
dialog: Ministry-prepared, theory-centered
dialog: Defense lesson plan.
text: She waves her wand at the blackboard and words are written
text: down on it.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Copy this down.
text: Everyone opens their books and begins copying, except
text: Hermione, who sits with her book unopened, her hand in the
dialog: air.
text: Umbridge ignores her.
text: However, within the next few seconds, nearly the whole class
text: is watching Hermione. Umbridge sighs.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I wanted to know something about
dialog: your course aims.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Well, they should be perfectly self-
dialog: evident.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Well, I don't think they are. They
dialog: say nothing about actually doing
dialog: spells.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I can imagine no circumstance in my
dialog: class where you would need to use
dialog: spells, my dear!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: But surely the whole point of
dialog: Defense against the dark arts is
dialog: practical application?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Miss Granger, this class has been
dialog: approved by Ministry experts. Are
dialog: you a Ministry Expert?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: No, but-
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Then you have no business
dialog: challenging those who are. We will
dialog: be learning about spells in a safe,
dialog: risk-free environment-
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: But we've got O.W.L.s coming up!
dialog: You expect us to do the spells with
dialog: no practice?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What good's theory in the real
dialog: world?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: This is school, not the real world,
dialog: Mr. Potter. There is nothing out
dialog: there waiting to get you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What about Lord Voldemort?
text: The whole class flinched at the sound of the name.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr.
dialog: Potter. Let me set the record
dialog: straight.
text: She stands behind her desk, leaning on her knuckles.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Some of you have been told that a
text: certain dead wizard has returned.
dialog: This is a lie.
text: Harry stands up, knocking his books to the ground, a look of
text: livid rage on his face.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It-is-NOT-a-LIE!
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Mr. Potter, you have just landed
dialog: yourself in detention!
text: Harry moves around his desk stiffly, trembling with rage, his
dialog: eyes dangerous.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So, according to you, Cedric
dialog: Diggory dropped dead? Or are you
dialog: calling me a murderer?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: The boy's death was a tragic
dialog: accident.
text: Harry has reached the desk. He slams his fists against the
text: wood, thrusting his face right up to Umbridge's, glaring at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
text: The class is deathly still. PARVATI PATIL is covering her
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Mr Potter, you have earned yourself
dialog: a week's worth of detentions!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, talk to somebody who cares.
dialog: Voldemort killed Cedric, and you
dialog: know it.
text: Umbridge snatches a QUILL up and scribbles a note, and hands
dialog: it to Harry.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: That goes to Professor McGonogall,
dialog: dear.
text: Harry rips it from her hand and storms out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLS - DAY
text: Harry storms down the halls, turns a corner, and practically
text: kicks open the door to McGonogall's office.
scene_heading: INT. McGONOGALL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harry stomps in and hands the note to McGonogall.
text: She takes it and glances at it.
speaker_heading: MCGONOGALL
dialog: Is this true? Did you shout at
dialog: Professor Umbridge?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. But she called me a liar!
speaker_heading: MCGONOGALL
dialog: My dear boy, do use your common
dialog: sense! Umbridge is reporting
dialog: directly to Fudge. She is here
dialog: to...interfere...with Dumbledore.
dialog: And things could get much worse,
dialog: trust me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Use caution, always, Potter. Do not
dialog: mess with Dolorus Umbridge, she is
dialog: dangerous. The Order's hands are
dialog: tied at Hogwarts, Harry. If you get
dialog: too deep into trouble, we may not
dialog: be able to get you out. Do you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes, Professor.
speaker_heading: MCGONOGALL
dialog: Good. Off you go.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - DAY
text: Harry, Hermione, and Ron sit in a corner of the large common
text: room, trying to ignore the talking and chattering going on
text: all around them.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: How can Dumbledore let that
dialog: horrible woman teach? And when
dialog: we're taking our OWL tests too!
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You reckon she's here to spy on us?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Well, not us specifically, but
dialog: definitely Dumbledore and the
dialog: Order.
text: At that moment, ANGELINA JOHNSON comes up to them.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Well, way to go, Potter. Your
dialog: detention is at the same time as
dialog: Quidditch practice!
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh! Sorry...
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: Yeah, well, you're going to have to
dialog: get out of it somehow. We're
dialog: holding tryouts for Keeper now
dialog: Wood's gone, and I wanted to have
dialog: the whole team there.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'll never get out of it, Angelina.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: Well, just...don't do it again!
text: And she storms off.
scene_heading: INT. COURTYARD - DAY
text: Harry, Ron, and Hermione are heading back inside to the
scene_heading: GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM.
text: The sun is setting in the distance.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Well, Harry, shall we start on
dialog: Snape's report?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Later, I've got detention.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Good luck, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. UMBRIDGE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: The door to her office creaks open, and Harry enters.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Ah, Potter. Sit down.
text: Harry sits in a chair right in front of her desk.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: You're going to be doing lines,
dialog: tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be
dialog: using this quill.
text: The QUILL was BLOOD-RED and sinister looking.
dialog: 47.
text: Harry takes it.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: You will write "I will not tell
dialog: lies" until I tell you to stop.
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: There's no ink.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Oh...you won't need ink.
text: Harry begins to write, then gasps in pain. He looks at his
text: hand, and finds that "I will not tell lies" has carved itself
text: in the skin of his hand, and the quill had written the words
text: on the parchment in bright red BLOOD.
text: Then the words healed over again, on his hand.
text: Harry glances at Umbridge, who is smiling evilly.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Problem, Potter?
text: Harry shakes his head and returns to his lines. He gasps
text: after writing it again, the words on his hand had gotten
text: deeper. Gritting his teeth, he forces himself on.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
text: Harry's shaking, weak hand scratches the final line of the
text: evening, the words on the back of his hand not even healing
text: any longer, but bleeding profusely.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: That's enough for this evening.
dialog: Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see
dialog: if we can get the message to sink
text: in a bit deeper.
text: Harry staggers to his feet, weak and pale, and staggers from
dialog: the office.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS - NIGHT
text: Harry exits Umbridge's office and staggers down the hall and
text: around a corner, then breaks into a terrified run.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Harry moves down the dark hallway again, slowly,
text: meaningfully. Locked doors are all around him, lining the
text: walls as far down as he could see.
text: He breaks into a jog, and then a run, then a sprint. The
text: doors rush past him.
text: Suddenly an invisible force grabs him and pulls him along,
text: faster and faster, the doors a blur. Then he saw the end, a
text: blinding light, which he blasts into with a SMACK, and as the
text: light fades, he catches a glimpse of a further room, beyond
text: the light, for only an instant.
text: Then it too is gone, and Harry awakes with a yelp, hands
text: pressed against his scar, which is BURNING horribly.
text: He rubs it, until the pain goes away.
scene_heading: INT, GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - DAY
text: Hermione steps into the common room, looking puzzled.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Hey, Harry.
text: He looks up from his parchment.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Have you seen Ron? I can’t find him
dialog: anywhere.
text: Harry shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, I haven’t.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: He’s been acting fishy all week.
dialog: He’s up to something.
text: Harry packs up his parchments.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (absentmindedly)
dialog: Uh huh.
text: He stands.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Another night, another detention.
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: INT. UMBRIDGE’S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Harry scratches away with the horrible quill, gritting his
text: teeth, determined not to make a sound. Sweat beads on his
text: face, and blood is flowing freely from the cuts on his hand.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: That’s enough for tonight, Potter.
dialog: Let’s see that hand.
text: She reaches out and touches his hand. Instantly, pain
text: explodes in his scar and Harry leaps back as if electrocuted,
text: stumbling due to blood loss. He clutches at his scar in
dialog: agony.
text: Harry stares at her in horror. She grins unpleasantly.
text: He staggers backward and out the door to her office without
dialog: another word.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Harry attempts to run down the hallway, swaying on his feet
text: as a drunk. Blood pours down his hand, dribbling onto the
dialog: floor.
text: He staggers toward the PORTRAIT HOLE back to the Gryffindor
text: commons. It stands open, and Harry passes through it.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
text: The Quidditch team stands around, talking. Ron spies Harry.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Harry! I tried out for Quidditch
dialog: Keeper at the tryouts! I’m on the
dialog: team!
text: Everything stops as they take in the sight of Harry, pale and
text: gaunt, barely standing, with one hand clutching his scar and
text: the other hanging limply at his side, covered in blood.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Harry--bloody hell!
text: Harry’s knees give out, and he falls to the floor. Fred,
text: George, Ron, and Hermione lift him up.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: He’s got to be taken to the
dialog: hospital wing.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: No. Can’t give...Umbridge the
dialog: satisfaction...
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Umbridge did this?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You said she was making you do
dialog: lines!
text: They settle Harry back down.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: She is. But the quill has some sort
dialog: of spell on it. It uses blood for
dialog: ink.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: That old hag! She’s sick!
text: Hermione looks horrified.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Oh, Harry. You’ve got to go to
dialog: Dumbledore. You can’t keep this up.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, I’m telling anyone.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry, I really think you should
dialog: tell--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No!
text: Harry climbs slowly to his feet.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don’t need his help. I don’t need
dialog: anyone’s help.
text: He pushes past them and limps up into the boys’ dorm.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Harry sits at the Gryffindor table, bent over a parchment,
text: his quill scratching away. He looks up, finished.
text: Ron and Hermione join him.
text: Hermione is staring up at the teacher’s table. Hagrid’s chair
text: is still empty.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Hagrid’s still not back yet. I hope
dialog: he’s all right.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I’ve asked Sirius about it.
text: He indicates the parchment. Hermione pulls it towards her.
text: She looks startled.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry, you can’t write to him! Owls
dialog: are being intercepted, it isn’t
dialog: safe.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Don’t worry, Hermione, I wrote it
dialog: in code. Anyway, I figured I need
dialog: to tell someone about Umbridge. My
dialog: scar hurt again last night in
dialog: detention.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Always knew she was a bit fishy.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: You think she’s working for You-
dialog: Know-Who?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, it’s a possibility, isn’t it?
text: Hermione looks dubious.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I suppose so. He could have her
dialog: under the Imperious Curse, though
dialog: it’s unlikely. Dumbledore’d know.
text: Harry leans in even closer.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, but Dumbledore didn’t have a
dialog: choice, did he? She’d been sent
dialog: here by the Ministry.
text: Hermione unfurls a copy of the Daily Prophet.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Anything about Harry?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: No, nothing.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Wait! Look at this!
text: She slaps the paper down on the table. Harry and Ron lean
dialog: closer.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: (reading)
text: “Trespass at Ministry. Sturgis
dialog: Podmore has appeared before the
dialog: Wizengamot with charges of trespass
dialog: and attempted robbery at the
dialog: Ministry of Magic on the 31st of
dialog: August. He was arrested when found
text: trying to break into a top-security
text: door at one in the morning. Podmore
dialog: was convicted and sentenced to six
dialog: months in Azkaban.”
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sturgis Podmore?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Wait, he’s one of the Order!
text: Hermione glares at Ron.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Quiet!
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Do you s’pose it was a frameup?
text: They stop talking. Dean Thomas walks by.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Come on, we'll be late for Charms
dialog: if we don’t hurry.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Right.
dialog: 53.
text: Harry takes back the parchment and stands.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You go on without me. I want to
dialog: send this.
dialog: They part ways.
scene_heading: INT. OWLRY - DAY
text: Harry steps into the OWLRY, the floor covered in straw and
text: hundreds of owls hooting softly on many roosts.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hedwig!
text: Hedwig flutters down to him. He gives the parchment to the
text: owl. She flies out of the open window and soars away, out of
text: sight over the Forbidden Forest.
text: Harry watches the forest. A huge animal which appeared to be
text: a winged reptilian horse. Harry frowns.
text: Behind him, the door creaks open. He turns to see CHO CHANG
text: entering.
speaker_heading: HARRY
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Oh...hi. Didn’t think anyone else
dialog: would be up here.
text: She moves to a brown school owl. There is an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Have you found a new Keeper for
dialog: Quiddich?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley.
text: She ties the package to the owl.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: He any good?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, he made the team. I missed
dialog: the tryouts.
text: She lets go of the owl and it flies out the window.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Yeah, Umbridge. You were really
text: brave, standing up to her.
text: Harry straightens, smiling.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah...well, it was the truth.
text: The owlry door bursts open again. ARGUS FILCH charges in.
speaker_heading: FILCH
dialog: Right, Potter. I’1l have what
dialog: you're sending.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FILCH
dialog: I have had a tip-off that you are
dialog: ordering a large quantity of
dialog: Dungbombs! Now hand it over.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You’re too late, it’s gone.
text: Filch looks furious.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Yeah, I saw him send it.
text: Filch regards her for a moment, then turns back to Harry.
speaker_heading: FILCH
text: I get a single whiff of a Dungbomb
dialog: in this castle, Potter...and you’re
dialog: mine.
text: He turns and departs.
text: There is a silence for a moment as Harry and Cho process what
dialog: had happened.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Um, you weren’t ordering dungbombs,
dialog: were you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: I wonder why he’d think you were.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, see you, Harry.
text: She turns and leaves the Owlry.
text: Harry smiles.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: What a load of rubbish!
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS COURTYARD - DAY
text: Hermione, Harry, and Ron are making their way back up to the
text: castle. Ron and Harry are in Quiddich robes and caked in mud.
text: Ron is looking upset.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: You, ordering dungbombs. I mean,
dialog: really.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, it doesn’t make any sense.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Unless whoever tipped Filch off was
dialog: interested in reading your mail,
dialog: Harry. I mean, doesn’t it seem a
dialog: little too coincidental that Filch
dialog: was tipped off when you happened to
dialog: be sending a message to Sirius?
text: Harry looks thoughtful.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, that does seem weird. You
dialog: figure its Umbridge?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Just then Malfoy appears close by.
speaker_heading: MALFOY
dialog: Hey, Weasley! Nice job out on the
dialog: field today! You’1l be our best
dialog: player on the pitch!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Get bent, Malfoy!
dialog: 56.
text: Draco and the other Slytherins laugh. Ron shakes his head as
dialog: they walk.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: No, he’s right. I’m useless out
dialog: there. Complete rubbish.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It’s your first practice. Don’t
dialog: worry about it.
text: Ron looks unusually pale.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I’m gonna make a fool of myself out
dialog: there.
text: Harry gasps and rubs at his scar.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Are you all right, Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. Its just...the pain’s getting
dialog: stronger.
text: Ron and Hermione exchange glances.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
text: Harry, Ron, and Hermione sit near each other in the common
text: room. Around them, people talk, laugh, and study.
text: Hermione sighs and shuts her book with a SNAP.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I don’t know how we’re ever going
dialog: to pass our O.W.L.s in Defense
dialog: against the dark arts without any
dialog: practice! That Umbridge woman is
dialog: SO...
text: She looks at Harry and Ron.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: We've got to do something about
dialog: her.
text: The boys stare at her.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah, well, poison should do the
dialog: trick.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Don’t be silly, Ron. Not her, I
dialog: meant her teaching. We’re not going
dialog: to learn anything in that class.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, that’s true.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Anyway, I thought we should do it
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Defense Against the Dark Arts. We'd
dialog: teach ourselves.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don’t know...
text: There is a TAPPING sound coming from the window. They turn
dialog: and look.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Hermes?
text: He goes to the window and opens it. Hermes deposits a letter
text: in Ron’s hands, turns, and vanishes out of the window again.
text: The last Gryiffindor heads for bed, leaving the common room
text: deserted except for the three of them.
text: Ron opens it and returns to his seat.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: It’s from Percy!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Read it.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: “Dear Ron, congratulations on
dialog: becoming a Prefect. For some time I
dialog: was worried you would take the
dialog: ‘Fred and George’ route instead of
dialog: following in my footsteps.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: RON (cont'd)
dialog: You can imagine my relief that this
dialog: is not the case.”
text: He looks incredulously at Harry and Hermione.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Keep reading.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: “Given your attachment to using me
dialog: as a role model, I will give you a
dialog: bit of advice from one respecter of
dialog: authority to another.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It is likely that you have been
dialog: seeing quite a lot of Harry Potter
dialog: of late. I must recommend you break
dialog: ties with that boy as soon as
dialog: possible. He may be Dumbledore’s
dialog: favorite, but Dumbledore may not be
text: in charge at Hogwarts much longer.
dialog: Your loyalties should lie with the
dialog: Ministry of Magic, not Dumbledore
dialog: and Potter’s personality cult.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Please do not fear breaking ties
dialog: with Potter. If trouble arrises, go
dialog: to Dolores Umbridge, a truly
dialog: delightful woman.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I hope you will carefully consider
dialog: my advice to you, Ron. Don’t let
dialog: the dangerous errors of Dumbledore,
dialog: Potter, and unfortunately our
dialog: parents lure you into destroying a
dialog: perfectly good career. Percy.”
text: Ron looks up, aghast.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, if you want to, ah, “break
dialog: ties” with me, I swear I won’t get
dialog: violent.
text: Ron tears the letter in half.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: He is the world’s biggest git!
text: He hurls the pieces into the fireplace.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Watch it!
dialog: 59.
text: Ron jumps, startled.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sirius?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Right you are. Got you letter and
dialog: though we should talk in person.
text: He cranes his neck at the burning letter.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Letter from Percy.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah, full of the usual rubbish.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Except he did mention that
dialog: Dumbledore might not be in charge
dialog: here much longer.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: It doesn’t surprise me. Fudge wants
text: Dumbledore out.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
text: He’s worried Dumbledore is trying
dialog: to turn the students against the
dialog: Ministry.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Well, that would explain why
dialog: Umbridge isn’t teaching us anything
dialog: useful in Defense Against the Dark
dialog: Arts.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Exactly. The Ministry doesn’t want
dialog: you trained in combat.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What does he think Dumbledore is
dialog: going to do, raise an army?
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: That’s exactly what he’s worried
text: about. Fudge is getting more
dialog: paranoid about Dumbledore every
dialog: day.
text: There is a nervous silence in the room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What do you know about Umbridge?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: She’s a nasty piece of work.
dialog: Apparently she hates part-humans.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Could she be a Death Eater?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
text: The Order seriously doubts it.
dialog: She’s no picnic, but she’s no Death
dialog: Eater either.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But she’s evil.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: The world isn’t split into the
dialog: Order and the Death Eaters, Harry.
text: Harry sits back, looking unsatisfied.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: As to your question about Hagrid,
dialog: well, no one is really sure what
dialog: happened to him, actually. He was
dialog: supposed to be back a while ago.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
text: Dumbledore’s not worried about him,
dialog: though. Hagrid’s tough. He’1l be
dialog: all right.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: But if he was supposed to be back
dialog: by now...
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Look, asking questions about him
dialog: will only make it more obvious that
text: he’s not back.
text: Suddenly he glances with concern at the wall of the
dialog: fireplace.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Get out of here!
text: His head vanishes. A split second later, a stubby-fingered
text: hand appears in the fire, groping for Sirius’s head.
text: The three of them run for their dormitories.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR BOYS DORM - NIGHT
text: Harry lays on his bed, fast asleep. He dreams...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - NIGHT
text: Harry strolls along the darkened corridor, passing the many
text: grey doors. There is only one door that interests him. It
text: lies at the end of the long hall, pure WHITE LIGHT shining
text: through the gap between door and jam.
text: Harry moves towards it, bathed in shining light. He reaches
text: out his hand to the door and grasps the handle. It is locked.
text: He shakes the handle and hits the door.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR BOYS DORM - NIGHT
text: Harry’s eyes snap open. He rubs at his scar, wincing in pain.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Hermione opens her edition of the Daily Prophet and sits up
dialog: in alarm.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I cannot believe it!
text: Harry and Ron glance at her.
text: She slaps the paper down on the table.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (reading headline)
dialog: “Ministry Passes Educational Decree
dialog: Number Twenty-Three: Dolores
dialog: Umbridge Appointed Hogwarts High
dialog: Inquisitor”?
text: He looks at Harry and Hermione.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: It says here that the High
dialog: Inquisitor has the power to inspect
text: all of the teachers.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You’re kidding!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: That’s not all. The High Inquisitor
dialog: also has the power to sack teachers
dialog: as well.
text: Fred and George march by.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: So, seen the news have you?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Personally, I envy you three.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Why’s that?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Umbridge is inspecting McGonagall
dialog: in your period. That old toad won't
dialog: know what hit her.
text: He looks at Fred wistfully.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, to be a youth again, to
dialog: experience the innocent glee of
dialog: watching Umbridge be destroyed by
dialog: the greatest Head of Gryffindor
dialog: this century.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Well, we’ll expect a full report
dialog: after.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Complete with facial expressions.
text: And they wander off.
scene_heading: INT. DIVINATION CLASS - DAY
text: PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY stands before her class.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: Greetings my children. I sense even
dialog: now that many of you have already
dialog: made the transition into the
dialog: beyond!
text: Umbridge smiles, toad-like.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: Today we will be continuing our
dialog: interpretation of prophetic dreams.
dialog: Please divide into your groups and
dialog: discuss your recent night time
text: visions using the text as a guide.
text: Ron and Harry open their books, while listening to Trelawney
dialog: and Umbridge.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: And how long have you been at this
dialog: post?
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: Near to sixteen years I have been
dialog: the guide to young seers possessed
dialog: of the Inner sight.
text: Umbridge makes a note.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I understand you are the descendent
dialog: of the famous Seer Cassandra
dialog: Trelawney?
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: And you are the first since
dialog: Cassandra to have the Second Sight?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: These things tend to
dialog: skip...several...generations.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Of course.
text: She makes another note.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Now, if you would kindly make a
dialog: prediction for me?
text: Trelawney seems to swell with indignation.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: The Inner Eye does not See upon
dialog: command!
text: Umbridge smiles unpleasantly and makes an extensive note.
text: Trelawney becomes agitated and looks around wildly.
text: She steps up to Harry, who recoils slightly.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: My dear boy, your dream diary, if
dialog: you please!
text: Harry nervously hands his diary to her. She takes it with
text: trembling fingers and gazes at it for only a moment. She
text: drops it back to the table and gives a little scream.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: My dear boy! My poor boy! These
dialog: dreams are evil portends!
text: Harry looks at the page.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “Dreamt I was at breakfast eating
dialog: oatmeal”?
text: Trelawney stares at him for a moment. Umbridge smirks in the
text: background, making more notes.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling
dialog: me you cannot see the signs? The
dialog: foretelling of suffering and death?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Er...
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: Perhaps you are not as in the
dialog: beyond as the others.
text: She sweeps from Harry’s table.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Well, if that’s the best you can
dialog: do, Professor, I will be going.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS - DAY
text: Leaves, now a molted brown color, drift off of the trees
text: around Hogwarts. It is now October.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGSMEAD - DAY
text: Hermione, Ron, and Harry walk down the crowded streets of
text: Hogsmead, avoiding the swarms of other students.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where are we going, Hermione?
text: She leads them on confidently. They stop before a slightly
text: seedy looking pub.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: There we are.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: “The Hog’s Head,” Hermione?
text: She leads them towards it.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Come on, I’1l explain in a minute.
scene_heading: INT. HOG’S HEAD - DAY
text: The three of them step into the pub. It is grimy and ill-lit.
text: Shady witches and wizards sit uneasily in corners.
text: Except for one corner by the front window, which is populated
text: by Dean Thomas, Neville Longbottom, LAVENDER BROWN, Parvati
text: and Padma Patil, Cho Chang, Luna Lovegood, KATIE BELL, ALICA
scene_heading: SPINNET, Angelina Johnson, COLIN and DENNIS CRERVEY, ERNIE
scene_heading: MACMILLAN, JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHELY, HANNAH ABBOTT, ANTHONY
text: GOLDSTEIN, MICHAEL CORNER, TERRY BOOT, Ginny Weasley, Fred
scene_heading: and George Weasley, LEE JORDAN, ZACHARIAS SMITH, SUSAN BONES
text: and five others who Harry doesn’t know.
dialog: 66.
text: Harry looks questioningly at Hermione.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hermione, what’s going on?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: These are some people I mentioned
dialog: my Defense Against the Dark Arts
dialog: idea with.
text: She sits down. Harry and Ron follow.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You mean about us teaching
dialog: ourselves?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Hey, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, Neville.
speaker_heading: LUNA
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: It’s good to see that the horned
dialog: snorkle-stacks haven’t gotten you
dialog: yet, Harry.
text: Harry looks confused for a moment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Uh...same to you, Luna.
text: Hermione beats on the table to quiet everyone.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Hi, everyone. I thought it would be
dialog: good if we met and talked over how
dialog: we wanted to teach ourselves
dialog: Defense Against the Dark Arts.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Because we need to learn it
dialog: properly, not the rubbish Umbridge
dialog: is doing.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Hear, hear!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Obviously, this will help us pass
dialog: our O.W.L.s, but more importantly,
dialog: it gives us the ability to protect
dialog: ourselves from...Lord Voldemort.
dialog: 67.
text: Several people jump or wince in fear at the name.
text: Hermione takes a shuddering breath, looking exhilarated. She
text: looks at Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That’s the first time you've said
dialog: his name.
text: Hermione looks pleased.
speaker_heading: ZACHARIAS
dialog: How do we know You-Know-Who’s
dialog: really back?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Dumbledore believes he is.
scene_heading: JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLY
dialog: You mean Dumbledore believes him.
text: He nods in Harry’s direction.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: That’s true, but I think we’re
dialog: drifting from the purpose--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It’s okay, Hermione.
text: He looks at the crowd.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I believe Voldemort’s back because
dialog: I fought him last year.
dialog: Dumbledore’s already told the
dialog: school that. If you didn’t believe
dialog: him you won’t believe anyone.
text: There is a tense silence.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Well...anyway...uh, I think that in
dialog: order to learn properly we’1ll need
dialog: a teacher.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: But we’re all students. None of us
dialog: has the experience to--
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Someone here does.
dialog: 68.
text: Everyone looks at her. She is staring directly at Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL CORNER
dialog: I for one would like to know why
dialog: Potter’s qualified and the rest of
dialog: us aren't.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Well, he’s only confronted You-Know-
dialog: Who himself four times and lived to
dialog: talk about it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN BONES
dialog: One of the portraits said you'd
text: killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of
dialog: Secrets with that sword in
text: Dumbledore’s office.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Uh...well, yeah, I did.
speaker_heading: LEE JORDAN
dialog: Blimey, Harry...
text: Half the crowd looks awestruck.
speaker_heading: LAVANDER BROWN
dialog: Wow...
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Can't forget that he saved the
dialog: Sorcerer’s Stone from You-Know-Who
dialog: in his first year.
text: The Patil sisters’ eyes are wide with respect and
dialog: astonishment.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: And last year he got through the
dialog: Triwizard Tournament!
text: There are mutters of agreement.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Not to mention you dueled with You-
dialog: Know-Who all alone and he still
dialog: couldn’t kill you!
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: And you fought off those dementors
dialog: that attacked you this summer.
text: Hermione looks tremendously pleased.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: So all in favor of taking lessons
dialog: from Harry?
text: She holds up her hand. Ron, Ginny, Fred, George, Neville,
text: Luna, Dean, Lee, Katie, Alica, Angelina, and Susan raise
text: their hands. Then, after a moment, the rest raise theirs as
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Where are we going to meet?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What about an unused classroom?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That might work. I’1l look into
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Ok, good.
text: She pulls a parchment out of her bag.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I think we should put our names
dialog: down, so we know who was here.
text: Suddenly people look uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: I don’t know...if it were found...I
dialog: mean, Umbridge wouldn’t like what
dialog: we're doing...
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Honestly, Ernie, do you think I’d
dialog: just leave it lying around?
dialog: Besides, its enchanted.
text: Ernie looks more comfortable. Fred and George eagerly sign,
text: as do the rest, even Cho’s friend MARIETTA signs.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Also, what should we call
dialog: ourselves?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: What about the Anti-Unbridhe
dialog: League?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: We need something that doesn’t give
dialog: away what we’re doing.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: I think it should be Dumbledore’s
dialog: Army.
text: There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Dumbledore’s Army it is, then. The
dialog: D.A. for short.
text: Fred and George stand, along with Lee.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: We'll let you know when we’re going
dialog: to meet.
text: The meeting breaks up.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGSMEAD - DAY
text: Harry, Ron, and Hermione trudge back up towards the castle.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I think that went well.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: And did you see Cho, Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (stiffly)
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Well, she couldn’t keep her eyes
dialog: off you, could she?!
text: Harry gives a little smile.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - DAY
text: Harry, carrying a load of schoolbooks, walks alone down a
text: stone hallway.
text: Angelina comes running up to him.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: Harry, you won't believe...that
dialog: Umbridge woman...this is too much!!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s she done now?
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: Follow me.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - DAY
text: Harry and Angelina approach a large BILLBOARD surrounded by
text: murmuring students. They push their way through.
text: A large parchment hangs from the wall.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: “By order of the Hogwarts High
dialog: Inquisitor: All student
dialog: organizations, societies, teams,
dialog: groups, and clubs are henceforth
dialog: disbanded. Permission to reform
dialog: must be approved by High Inquisitor
dialog: Umbridge. No student organization
dialog: can exist without the knowledge and
dialog: approval of the High Inquisitor.
dialog: Any student found to be a part of
dialog: an illegal organization will be
dialog: expelled immediately.”
text: Angelina is furious just looking at it again.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: She refused to allow us to reform
dialog: the Gryffindor team. We had to go
dialog: to Dumbledore to get her to allow
dialog: it.
text: Harry is extremely angry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not only that, but what about the
dialog: D.A.?
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
text: Harry is pacing in front of the fire. Hermione and Ron sit on
text: chairs, watching him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This isn’t a coincidence.
text: He looks at Ron and Hermione.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She knows.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: She can’t!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look, we don’t know how many people
dialog: could have overheard our meeting
dialog: and told her.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Or somebody at the meeting could
text: have blabbed to her.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: No, they couldn’t have. The
dialog: parchment we all signed was
dialog: enchanted, like I said. No one can
dialog: betray the D.A. without us knowing.
text: Harry stops pacing and grins at Hermione.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What would we do without you,
dialog: Hermione?
text: She beams at him.
text: Hedwig flutters in the open window and collapses to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hedwig!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: She’s hurt!
text: Hedwig hoots softly.
speaker_heading: RON
text: She doesn’t look very good.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry, you'd better take her to
dialog: Professor Grubby-Plank. She’1ll know
dialog: what to do.
text: Harry scoops Hedwig up and runs through the portrait hole.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Harry steps out of the portrait hole.
text: McGonagall comes around the corner.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Potter!
text: He stops and turns to her.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Where on earth are you going at
dialog: this time of night?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It’s Hedwig. I think she’s been
dialog: attacked.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: What?
text: She steps closer and peers closely at the hurt owl.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Yes, I think you might be right,
dialog: Potter.
text: She looks at Harry.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Where was she coming from?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: London.
text: He gives her a significant look. She nods.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Well, give her to me. I’1l run her
text: down to Professor Grubby-Plank.
text: Harry hands Hedwig to her. She takes the owl carefully.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: There you are.
text: She straightens and moves down the hall, then stops. She
text: turns to look at Harry.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Bear in mind, Potter, that channels
dialog: of communication in and out of
dialog: Hogwarts are being watched, won’t
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes, Professor.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Good. Now, off to bed.
text: She vanishes around the corner. Harry turns and goes back
text: through the portrait hole.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
text: Harry steps back inside the common room. Hermione and Ron
text: have gone to bed. He is alone.
speaker_heading: DOBBY
dialog: Mr. Harry Potter!
text: Harry turns to see Dobby standing in the middle of the room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dobby! What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: DOBBY
dialog: Dobby is cleaning, sir.
dialog: He seemed to want to say something more.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is it, Dobby.
speaker_heading: DOBBY
dialog: Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help
text: Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him
text: muttering in his sleep.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Don’t worry about it, Dobby. But I
dialog: don’t think you can help me.
text: Dobby’s ears droop.
dialog: 75.
text: Harry collects his books, then stops.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Actually, there is something you
dialog: can do, Dobby.
text: Dobby brightens instantly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I need a room where twenty-eight
dialog: people can practice Defense Against
dialog: the Dark Arts without the teachers
dialog: knowing. Especially Professor
dialog: Umbridge.
text: Dobby leaps into the air and claps his hands.
speaker_heading: DOBBY
dialog: Dobby knows of the perfect place,
dialog: Harry Potter! It is the Room of
dialog: Requirement, sir. You can only use
dialog: the room in times of great need.
dialog: Whatever you need will be there for
dialog: you, Harry Potter.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That’s brilliant, Dobby!
text: Dobby looks pleased.
speaker_heading: DOBBY
dialog: Dobby can show you now, if you
dialog: wish, Harry Potter.
text: Harry thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Better not, Dobby. School is pretty
dialog: intense right now. We'll do it ina
dialog: few months, before the holidays.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS - DAY
text: We glide over the landscape, the leaves gradually vanishing
text: from the trees and snow begins to drift into sight as we pick
text: up speed. We sail into the snowstorm over the Hogwarts
text: Grounds, past Hagrid’s empty hut and into the Quidditch
dialog: stadium.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH - DAY
text: Visibility is low. Players scatter everywhere.
speaker_heading: LEE JORDAN
dialog: ..-and Slytherin is up forty to
dialog: ten. Alica with the quaffle!
text: Alica spins through the blizzard, trying desperately to see.
text: Two shapes emerge from the snow. They are CRABBE and GOYLE,
text: the Slytherin Beaters. Both of them take a swing at her.
text: She twists completely around on her broom and the clubs swish
text: harmlessly past. She pushes forward to the Slytherin goals
text: and hurtles the quaffle. Blocked by the Slytherin Keeper!
text: Below, in the stands, there is a groan from the Gryffindor
text: side. From the Slytherins, there is a chant.
speaker_heading: SLYTHERINS
dialog: Weasley is our King,
dialog: Weasley is our King,
dialog: He always lets the Quaffle in,
dialog: Weasley is our King!
text: Harry pulls up near to Ron, who is looking grimly sick to his
dialog: stomach.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just ignore them, Ron!
text: Ron does not acknowledge him.
text: Several Slytherins, in possession of the Quaffle, bear down
text: on the Gryffindor goals. They throw the quaffle. Ron dives
dialog: and misses.
text: A loud GONG sounds. Another groan from the Gryffindors.
speaker_heading: LEE JORDAN
dialog: (v.o.)
text: Another ten points to Slytherin.
dialog: The score is now fifty-ten in favor
dialog: of Slytherin.
text: Malfoy pulls up on his broom near Ron as well.
speaker_heading: MALFOY
dialog: I should thank you, Weasley. You're
dialog: definitely our best player!
text: He laughs.
dialog: 77.
text: Just then, the SNITCH blasts past Malfoy. He takes off in
text: pursuit. Harry rockets after him at top speed, ignoring the
text: bite of the snow against his face.
text: He and Malfoy give chase, following the Snitch at top speed.
text: Malfoy is still far closer than Harry.
text: Then the Snitch BANKS SHARPLY. Both Draco and Harry turn with
text: it, though now Harry has pulled even with Draco. They are
text: inches from the Snitch. They reach with all of their might.
text: Harry’s hand inches out in front of Draco and closes around
text: the Snitch. Draco’s fingers scrabble on the back of Harry’s
text: gloved hand.
text: The crowd goes wild. Harry straightens, triumphant.
text: Behind him, without warning, Crabbe emerges from the blizzard
text: and CRACKS Harry across the back of the head with his
dialog: Beater’s club.
text: Harry slumps forward, and nose-dives into the pitch, rolling
text: to a stop looking dazed. There is a groan of sympathy from
dialog: the crowd.
text: The other Gryffindors land and run to Harry.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry, are you all right?
text: He is helped to his feet by Fred and George.
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved
dialog: Weasley’s neck, didn’t you?
text: The Gryffindors ignore him.
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: I've never seen a worse Keeper!
dialog: Maybe we should add some more
dialog: verses to our little song. About
dialog: his filthy mother!
text: George tries to leap at Draco. Harry and Fred hold him back.
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: And his pathetic loser of a father
dialog: too!
text: Fred attempts to charge Draco too. Other Gryffindors are
text: restraining them now.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: But then, you like the Weasleys,
dialog: don’t you? How can you stand the
dialog: stink? I guess it reminds you of
dialog: your own dear mother!
text: Harry turns and runs full out at Draco, who looks startled as
text: Harry leaps at him, CRUSHING his fist into Draco’s jaw and
text: knocking him to the ground.
text: George breaks free of the Gryffindors and follows, hitting
dialog: Malfoy too.
text: Harry leaps onto Draco, hitting him again and again.
speaker_heading: MADAM HOOCH
dialog: Impedimenta!
text: She blasts Harry and George with her spell, knocking them off
dialog: of Malfoy.
text: McGonagall storms onto the pitch, Gryffindor scarf flapping
text: wildly in the wind.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: What on earth do you two think
dialog: you're doing?
text: Harry rolls to his feet and goes for Malfoy again. Madam
text: Hooch stands between them, her wand pointed directly at
dialog: Harry.
speaker_heading: HOOCH
dialog: Don’t make me stupify you, Potter!
text: Harry stops, breathing hard, glaring daggers at Malfoy, who
text: is curling in a ball, bleeding and crying.
text: McGonagall comes right up to Harry and grabs him hard by the
text: elbow. He finally turns his attention to her. She is pale and
text: grim-faced.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: My office. Now.
scene_heading: INT. MCGONAGALL’S OFFICE - DAY
text: George and Harry stand in front of McGonagall’s desk. She
text: stands on the other side of it.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: In all my thirty-nine years at this
dialog: school, I have never seen such a
text: disgusting display.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Malfoy provoked us.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Of course he wanted to provoke you!
dialog: He‘d just lost!
text: She stares at both of them.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: I cannot express in words the
dialog: disappointment I feel right now.
text: The door opens and Umbridge steps into the room, smiling
text: sickly.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: What is it, Dolores?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I thought you might need some
dialog: additional authority in dealing
dialog: with these two.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: You thought wrong. Now kindly
dialog: remove yourself from my office.
text: She turns back to George and Harry.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Now, I don’t care what Malfoy said.
dialog: Your performance out there was
dialog: shameful. Fifty points from
dialog: Gryffindor, and I’m giving you both
dialog: a week’s worth of detentions.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I hardly think that’s an adequate
dialog: punishment for this.
text: She holds up a parchment.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It
dialog: gives me, as High Inquisitor, the
dialog: power to give punishments and
dialog: privileges, and to alter those
dialog: given out to students by other
text: members of the staff.
text: She turns to Harry and George.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: So, I think a life-long ban from
dialog: playing quidditch should do the
dialog: trick for both of these. Oh, and
dialog: this one’s twin as well. He was
text: going to attack Malfoy as well.
text: Harry and George are stunned.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ban us...for life.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter.
text: She moves towards them.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Ah, I'll take your brooms as well.
text: She confiscates the brooms too.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE

speaker_heading: RON

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You can’t!
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I’m horrible! I should never have

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If you quit, we'll be out four

speaker_heading: RON

scene_heading: INT. HAGRID’S HUT - NIGHT
text: Harry, Ron, and Hermione have taken seats around the hut, at
text: the table and in chairs.
text: Hagrid boils some water over the fire. His FACE is covered in
text: CUTS and BRUISES.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hagrid, what happened to you?
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: I’ve fine, I tell yeh!
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Come off it, Hagrid! We're not
dialog: blind!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Was it because of the giants?
text: There is a silence.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Can’ answer tha’, I’m afraid. Top
dialog: secret, that is. Business of the
dialog: Order.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We know you were looking for
dialog: giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so
dialog: last year.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went
dialog: with Madame Maxime. Took us a month
dialog: to get to their camp.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: A month?
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: O’ course! Can’ do magic, not with
dialog: the Ministry followin’ us all the
dialog: way. Plus, giants aren’t fond o’
dialog: wizards. Don’ trust ‘em.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So what did you do when you found
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Waited ‘till mornin’ an’ then
dialog: marched righ’ in.
scene_heading: EXT. GIANT VALLEY - DAY
text: Hagrid and Madam Maxime march into the camp, eyes fixed
text: firmly on the GURG. Hagrid holds a large branch of
text: EVERLASTING FIRE above his head.
text: The GURG sits some distance away, sitting on a large stone
text: seat, surrounded by other giant servants.
text: THe giants stare at Hagrid and Maxime, flabbergasted. They
text: slowly move aside for them to pass.
dialog: 83.
text: Hagrid and Maxime bow before the GURG.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: We gave ‘ema gift, jus’ like
dialog: Dumbledore said. Gave ‘em a branch
text: o’ Gubraithian fire, Everlasting
dialog: Flame.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Giants love magic, see, jus’ not
dialog: too fond o’ wizards. Nuthin’ a
dialog: giant loves better than magic.
text: The GURG smiles and hoists the branch of fire into the air.
text: The giants roar and yell around them.
text: Sticking the branch into the ground, the Gurg beckons Hagrid
text: and Maxime foreward.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: What happened then?
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: We sat down, an’ had a talk. Well,
dialog: mostly they listened good. But
dialog: there were good signs.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, they did ‘till tha’ night.
dialog: Tha’s when everythin’ went wrong.
text: Hagrid and Maxime watch a great battle in the valley below
text: them. They stand on the mountain side.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: There were a coup. Nex’ mornin’
dialog: there were a new chief.
text: Hagrid and Maxime walk back towards the New GURG the next
text: day. This GURG is evil-looking and grinning at them nastily.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: We went back ter see what we could
dialog: do with this new chief.
text: Two large bodyguards block the way to the new Gurg. They grab
text: Hagrid. Maxime blasts them with spells from her wand. They
dialog: drop Hagrid.
dialog: 84.
text: There is an earth-shaking ROAR from all around them. Giants
dialog: charge them from every direction.
text: Maxime and Hagrid flee back up the mountain.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: An’ then things got even worse.
text: Death Eaters arrived, an’ the new
dialog: chief were all happy ter be seein’
dialog: them!
text: Several DEATH EATERS, faces concealed behind their black
text: cloaks, approach the new Gurg, who beckons them to speak.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: We figured, jus’ cause some o’ the
dialog: giants were favorin’ You-Know-Who
dialog: don’t mean all of ‘em were. The
dialog: coup ha’ driven the ol’ chief's
dialog: supporters into some caves, so we
dialog: wen’ in after ‘em.
text: Maxime and Hagrid walk into a dark cave, wands glowing.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (awed)
dialog: You went into caves looking for
dialog: giants?
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: We foun’ enough, an’ they seemed
dialog: interested--at first. Then the new
dialog: chief’s lot raided the caves.
dialog: Tweren’t many survivors, an’ none
dialog: o’ them wanted anythin’ to do with
dialog: us after tha’.
scene_heading: INT. HAGRID’S HUT - NIGHT
text: There is silence.
speaker_heading: ROM

scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT
text: Harry strolls into the ROOM OF REQUIREMENT, looking at the
dialog: assembled
text: group that makes up DUMBLEDORE’S ARMY.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Glad to see all of you could find
dialog: this place all right.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?
text: Scattered around the room are many devices such as DARK
speaker_heading: DETECTORS
text: and SNEAKASCOPES.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Loads of Defense Against the Dark
dialog: Arts equipment. Hopefully we’1ll be
dialog: able to get to all of it before the
dialog: end of term.
text: He paces in front of them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You need to understand something
dialog: before we start, though. Defending
dialog: yourself from the Dark Arts has
dialog: less to do with magical ability and
dialog: more to do with thinking fast and a
dialog: lot of luck.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We'll be doing Expelliarmus
dialog: tonight, though hopefully we can
dialog: move on to other things if we have
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: ZACHARIAS
dialog: Oh please. Professor Lockhart
dialog: taught us that in second year.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Lockhart didn’t teach as much as
text: prune himself.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Besides, it works. I used it
dialog: against You-Know-Who last June. It
dialog: saved my life.
text: Zacharias falls silent.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Right. Well, let’s split into pairs
dialog: and give it a go.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT
text: Harry strolls among the students amid shouts of
text: “Expelliarmus”, checking everyone’s progress.
text: He reaches Neville and Ron, who are practicing together.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Expelliarmus!
text: Ron’s wand flips from his hand across the room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well done, Neville!
text: He shouts down the others.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look here, you lot! Neville’s
dialog: really got the hang of this one.
dialog: (to Neville)
dialog: Go ahead again.
text: Fred tosses Ron’s wand to him. Neville swirls his wand.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Expelliarmus!
text: Ron’s wand does it again.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I did it! I did it!
text: Harry claps him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Never forget this spell, Neville.
dialog: It could save your live some day.
text: He moves to the front of the room again.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay, everyone. We’ve done a lot
dialog: today, and I’ve seen some great
dialog: improvement. That’s it for now.
dialog: We’1ll meet back here, same time
dialog: next week!
dialog: 87.
text: People began to drift out of the meeting. Harry goes about,
text: straightening the room up.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR BOYS DORM - NIGHT
text: Harry lies in bed. He dreams again...
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - NIGHT
text: We float along a dark corridor, inches from the floor. We
text: come to another corridor and peer down it. It appears empty.
text: A great PYTHON of a SNAKE slithers down the empty corridor.
text: It slowly makes its way past many doors, until it reaches, at
text: last, another, larger door.
text: Behind it, an invisibility cloak falls to the floor ina
text: SHIMMER OF SILVER. Mr. Weasley stands, drawing his wand.
text: He fires a GOLDEN JINX at the snake. He misses. The snake
text: strikes. Mr. Weasley screams.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR BOYS DORM - NIGHT
text: Harry yells at the top of his lungs, eyes tightly closed. He
text: makes biting motions with his mouth, snarling madly. A
text: seizure takes him.
text: He screams in rage and horror, his entire bed shaking with
text: his thrashing.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - NIGHT
text: The snake strikes Mr. Weasley again and again. BLOOD
text: SPLATTERS against the walls and floor. Mr. Weasley screams
dialog: again.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR BOYS DORM - NIGHT
text: Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville leap out of their beds. Harry
text: screams again, an unearthly sound of horror, anguish, and
dialog: blood lust.
text: Ron and Neville sprint to Harry’s bed.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What’s wrong with him?
dialog: 88.
text: Harry screams again. His eyes snap open and they are pure
text: white, without pupils. He makes the bitting motion again,
text: thrashing wildly.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Get McGonagall! Go!
text: Neville turns and runs out of the dorms.
scene_heading: INT. WEASLEY HOME - NIGHT
text: Mrs. Weasley sits in her living room drinking a mug of tea.
text: On the other side of the room stands the WEASLEY’S CLOCK. It
text: chimes. She looks up, and then stands, moving closer to it.
text: Mr. Weasley’s hand grinds over to the hour labeled “MORAL
speaker_heading: PERIL.”
text: The mug of tea SHATTERS on the floor.
text: Mrs. Weasley clutches at her mouth in dread and horror.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - NIGHT
text: The snake strikes again. Mr. Weasley, eyes flicking
text: everywhere and seeing nothing, staggers into the wall and
text: falls to the ground, leaving a bloody smear to mark his
dialog: descent.
text: The snake abandons the door and slithers away at top speed.
scene_heading: INT. GRYFFINDOR BOYS DORM - NIGHT
text: Harry still struggles madly.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Harry! HARRY!
text: Harry blinks, and his eyes are normal. He comes to himself,
text: only to let out a SHRIEK of BURNING AGONY. He clutches at his
text: scar, eyes crossing and unable to focus.
text: He rolls off the bed and onto the floor, where he writhes in
text: abject pain.
text: Neville returns with McGonagall.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Potter!
dialog: 89.
text: She runs to him, thrusting her candle into Neville’s hands.
text: She falls to her knees next to Harry and tries to touch him.
text: Her hand touches his skin and he yelps as if BURNT. She backs
dialog: off.
text: Harry vomits all over the floor. Taking a step back,
text: McGonagall draws her wand, looking uncertain what she will do
dialog: with it in any case.
text: Then, as suddenly as it had begun, it stops. Harry slumps
text: over, unmoving.
text: McGonagall is at his side in an instant. She rolls him over.
text: His eyes are closed.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please...
text: Harry’s eyes open. He sits up, looking frantic.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Mr. Weasley’s been attacked!
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: You dreamed this, Potter?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, I saw it happen! I...I was
dialog: there...
text: Ron is looking pale.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: You’re sure this happened, Potter?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Yes! We’ve got to do something or
dialog: he will die!
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: We're going to see the Headmaster,
dialog: Potter.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Weasley, you’d best come too.
scene_heading: INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: McGonagall opens the door leading to DUMBLEDORE’s OFFICE and
text: leads Harry and Ron inside.
dialog: 90.
text: Dumbledore looks up from where he is seated at his desk.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Professor McGonagall, and...ah...
text: Dumbledore does not look at Harry, even acknowledge his
dialog: presence.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Well, Potter has had some kind of
dialog: nightmare...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It wasn’t a nightmare! Well, I was
dialog: asleep, but it wasn’t a normal
dialog: dream. It was...well, real. I saw,
dialog: well--Mr. Weasley has been attacked
text: by a giant snake.
text: Ron is looking very pale.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: How did you see this? How were you
dialog: positioned when you saw it?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it
text: from the snake’s perspective.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Is Arthur seriously injured?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes!
text: Dumbledore stands and looks up at the portraits of previous
text: headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts. Two of them are
text: watching the proceedings.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You were listening?
speaker_heading: EVERARD
dialog: Naturally.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Raise the alarm. We must make sure
dialog: Arthur is found by the right
dialog: people.
dialog: 91.
text: Everard and Dilys move out of their frames and do not return.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Many of our previous headmasters
dialog: and mistresses have portraits in
dialog: other institutions, allowing them
dialog: to move between them.
text: He motions for all of them to sit.
text: They sit. Dumbledore moves to Fawkes.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Fawkes, we will need a warning.
text: The PHOENIX vanishes in a blast of fire.
text: Dumbledore sits back at his desk and pulls a SILVERY,
text: WHIRRING instrument to him. It emits some smoke that forms
text: itself into the shape of a SERPENT, then splits in two.
text: The two serpents coil around each other.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Naturally, naturally.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But in essence divided?
text: Harry and Ron exchange confused looks.
text: Everard returns to his portrait.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: What news?
speaker_heading: EVERARD
dialog: I shouted until someone came. They
text: carried him up seconds ago. He
text: doesn’t look good. Covered in
dialog: blood...
text: Dilys returns to her portrait at this time.
speaker_heading: DILYS
dialog: Dumbledore, I’ve just seen them
text: arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated
text: there moments ago. He looks really
dialog: bad.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Good.
dialog: (to McGonagall)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE (cont'd)
text: Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys
dialog: will need to be awoken.
text: She nods and departs.
text: Dumbledore again turns to the portraits hanging on the wall.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Phineas.
text: PHINEAS BLACK opens his eyes and stares at Dumbledore.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Phineas, I need you to visit your
dialog: other portrait. Tell Sirius what
dialog: happened and that we are coming to
dialog: stay for a while.
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: It’s late, Dumbledore...
text: Dumbledore stares at him.
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: I’m going, I’m going...
text: He vanishes.
text: Dumbledore takes a black pot and taps it with his wand.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: “Portus.”
text: McGonagall returns with Ginny, Fred, and George in tow.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Harry, what's happening--
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Your father has been injured in the
dialog: course of his work for the Order.
text: He is alive and arrived at St.
dialog: Mungo’s Hospital for Magical
dialog: Maladies and Injuries only moments
dialog: ago.
text: He picks up the pot and steps around the desk.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: We, however, are going to Sirius’s
dialog: house until the morning. We're
text: merely waiting for Phineas to
dialog: return.
dialog: 93.
text: A flash of flames appears over Fawkes’ perch. A single
text: feather floats to the ground.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Fawkes’s warning. Umbridge knows
dialog: you’re out of bed. Minerva, head
dialog: her off. Tell her anything you can
dialog: think of.
text: McGonagall departs again.
text: Phineas returns to his portrait.
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: He says he’d be delighted.
text: Dumbledore beckons everyone over to him.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: We're going by Portkey.
text: They all grab the pot, and VANISH.
scene_heading: INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - NIGHT
text: They reappear in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. Sirius
text: hurries in.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: There you are.
text: He looks at Dumbledore, but the Headmaster had all ready
text: disapperated.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: We've got to go to St. Mungo’s.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: No, you can’t.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We can go where we please.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: We can’t go yet. It would look to
dialog: suspicious if you lot showed up
dialog: fifteen minutes after Arthur
text: arrives because Harry’s been seeing
dialog: visions of things happening
text: hundreds of miles from Hogwarts.
dialog: 94,
text: George, livid with rage and fear, shoves his face near
dialog: Sirius’s.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That’s our father out there dying!
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I can’t let you leave. I’m sorry.
text: He slowly draws his wand, holding it loosely at his side. The
dialog: point was not lost to anyone.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You don’t even care! You wouldn't
dialog: even understand!
text: Sirius stares at him incredulously.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I was part of the first Order. I
dialog: lost my best friends to You-Know-
dialog: Who.
text: His eyes flick to Harry.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: He’s all I have left of them.
dialog: Believe me, I don’t want Arthur to
dialog: die.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But there are some things worth
dialog: dying for!
text: Fred and George look very much cowed by the haunted look in
text: Sirius’s eyes.
text: Finally, they sink into chairs around the table. George puts
text: his head in his hands. Fred simply stares at the wall. Ginny
text: is weeping softly. Ron puts his arm around her.
text: Harry sits away from them, by himself.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY
text: Fred and Ginny lay slumped in chairs, dozing. The rest are
text: sitting silently.

dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Mum!
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY
text: The Weasleys get up and hug their mother all at once in the
text: entry hall.
text: Harry gets up and walks wearily out into the hall. He stands
text: back, watching, as the Weasleys are reunited in the hall.
text: Yet Harry is forgotten in the background. He stands apart
text: from them, looking on, an intruder to their grief.
text: Finally they separate.
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: Your father’s alive. He’s going to
dialog: make it.
text: There is relief evident on all of their faces.
text: Harry turns and leaves, re-entering the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Harry sets down several plates, then looks at Sirius.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sirius, I--
text: He stops. Sirius looks at him.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You can tell me, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: When I saw the attack, well, I was
dialog: the snake.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I felt the fangs like they were
dialog: mine, saw through the snake’s eyes
dialog: like they were mine...
text: Sirius looks concerned.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think I might be going mad.
text: There is a horrible silence. Sirius looks uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Nonsense. You’re just tired. You’ve
dialog: had a rough night.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But what if there’s a snake inside
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You’ve told Dumbledore this?
dialog: (off Harry’s nod)
dialog: Then there’s nothing to worry
dialog: about.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON - DAY
text: Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Ginny, Fred, George, Moody, and Tonks walk
text: up to a run-down storefront with a single mannequin in the
text: display window.
text: Tonks moves right up to the window.
speaker_heading: TONKS
dialog: We're here to see Arthur Weasley.
text: The mannequin beckons to them with its finger. Tonks steps
text: into the glass and VANISHES. The rest follow.
scene_heading: INT. ST. MUNGOS - DAY
text: They enter a crowded reception area packed with witches and
dialog: wizards who have been damaged or injured in the course of
dialog: their magical lives.
text: Many move around wearing white robes with the insignia of a
text: WAND and BONE crossed over each other.
text: Mrs. Weasley marches very determinedly through the crowd.
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: This way, come on!
scene_heading: INT. ST. MUNGO’S HALLWAY - DAY
text: Moody and Tonks stop outside the door.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: TONKS
dialog: We'll wait outside at first, Molly.
dialog: It should be family first.
text: Mrs. Weasley nods and pushes her children through the door.
text: Harry holds back, but she beckons to him.
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: Don’t be silly, Harry. You too.
text: And she ushered him inside.
scene_heading: INT. WARD - DAY
text: There are three patients in the ward. Arthur lies in the
text: farthest bed by the window, propped up on several pillows and
text: reading the paper.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: Hullo, everyone!
text: Mrs. Weasley bends down and kisses Arthur.
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: How are you, dear?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I am absolutely fine. If they could
dialog: take the bandages off, I’d walk out
dialog: of here in a jiffy.
text: He hugs Ginny with his good arm.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: How come they haven't taken them
dialog: off, then?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Oh, I start bleeding like mad. The
dialog: snake had some strange poison in
dialog: it. Keeps the wounds open. But
dialog: they’1l find a cure, don’t you
dialog: doubt.
text: George leans in close.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What were you doing when it
dialog: happened, dad?
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: That’s my own business.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You were guarding it, weren't you?
dialog: This weapon thing?
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: That’s enough!
text: She looks at Arthur.
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
text: Moody and Tonks are outside,
dialog: Arthur. They’d like a word.
text: She looks at her children.
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: All of you, out, if you please.
text: They turn and leave. Mr Weasley calls Harry back.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Harry, stay a moment.
text: Harry returns to the bed.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I never thanked you properly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: There’s no need--
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: But there is, Harry. If you hadn’t
dialog: had your vision, no one would have
dialog: found me in time. So...thank you.
text: Harry smiles, then departs.
scene_heading: INT. ST. MUNGO’S HALLWAY - DAY
text: The door to the ward is closed. Ron is listening with his ear
text: to the door.
text: They lean close to the doors.
scene_heading: INT. WARD - DAY
speaker_heading: TONKS
dialog: .».-we searched the whole floor,
dialog: Arthur, but we couldn’t find that
dialog: snake. Why a snake, anyway?
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: He probably sent it as a lookout.
dialog: See what he’s up against. That’s
text: the closest he’s ever gotten to it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So, Potter says he saw the whole
dialog: thing?
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: Yes. You know, Dumbledore seems
text: like he’s been waiting for
dialog: something like this to happen. When
dialog: I spoke to him this morning, he
dialog: seemed very worried about Harry.
speaker_heading: MOODY
dialog: He should be. I mean, if You-Know-
dialog: Who is really possessing him...
text: Moody trails off.
scene_heading: INT. ST. MUNGO’S HALLWAY - DAY
text: Harry straightens and looks at the others huddled outside the
text: door. They are staring at him in unmistakable fear.
text: Harry looks away from them. There is a silence.
speaker_heading: LOCKHART
dialog: Hullo.
dialog: They turn.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Professor Lockhart!
text: Lockhart looks puzzled.
speaker_heading: LOCKHART
dialog: Professor? Me? Did I really? Well,
dialog: I expect I was hopeless at it!
text: He rubs his hands together briskly.
speaker_heading: LOCKHART
dialog: Now, I’1ll expect all of you will be
dialog: wanting my autograph?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Uh, sure...
text: Just then, a HEALER emerges from a DOUBLE-DOOR nearby.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: HEALER
dialog: Ah, there you went, Gildroy.
text: She comes up to them and gently takes his elbow.
speaker_heading: HEALER
text: He keeps wandering off, handing out
dialog: autographs, don’t you know? It’s a
dialog: good sign toward recovering his
dialog: memory, the poor dear.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah, sorry about that, mate.
text: Lockhart peers at him.
speaker_heading: LOCKHART
dialog: Have we met?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah, it was my wand that backfired
dialog: on you.
speaker_heading: HEALER
dialog: Was it? What a coincidence!
text: She takes Lockhart back in through the double-doors. Harry,
text: Ron, and Hermione follow.
scene_heading: INT. PERMANENT WARD - DAY
text: The Healer sits Lockhart down in a chair. There are other
text: apportioned sections of the room.
speaker_heading: HEALER
dialog: This is our long-term resident
dialog: ward, for permanent spell damage.
dialog: Well, I must go...
text: She bustles away.
scene_heading: MRS. LONGBOTTOM
dialog: Come along, Neville.
text: Harry and the others turn.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Hey, Neville!
text: Neville turns beet-red, and looks away.
text: His GRANDMOTHER looks at the three of them.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: MRS. LONGBOTTOM
dialog: Friends of yours, Neville?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Ah, yes, Harry Potter. Good to meet
dialog: you, finally. And a Weasley.
text: She turns to Hermione
scene_heading: MRS. LONGBOTTOM
dialog: And you must be Miss Granger.
dialog: Neville’s mentioned you.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Who’re you visiting, Neville?
text: Mrs. Longbottom turns to Neville.
scene_heading: MRS. LONGBOTTOM
dialog: You haven’t told them?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Told us what?
scene_heading: MRS. LONGBOTTOM
dialog: Neville’s dear parents were
dialog: tortured into insanity by You-Know-
dialog: Who before he disappeared. Aurors,
dialog: you know, very well respected.
text: Just then, ALICE LONGBOTTOM, Neville’s mother, emerges from
text: behind the parition.
text: She beckons tentatively to Neville, who goes to her.
text: She gently, almost reverently, hands him a CANDY WRAPPER.
scene_heading: MRS. LONGBOTTOM
dialog: Another one, Alice? All right, come
dialog: on, Neville.
text: Neville is still staring at his mother, who smiles at him,
text: then disappears again.
text: Neville turns, locks eyes with Harry, and departs. As he
text: goes, he slips the wrapper into his pocket, as if it were his
dialog: most treasured possession.
text: Hermione and Ron watch him.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I never knew...Poor Neville.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY
text: Mrs. Weasley, Harry, Ginny, Ron, Fred, George, Hermione,
text: Moody, and Tonks walk into the entry hall of Grimmauld Place.
text: Mrs. Weasley looks at Harry concernedly.
scene_heading: MRS. WEASLEY
dialog: Are you all right, Harry dear? You
dialog: look like you’re going to be sick.
text: He doesn’t answer, but marches up the stairs and shuts
text: himself in his bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Harry begins to pack his trunk determinedly.
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: Running away, are we?
text: He turns to the portrait of Phineas.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I have to.
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: You know, I thought Gryffindors had
dialog: to be brave.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I won’t hurt anybody else.
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: I see. You are running away out of
dialog: nobility. You know, that’s why I
dialog: hated teaching. Young people always
dialog: think they know what’s best, as if
dialog: no one else could possibly
dialog: understand things better.
text: Harry moves to a window and opens it, leaning out.
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: I’ve brought a message from
dialog: Dumbledore.
text: Harry stops and looks at him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: Dumbledore says, ‘Stay where you
dialog: are.’
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That’s it? Stay there while the
dialog: grown-ups sort things out?
speaker_heading: PHINEAS
dialog: When in all your life has listening
dialog: to Dumbledore ever led you into
dialog: trouble? Whatever his reasons, he
dialog: has your best interests at heart,
dialog: Potter.
text: Phineas moves off the portrait frame and vanishes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore
dialog: thanks for nothing!
text: He tips his trunk over in anger and sits down on the bed.
text: There is a knock on the door.
text: Ginny walks in, looking determined.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Get out!
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ginny, I’m dangerous. You can’t be
dialog: around me.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Did you forget that I’ve been
dialog: possessed by You-Know-Who before?
text: Harry falls silent, looking cowed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I forgot.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Lucky you. Anyway, that’s what I
dialog: wanted to talk to you about.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Can you remember everything you’ve
dialog: done this year? There aren't any
dialog: blank spots in your memory?
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Then You-Know-Who has never
dialog: possessed you, Harry.
text: She sits down on the bed next to him.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: I don’t know what’s going on with
dialog: you right now, but possession’s not
dialog: one of them. You’re not dangerous.
text: She smiles at him. Finally, he smiles back.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Thanks, Ginny.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Don’t mention it.
text: She hops off the bed and departs the room.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Harry wanders into the kitchen and opens the REFRIGERATOR.
text: Sirius enters.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Harry, have you seen Kreacher? I
dialog: haven’t seen him for days now.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Haven’t seen him.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Oh well. Maybe he’s crawled up into
dialog: the air ducts and died...mustn’t
dialog: get my hopes up though.
text: The back door is shoved open and Snape enters.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Potter, excellent. I’d like a word.
text: He marches over to the table and sits.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Sit, Potter.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You know, I don’t like people
dialog: giving orders in my house.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: How unfortunate for you. Now kindly
dialog: get out. My instructions from
dialog: Dumbledore are to talk with Potter
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I’m his godfather. I think I’11l
dialog: stay.
text: Snape curls his lip in anger but keeps quiet.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Very well, then. I know how you
dialog: like to pretend you’re useful.
text: Sirius stiffens, but ignores the jab.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: It is the Headmaster’s wish that I
dialog: teach you Occlumency, Potter.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s that?
text: Snape sneers.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Occlumency. It is an ancient form
dialog: of magic that allows you to defend
dialog: your mind from external intrusion.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We begin at six-o-clock on Monday,
dialog: Potter.
text: Snape stands.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Well, unlike Sirius here, I don’t
dialog: have unlimited leisure time.
speaker_heading: SIRUS
dialog: Just a second, Snape. If I hear
dialog: that you’re using this to give
dialog: Harry a hard time, you’1l have me
dialog: to answer to.
text: Snape sneers again.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: How touching. Yet Potter is
text: incredibly like his father.
text: Criticism simply bounces off of
dialog: him.
text: Sirius stands and grabs Snape by the shoulders and roughly
text: shoves him into the wall. He glares at Snape.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I’ve warned you, Snivellus.
dialog: Dumbledore may think you’ve
dialog: reformed, but I know better...
text: Snape pushes him out of the way.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Touch me one more time, Black, and
dialog: you won’t touch anything again.
text: He sweeps back to the door and departs.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS - DAY
text: We sail through another snowstorm back to Hogwarts, passing
text: the grounds and sliding through an open window.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - DAY
text: Harry makes his way along the hallway.
text: Suddenly Cho comes around the corner. She skids to an abrupt
text: halt, blushing slightly.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Hi, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hi.
text: There is an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Er...bye then.
text: She starts to walk by.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey Cho!
text: She turns to him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, uh, Valentine’s Day is the
dialog: same day as our next Hogsmead
dialog: visit.
text: She blushes harder.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, uh, would you like to, you
dialog: know, go with me?
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Sure!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Cool.
text: She smiles at him and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. SNAPE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harry enters SNAPE’S OFFICE. Snape sits behind his
text: to a PENSIVE.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Sit, Potter.
text: Harry does so.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: As you are well aware, I will be
dialog: teaching you Occlumency. The
dialog: headmaster feels you should learn
dialog: this form of magic to defend
dialog: yourself against the Dark Lord, who
dialog: is skilled at Legilimency.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s that, Professor?
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Legilimency is the ability to
dialog: extract thoughts and feelings from
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Voldemort can read minds?
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: As usual, you have all the subtlety
text: of a stone wall, Potter.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 107.
dialog: desk, next
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: SNAPE (cont'd)
dialog: The mind is not a book, of which
dialog: any page can be examined. The mind
text: is complex and multi-layered.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So he could read our minds right
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Eye contact is normally required
dialog: for Legilimency to work. In your
dialog: case, however, things are somewhat
dialog: different. Your scar has forged a
dialog: connection between you and the Dark
dialog: Lord.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: When your mind is most relaxed,
dialog: such as during sleep, you receive
dialog: the Dark Lord’s thoughts and
dialog: feelings. The Headmaster believes
dialog: that it is inadvisable for this to
dialog: continue.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But hasn’t it helped so far? I
dialog: mean, it saved Mr. Weasley’s life,
dialog: didn’t it?
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Yes, it did, but at the expense of
dialog: our advantage. The connection
dialog: between you was so powerful during
dialog: your vision of the snake that the
dialog: Dark Lord became aware of it. The
dialog: Headmaster fears that he may try to
dialog: use this to his advantage, to
dialog: Manipulate you through false
dialog: visions.
text: Snape stands and pulls out his wand. Harry flinches, ever so
text: slightly. But Snape merely puts it to his head and draws a
text: GLOWING STRING of memory from his head and drops it into the
speaker_heading: SNAPE
text: Wand out, Potter.
text: Harry draws his wand.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: You may use any spell you can think
dialog: of to try and repel me.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: I am going to break into your mind.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Legimens!
text: The spell hits Harry, who staggers backward, grimacing.
scene_heading: EXT. DURSLEYS - DAY
text: Harry clings to a tree branch as the dog RIPPER barks at him
text: from the ground. The Dursleys laugh as they stand in the
dialog: driveway.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Harry sits under the SORTING HAT.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GREAT LAKE - NIGHT
text: Harry stands over Sirius, a PATRONUS hovering over him as
text: hundreds of DEMENTORS swarm overhead.
scene_heading: INT. SNAPE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harry’s face is contorted with rage.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No!
text: A spell fires from his wand. Snape dodges it. Gasping, Harry
text: falls to his knees.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Well, you stopped me eventually.
dialog: Ideally, you should repel me with
dialog: your mind.
text: Harry climbs to his feet.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon
dialog: your emotions. Legilimens!
text: Harry staggers again.
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: INT. DURSLEYS HOME - DAY
text: Uncle Vernon nails the letterbox closed...
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - DAY
text: Harry skids to a stop and looks down a dark hallway. Mr.
text: Weasley stops as well, and glances back at Harry.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: Come on, Harry!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I've been there before...
text: Mr. WEASLEY looks nervous, then grabs Harry's robes and drag
dialog: him along.
speaker_heading: MR. WEASLEY
dialog: Now, Harry, I find that highly
dialog: unlikely...
scene_heading: INT. SNAPE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Snape lowers his wand, breaking the spell.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: What was that?
text: Harry looks stunned.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I’ve just realized...
text: Snape is staring at him, agitated.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Realized what, Potter?
text: Harry looks at Snape suddenly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s in the Department of
dialog: Mysteries, sir?
text: There is a stunned silence. Snape regards Harry with
dialog: suspicion.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That corridor, I’ve been dreaming
dialog: about it for months...it leads to
dialog: the Department of Mysteries, I’m
dialog: sure of it.
text: Snape comes around the desk. He is deathly quiet, always a
dialog: bad sign.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: There are many things in the
dialog: Department of Mysteries, Potter,
dialog: none of which concern you.
text: There is a horrifying SCREAM that ECHOS through the castle.
text: Snape and Harry stare at the ceiling. Snape glances at Harry,
text: then hefts his wand and sweeps from the office. Harry
text: follows.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
text: There is a huge crowd of students standing at the top of the
text: stairs leading down into the entry hall.
text: There is another UNEARTHLY WAIL.
text: Harry pushes his way through the crowd until he can see.
text: Trelawney stands at the bottom of the stairs, looking crazed
text: and turning in circles, her wand out and clutched in her
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: (shrieking)
dialog: You cannot sack me!
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I can do whatever I wish!
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: This is my home!
text: Umbridge is grinning evilly.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Not anymore.
text: She points at the door with a stubby finger.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Now remove yourself from this
dialog: castle!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: She will not be leaving.
text: Behind Umbridge, the crowd parts slowly, and Dumbledore moves
text: down the steps.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I have the authority, Headmaster!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Oh, I agree with you, Professor
dialog: Umbridge. You do have the power to
dialog: dismiss my teachers. However...
text: He looks at Trelawney, who stands alone in the entry hall,
text: smiling at Dumbledore through her tears.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: ...You cannot send them from this
dialog: castle. That is still my decision.
dialog: Professor Trelawney will remain
dialog: here.
text: Umbridge turns to him, furious.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: And what of her quarters when I
dialog: appoint a new teacher.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Happily, that will not be
dialog: necessary. I have found a successor
dialog: for good Professor Trelawney
dialog: already. As you know...
text: Umbridge is looking mutinous.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: ...the Ministry can only appoint
dialog: new teachers if I cannot find one.
dialog: I think you will find him suitable
dialog: enough.
text: The GREAT OAKEN doors leading to the grounds swing open,
text: revealing an EBONY-SKINNED CENTAUR. It is FIRENZE, who saved
dialog: Harry in his first year.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: This is Firenze.
dialog: 113.
text: Umbridge is thunderstruck.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: Harry, Ron, and Hermione are huddled around a table.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: So you're saying this weapon You-
dialog: Know-Who’s after is in the
dialog: Department of Mysteries?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It’s got to be.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: That’s got to be what Surgis
dialog: Podmore was doing in the Ministry
dialog: when he was arrested.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably
dialog: there when he was attacked, too.
dialog: That must be what the Order’s
dialog: guarding!
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: But why the Department of
dialog: Mysteries?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: It makes perfect sense, Ron. It’s
dialog: got to be something the Ministry’s
dialog: been developing. Something top
dialog: secret.
text: Harry nods in agreement.
text: Hermione picks up a copy of the Daily Prophet grimly.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Look at this. There’s been a mass
text: escape from Azkaban.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Bloody hell!
text: Harry stares at the front page picture of ten witches and
dialog: wizards.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: They’re all Death Eaters!
dialog: 114.
text: Hermione nods fearfully.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Yes.
text: Harry grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Voldemort.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. HOGSMEAD - DAY
text: The sun rises over Hogwarts as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
text: stroll down the main street of Hogsmead.
text: Cho quickly finds Harry.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Hi, Harry!
text: Harry grins sheepishly at her, avoiding looking at Ron.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Have fun, Harry. Meet me in The
text: Three Broomsticks after. There’s
dialog: something you need to do.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ok.
text: He goes to Cho, and they leave together.
scene_heading: INT. MADAM PUDDIFOOT’S - DAY
text: Outside, it rains.
text: Harry and Cho sit awkwardly opposite each other at a small
text: table. Valentine’s Day decorations accost the eyes at every
dialog: turn.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: You know, Cedric and I came here
dialog: last year. Before...
text: Harry looks away, and sees several couples kissing. He looks
dialog: away.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: I--I’ve been meaning to ask you for
dialog: ages...but...I mean...
text: Harry looks at her. She is beginning to tear up.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: Did--did Cedric say anything about
dialog: me before he...he--died?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh. Uh, no, there wasn’t really
dialog: much time...
text: Cho bursts into tears. Harry tries to console her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look, maybe we should talk about
dialog: something else...
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: I thought you’d want to talk about
dialog: it! I thought you’d understand!
text: She stands up so suddenly the table rattles. The teashop has
text: gone deathly still. Everyone watches them.
speaker_heading: CHO
dialog: See you around, Harry.
text: She walks out.
text: Harry stands and runs after her.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGSMEAD - DAY
text: Harry staggers into the rain, looking around frantically. But
text: Cho has disappeared.
text: Getting wetter by the minute, he gives up and slowly makes
text: his way over to the Three Broomsticks.
scene_heading: INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS - DAY
text: He enters and sees Hermione. She’s sitting in a booth with
text: Luna and RITA SKEETER, a reporter.
text: Harry sits down.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s this all about?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: That’s what Little Miss Perfect was
dialog: about to tell us.
text: Harry glances at Hermione.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Right, well, I figured that with
dialog: all of the negative press out about
dialog: Harry, he should have a chance to
dialog: defend himself.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All of the details. What happened
dialog: last summer. The truth about Sirius
dialog: Black and Voldemort, not to mention
dialog: the names of all the Death Eaters
text: still on the loose.
text: Rita leans across the table.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: The Prophet will never publish
dialog: that. Goes against the public mood.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Well, it doesn’t matter. We’ve
text: found a publisher for the article.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Who?
text: Luna looks away from the window.
speaker_heading: LUNA
dialog: My father. He’s the editor of The
dialog: Quibbler.
text: Rita laughs out loud.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: The Quibbler?
dialog: (to Hermione)
dialog: You think people will take Harry
dialog: Potter seriously if he’s published
dialog: in the Quibbler? It’s nothing but a
dialog: conspiracy theory, cock-and-bull
dialog: story tabloid!
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Some won't believe Harry, that’s
dialog: true. But every person we do
dialog: convince is one more ally.
text: Rita shrugs, and pulls her quill from her bag.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: So, Harry. Ready to tell the public
dialog: the truth?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, I guess so.
text: Hermione sits back and sips her drink.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Fire away, Rita.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY
text: The snow on the ground has melted. The sky is clear and the
text: sun shines brightly. Spring has come.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Harry, Ron and Hermione sit at the Gryffindor table eating
dialog: breakfast.
text: An owl drops a letter on Harry’s plate. Hermione opens it and
text: pulls out a copy of the Quibbler.
text: Harry’s smiling face grins at them from the front cover.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Look, Harry! It’s your article!
text: Then, a dozen more owls drop letters on Harry. He covers his
text: head as their rain around him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What on earth?
text: Hermione beams at him.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Fan mail, Harry! Responses to the
dialog: article.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Which article is that, dear?
dialog: 118.
text: Umbridge had appeared at their table, smiling toad-like.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I have just published an article
dialog: telling the real story about what
dialog: happened last June.
text: Umbridge instantly turns an ugly shade of purple in her rage.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Where is this article?
text: Hermione hands her the Quibbler.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Right, I will confiscate this.
dialog: Anyone found in possession of this
dialog: magazine will be expelled.
text: She stalks off.
text: Hermione giggles in triumph.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: She’s done it to herself. Banning
dialog: the article will only make people
dialog: want to read it more!
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT
text: Harry stands before the D.A. again.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We've been doing so well, I thought
dialog: we'd work on some defensive
dialog: blocking spells tonight.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT
text: Wands wave and spells fly through the air. Harry paces
dialog: through the students.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That was really good.
text: With a CRACK, Dobby appears.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: DOBBY
dialog: Mr. Harry Potter!
text: He looks absolutely frantic. Harry turns to him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is it, Dobby?
text: The House-Elf has gone quiet, clamping his hands over his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: DOBBY
dialog: She--
text: He stopped, terrified.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who, Dobby?
text: Dobby shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Is it Umbridge?
text: Dobby nods. Harry looks up, horrified.
text: Dobby forces his arms down and takes a breath.
speaker_heading: DOBBY
dialog: She knows, Harry Potter. She’s
dialog: coming!
text: Harry opens the door with a wave of his wand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Get out of here! Now!
text: There is a mad rush to the door. Harry ushers them all out
text: safely, and exits.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Harry pelts up a hallway.
text: He is hit in the back with a spell and falls to the ground.
text: Malfoy leaps from behind a statue.
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: Got you, Potter.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Over here, Professor! I've got one!
dialog: 120.
text: Umbridge hurries over.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: It’s him. Well done, Draco!
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: On your feet, Potter. We’re going
dialog: to see the Headmaster!
text: She turns to Draco.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Search everywhere for the others,
dialog: Draco. Round them all up. Check
dialog: everywhere, bathrooms, the library,
dialog: empty classrooms. We must find
dialog: them!
text: Draco nods and hurries off.
scene_heading: INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Umbridge shoves Harry into Dumbledore’s office, which is
text: filled with people. McGonagall, Cornelius Fudge, Kingsley
text: Shacklebolt, another Auror, and Percy Weasley.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You may be High Inquisitor of this
dialog: school, Professor Umbridge, but
dialog: kindly do not manhandle my
dialog: students.
text: Fudge looks pleased. He claps his hands and rubs them
dialog: excitedly.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Well, well, well, Mr. Potter! I
dialog: expect you know why you’re here?
text: Harry glances at Dumbledore. The Headmaster shakes his head,
dialog: ever so slightly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not really, no.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: You don’t? You haven’t broken any
dialog: school rules?

dialog: School rules? No.

speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Or Ministerial Decrees?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not that I know of.
text: Umbridge opens the door again, leading Marietta, Cho's
text: friend, into the room. She has been crying, and her face is
text: covered in PIMPLES forming the word “SNEAK.”
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I’m afraid the poor girl is unable
dialog: to speak. But I shall tell you what
dialog: has transpired.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Shortly after dinner she came to me
dialog: and said that if I went to the Room
dialog: of Requirement I would find an
text: illegally-formed student group.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It was at that time that this hex
dialog: took affect.
text: She gestures to Marietta’s face.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Since I had received information
dialog: some time ago that Potter and a
dialog: number of other students had met in
dialog: the Hog’s Head to start an illegal
dialog: group--—
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I’m not sure that’s true,
dialog: Professor.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: In point of fact, when young Potter
dialog: met those students it was not
dialog: illegal.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: But two days later, Educational
dialog: Decree Twenty-Four was introduced.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Again, quite correct. However, I
dialog: wonder if you have any evidence
dialog: that proves this group has been
dialog: meeting since then?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I have a witness right here!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Correct again. I must confess that
dialog: I was, however, under the
dialog: impression that this young girl
dialog: only told you a meeting was going
dialog: on tonight.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Let’s ask her, shall we?
text: She turns to Marietta, who is staring at the wall.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: You can shake your head for an
dialog: answer, dear. Now, have there been
dialog: more meetings?
dialog: 122.
text: Slowly, still staring at the wall, Marietta shakes her head.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: What do you mean by shaking your
dialog: head, girl?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I would think that she was saying
dialog: there have been no other meetings.
dialog: Would that be correct?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: But what about Potter? He was the
dialog: leader, and has been--
text: To Umbridge’s astonishment, Marietta is shaking her
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Why are you shaking your head,
dialog: girl?
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: It usually means ‘no,’ Dolores.
text: Umbridge grabs Marietta by the cloak and shakes her
text: Dumbledore stands, and there is anger in his voice.
text: his wand and points it at Umbridge.
dialog: head yet
dialog: roughly.
dialog: He draws
dialog: 123.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Again, I cannot have you
dialog: manhandling my students, Professor
dialog: Umbridge.
text: She laughs, softly, and lets Marietta go.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Well, what about the meeting
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Right. Of course. Well, we
dialog: proceeded down to the Room and
dialog: entered.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We caught Potter just outside. But
dialog: it doesn’t matter. We’ve found all
dialog: of their names.
text: She pulls the roster list Hermione had made up from her
text: pocket. Harry gaps at it in horror.
text: Fudge gapes at it as well. He snatches it out of Umbridge’s
text: hands. He looks up, an expression of twisted delight on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: So, Dumbledore, you’ve been behind
dialog: this whole thing.
text: He hands the paper to Dumbledore, who looks at it. He seems
text: suddenly at a loss for words.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: (harsh whisper)
dialog: Dumbledore’s Army.
text: Dumbledore smiles pleasantly and spreads his hands widely.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Well, Minister. You’ve caught me.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: This has all been your doing!
dialog: You’ve been recruiting students for
dialog: your army!
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Quite correct, Cornelius.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: I knew it! I KNEW it! You’ve been
dialog: plotting against me all this time!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: This is too good to be true!
text: Harry turns to Dumbledore in horror.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Professor, no!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Quiet, Harry!
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you’ll be
dialog: coming with us to the Ministry--
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd
dialog: hit that little snag.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: I see no snag, Dumbledore.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: But I do. You seem to be laboring
dialog: under the delusion that I would
text: ‘come quietly.’
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Resisting arrest, now are you,
dialog: Dumbledore?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Precisely. You see, I have
dialog: absolutely no intention of going to
dialog: Azkaban.
text: The Auror next to Kingsley slowly moves his hand towards his
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Don’t be silly, Hawkes. Leave the
dialog: wand there.
dialog: 125.
text: The man stops.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: You would really take on two
dialog: Aurors, Dolores, and myself,
dialog: Dumbledore?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Naturally. All of you did rather
dialog: well on your spellwork at this
dialog: school, but if you attempt to take
dialog: me in by force, I’m afraid I shall
dialog: have to hurt you.
text: In one motion, all of them draw their wands. Harry dives for
dialog: cover.
text: Dumbledore is fastest. There is an instant of BLINDING LIGHT
text: as spells blast in all directions. A spell strikes
text: Dumbledore’s desk with a BANG, and explodes. Dust fills the
dialog: room.
text: There is a shout and some SCUFFLING OF FEET, another BANG,
dialog: and silence.
text: Harry blinks and stands as the dust settles. Dumbledore
text: hasn’t moved. Fudge, the Auror, Dolores, Kingsley, and Percy
text: are all laying on the floor, unconscious.
text: Dumbledore’s desk has been broken in half, and all of the
text: tables overturned.
text: He moves swiftly to McGonagall, Harry, and Marietta.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Are you all right?
text: McGonagall is standing, dusting herself off.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Yes, we’re fine.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Oh, where will you go, Albus?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I’m not going into hiding. Fudge
dialog: will soon regret removing me from
dialog: Hogwarts.
text: Harry moves to Dumbledore’s side.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I’m so sorry, Professor!
dialog: 126.
text: Dumbledore smiles at him.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: It’s fine. Now listen to me, Harry.
dialog: Keep studying Occlumency! Do
dialog: everything Professor Snape tells
dialog: you.
text: He grips Harry’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Close your mind! You will
dialog: understand, in time.
text: Fudge is stirring.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Lay back down. They must not think
dialog: we have had time to talk.
text: They do so. He moves to Fawkes.
text: Fudge opens his eyes. Dumbledore grabs onto Fawkes’ tail, and
text: the two VANISH in a BLAST of FIRE.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Find him!
text: Umbridge, Percy, Kingsley, the auror, and Fudge race from the
dialog: office.
text: McGonagall ushers Harry and Marietta out of the office.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Harry sits next to Ron and Hermione.
text: Umbridge stands up from the staff table, holding a parchment.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: “By Order of the Ministry of Magic:
dialog: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace
dialog: Albus Dumbledore as Head of

dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: My first act as your new
dialog: Headmistress is to form an
text: Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco
dialog: Malfoy. They will report directly
dialog: to me about the goings on in the
dialog: halls of this school.
text: Harry glares at her.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Furthermore, our good caretaker,
dialog: Mr. Filch has requested we
dialog: reinstate the ‘old punishments.’ I
dialog: have decided that there is no
dialog: reason we shouldn't.
text: Filch stands at the back of the hall, grinning like a kid at

scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS COURTYARD - DAY
text: Harry, Hermione, and Ron head towards the Hogwarts Grounds.
text: Ron is dressed in his Quidditch robes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you sure you can’t? Hagrid said
dialog: it was important.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: No way. Quidditch practice. If I
dialog: don’t show up, Angelina’1ll go mad.
dialog: They part ways.
scene_heading: EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY
text: Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid march through the FORBIDDEN
speaker_heading: FOREST.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Hagrid...we’ve been walking for a
dialog: good hour.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Its jus’ up ahead, here.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Could you tell us what it is,
dialog: Hagrid, please?
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: All righ’. Well, I’m showin’ yeh
dialog: this, because tha’ Umbridge woman
dialog: put me on probation. I can’ last
dialog: much longer afore I get sacked like
dialog: Trelawney.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: We won’t let her!
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Bah. S’not the end o’ the world. If
dialog: I do, I’ll go help Dumbledore.
dialog: Grea’ man...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Anyway, I woudn’ tell yeh ‘cept for
dialog: tha’. I can’ leave withou’ makin’
dialog: arraingmen’s, see?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I’‘ll need all o’ yer help.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Of course we’ll help.
text: Hagrid took a great sniff and clapped her on the back,
text: causing her to stumble slightly.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Knew yeh’d say yes!
text: He pauses and glances at them.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Okay, real quiet like from here on.
text: They creep down the path until Hagrid straightens and smiles.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: There we are!
text: There is a huge body laying on the ground before them. It is
text: a giant.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Hagrid, I thought none of them
dialog: wanted to come!
text: Hagrid looks uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: None o’ them did, Hermione! I didn’
dialog: have much ruddy choice inna matter!
dialog: I couldn’ leave ‘im!
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: He’s me brother!
text: There is a silence in the forest.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum
dialog: had ‘im afore she died.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I though’ I could bring ‘im back
dialog: here an’ train ‘im up a bit. Teach
dialog: ‘im a bit o’ manners.
text: Hermione is distraught. Harry is nervous. Hagrid moves
text: towards his half-brother.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Here. I’1l introduce yeh to Grawp!
text: He tosses a rock at GRAWP. It bounces off his head. The giant
text: awakes, and slowly stands to his full FIFTEEN-FOOT height.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Yeh all righ’, Grawp?
text: Grawp gives a low roar.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Look wha’ I brough’ yeh, Grawpy!
dialog: Two new friends an’ all. We ‘ave
dialog: Harry Potter here, see? An’ over
dialog: here is Hermy.
text: Grawp stops roaring and simply looks at them. Then he reaches
text: out towards Hermione.
speaker_heading: GRAWP
dialog: Hermy!
text: Harry grabs her and pulls her behind a tree as the huge fists
text: close around the air. Hagrid hits Grawp with a large stick.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Bad Grawpy! Bad boy!
text: Grawp roars in pain.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: We don’ attack our friends, Grawpy!
text: Grawp roars again. Hagrid, Hermione, and Harry flee the
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: See, he don’ know any better.
text: Harry glares at him.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go
dialog: an’ talk to ‘im. Give ‘ima bit o’
dialog: company.
dialog: 130.
text: Suddenly Hagrid stops and looks around. From the undergrowth,
text: a large number of CENTAURS have appeared.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Oh blimey...
text: BANE steps into the clearing.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: I thought we told you that you were
dialog: no longer welcome in this place,
dialog: Hagrid. You or that beast you
text: brought from afar.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: S’not up to you who comes and goes
dialog: in this forest.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: You stopped us from invoking our
dialog: punishments on Firenze for becoming
dialog: the servant of the humans at
dialog: Hogwarts.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Stopped yeh from committin’ murder,
dialog: yeh mean!
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: Our ways are not yours, Hagrid. And
dialog: now you bring that monster
dialog: here...our patience with it wanes
dialog: swiftly.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
dialog: Well, you’1l tolerate ‘im as long
dialog: as he’s here!
text: The Centaurs paw the ground in agitation.
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: BANE
dialog: We allow you to pass this time,
dialog: Hagrid, because you have young with
dialog: you. But the next time you enter
dialog: this forest, your life is forfeit.
text: The centaurs vanish into the undergrowth again.
scene_heading: INT. MCGONAGALL’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harry enters McGonagall’s office. She sits behind her desk.
text: Umbridge sits in the corner with a note pad.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Please sit, Potter.
text: He sits.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: You’re here to have a talk with me
dialog: about your career thoughts, Potter.
dialog: We do this so we can begin to aim
dialog: your courses over the next two
dialog: years to prepare you for that
dialog: career.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, yeah. Well, I did think about
dialog: being an Auror.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Auror. Interesting, Potter. You’1l
dialog: need top grades for that.
dialog: Challenging career path, but not
text: unrewarding.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Hem hem.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Now then, Potter, you’1ll need to
dialog: concentrate on Defense Against the
dialog: Dark Arts, Potions,
dialog: Transfiguration, and Charms to
dialog: adequately prepare yourself for the
dialog: general Auror requirements.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Hem hem.
dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: May I offer you a cough drop,
dialog: Professor Umbridge?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Oh, no thank you, Minerva.
dialog: Actually, I was just wondering if
dialog: Potter has the proper temperament
dialog: to be an Auror.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Were you indeed.
text: She turns back to Harry.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: If you’re serious in this ambition,
dialog: Potter, I would recommend
dialog: concentrating on bringing your
text: Potions and Charms grades up before
dialog: your O.W.L.s. I daresay you’ve got
dialog: enough time if you apply yourself.
dialog: Lord knows you’ve consistently done
dialog: well in Defense Against the Dark
dialog: Arts. Professor Lupin--
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Excuse me, Minerva, but have you
dialog: seen my note on Potter’s current
dialog: grades in my class?
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Yes, indeed I have.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Then I think you will find that
dialog: Potter’s grades have been
dialog: consistently poor this year.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: You apparently misunderstand me. I
dialog: meant that Potter has done well in
dialog: every Defense Against the Dark Arts
text: class taught by a competent
dialog: teacher.
text: She turns briskly back to Harry. Umbridge looks as though she
text: cannot believe her ears, then flips a page on her notepad and
text: scribbles furiously.
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Now, assuming you’ve passed all of
dialog: your necessary classes, the
dialog: Ministry will put you through a
dialog: number of character and aptitude
dialog: tests.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s involved in them?
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: How you stand up under pressure,
dialog: your perseverance, and dedication,
dialog: things of this nature.
text: Umbridge stands abruptly.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Harry Potter has no chance of ever
dialog: becoming an Auror!
text: McGonagall stands as well, her eyes locked with Harry's.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: I will assist you in becoming an
dialog: Auror if it the very last thing I
dialog: do, Potter! I will coach you
dialog: nightly in order to get the
dialog: necessary grades!
text: Umbridege storms from the room.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: This concludes our meeting, Potter.
text: She smiles at him. He smiles back.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Thanks, Professor.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: You're welcome, Potter. Now hurry
dialog: or you'll be late for Occlumency.
scene_heading: INT. SNAPE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harry sits down in front of Snape’s desk.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Have you been practicing, Potter?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Well, we shall see, won’t we?
dialog: 134.
text: He places his wand-tip to his head and extracts that same
text: memory and places it in the pensive.
text: Just then, the door opens and Draco Malfoy steps in.
speaker_heading: MALFOY
dialog: Excuse me, Professor. Professor
dialog: Umbridge says she needs you right
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: What on earth for?
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: Well, sir, remember when Montegue
dialog: vanished over Christmas? She says
text: he’s turned up in a toilet on the
dialog: fourth floor.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Any idea how he got there?
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: He’s pretty confused, but I think
dialog: he said something about the
text: Vanishing Closet.
text: Snape stands irritably.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: We will pick your remedial potions
dialog: lesson up tomorrow, Potter.
text: Draco sniggers. They depart.
text: Harry looks around for a moment, then stands and looks
text: the pensive.
text: He looks at the door. There is silence. He plunges his
text: into the pensive, and his body is sucked into it.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - DAY
text: Harry stands next to the GREAT LAKE. Under a tree sits
text: young Sirius. Next to him are the equally young Lupin,
text: PETIGREW, and lastly JAMES POTTER.
dialog: into
dialog: head
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: James
dialog: again.
dialog: James
dialog: Lupin
dialog: James
text: is playing with a Snitch, letting it go and
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Put that away, James.
text: shrugs and does so.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I’m bored. Wish it was full moon.
text: snorts.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Easy for you to say.
text: nudges Sirius.
text: Sirius grins.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: This should cheer you up, Sirius.
dialog: Look.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Excellent! Snivellus!
dialog: 135.
dialog: catching it
text: Snape is walking by. The four of them stand and follow him.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: All right, there, Snivellus?
text: Snape turns in a flash, wand out. Sirius is faster, however.
text: Snape’s wand flies from his hand. He dives for it.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Expelliarmus!
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Impedimenta!
text: Snape stops moving, struggling against INVISIBLE ROPES.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: You just wait...
text: Sirius laughs.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Wait for what, Snivellus? You to
dialog: wipe that great greasy nose on us?
dialog: 136.
text: Several bystanders laugh.
text: James raises his wand, turning to the bystanders.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: And now, the moment you’ve all been
dialog: waiting for--
speaker_heading: LILY EVENS
dialog: Leave him alone, James Potter!
text: James turns. Harry does as well. It is LILY EVANS. Harry’s
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Another charity case, Lily?
speaker_heading: LILY EVENS
dialog: What has he done to you?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Nothing. It’s more the fact that he
dialog: exists, you see...
text: The IMPEDIMENT CURSE wears off. Snape grabs his wand and
text: turns. James whirls.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Semper--—
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Levicorpus!
text: Snape was lifted into the air and dangled by an ankle. He
text: struggled madly, his robe hanging from his arms and over his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: LILY EVENS
dialog: Leave him alone, Potter!
text: James turns and smiles at her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I will if you go out with me.
speaker_heading: LILY EVENS
dialog: I wouldn’t go out with you if it
dialog: were a choice between you and the
dialog: giant squid! Now let him down.
text: James shrugs and gestures with his wand. Snape falls to the
text: ground. He tries to go for his wand again, but Sirius hexes
dialog: him.
dialog: 137.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Locomotor mortis!
text: Lily draws her wand.
speaker_heading: LILY EVENS
dialog: I said, leave him alone!
text: James slowly turns to regard her. The playful expression on
text: his face has vanished.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Don’t make me hex you, Lily.
speaker_heading: LILY EVENS
dialog: Then let him go!
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Fine!
text: He mutters the counter-curse and Snape struggles to his feet
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You’re lucky Lily was here,
dialog: Snivellus!
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: I don’t need help from a mud-blood
dialog: like her!
text: James eyes are BLAZING with anger. He points his wand, which
text: is shaking in his hand from his rage, at Snape.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Apologize to her! Now!
speaker_heading: LILY EVENS
dialog: Don’t make him apologize. Honestly,
dialog: you’re as bad as he is!
text: James whirls on her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I would never call you that.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: LILY EVENS
dialog: You make me sick, Potter.
text: She turns and walks away.
dialog: 138.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Lily! Hey Lily!
text: Harry watches her go. The adult Snape grabs Harry’s arm
text: roughly. Harry turns to him, horrified. Snape yanks on the
text: arm and the memory dissolves around them.
scene_heading: INT. SNAPE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: There is a BLAST of LIGHT, and Snape and Harry return to
text: Snape’s office.
text: Snape is livid with rage. He is pale, his lips thin. He is
dialog: shaking.
text: He pulls Harry close with trembling fingers, glaring daggers
text: at him.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Having fun, Potter?
text: Harry shakes his head, but Snape shakes him roughly, fury
text: etched in his every feature.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Been enjoying yourself?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Amusing man, your father...
text: His lips are shaking, his teeth bared. He shakes Harry again,
dialog: absolutely SEETHING.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I--sorry!
text: Snape picks Harry up off the floor and FLINGS him away from
text: him. Harry slams into a potions cabinet and falls to the
text: ground as glass beakers and bottles shatter around him.
text: Snape points a shaking finger at Harry.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: You will repeat what you saw to no
dialog: one!
text: Harry is already shaking his head.
dialog: 139.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, of course not!
text: Snape picks up a jar of some fluid and hurtles it across his
text: office. It shatters into the wall.
text: Snape grabs Harry by the robe and hauls him to his feet,
text: shoving him against the wall.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: You had better not, Potter, or you
dialog: will experience a pain so horrible
dialog: you will wish you had never been
dialog: born!
text: He pushes Harry away from him.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Now get out of my sight! Do not set
dialog: foot in this office ever again!
text: Harry turns and runs.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: The whole school is gathered in the great hall.
text: Professor McGonagall stands in front of the staff table.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Today begins your O.W.L exams. A
dialog: number of Ministry instructors are
dialog: here to give them. Exams will take
dialog: place for the next two weeks. Exams
dialog: will be split in two parts, theory
dialog: and practical application.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I must warn you that the most

dialog: 140.
scene_heading: EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - NIGHT
text: Harry and Ron stand on top of the ASTRONOMY tower, peering
text: through telescopes into the night sky.
text: Harry’s TELESCOPE is propped on the PARAPET and he is leaning
text: over it slightly.
text: Below him, the doors to the GREAT HALL groan open. GOLDEN
text: LIGHT spills into the night, and six shadows move forward
text: into the darkness.
text: Harry and Ron watch.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Oy! That’s Umbridge down there!
text: Several other students begin to watch the proceedings taking
dialog: place below.
text: Harry looks panicked.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: They’re heading for Hagrid’s!
text: Ron and Harry exchange nervous glances.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR TOFTY
dialog: Eyes back on the sky, please.
text: The students ignore the Professor.
text: The six shadows approach the hut, silhouetted against the
text: windows of it.
text: They open the door, and it closes.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR TOFTY
dialog: Twenty minutes left on your exam,
dialog: students.
text: Shadows pace past the windows to Hagrid’s hut. Raised voices
dialog: reach them.
text: Then a sharp BANG is heard, along with a flash of BLINDING
text: light from within the cabin.
text: The door bursts open and Hagrid stumbles out, clutching at
text: his waist, followed by the other six.
text: The six shadows fire STUN SPELLS at Hagrid.
dialog: 141.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No!
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: The RED-COLORED spells simply impact with Hagrid and bounce
text: off of him.
speaker_heading: HAWLISH
dialog: Be reasonable, Hagrid!
text: Hagrid yells uncomprehensibly.
text: FANG leaps from the open door onto Hawlish, knocking the man
text: over. Fang bounds over to Hagrid and leaps in front of him,
text: taking a hex full in the chest and falls to the ground with a
text: whine.
text: Hagrid ROARS in rage, seizes the one responsible and hurls
text: him ten feet through the air. The man lands hard and does not
dialog: move.
text: Professor McGonagall storms through the doors of the Great
text: Hall and out into the night, fury written across her face.
scene_heading: EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - NIGHT
text: Ron points to McGonagall.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Look!
text: Harry smiles.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: McGonagall’‘1l sort this out!
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: She marches towards them. Her face is illuminated every few
text: moments by the red light of spells being fired.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: (shouting in rage)
dialog: How dare you! How DARE you!
text: She breaks into a run.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Stop this immediately!
dialog: 142.
text: The firing continues.
speaker_heading: MCGONAGALL
dialog: Enough!
text: She draws her wand in a swift motion. Instantly, four of the
text: attackers turn to her and fire their spells.
text: Before she can even react, they slam into her. She is briefly
text: illuminated in blood-red light and then is lifted from her
text: feet and hurled backward five feet to slam into the ground.
text: She does not move.
scene_heading: EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - NIGHT
text: Several students scream in terror. Professor Tofty covers her
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR TOFTY
dialog: Not even a warning!
text: Most of the students break for the doors leading back to the
text: Entry Hall, Harry and Ron among them. Professor Tofty
text: follows.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: Hagrid seems to go mad with anger.
speaker_heading: HAGRID
speaker_heading: COWARDS!
text: He leaps at the nearest attacker and CRACKS him across the
text: jaw. The man falls to the ground. Hagrid moves on to the
dialog: next, and then the next.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Get him, get him!
text: But Hagrid, dodging more stunning spells, hoists Fang onto
text: his shoulders and flees down towards the forest.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGWARTS GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: Students and teachers spill from the entry hall out into the
text: night, running for McGonagall.
dialog: 143.
text: They surround her, several teachers leaning over her. She
text: looks very pale and her eyes are closed. Others keep the
text: students at a safe distance.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR SPROUT
dialog: Get her to the hospital wing right
dialog: away.
text: Professor Flitwick steps forward and levitates McGonagall
text: into the air, floating her up the steps and into the school.
text: They leave dozens of muttering students behind, in the night.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: The long tables in the great hall have been moved aside. In
text: their place, hundreds of desks have been set up. It is at one
text: of these that Harry now sits.
text: PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS stands near the staff table.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS
dialog: Before we begin, I have an update
dialog: on Professor McGonagall. She will
dialog: be all right, and is resting in the
dialog: hospital wing.
text: Harry and Ron look encouraged.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS
dialog: You may now turn your papers over
dialog: and begin.
text: Harry turns over his paper and stares at it. He begins to
text: mark on it, scribbling answers.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Harry stares at the last page of his exam.
text: He winces and feels his scar. Shakes his head. Bends over his
dialog: paper again.
text: Again the scar twinges. Again he winces.
text: The Great Hall FADES away.
dialog: 144,
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF MYSTERIES - DAY
text: Harry moves down towards the door at the end of the corridor.
text: The same white light glows around it’s edges as in his
dialog: dreams...
text: He pauses before it, then tries the handle. It opens. The
text: LIGHT OVERWHELMS him.
scene_heading: INT. HALL OF PROPHESY - DAY
text: It dies abruptly. Harry stands in a huge room filled floor to
text: ceiling with shelves. On each shelf there are many tiny
scene_heading: GOLDEN ORBS.
text: LORD VOLDEMORT stands, grinning coldly at a man lying on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Can you reach it? Can you take it
dialog: for me, Black?
text: Sirius, surrounded by Death Eaters, glares defiantly at
dialog: Voldemort.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I would rather die!
text: Voldemort raises his wand. Sirius SCREAMS in AGONY, WRITHING
text: on the floor of the dark chamber.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Oh, you will die. Eventually. But
dialog: there are hours, even days of pain
dialog: awaiting you before then.
text: He releases Sirius, who slumps to the floor, panting for air.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: I’m going to enjoy this, Black. I
dialog: have you, and soon I shall have the
dialog: weapon. And then not even your
dialog: pathetic Order can stand in my way!
text: Voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh.
text: The room dissolves around Harry.
dialog: 145.
scene_heading: INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Harry falls out of his seat, clutching at his scar in agony.
text: Professor Marchbanks hurries to Harry’s side. He pulls Harry
text: to his feet and escorts him out of the Great Hall.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY
text: Professor Marchbanks looks at Harry, concern on his face.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS
dialog: Are you all right, Potter?
text: Harry shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR MARCHBANKS
dialog: Pressure of exams. It happens. Take
dialog: a breath, and maybe you'll be ready
text: to go back in. Time is nearly up,
dialog: but--
text: Harry is shaking his head.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No--no, I’ve done all I can.
text: Professor Marchbanks nods, and returns to the Great Hall. He
text: passes Ron and Hermione who run up to Harry.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Voldemort! He’s got Sirius! In the
dialog: Department of Mysteries!
text: Ron looks pale.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I just saw it.
text: He looks out at the Hogwarts grounds, then turns back to
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How’re we going to get there?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: To the Department of Mysteries?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We've got to do something!
text: Ron and Hermione exchange looks.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: How'd Voldemort get into the
dialog: Ministry of Magic without being
dialog: seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the
dialog: two most wanted wizards in the
dialog: world...
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Yeah. They can’t just waltz into
dialog: the Ministry of Magic!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: It just seems so unlikely, Harry!
text: Harry grabs her robes and glares at her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I won’t let Sirius die!
dialog: 146.
text: Just then Ginny, Luna, Fred, and George round the corner.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: We heard Harry yelling. What’s up?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Voldemort’s broken into the
dialog: Department of Mysteries. He’s got
dialog: Sirius there!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He could already have the weapon!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you!
dialog: He knows you’d rush off to save
dialog: Sirius.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: There isn’t anyone else, Hermione!
dialog: Everyone from the Order is gone!
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Anything we can do to help?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, there isn’t!
dialog: 147.
text: Ginny crosses her arms, looking slightly hurt.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Yes, they can, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Before we do anything, we need to
dialog: establish that Sirius really isn’t
dialog: at Headquarters. Which means we’1l
dialog: need to break into Umbridge’s
dialog: office.
text: She smiles, and glances at Fred and George.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: For that, we’ll need a really good
dialog: distraction.
text: Fred and George grin.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Right you are, Hermione. Think we
dialog: can whip something up, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Might be able to.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Just give us a few seconds.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Mind you, it’s got to be really
dialog: good!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Not to worry, Hermione. We’ve got
dialog: something that will outdue
dialog: everything else we’ve done here
dialog: combined.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It’s been too quiet around here
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Time we did some real damage to
dialog: this place.
text: They lean close to each other and begin whispering together
text: in excited voices.
dialog: 148.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: We’ll also need to keep everyone
text: away from her office.
text: Ginny brightens.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: We can do that! Me and Luna’1l
text: guard the hallway.
text: Harry smiles at them.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: We'll probably only manage five
dialog: minutes or so.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That’s all we'll need.
text: Fred and George straighten.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Right. You’ve got ten minutes to
dialog: get to Umbridge’s office. And
dialog: whatever you do, stay away from the
dialog: Astronomy Tower for the next couple
dialog: of hours.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Unless they spread, in which case,
dialog: I'd get out of the castle for a
dialog: while.
text: They leave.
text: Hermione turns to Harry.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Break out your Invisibility Cloak,
dialog: Harry.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - DAY
text: Ginny and Luna have taken up positions outside Umbridge’s
text: office at the ends of the hall on either side.
text: Suddenly, there is a BANG like a CANON has gone off, and the
text: whole castle shakes. Dust drifts from the ceiling.
text: Umbridge stumbles from her office, looking up at the ceiling.
text: Filch tears around the corner.
dialog: 149.
speaker_heading: FILCH
dialog: Professor! It’s those Weasley
dialog: twins! They’ve set something off in
dialog: the Astronomy Tower!
text: Umbridge smiles twistedly.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Ready to try out the old
dialog: punishments again?
speaker_heading: FILCH
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: They’ve had this coming for a long
dialog: time!
text: They depart around the corner. A second later, the door to
text: Umbridge’s office swings open and closed.
scene_heading: INT. UMBRIDGE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harry and Hermione drop the Invisibility cloak. Harry races
text: to the fireplace, snatching up a handful of FLOO POWDER. He
text: tosses it into the fire.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Grimmauld Place!
text: The fire turns bright green. Harry sticks his head into the
dialog: fire.
scene_heading: INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY
text: Harry’s head appears in the kitchen. It is empty.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sirius! Are you here!
scene_heading: INT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - DAY
text: Umbridge and Filch race around the corner and stop dead.
text: There is a DRAGON made of FIREWORKS sweeping through the
dialog: hallway.
text: Umbridge draws her wand and tries to stop it. The spell
text: EXPLODES harmless against the firework dragon, and it splits
text: into a dozen dragons which fly down different corridors.
text: They break into a run after the closest one and vanish down a
dialog: hallway.
dialog: 150.
text: Fred and George step out from behind a statue, laughing.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: That was worth it!
text: Filch steps back around the corner, grinning evilly.
speaker_heading: FILCH
dialog: I’ve got you now!
text: Fred and George break into a run. Filch follows, along with
dialog: Umbridge.
scene_heading: INT. HOGWARTS HALLWAY - DAY
text: Fred and George run full out down this hallway. Draco and the
text: Inquisitional Squad comes around the corner ahead. Fred and
text: George peel around, returning the way they had come, but
text: Filch and Umbridge block that way off.
text: The close in on the Weasley twins. Fred nods at George.
text: George pulls a nasty-looking DEVICE from his pocket and drops
text: it on the floor.
text: It explodes in a flash of LIGHT. Everyone covers their eyes.
text: When it clears, there is a huge SWAMP in the middle of the
text: hall and the Weasleys are standing well beyond Umbridge and
dialog: the Squad.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Thank you for playing, one and all.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And now, we've got to go!
text: They turn and vanish down another hallway.
scene_heading: INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY
text: Harry continues to shout.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
speaker_heading: KREACHER
dialog: What’s this? The Potter boy in the
dialog: fire...
text: Kreacher comes into view of the fireplace.
dialog: 151.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Kreacher, where’s Sirius?
speaker_heading: KREACHER
dialog: Master went out.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY
text: Fred and George skid to a stop in the entry hall near the
text: great doors leading outside.
text: From every direction, Inquisitional Squad members close in on
dialog: them.
text: Behind them, students and teachers pour into the entry hall.
text: Beaming, and not appearing the least bit afraid, Fred and
text: George wave to people in the crowd.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
text: So, turning a hallway into a swamp
dialog: is funny, is it?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Fairly amusing, yeah.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Well, now you’re going to learn
dialog: what happens to wrongdoers in my
dialog: school.
text: Filch pulls out a long evil-looking BLACK WHIP, smiling.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: This was never your school!
dialog: Hogwarts is Dumbledore’s school!
text: There is a loud cheer from the students filling the hall.
text: Umbridge looks around, livid with rage.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Well, now you’re going to get your
dialog: punishments right here, in front of
dialog: the whole school!
text: Fred snorts.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You know, I don’t think we are.
dialog: 152.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: George, I think we’ve outgrown full-
dialog: time education. Wouldn’t you agree?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Completely, Fred.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Time to enter the real world?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Definitely.
text: Together they raise their wands.
speaker_heading: FRED AND GEORGE
dialog: Accio brooms!
scene_heading: ITN. UMBRIDGE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Hermione shrieks as Fred and George’s brooms rip themselves
text: from the wall and fly out the door.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY
text: The brooms speed to Fred and George. They leap on them.
text: Draco and some others from the Inquisitional Squad charge
dialog: them.
text: Fred and George kick off from the ground and into the air.
text: Fred glares at Umbridge.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We won’t be seeing you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, don’t bother writing.
text: They wave their wands and the great doors open, revealing a
text: BEAUTIFUL SUNSET over the Forbidden Forest.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Be sure to visit us at our new
dialog: premises on Diagon Alley!
text: And they dive on their brooms, sailing out the doors and into
text: the beautiful sunset.
dialog: 153.
scene_heading: INT. GRIMMAULD PLACE - DAY
text: Harry glares at Kreacher.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know where he is, don’t you?
speaker_heading: KREACHER
dialog: Master does not tell Kreacher where
dialog: he goes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But you know.
text: Kreacher grins horribly.
speaker_heading: KREACHER
dialog: Master will never return from the
dialog: Department of Mysteries!
text: Harry gapes. Kreacher cackles in his nasty way, and scampers
text: from the room.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: Harry!
text: A stubby hand appears in the fire over Harry’s head and grabs
text: his hair, yanking him back. Both head and hand vanish from
dialog: the fireplace.
scene_heading: INT. UMBRIDGE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Umbridge throws Harry to the floor.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: You think you could simply walk
dialog: into my office without me knowing
dialog: about it? Foolish boy!
text: Harry looks around the room. Malfoy leans against a
text: windowsill. Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Ron, and Neville are under
text: guard by the Inquisitional Squad, their wands piled on the
dialog: floor.
text: Umbridege draws her wand and waves it at Harry.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Accio wand!
text: Harry’s wand flips from his pocket to Umbridge’s hand.
dialog: 154.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Who were you trying to contact?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It’s none of your business.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Draco, would you fetch Professor
dialog: Snape, please?
text: Draco leaves. Umbridge smiles sickeningly at Harry.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Very well, Potter. I have been
dialog: patient enough with you.
text: Draco returns with Snape.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: You wished to see me?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: I have just caught Potter trying to
dialog: communicate with someone in my
dialog: fire. I need some Veritaserum.
dialog: Truth syrum.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Well, it appears that I cannot help
dialog: you. I have none.
text: He turns to leave. Harry looks at him desperately.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He’s got Padfoot at the place it’s
dialog: hidden!
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: What? What does that mean?
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Potter, if I want nonsense shouted
dialog: at me, I shall inform you.
text: He sweeps from the office.
text: Umbridge is enraged.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: We've played nicely, Potter. You
dialog: leave me no choice!
text: She draws her wand, moving menacingly at Harry.
dialog: 155.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: You could have saved me a lot of
dialog: trouble if those Dementors I sent
dialog: to your house had finished you off!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You sent the Dementors?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Of course I did! Someone had to
dialog: act!
text: She points her wand at Harry’s chest.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
speaker_heading: CRUCIO!
text: Harry SCREAMS as the curse washes over him. He slumps to the
text: ground, shaking wildly.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: No! Please, stop!
text: Umbridge looks pleased and turns to Hermione.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Well, well.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hermione, no!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: We have to tell her, Harry...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I would rather die!
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you
dialog: silly girl! Who were you talking
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: We were trying to find Professor
dialog: Dumbledore. We had to tell him...
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Tell him?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: That it’s ready. The weapon.
dialog: 156.
text: Umbridge’s eyes are shining with eagerness. She smiles at
dialog: Hermione.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: You and Mr. Potter will take me to
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY
text: Umbridge, Harry, and Hermione move through the forest.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Much further, is it?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Oh, yes. It’s very well hidden.
text: They wander around for a while in silence. An ARROW lands in
text: the ground next to them. They stop, as about fifty Centaurs
text: emerge once again from the underbrush.
speaker_heading: MAGORIAN
dialog: What are you doing in our forest?
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Your forest? This forest belongs to
dialog: the Ministry of Magic!
text: The centaurs move closer.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Stay back, you beasts!
text: There are HOWLS of rage from the ranks of Centaurs. Many nock
dialog: and draw their bows.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: You cannot attack me! Any attack on
dialog: a wizard by a half-breed--
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Don’t call them that!
text: Magorian ROARS in anger.
speaker_heading: MAGORIAN
dialog: You dare to insult us?
text: Umbridge points her wand at him, though it is shaking in her
dialog: hands.
dialog: 157.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Come no closer!
text: Magorian rears up on his hind-legs and beats his chest.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Incarcerus!
text: Ropes fly from her wand and wrap themselves around Magorian.
text: The Centaurs charge Umbridge.
text: Harry grabs Hermione and they leap behind a tree. They can
text: still here Umbridge scream, as the centaurs surround her.
speaker_heading: UMBRIDGE
dialog: Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half-
dialog: bloods!
text: There is BLAST like a GUNSHOT and Umbridge screams again.
text: Harry and Hermione are grabbed by two Centaurs.
speaker_heading: CENTAUR
dialog: What of these two?
speaker_heading: CENTAUR #2
dialog: They have been here with Hagrid.
dialog: They have heard the warnings and
dialog: disobeyed. They must suffer the
dialog: consequences!
text: Several trees to their left are torn from the ground and
text: tossed aside like twigs. There stands Grawp.
text: The centaurs stop dead in their tracks. Grawp ROARS.
scene_heading: INT. UMBRIDGE’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Draco paces in front of Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville,
text: smiling.
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: God, I can’t wait until all you
dialog: Weasleys have been expelled. Your
dialog: stench has been fouling this castle
dialog: for too long.
text: Ron glares at him.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Shut up, Malfoy!
dialog: 158.
text: Draco smiles and punches Ron in the gut. He doubles over.
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: That’s for speaking to me. You
dialog: know, you Weasleys are just as bad
dialog: as Mudbloods!
text: Ron has fallen near the pile of wands on the floor. Draco
text: ignores him and sneers at Ginny.
speaker_heading: DRACO
dialog: You know, Weasley, it’s really too
dialog: bad Potter saved you from the
dialog: Chamber of Secrets.
text: Ginny struggles against Crabbe, who is restraining her.
text: Ron snatches up his wand.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Stupify!
text: Crabbe falls over. Ginny leaps at Draco, who is knocked to
text: the ground. Luna calmly kicks her restrainer in the shins.
text: Neville slips out of the strangle-hold he’d been in and
text: snatches up his wand.
text: Goyle waves his wand, but Neville is faster.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Expelliarmus!
text: THe wand flies away. Ginny rolls away from Draco, scooping up
text: her wand. She waves it at him, and he’s blasted backward into
text: the wall. He slumps to the floor.
text: They exit the office.
scene_heading: INT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY
text: There is silence as they all stare at Grawp.
speaker_heading: GRAWP
dialog: Haggar!
text: There is another silence. Grawp sees Harry and Hermione.
speaker_heading: GRAWP
dialog: Hermy! Where Haggar?
text: The centaurs raise their bows to point at the giant.
dialog: 159.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Grawp, help us!
text: Grawp ROARS again and BEATS his CHEST.
speaker_heading: GRAWP
dialog: Grawp save Hermy!
text: He reaches out for them. The centaurs LOOSE their ARROWS.
text: They pepper Grawp across the face and chest. He roars in
text: AGONY and begins stomping on the ground, as if trying to
text: squash the centaurs, who scatter.
text: Harry grabs Hermione’s hand and drags her away from the
text: fight. As they depart, they hear Grawp one last time.
speaker_heading: GRAWP
dialog: (v.o.)
text: GRAWP WANT HAGGAR!
text: Harry and Hermione reach the edge of the forest. They stop to
dialog: catch their breath.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Great plan, Hermione.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I thought it worked out rather
dialog: nicely.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are we supposed to do now?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: That’s just what we were wondering.
text: Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville appear from around Hagrid’s

text: Harry and Hermione look surprised.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: So, how do we get to the Ministry?
text: He tosses Harry and Hermione their wands.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I’d imagine we should fly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We’ve got no brooms.
dialog: 160.
speaker_heading: LUNA
dialog: There are other ways to fly.
text: She nods in the direction of the forest.
speaker_heading: LUNA
dialog: I mean, they can fly, and they're

text: Harry turns around and sees three THESTRALS watching them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are those?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What are what?
text: He looks right at them and doesn’t see them.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: There’s nothing there, Harry.
speaker_heading: LUNA
dialog: Yes, there is. They’re Thestrals.
dialog: You can’t see them unless you’ve

text: Neville is quiet. Finally, he looks up.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I can see them too.
text: Harry claps his hands.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: All right, then. Get on one, and

speaker_heading: RON

text: The Thestrals dive. Hermione gives a SHRIEK of surprise as
text: they swoop down closer to the lights of London.
scene_heading: INT. LONDON - NIGHT
text: They SOAR between buildings and finally set down in front of
text: a TELEPHONE BOOTH.
text: Ron jumps off of the thestral shakily.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Never again...
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: What now, Harry?
text: Harry leads the way to the telephone booth. He opens the door
text: and steps in. The rest cram inside with him.
scene_heading: INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - NIGHT
text: The lift grinds to a halt and the doors swing open. Harry and
text: the others step out to the receptionist area with the GOLDEN
speaker_heading: FOUNTAIN.
text: The place is deathly quiet and completely deserted.
text: They fan out, wands at the ready. Harry waits a moment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: All right, come on.
text: They head past the fountain and up the steps into the
dialog: Ministry of Magic.
scene_heading: INT. LIFT - NIGHT
text: This larger lift CLINKS downward slowly. Finally, it grinds
text: to a halt.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: Department of Mysteries.
text: The doors open and Harry leads the others out. This
text: department too is abandoned.
dialog: 162.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where is everyone?
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: The Ministry closed a half-hour
dialog: ago. I expect they all went home.
text: Harry nods grimly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That’s how Voldemort got in
text: unnoticed.
text: They walk until they reach the hallway from Harry’s dreams.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This is it. Come on.
text: They make their way down the long hall until they reach the
text: door at the end of the hall. Only it does not glow.
text: Harry tries the handle. It swings open.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stay close.
text: He steps into the next room.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF DOORS - NIGHT
text: This room is large and circular. It is filled with identical
text: doors all the way around. It is illuminated by BLUE-FLAMED
speaker_heading: CANDLES.
text: After Neville enters the room, the door swings shut with an
text: ECHOING BANG.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Now where?
text: Harry looks around, confused.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don’t understand. In my dream,
dialog: the doors weren’t identical.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Well, let’s try a few.
text: Harry nods.
dialog: 163.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. I’‘1ll know the way when I see
dialog: it.
text: He goes to the first door he sees and opens the door.
text: He steps inside. The others follow.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF THE VEIL - NIGHT
text: Harry opens the door and enters. The rest follow.
text: The room is like an upside-down ZIGGURAT, with huge steps
text: leading to the base of the pit. On the lowest level rests a
text: dark, grey VEIL that flutters as if there were a breeze.
text: Soft whispers fill the room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who’s there?
text: He clambers down to the Veil and stares hard at it. The
text: whispers INTENSIFY. Harry looks around the room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sirius?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: There’s no one here, Harry. This
dialog: isn’t the right room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Does anyone else hear that?
speaker_heading: LUNA
text: I do. It’s coming from the Veil.
text: They look at it. It flutters menacingly though there is no
dialog: wind.
text: Harry moves closer to it, slowly.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Harry...
text: His eyes are locked on the veil. He walks closer.
speaker_heading: LUNA
dialog: There are people in there!
dialog: 164.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What do you mean, people?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry, I think we should leave.
text: Harry reaches out his hand towards the veil.
text: Hermione comes up behind Harry and grabs his arm. He tries to
text: pull away from her, eyes still locked on the veil.
text: The whispers have intensified into HARSH MOANS as Harry is
text: only feet away from the veil.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry, we’re here for Sirius,
dialog: remember?
text: Harry stops. He blinks and drops his hand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sirius...yeah...
text: She gently leads him away from the Veil. The moans have
text: returned to whispers once again, muttering angrily as they
dialog: depart.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF DOORS - NIGHT
text: They return to the Room of Doors. Hermione draws a FLAMING X
text: over the door they just closed.
text: Harry moves to the next one. It is locked. He raises his
dialog: wand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Alohomora!
text: It remains closed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Whatever’s in there, the Ministry
dialog: sure doesn’t want anyone getting to
dialog: it.
text: He moves to the next door and opens it, stepping inside.
scene_heading: INT. CLOCK ROOM - NIGHT
text: They enter the CLOCK ROOM. Every surface is covered in
dialog: clocks.
dialog: 165.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This is it! Come on!
text: They move through the clocks.
text: Harry leads them back to the end of the room, where another
text: door lies.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This is it. This is where Sirius
dialog: is!
text: He opens the door and charges through.
scene_heading: INT. HALL OF PROPHESY - NIGHT
text: Harry and the others spill into the HALL OF PROPHESY and
text: stop. Harry glances around. They grip their wands tightly.
text: The room is GIGANTIC, being over fifty feet high and
text: incredibly lond. There are rows and rows of shelves.
text: On every shelf are dozens of dusty GOLDEN ORBS.
text: The room is LIT by more BLUE-FLAMED CANDLES.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He’s in here somewhere.
text: He leads them down the center isle, peering down each row. He
text: turns down one row, leading them to the end. This end opens
text: out into another wide isle.
text: The row is empty. He looks around in confusion.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: I don’t think Sirius is here.
text: Ron stares at one of the orbs.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Harry, have you seen this?
text: Harry looks over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Er...it’s got your name on it.
text: Sure enough, there was a golden orb resting on the shelf with
text: the label “S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D.: The Dark Lord and (?) Harry
dialog: Potter.”
dialog: 166.
text: Harry reaches out for it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s my name doing here?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Don’t touch it, Harry!
text: Harry glares at her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Yeah, Harry, don’t.
text: He looks at Neville, who is very pale.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It’s got my name on it!
text: He takes it off the shelf and looks at it.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: I warned you before that one day
dialog: you would come to a sticky end,
dialog: Potter.
text: LUCIUS MALFOY emerges from the shadows, cloaked all in black.
text: Two dozen other Death Eaters emerge around him.
text: Harry and the others are surrounded and outnumbered.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where’s Sirius?
text: Lucius, and several other death eaters laugh.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: We don’t have him, if that’s what
dialog: you mean.
text: Harry is stunned.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You never did, did you? It was all
dialog: just a trick.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: The Dark Lord knows your weakness
dialog: for heroics, Potter. All it took
dialog: was a little nudge to get you here.
dialog: 167.
text: Lucius reaches out his hand, palm up.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Now give me that prophesy.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What prophesy?
text: Lucius points at the Golden orb.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: That prophesy. Now hand it over or
dialog: we'll have to use wands on you.
text: Harry raises his wand at the same time that Ginny, Neville,
text: Hermione, Ron, and Luna raised theirs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Go ahead.
text: Lucius regards him coldly.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Very brave of you, Potter. Or are
dialog: you foolish?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come and find out!
text: Lucius doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Really, Potter. You expect to
dialog: defeat all of us with your little
dialog: school friends? Now hand it over,
dialog: and they won’t have to die here.
text: One of the Death Eaters moves forward, throwing back her
text: hood. It is BELLATRIX LESTRANGE.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: I haven’t escaped from Azkaban for
dialog: this!
text: She raises her wand. Lucius forces her arm down.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: No! If the prophesy is smashed--
text: He stops and turns back to Harry. But Bellatrix turns to
text: several other Death Eaters.
dialog: 168.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Take the youngest girl. We’ll see
dialog: how committed Potter is as we
dialog: torture her.
text: Ron, Hermione, Luna, and Neville close in around Ginny. Harry
text: steps in front of Ginny, wand out and aimed at Bellatrix’s
text: chest. He holds the prophesy in his other hand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You even try to take her and I’‘11
dialog: smash this thing.
text: He tosses the prophesy casually into the air and catches it
text: again. Lucius starts in horror.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So, what kind of prophesy are we
dialog: talking about here?
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Surely you jest, Potter?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not really. How come Voldemort
dialog: wants it?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: You dare to speak the Dark Lord's
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who, Voldemort? Oh, yeah, I dare.
dialog: Voldemort, voldemort, Voldemort--
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Silence! How dare you utter that
dialog: name from your half-blood mouth!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, did you know Voldemort’s a
dialog: half-blood too?
text: Bella raises her wand to strike, but Malfoy stops her again.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Control yourself, Bellatrix!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What’s so special about this
dialog: prophesy anyway?
text: Bella shrieks with laughter.
dialog: 169.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: You mean Dumbledore never told you
dialog: the reason you bear that scar was
dialog: hidden here?
text: Harry looks as if slapped, he is so surprised.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
text: Lucius and the Death Eaters laugh.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: When I give the signal, blast the
dialog: shelves...
text: Hermione and Ron nod grimly.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: So that’s what took you so long. We
dialog: wondered.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But why did he need me to take it?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Only a person for whom the prophesy
dialog: was made can remove it from its
dialog: self, Potter, and the Dark Lord
dialog: certainly couldn’t get it himself.
text: Harry is angry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So he used me to do his dirty work,
dialog: did he?
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Precisely, Potter.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Now!
text: No less than six wands fire into the shelves at once. The
text: Death Eaters cover their faces as DEBRIS covers them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: RUN!
text: Dust fills the air. Entire shelves fall CRASHING to the
text: ground, raining glass shards and golden orbs. The students
text: break and run for the door.
dialog: 170.
text: Malfoy grabs Harry by the shoulder. Hermione waves her wand
text: at him.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Stupify!
text: Malfoy is blasted backward. Harry and Hermione run after the
dialog: others.
text: Spells explode around them.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Stop them!
text: Harry is the last through the door.
scene_heading: INT. CLOCK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Hermione slams the door shut and points her wand at it.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Colloportus!
text: The door seals itself.
text: Harry looks around. Only Hermione and Neville are still with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where'd the rest go?
text: Hermione looks around.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry, they went the wrong way!
text: They run after Ron, Ginny, and Luna. Just then, the door
text: blasts off its hinges.
text: Harry, Hermione, and Neville dive underneath several desks.
text: Death Eaters enter the room, slowly moving between the clocks
text: and desks.
speaker_heading: DEATH EATER
dialog: They might have gone on to the
dialog: hall.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Check under the desks.
text: Harry leaps out from under his desk.
dialog: 171.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stupify!
text: A JET of RED LIGHT hits one of the Death Eaters in the chest.
text: He is knocked backward into the wall.
text: Hermione jumps from under her desk and runs for the exit.
text: Bellatrix sees her and raises her wand.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Avada--
text: Neville emerges from beneath his desk.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Expelliarmus!
text: Bella’s wand flies from her fingers. Harry finishes her off.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stupify!
text: Bellatrix is STRUCK with the same red light and falls to the
dialog: ground.
text: There is a YELL from the next room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ron!
text: Two Death Eaters enter the room.
speaker_heading: DEATH EATER
dialog: Impedimenta!
text: The spell blasts Harry, Hermione, and Neville backward.
text: Neville flies over a desk. Hermione strikes a bookshelf and
text: is nearly buried under the falling books, and Harry strikes
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: DEATH EATER
dialog: We’ve got him!
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Silenco! Stupify!
text: The death eater falls silent, and then to the ground.
text: Harry staggers to his feet, dazed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Pretificus Totalus!
dialog: 172.
text: The second Death Eater falls to the ground and cannot move.
text: The mute Death Eater attacks Hermione, making a slashing
text: movement with his wand.
text: Purple flame BLASTS from the wand and slashes Hermione across
text: the chest. Her eyes go wide and she falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Stupify!
text: The death eater falls over.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hermione!
text: He runs to her. She appears to be sleeping.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Please don’t be dead, please don’t
dialog: be dead...
text: He shakes her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hermione, wake up...
text: Neville runs over.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What’s they do to her?
text: Harry shakes his head. Neville feels her wrist.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: She’s alive, Harry. There’s a
dialog: pulse.
text: Harry sighs in relief.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can we carry her?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I’ll do it. You’re better at
dialog: fighting.
text: He hoists Hermione up on his back. They move on to the
dialog: room.
dialog: next
dialog: 173.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF DOORS - NIGHT
text: Harry, and Neville, still carrying Hermione, re-emerge into
text: the circular room of doors. Hermione’s X’s have fades from
dialog: the walls.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where do we go?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don’t know...
text: A door opens and Luna and Ginny emerge, helping Ron walk
dialog: between them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What happened.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: I think my ankle’s broken. And
dialog: somebody hit Ron with a weird
dialog: spell...
text: Ron laughs strangely.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Hiyya, Harry.
dialog: (he giggles)
dialog: You look funny....
text: He laughs again.
text: Ginny’s legs give way, and both she and Ron fall to the
dialog: ground.
text: Harry is at Ginny’s side, looking concerned. She is breathing
dialog: very hard.
speaker_heading: LUNA
text: They hit her with something too.
text: Harry straightens.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We need to get out of here. Luna,
dialog: can you help Ginny?
text: Luna moves to her side.
text: Another door opens, and five death eaters emerge.
dialog: 174.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: There they are!
text: Stunning spells rain all around them. The wounded group heads
text: for the nearest door.
text: Luna is blasted off her feet by a stunning spell. She and
text: Ginny TUMBLE to the floor. Harry has no choice but to keep
dialog: running.
text: The next stunning spell hits Neville in the back. He falls to
text: the ground, Hermione rolling away from him.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF THE VEIL - NIGHT
text: Harry and Ron stagger into the Room of the Veil. Just as they
text: enter, Ron is hit and falls. Harry slips and tumbles down to
text: the bottom of the chamber. He comes to rest by the DAIS of
dialog: the Veil.
text: Doors all around him burst open and Death Eaters enter,
text: climbing down to surround him--from a safe distance.
text: Harry staggers up onto the dais, his wand held weakly in his
text: hand. Blood trickles out of his mouth and down his chin.
text: Malfoy shoves his way towards Harry.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Your race is run, Potter. Hand it
dialog: over.
text: Harry glances around frantically.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Let my friends go and I will.
text: Bellatrix and several other Death Eaters drag his friends
text: into the chamber.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: You are not in a position to
dialog: negotiate.
text: Neville struggles against the Death Eater holding him.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Don’t do it, Harry! Don’t!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stop, Neville!
dialog: 175.
text: Bellatrix looks at Neville.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Neville? Neville Longbottom?
text: She laughs in glee.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: My dear boy, I paid your parents a
dialog: visit a long time ago. We had such
dialog: a time!
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You put them in St. Mungos!
text: Bellatrix beams at him.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or
dialog: I’1l see how long it takes to crack
text: Longbottom like his parents.
text: Harry is desperate.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Don’t give it to them!
text: Bellatrix points her wand at him.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Crucio!
text: Neville HOWLS in PAIN, curling up in a ball and SCREAMING at
text: the top of his lungs.
text: The doors at the top of the chamber EXPLODE off their hinges.
text: Everything stops as Lupin, Sirius, Moody, Tonks, and
dialog: Kingsley.
text: They BLAST spells at the Death Eaters. Malfoy moves to
text: attack, but Tonks disarms him.
text: Harry leaps off of the DAIS, landing next to Neville.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Yeah...
text: He and Harry begin making their way away from the fighting. A
text: man grabs Harry from behind, his large, sweaty arm around
text: Harry's throat.
dialog: 176.
speaker_heading: DEATH EATER
dialog: Give me the prophesy!
text: Neville leaps upon his back and hits him in the face. Harry
text: elbows him in the ribs. The man falls away. As he falls, he
text: strikes Harry’s hand by accident.
text: The prophesy flies from his hand.
text: Malfoy sees it. He raises his wand. Sirius leaps into him.
text: Both men fall the rest of the way to the lowest level of the
text: room, landing hard.
text: The prophesy bounces off of a step, flips down to the next
text: level and shatters against the stone.
text: A GHOSTLY version of Professor Trelawney appears over the
text: shattered golden orb, speaks something which cannot be heard
text: over the fight, and dissolves away.
text: Harry and Neville seem frozen, staring at the broken pieces
dialog: of the orb.
text: Sirius gets to his feet and sprints to Harry and Neville.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Get out of here, you two!
text: He points at one of the doors.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: That will take you back out of the
dialog: Department of Mysteries.
text: Sirius makes to go back to the fight. Harry grabs his hand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You come with us!
text: Sirius shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: You’re the important one, now,
dialog: Harry. I have to help the Order.
text: Slowly, Harry lets go of Sirius’s robe sleeve. He looks into
text: his Godfather’s eyes.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: I‘ll always be here for you, Harry.
dialog: Now go!
dialog: 177.
text: He pushes Harry away from him towards the door. A spell
text: rockets past Sirius’s head.
text: Bellatrix leaps down in front of Sirius. She smiles. Sirius
dialog: grins.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Hello, cousin!
text: He fires a spell at her. She dodges, leaping down to the Dais
text: on which the Veil sits. Sirius leaps after. Their wands
text: clash, blinding lights exploding from the tips.
text: Harry and Neville climb towards the door.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Potter!
text: They whirl around to find Lucius only feet away, holding his
text: wand out at them.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: We may have lost the prophesy, but
dialog: I can still deliver you to the Dark
dialog: Lord!
text: He waves his wand.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Stupify!
text: Harry raises his own.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Protego!
text: Malfoy’s spell bounces away from Harry.
text: The door opens and Dumbledore, EYES BLAZING, enters, his wand
text: at the ready.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: It’s Dumbledore!
text: Malfoy attempts to run, but Dumbledore snaps his wand out,
text: and Malfoy is knocked over and dragged back.
text: Dumbledore moves past Harry and Neville, descending into what
text: appears to be a war zone.
text: He reaches the fight before the Death Eaters even know he’s
dialog: there.
dialog: 178.
text: Dumbledore blasts two of them across the room before the rest
text: notice. They break for the exits, but members of the Order
text: are already there, stunning them.
text: Bellatrix fires a stunning spell. Sirius ducks under it,
text: laughing.
speaker_heading: SIRIUS
dialog: Is that the best you’ve got,
dialog: cousin?
text: He doesn’t even see it coming. He’s barely finished his
text: sentence when the second spell strikes him in the chest.
text: He is lifted up into the air, a look of shock upon his face.
text: Time seems to slow for Harry as he watches Sirius’s descent.
text: And then Sirius falls into the Veil, his body simply falling
text: behind it. He does not reappear on the other side.
text: Harry sprints for his Godfather, but he seems to move in slow
dialog: motion.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Sirius!
text: He leaps down towards the Veil, abandoning everything. Tears
text: are streaming down his face. His wand drifts from his grasp
text: and clatters behind him.
text: He leaps to the lowest level and charges up to the DAIS.
text: Lupin reaches out and grabs him, holding him fast.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Let me go!
text: He hits at Lupin, trying to break away from him.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Harry! HARRY!...he’s gone...there’s
dialog: nothing you can do...
text: Harry hits him across the face, still struggling wildly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
speaker_heading: LIAR!
text: Things seem to slow down. All sound dies away for Harry.
text: Spells flash and explode all around, bathing the room in
text: strange colors, mixing with the light of the blue candles.
dialog: 179.
text: But Harry’s legs simply give out and he slumps against Lupin,
text: who is also weeping.
text: Harry clenches and unclenches his fists in agony, beating
text: them weakly against Lupin’s chest.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No...no...no....
text: Lupin bodily picks Harry up, still weeping, and carries him
text: away from the Dais.
text: He lets go of Harry and turns to help Neville. Harry stands,
text: dumbfounded beside him, still staring at the Veil.
text: Kingsley leaps up to duel with Bellatrix, but she blasts him
dialog: aside.
text: Dumbledore turns and attempts to stop her, but she deflects
text: the spell and leaps towards the door.
text: Harry watches her, and there is COLD FURY in his eyes.
text: Harry sprints after her. Lupin turns to see him leaping up
dialog: after Bellatrix.
speaker_heading: LUPIN
dialog: Harry, no!
text: He flies through the door after her.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM OF DOORS - NIGHT
text: Harry enters just to see Bellatrix escape through a doorway.
text: He charges after her.
scene_heading: EXT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - NIGHT
text: Harry sprints down the steps leading out to the GOLDEN
text: FOUNTAIN and the Telephone Lift. Bellatrix is nearly to it.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: You can’t stop me, Potter!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I’LL KILL YOu!!
text: He brandishes his wand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stupify!
dialog: 180.
text: Bellatrix turns and deflects it. She fires back at him. Harry
text: dives behind the fountain.
text: There is silence. Then, the slow footfalls of Bellatrix.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Come out, come out, Potter...
text: Harry grows more angry by the second.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Well, well, have you come to avenge
dialog: your dear Godfather?
text: Harry leaps out from behind the fountain.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Crucio!
text: He hits her squarely in the chest. She SHRIEKS in pain and
text: falls to the ground, but she rolls away from him to her feet
text: almost immediately.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Crucio!
text: Harry leaps behind the statue of the Centaur. Bellatrix’s
text: spell blasts the Centaur’s head off. It clangs away into the
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Never used an Unforgivable Curse
dialog: before, have you, Potter? You have
dialog: to mean it, you have to want to
dialog: cause the pain in your very soul...
text: She tries to outflank him, but he moves behind another
dialog: statue.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Give me the prophesy!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can’t. It got smashed by accident!
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: You lie!
text: Harry laughs.
dialog: 181.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How’s Voldemort going to like that?
dialog: You’ve failed him, and he’s not
dialog: very forgiving, is he?
text: Bellatrix lets out a shriek of horror.
speaker_heading: BELLATRIX
dialog: Forgive me, Master! I tried, I--
text: Harry laughs again.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He can’t hear you from here, you
dialog: know!
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Can’t I, Potter?
text: Voldemort has appeared in the middle of the hall, his wand
dialog: pointed at Harry.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: So, you smashed my prophesy...
text: Harry doesn’t move, frozen into stillness by the horror.
text: Voldemort sneers.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: I grow tired of you continually
dialog: thwarting my plans, Harry Potter!
text: He snaps his wand down.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Avada Kadavra!
text: Green light EXPLODES from his wand. Harry flinches, but the
text: statue of the GOLDEN WIZARD leaps down from the fountain and
text: takes the blast full in the chest. It explodes in a thousand
text: shards of molten metal.
text: Voldemort whirls. Dumbledore stands at the doorway, looking
text: ferocious, his BLUE EYES BLAZING.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You should not have come here
dialog: tonight, Tom.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: It is you who made that mistake,
dialog: Dumbledore!
dialog: 182.
text: He slashes with his wand.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: Avada Kedavra!
text: Dumbledore VANISHES with a swirl of his cloak and reappears
text: between Voldemort and Bellatrix.
text: She tries to run, but Dumbledore knocks her to the ground
text: with a stunning spell, vanishing again just as another
text: KILLING CURSE strikes the wall and explodes, shaking the
dialog: hall.
text: He reappears close to Voldemort. Dumbledore raises his wand
dialog: and strikes.
text: A BLINDING LIGHT issues forth from it, the POWER of it
text: staggering. Voldemort conjures a GLOWING, TRANSLUCENT SHIELD
text: around himself. Dumbledore’s spell COLLIDES with it, filling
text: the room completely with BLINDING LIGHT. The whole room
dialog: shakes.
text: Harry staggers to the ground. Bits of dust and rock fall from
dialog: the walls.
text: The light fades and Voldemort is unharmed.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: You do not seek to kill me,
dialog: Dumbledore?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: There are other ways to destroy a
dialog: man, Tom.
speaker_heading: VOLDEMORT
dialog: There is nothing worse than death!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You are quite wrong, Tom, as you
dialog: have always been.
text: Voldemort fires another killing curse at Dumbledore. Fawkes
text: the Phoeniz swoops down from above and SWALLOWS the jet of
text: green light, EXPLODING into flames and falling to the earth.
text: Dumbledore spins, sending a constant flow of BLINDING LIGHT
text: BLASTING from his wand, the sheer POWER of it SHAKING the
text: HALL. Voldemort raises his own wand, and the LIGHT separates
text: around him. Dumbledore and Voldemort are SURROUNDED by the
text: flow of LIGHT.
dialog: 183.
text: Dumbledore grits his teeth as a high wind BILLOWS his CLOAK
text: around him. Voldemort glares at Dumbledore, EYES BLOOD-RED.
text: His wand trembles in his hand, and Voldemort is slowly being
text: forced backward by the power of the STREAM of LIGHT.
text: Fear flickers in Voldemort’s eyes. He lets out a ROAR of
text: frustration. A ring of GREEN FLAME surrounds him, and he
text: vanishes in a TONGUE of RED-ORANGE FIRE.
text: Dumbledore’s stream of LIGHT BLASTS into the wall and PUNCHES
text: a HUGE, GAPING HOLE in the wall, shaking the whole Ministry.
text: Harry is lifted bodily into the air and tossed into the wall
text: from the explosion.
text: There is a sharp CRACK of rock BREAKING, and half of the
text: ceiling falls in. Dumbledore whips around his wand and Harry
text: is pulled from under the falling rocks.
text: Voldemort reappears on the PILINTH where the statues had
dialog: been.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look out!
text: He raised his wand, shouting a spell. The water in the pool
text: below the statues instantly flow upward to surround Voldemort
text: in a globe of water.
text: Voldemort vanishes from within the globe of water, and it
text: crashes back down to the pool, spilling over onto the floor.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Professor!
text: He stands up.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Stay where you are, Harry!
text: Dumbledore sounds frightened.
text: Then Harry SCREAMS. His scar simply SPLITS open and BLOOD
text: SPIRTS from it. He shrieks in agony, the pain unbearable.
text: Harry speaks, but it is not his voice.
speaker_heading: HARRY /VOLDEMORT
dialog: Kill me now, Dumbledore...do it, if
dialog: death means nothing...
dialog: 184.
text: Green flames explode from all of the fireplaces around them,
text: and people appear as they APPERATE. Cornelius Fudge arrives
dialog: too.
text: Voldemort shrieks in pain, and he appears across the room. He
text: snatches up the unconscious body of Bellatrix and
text: DISSAPARATES in a blast of GREEN FIRE.
text: Harry slumps to the ground. His eyes are closed, his face
text: peaceful. Blood flows from his scar across his face to the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Harry!
text: He runs to Harry’s side and touches his skin. He closes his
text: eyes and whispers a spell. Harry’s eyes snap open.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Are you all right, Harry?
text: Harry nods, dazed.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who!
dialog: He was right there!
text: Fudge is standing in the middle of the room, a dazed look
text: also on his face.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: I know...I saw him too...
text: Dumbledore stands. Half the room gasps and draws back. Fudge
text: seems to notice him for the first time.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: If you and your men will proceed to
dialog: the Death Room, you will find
dialog: several Death Eaters which I and
text: some others have apprehended.
text: Fudge points at Dumbledore.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Seize him!
text: Dumbledore stands to his full height, his eyes BLAZING with
speaker_heading: ANGER.
dialog: 185.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Minister, you have just seen You-
dialog: Know-Who in the flesh only seconds
dialog: ago! It is time to come to your
dialog: senses!
text: Fudge looks cowed.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: If you insist on trying to arrest
dialog: me, I am perfectly willing
dialog: demonstrate how useless such an
dialog: attempt will be.
text: No one looks remotely interested in trying to arrest
dialog: Dumbledore.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Dumbledore, what the blazes
dialog: happened here?
text: Dumbledore smiles, and walks back over to Harry, lifting him
text: to his feet.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I will explain everything,
dialog: Minister. Just as soon as I return
dialog: Harry to school.
text: Fudge (and half the crowd) turns to see Harry for the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: What’s he doing here? And what’s
dialog: happened to him?
text: Dumbledore taps his wand against Harry’s scar and the
text: bleeding stops.
text: He turns to the Minister of Magic.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Minister, you will order the
dialog: removal of Dolores Umbridge from my
dialog: school.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Also, she will probably need
dialog: medical attention, having had a
dialog: violent encounter with some
text: Centaurs earlier this evening.
dialog: (pause)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 186.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE (cont'd)
dialog: All Educational Decrees will be
dialog: nullified and you will call off the
dialog: search on Hagrid so he can return
dialog: to work.
text: Fudge is sputtering incomprehensibly.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I will return here later tonight,
dialog: after I have seen to Harry. It
dialog: should not take long.
text: He taps the Golden centaur head.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Portus.
text: He motions Harry over.
speaker_heading: FUDGE
dialog: Dumbledore, I want some answers!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
text: The Second War has begun, Minister.
text: Harry takes the head with Dumbledore, and they vanish from
dialog: the Ministry of Magic.
scene_heading: INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Harry and Dumbledore reappear in his office. There are shouts
text: of welcome from the portraits.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Thank you...
text: He takes a small baby Phoenix from his pocket and places it
text: on Fawkes’ stand.
text: Dumbledore’s desk has been repaired, and the Pensive rests
dialog: upon it.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Please sit, Harry.
text: Harry is staring at him, bitterness and sorrow evident on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I understand how you feel, Harry--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No you don’t!
dialog: 187.
text: Dumbledore looks hard at him.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You forget that Sirius was my
dialog: friend too. You are not the only
dialog: person on this earth capable of
dialog: feelings, Harry.
text: Harry nearly snarls at him.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: There is no shame in feeling pain,
dialog: Harry. It is your greatest
dialog: strength...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You don’t have a clue! You can’t
dialog: possibly know!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: What can’t I know?
text: Harry grabs an instrument from one of the tables and throws
text: it across the room.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: This pain is part of being human,
dialog: Harry...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Then I don’t want to be human!
text: He kicks at a table, and the leg breaks, sending the whole
text: thing crashing to the ground.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don’t care! I don’t care!
text: He begins to silently weep, tears pouring down his face. He
text: throws over another table and falls to his knees.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You do care. You care so much you
dialog: feel like you will bleed to death
dialog: because of it.
text: Harry gets to his feet.
text: Harry turns and moves to the door. He yanks on the handle.
text: The door will not open. He looks at Dumbledore.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Let me out.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: No.
text: Harry draws his wand, looking furious.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You can’t keep me in here!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I daresay I can. And if you
dialog: actually do attack me with that
dialog: wand, Harry, I'm afraid to say you
dialog: will regret it.
dialog: 188.
text: Harry is silent, breathing hard and glaring at Dumbledore.
text: The Headmaster indicates the chair in front of his desk.
text: Harry finally sits, looking sulky.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: It is my fault Sirius died tonight.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I have kept things from you, Harry.
dialog: Things that I should not have
dialog: concealed. You had a right to know,
dialog: but I put off telling you.
text: Dumbledore sighs, sadly, and suddenly he seems very old.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Had I told you that Voldemort might
dialog: try to lure you down to the
dialog: Department of Mysteries you would
dialog: never have gone there tonight.
dialog: Sirius would never have gone after
dialog: you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That fault lies with me. I hope
dialog: that you can find it in your heart
dialog: to forgive me one day.
text: Harry stares angrily out the window.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Harry, I owe you this explanation,
dialog: to show you the failings of an old
dialog: man.
text: Harry continues staring out the window.
dialog: 189.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Our explanation begins with your
dialog: scar. You already know that it is a
dialog: connection between you and
dialog: Voldemort, and that this connection
dialog: goes both ways.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I grew worried that Voldemort would
dialog: at some point discover this
dialog: connection, which he did the night
text: Mr. Weasely was attacked.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I already know all this.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Haven’t you wondered why I haven’t
dialog: spoken to you, even looked at you,
dialog: for months?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, yeah, I did...
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I was worried that if Voldemort
dialog: discovered there was a closer
dialog: relationship between us than simply
dialog: between teacher and student he
dialog: would use you to spy on the Order.
dialog: Another mistake.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Voldemort showed us both tonight
dialog: that his aim in possessing you
dialog: would not be to destroy me, but to
dialog: destroy you.
text: Harry looks at his shoes.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Sirius told me you believed there
dialog: was a snake inside of you. This was
text: Voldemort attempting to manipulate
dialog: you. To protect you from this, I
dialog: had you study Occlumency.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But Snape stopped giving me
dialog: lessons.
dialog: 190.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Yes. I thought he could overcome
dialog: his feelings towards your father,
dialog: but I was wrong. Some wounds cut
dialog: too deep to be healed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He barely taught me, though. I
dialog: always felt more open to it after
dialog: the lessons. Like he was trying to
dialog: open me to Voldemort--
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I would trust Severus Snape with my
dialog: life, Harry. You have never
dialog: recovered from your mistrust of him
dialog: in your first year.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sirius didn’t trust him. Didn’t
dialog: believe he’d really turned to our
dialog: side...
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
text: Again, some wounds run too deep to
text: be healed, Harry. Severus and
dialog: Sirius never liked each other at
dialog: school. This has never changed.
text: Harry glares at the carpet.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: During your Occulumency lessons,
dialog: Professor Snape discovered that you
dialog: were dreaming about the door in the
dialog: Department of Mysteries.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I’ve been dreaming about that all
dialog: year, before Voldemort discovered
dialog: the connection.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed
dialog: with hearing that prophesy since he
dialog: returned. Because of your scar,
dialog: what he was obsessed with, you were
text: obsessed with, in the form of
dialog: dreams.
dialog: (pause)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 191.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE (cont'd)
dialog: Once he discovered the connection,
dialog: Voldemort had little difficulty in
dialog: Manipulating you into thinking he
dialog: had captured Sirius.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But I checked Grimmauld Place!
dialog: Kreacher said--
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go
dialog: to the Department of Mysteries.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Kreacher has been serving two
dialog: masters for some months now.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: It appears that when Sirius told
dialog: him to get out, Kreacher thought he
dialog: meant out of the house. So he went
dialog: to the Black’s closest relatives,
dialog: the Malfoys.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Obviously, they questioned him.
dialog: Sirius had forbidden him from
dialog: giving up important secrets. But
dialog: Sirius had neglected to mention his
dialog: relationship with you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He told them how you saw him as a
dialog: mixture of father and brother, and
dialog: that you would move heaven and
dialog: earth to save Sirius.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Voldemort knew that making you
dialog: believe he had Sirius in the
dialog: Department of Mysteries would force
dialog: you there.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wait, where was Sirius when I tried
dialog: to contact him?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured
text: Buckbeak to distract him in case
dialog: you tried to contact Headquarters.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 192.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE (cont'd)
text: Sirius was tending to the wounds
dialog: when you called.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And Hermione said we should be nice
dialog: to Kreacher!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: She was quite right, Harry.
dialog: Kreacher is what wizards have made
dialog: him. He is to be pitied, not hated.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sirius hated him.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: He didn’t hate Kreacher himself.
dialog: Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius
dialog: of the home he had always hated.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, he really hated that place.
dialog: And you kept him locked up in
dialog: there!
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I was trying to save his life!
text: Dumbledore buries his head in his hands. Harry is
text: dumbfounded.
text: The Headmaster looks up finally.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: It is time to tell you what I
dialog: should have five years ago. No
dialog: doubt you have wondered why it was
dialog: that I sent you there and not to a
dialog: wizarding family?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I did it for your protection. You
dialog: were in more danger than anyone
text: realized. Voldemort was defeated,
dialog: but his servants were everywhere.
text: Harry is silent.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I also knew that Voldemort would
dialog: return one day. I played to his
dialog: weakness. There is an ancient magic
dialog: which Voldemort has always
dialog: underestimated.
dialog: (pause)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 193.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE (cont'd)
dialog: This magic is what your mother gave
dialog: you when she died. That protection
dialog: would only work, however, if you
dialog: were cared for by a blood relative.
dialog: Your Aunt, Petunia.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She never loved me.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Perhaps not. But she took you in,
dialog: however grudgingly. As long as you
dialog: can call your Aunt’s house your
dialog: home, you are protected.
text: Harry looks away.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: And now we come to the moment of
dialog: terrible truth, the moment I have
dialog: dreaded for fifteen years. The
dialog: moment when I must lay another
dialog: burden atop your already straining
dialog: shoulders.
text: Harry stares into his blue eyes.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Do you remember your first year
dialog: here? When you lay in the hospital
dialog: wing fresh from your confrontation
dialog: with Voldemort?
text: Harry nods.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Do you remember what you asked me
dialog: that night?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I asked you why Voldemort tried to
dialog: kill me.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Yes. I decided not to tell you
dialog: then. After all, eleven was too
dialog: young for such burdens. The same
dialog: went for twelve. But I was running
dialog: out of excuses by thirteen and
dialog: fourteen. Do you see the flaw in my
dialog: plan yet?
text: Harry shakes his head.
dialog: 194.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: I cared about you too much. I
dialog: became more concerned with your
dialog: happiness and well-being than with
dialog: the truth and the lives it could
dialog: save. That was my greatest mistake.
dialog: It was exactly what Voldemort
dialog: expects from us fools who love.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But I could not bear to tell you. I
dialog: have watched you pass through
dialog: greater trials than any other
dialog: student in the history of this
dialog: school, and I could not bear to add
dialog: another one, the greatest one of
dialog: all.
text: He looks at Harry, sympathy and regret etched on his face.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You have no idea the pain it causes
dialog: me to tell it to you, even now. But
dialog: unfortunately, I must.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don’t understand, Professor.
text: Dumbledore sighs again.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: The reason Voldemort tried to kill
dialog: you is because of a prophesy made
dialog: just before your birth. By
dialog: attempting to kill you, he believed
dialog: he was fulfilling the terms of the
dialog: prophesy. Voldemort’s mistake was
dialog: that he had not heard the entire
dialog: prophesy.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That is the weapon we have been
dialog: guarding, and which he has been so
dialog: desperately seeking: the knowledge
dialog: of how to destroy you.
text: Harry sighs this time. He looks at the floor.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Professor, why am I so important to
dialog: him?
text: Harry hangs his head.
dialog: 195.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: An excellent question, Harry. The
text: answer lies in the prophesy.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sir, it got smashed.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: That was not the only place the
dialog: Prophesy is preserved.
text: Dumbledore raises his wand to his temple and extracts a
text: memory, placing it in the pensive. He waves his wand over it.
text: The ghostly image of Professor Trelawney rises from the bowl.
speaker_heading: TRELAWNEY
dialog: “The One with the power to vanquish
text: the Dark Lord approaches....Born to
dialog: those who have thrise defied him,
dialog: born as the Seventh Month
dialog: dies...and the Dark Lord will mark
dialog: him as his equal, but he will have
dialog: a power the Dark Lord knows
dialog: not...and either must die at the
dialog: hand of the other for neither can
dialog: live while the other
dialog: survives....The One with the power
dialog: to vanquish the Dark Lord will be
dialog: born as the Seventh Month dies...”
text: The image of Trelawney fades.
text: Harry looks staggered.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I’m not sure I understand all that,
dialog: sir...
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: It means that the only person with
dialog: a chance of defeating Voldemort was
dialog: born at the end of July to parents
dialog: who had resisted him three times
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And...it means me?
dialog: 196.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Interestingly, there were two boys
dialog: whom the prophesy could have been
dialog: referring to. You and Neville
text: Longbottom.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So it’s not necessarily me, sir?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: You forget the next qualification
dialog: of the prophesy. The Dark Lord will
dialog: mark this boy as his equal.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: In giving you that scar, Voldemort
dialog: did so. I’m afraid that the
dialog: prophesy is most certainly
dialog: referring to you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What if he chose wrong?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: He chose the child he believed to
dialog: be the more dangerous. He chose the
dialog: “half-blood” wizard because he saw
dialog: some of himself in you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He tried to kill you and instead
dialog: gave you the power and the future
dialog: to destroy him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why didn’t he wait? Why attack when
dialog: we were babies?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Voldemort had an informant
dialog: listening to my meeting with
text: Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he
dialog: was discovered before he could hear
text: the entire prophesy. Voldemort had
dialog: to act immediately, he didn’t know
dialog: the rest of the prophesy. All he
dialog: knew was that he had to destroy the
dialog: child who would grow to be a threat
dialog: to his power.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But I don’t have any special
dialog: powers.
text: Dumbledore is silent for a moment.
dialog: 197.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: There is a room in the Department
dialog: of Mysteries which is kept locked
dialog: at all times. It contains a force
dialog: so wonderful and yet terrible that
dialog: it is greater than death itself. It
dialog: is that power which you have
dialog: incredible amounts of and of which
dialog: Voldemort has none.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is it, sir?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: This power drove you to save Sirius
dialog: tonight. It kept Voldemort from
dialog: possessing you, he cannot bear to
dialog: touch it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: In the end, it was your heart and
dialog: not your head that saved you.
text: Harry looks away.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
text: There is only the end of the
dialog: prophesy which we haven't
dialog: addressed. It states “neither can
dialog: live while the other survives.”
text: Harry slowly looks up at Dumbledore.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: It is the final burden which I must
dialog: place on you, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: One of us has to kill the
dialog: other...in the end.
text: Dumbledore nods, and there are tears misting his eyes.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Yes.
text: They sit quietly together. Dumbledore softly wipes a tear
text: from his cheek.
scene_heading: EXT. GREAT LAKE - DAY
text: Harry sits by himself on a boulder by the side of the lake.
text: He watches the sunset.
dialog: 198.
scene_heading: NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK
dialog: Hello, Harry.
text: Harry turns to see NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK, a GHOST, standing
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, Nick.
text: Nick looks uncomfortable.
scene_heading: NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK
dialog: I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to
dialog: tell you that Hermione and Ron are
text: out of the hospital wing.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh. Thanks.
text: He stands and they begin to walk back to the castle together.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nick, I was wondering about
dialog: something?
text: Nick looks even more uncomfortable now.
scene_heading: NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK
dialog: I’ve been expecting this...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Expecting what?
scene_heading: NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK
dialog: A lot of people come to me when
dialog: they’ve lost loved ones.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I expect so...
text: There is a silence.
scene_heading: NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK
dialog: He’s not coming back, Harry.
text: There is another silence.
scene_heading: NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK
dialog: Few wizards choose the path I have
dialog: chosen.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 199.
scene_heading: NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK
dialog: I am neither here nor there, Harry.
dialog: Trapped between two worlds. That
dialog: does not appeal to most.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I know nothing of the secrets of
dialog: death, Harry. I was afraid of it. I
dialog: preferred to survive as a feeble
dialog: imitation of life than face the
text: vast unknown.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I often wonder if that was a wise
dialog: decision.
text: They approach the great doors leading to the entry hall.
text: Nick looks at Harry.
scene_heading: NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK
dialog: I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more
dialog: help, Harry. Truly I am.
text: Nick vanishes through the wall into the castle. Harry steps
text: through the doors into the entry hall.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY
text: Harry enters.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Harry!
text: He turns to see Hermione and Ron racing down the steps
text: towards him.
text: Hermione throws herself into Harry’s arms in a huge bear hug.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Good as new, mate.
text: Hermione pulls herself away from Harry and looks at him
dialog: closely.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: How are you doing, Harry?
text: Harry pauses for a long moment, thinking.
dialog: 200.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Better.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Come on, let’s go in to the feast.
text: Harry shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You two go on. I want to be alone
dialog: for a while.
text: Hermione nods. They turn away and begin to walk into the
dialog: great hall.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I’ve got something to tell you.
dialog: Something important.
