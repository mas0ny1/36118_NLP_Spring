text: Calvelli starts to move quietly; not waking any of the others.
text: Calvelli now travels through the underbrush to the edge of
text: the bayou where he sees:
speaker_heading: MASTERSON
text: holding the Trapper's head under water. The Cajun is on
text: his stomach, a rope ties: his arms behind his back -- Master-
text: son lets his head up momentarily then pushes it back into
text: the muddy water. The Trapper goes under, spitting bubbles.
speaker_heading: CALVELLI
dialog: What the hell you doing?
speaker_heading: MASTERS ON

scene_heading: CONTINUED: SUNDAY NIGHT
text: Masterson shoves the Trapper back in.
text: In a flash, Calvelli's right hand slashes out - the switch-
text: blade cutting along Masterson's poncho...a warning slash.
speaker_heading: MASTERSON
dialog: That's the second time you pulled
dialog: that on me.
text: Masterson takes out his bayonet. The long blade glistens in
dialog: the night rain. .
text: Calvelli backs away.
text: Masterson keeps coming.
dialog: Slash...slash.
text: Calvelli has no choice. The two men circle.
speaker_heading: CALVELLI
dialog: Okay, you got it.
text: Masterson lunges for the gut. Calvelli takes the feint and
text: leans back as Masterson continues the thrust upwards, barely
text: raking Calvelli from jaw to cheek. A fine line of blood
text: seeps out of the razored cut. Masterson smiles.
text: They circle each other, feinting for an opening; Masterson's
text: bayonet cutting circles through the falling rain.
text: Calvelli's left hand grabs Masterson's right wrist in mid
text: air, pulling it sideways, pitching Masterson off balance.
text: Calvelli pounces, the two men go down, each holding the
text: other's knife wrist.
text: ROLLING IN THE MUD
text: Once, twice. On the third roll the flash of the Cajun

text: His leverage has Masterson's wrist bent backwards, forcing
text: the bayonet from Masterson's grip. They roll over and come
dialog: apart.
text: Each man up quickly, each dives for the blade lost in the
dialog: mud.
text: Calvelli now has the bayonet. Masterson now has the switch-
dialog: blade.
text: Masterson lunges. Catches Calvelli off guard. Calvelli
text: throws his left arm up to block the stab. The switchblade
text: plunges into the lower flesh of Calvelli's bicep and sticks...
text: Calvelli's knife hand lashes up, misses, but his knuckles
text: catch Masterson flush on the jaw, a solid right hook.
text: Masterson stumbles backwards, leaving the switchblade stuck
text: in Calvelli's arm.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE WAY
text: Norman, Atwater, Wilson come running up through the under-
text: brush. Stop and stare at the two struggling men.
speaker_heading: CALVELLI
text: leaps on top of Masterson; they both go down hard...
text: Masterson on his back; Calvelli on top of him.
text: Calvelli's left wrist is pressed tight under Masterson's jaw,
text: pinning him, gagging him. Calvelli's shaking right hand
text: holds the bayonet shoulder high...Masterson is totally vul-
text: nerable, his empty arms stretched out in surrender...totally

dialog: him.
text: He can't believe what he's done. Can't believe it. But
text: it's there. Staring up at him. He did this. With his
dialog: own hand.

speaker_heading: LONGBRAKE
