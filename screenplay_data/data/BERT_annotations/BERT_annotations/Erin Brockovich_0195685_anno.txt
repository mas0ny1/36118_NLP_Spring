dialog: A True Story
dialog: by
dialog: Susannah Grant
dialog: February 1, 1998
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY
text: Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars
text: motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls
text: of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.
text: ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,
text: past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,
text: Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of
text: this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-
text: HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop. So high it hurts to look
text: at them. As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see
text: they're leaving a 99-cent store.
text: As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are
text: connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.
text: Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.
text: They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break. The men
text: pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful
dialog: woman. In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes
text: rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.
text: - Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the
text: tops of her thighs.
text: - A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a
scene_heading: MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.
text: - A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the
scene_heading: TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.
text: It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block
dialog: that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is
text: so goggle-eyed. Eye-catching is an understatement. All
dialog: those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have
text: obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.
scene_heading: EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY
text: A side street. No pedestrians, just parked cars. A PARKING
text: TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to
text: her voice. Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.
text: As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses
text: accidentally CLATTER to the ground.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Shit.
text: When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: God damn it.
text: She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.
text: WIDER ON THE STREET
text: The Hyundai starts it up, signals. Then, just as it pulls
text: slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the
text: corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side
text: of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median. It
text: SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost. And stops.
scene_heading: EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE - DAY
text: A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded
text: by strip malls. Definitely not where the power lawyers work.
speaker_heading: ROSALIND (O.S.)
dialog: Morning, Mr. Masry. How you doing today?
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY
text: Generic. Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art. A sign over
text: the reception desk reads: MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.
text: ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper
text: receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand. He's in his
text: mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM --
text: already rumpled.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind.
dialog: Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that
text: is his career has long since dissipated. He trundles off
text: toward his office.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what
dialog: can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner.
text: She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Tony Marvin.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, Jesus. Who's responsible for his pain
dialog: and suffering this time?
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: His dry cleaners. You want him?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What do you think? What's this?
text: He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Tequila. From your drug dealer friend.
speaker_heading: ED
text: Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: He's a low-life. Speaking of which, that's
dialog: your nine o'clock in there.
text: Ed peers into his office. It's a mess -- papers everywhere,
text: unopened mail. Standing in the middle of the room is Erin,
text: in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress. As she jiggles a
text: spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously.
text: Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Whoa.
dialog: (to Brenda)
dialog: Remind me.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Erin Brockovich. Car accident. Not her
dialog: fault, she says.
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: And she looks like such an honest girl, don't
dialog: you think?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Right. Lap-dancers are people too.
text: As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: I can't find him, Tony. We'll have to call
dialog: you back.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Not an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery
text: entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin -- hi. Sorry you had to wait. Here,
dialog: sit down, sit down.
text: He clears a stack of papers off a chair.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Thanks a lot.
dialog: (as she sits)
dialog: I tell you, I never thought just standing
dialog: would take it out of me, but ever since that
dialog: shithead hit me, it feels like my whole
dialog: body's put together wrong.
text: Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Jesus, you poor thing.
dialog: (he sits)
dialog: Well, listen, you came to the right place.
dialog: Whoever did this to you made one hell of a
dialog: mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make
dialog: him pay for it.
text: He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why don't you tell me what happened?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY
text: Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she
text: owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to
text: Ed, who's questioning her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I was pulling out real slow, and out of
text: nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the
dialog: corner like a bat outta hell ...
text: She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits
text: nobly in surgical scrubs. His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS
text: are behind him. A frigging Norman Rockwell painting.
scene_heading: LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: They took some bone from my hip and put it
dialog: in my neck. I didn't have insurance, so I'm
text: about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
speaker_heading: STILL LATER:
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... couldn't take painkillers cause they
dialog: made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
speaker_heading: STILL LATER:
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's
dialog: just nine months.
speaker_heading: STILL LATER:
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person,
dialog: a decent citizen. Just wanna take good care
dialog: of my kids. You know?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (oh so moved)
dialog: Yeah. I know.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: Erin is still on the stand. But now the doctor's lawyer is
dialog: questioning her.
scene_heading: DEFENDING LAWYER
dialog: Seventeen thousand in debt. Whew. Is your
dialog: ex-husband helping out?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Which one?
scene_heading: DEFENDING LAWYER
dialog: (feigning shock)
dialog: There's more than one?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. There's two. Why?
text: Erin looks over at the jury. The personification of
dialog: conservative family values. Oh, shit.
scene_heading: LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (getting defensive)
dialog: ... not like a career, cause I had my babies.
dialog: But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't
dialog: have this neck thing.
text: Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem.
text: Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.
scene_heading: DEFENDING LAWYER
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Right. No doubt.
text: Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances. Great.
speaker_heading: STILL LATER:
text: The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive. Erin's starting
text: to feel the case slipping away.
scene_heading: DEFENDING LAWYER
dialog: So. You must've been feeling pretty
dialog: desperate that afternoon.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: What's your point?
text: Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad.
scene_heading: DEFENDING LAWYER
text: Broke, three kids, no job. A doctor in a
dialog: Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good
dialog: meal ticket.
text: Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement.
text: She's on a sinking ship.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What? Hey -- he hit me.
scene_heading: DEFENDING LAWYER
dialog: So you say.
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: He came tearing around the corner, out of
dialog: control --
scene_heading: DEFENDING LAWYER
text: An ER doctor who spends his days saving
dialog: lives was the one out of control --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (erupting)
dialog: That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY
text: The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out,
text: furious. Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Open and shut? Open and fucking shut?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: If you hadn't used profanity --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, please, it was long over by then. God
dialog: damn, he made me look like some cheap --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I told you the questions might get a little
dialog: personal --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Bullshit. You told me I'd get half a
dialog: million dollars. You told me I'd be set.
text: Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Settle down? I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr.
dialog: Masry! I can't afford to settle down!
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm sorry, Erin.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah? Well, fuck you. Sorry doesn't feed my
dialog: kids.
text: Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway.
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge. The
text: Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.
text: Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads
text: over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.
text: A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white
dialog: baby. This is MRS. MORALES.
scene_heading: MRS. MORALES
dialog: Hi, Erin! You're back so soon. How was it?
text: She hands Erin the baby. It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old.
text: Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hi, sweetie. Were you a good girl? Where
dialog: are Matt and Katie?
scene_heading: MRS. MORALES
dialog: Outside with the sprinkler. So it's good?
text: The truth is too depressing to share.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It'll be fine, yeah.
scene_heading: MRS. MORALES
dialog: Ai, bueno. Because I didn't want to tell
dialog: you before, with your worries --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What?
scene_heading: MRS. MORALES
dialog: My daughter, she's bought a big house with a
dialog: room for me. I'm going to move in with her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You're moving away? When?
scene_heading: MRS. MORALES
dialog: Next week.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Wow, that's soon --
scene_heading: MRS. MORALES
dialog: I know. But it's good for me. Now I can
dialog: help my daughter take care of my grandkids.
dialog: And it's good for you, too. Now you have
dialog: money, you can find a good babysitter, huh?
dialog: Not the old lady next door.
text: Oh, God. In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Erin carries Beth up to her house. As she nears her door,
text: she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG. It crunches under her sole.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Ugh.
text: Insult added to injury. She heads up to the house, dragging
text: her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY
text: Just as dull inside. Salvation Army furniture. A lot of
text: beige. Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are
text: at the table. Beth is in a baby seat. Erin spoons some Mac
text: &amp; Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I don't like this part, it's all crusty.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I like the crust.
text: Erin switches the plates.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: How come you're not eating?
dialog: Cause there isn't enough food.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Mamma's gonna eat later.
text: From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more.
text: Thick, sick-sounding coughs. Erin looks at her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Don't go getting sick on me, baby. Okay?
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with
text: STEAM. Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap,
text: trying to steam the illness out of her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It's gonna be okay, sweetheart. I promise.
text: But her face doesn't look like she believes it.
scene_heading: EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY
text: Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.
scene_heading: INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY
text: Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles. She stops at the
text: medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself,
text: glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle.
scene_heading: INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY
text: As a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up
text: with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hi, remember me? I was in yesterday. Bought
dialog: a whole mess of stuff? Round about five?
scene_heading: CHECK-OUT LADY
dialog: Honey, it's a zoo here at five. I'm lucky
dialog: if I even see a face, much less remember it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, shoot, yeah, I guess that'd be tough.
dialog: Well, listen, I meant to buy my baby here
dialog: some medicine, and by the time I got home, I
dialog: realized I'd bought the adult stuff by
dialog: mistake. And now, wouldn't you know, I
dialog: can't find the receipt. I was wondering --
dialog: could I maybe exchange it anyway ...
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
text: Erin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Just remember. No matter what your Mamma
dialog: does, lying and stealing is real bad. I
dialog: don't ever wanna hear you doing something
dialog: like that ...
text: On the table beside her sit the classifieds. Row after row
text: of want ads circled, then X-'d out in red. A WATER BUG
text: crawls across the edge of the paper.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... Cause there's no excuse for it, you hear
dialog: me? No excuse at all.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Midday. Ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand. As he
text: heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files. Coffee
text: sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Damn it!
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Brenda!
text: She pops her head in.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Yeah?
text: He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What the hell is this doing here?
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: It's those files you asked for.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I didn't mean for you to leave them in the
dialog: middle of the floor. Jesus. Look at me.
dialog: What do I have this afternoon?
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
text: As Ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office,
text: he notices, on the other side:
text: ERIN, standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a
text: miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to MARIO, the firm's
text: mentally challenged office boy. Mario heads away from her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What's she doing here?
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Who?
text: Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey -- Mario -- what's she doing here?
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: She works here.
text: Ed looks back at her -- what the hell?
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: The support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all
text: stealing glances at Erin. Ed comes up to her, all friendly.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin! How's it going?
text: Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You never called me back. I left messages.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You did? Wow, sorry about that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Listen, Mario's a little not so bright. He
dialog: seems to think that you said --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry.
dialog: Being ignored, and being lied to. You did
dialog: both.
text: Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of
text: this. Ed lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I never lied. I may have miscalculated --
dialog: that happens sometimes, but --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You said things would be fine, and they're
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm sorry about that. Really. But --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don't need pity. I need a paycheck. And
dialog: I've looked, but when you've spent the last
dialog: six years raising babies, it's real hard to
dialog: convince someone to give you a job that pays
dialog: worth a damn. So I figure, since you're the
dialog: one who said I was gonna be okay, you should
dialog: be the one to hire me.
text: Ed sees everyone watching him, listening.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'd love to help, Erin, but I'm sorry, I
dialog: have a full staff right now, so --
text: He starts to escort her out, but she stays put.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Bullshit. If you had a full staff, you'd
dialog: have time to return your damn phone calls.
text: She's backing him into a corner here. He shifts gears.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay, look. If you really want to apply for
dialog: a job here, you can do it the way everyone
dialog: else does. Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm not everyone else, Mr. Masry. I'm
dialog: someone you made promises to that you didn't
dialog: deliver on. I trusted you. With my kids'
dialog: well-being. Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard-
dialog: working, and I'll do anything. But if you
dialog: think I'm leaving here without a job, you
dialog: got another thing coming.
text: Ed glances around the room. Not a whole lot of options here.
text: He looks back at Erin.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No benefits.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY
text: A tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves. ANNA,
text: the humorless file clerk, is showing Erin around.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: ... what we do in here is keep track of all
dialog: the case files. That way, at any time, we
dialog: can find out a case's status -- where it is
dialog: in the office, stuff like that. We file 'em
dialog: all here, alphabetically --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, hell.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm dyslexic.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That's a joke, right?
text: Erin shakes her head, no. Great, thinks Anna.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: As Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the
text: bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Just last week, he told my sister we weren't
dialog: hiring.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: What's your sister look like?
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Ed is packing up his office. Erin sticks her head in.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Mr. Masry?
text: He turns, sees her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd
dialog: talk to about maybe getting an advance on my
dialog: paycheck? Just -- for the weekend.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Jane's the office manager. She handles
text: payroll and petty cash. But she leaves early
dialog: on Fridays.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh. Okay. That's okay.
text: Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, for Christ's sake ...
text: He takes out his wallet, looks in.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: All I have is hundreds.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bullshit, you don't.
text: He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves. When he's gone,
text: she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a
dialog: great big kiss.
scene_heading: EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a
text: shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's. Katie and Matt
text: pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.
scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
text: Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag
text: of groceries in the other. Katie and Matt are each carrying
text: a bag of groceries as well. They are all singing and moving
text: with the jaunty step of the newly carefree. Katie spots a
text: flower display outside the store.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Mommy, can I get a flower?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: A small room with Salvation Army furniture. A BUNCH OF
text: DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table.
text: Matt and Katie are asleep in bed. Erin looks down at them,
text: smiles, then kisses them good-night.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door.
text: But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled
text: with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING.
text: It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall.
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what
text: used to be Mrs. Morales's house. A few MOTORCYCLES are
text: parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the
text: stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hey!
text: But of course he can't hear her. She walks over to him,
text: stands right in his line of vision.
speaker_heading: ERIN
speaker_heading: HEY!
text: He sees her and kills the engine. Everything about GEORGE
text: HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long
text: hair. Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, hello to you, darlin'.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What the hell do you think you're doing,
dialog: making all that Goddamn noise?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, I'm the neighbors. There, now we're
dialog: introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
text: The guys on the porch chuckle. Erin turns and starts back to
text: her house. George hops off his bike and follows her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a
dialog: beautiful woman next door, I'da done this
dialog: different. Let's start over. My name's
dialog: George. What's yours?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Just think of me as the person next door who
dialog: likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Now, don't be like that. Tell you what.
dialog: How about if I take you out on a date to
dialog: apologize for my rudeness?
text: Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Come on. Gimme your number, I'll call you
dialog: up proper and ask you out and everything.
text: She stops at her porch, turns to him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You want my number?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Which number do you want, George?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You got more than one?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of
dialog: my ears. Like, for instance, ten.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Ten?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how
dialog: many months old my little girl is.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You got a little girl?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. Sexy, huh? And here's another: five.
dialog: That's how old my other daughter is. Seven
dialog: is my son's age. Two is how many times I
dialog: been married and divorced. You getting all
dialog: this? 16 is the number of dollars in my
dialog: bank account. 454-3943 is my phone number.
dialog: And with all the other numbers I gave you,
dialog: I'm guessing zero is the number of times
dialog: you're gonna call it.
text: She turns and heads inside. He calls out after her:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How the hell do you know your bank balance
dialog: right off the top of your head like that?
dialog: See, that impresses me.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
text: Morning. Erin walks in, wearing her usual garb. She passes
text: the coffee area, where Jane, Brenda, and Anna are milling.
text: Brenda sees her, gives Anna a nudge. They both check out her
text: short hem. Anna nudges Jane, who looks as well. Erin
text: glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at
text: her judgementally. She stops in her tracks and stares back.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Y'all got something you wanna discuss?
text: The women go back to stirring their coffees. Erin walks on.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ed is walking into his office with a coffee cup in his hand
text: when he trips over the same box of files again.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Damn it!
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Brenda!
dialog: (no answer)
speaker_heading: BRENDA!
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY
text: Erin is alone, filing as she talks on the phone.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: How long's she been crying like that? ...
dialog: Well, she's got that tooth coming in --
text: Ed appears in the door, carrying the box of files.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --
dialog: (sees Ed)
dialog: I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that
dialog: bag -- I'll check back in a bit.
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: Sorry. My kid --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Where's Anna?
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: Out to lunch with the girls.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh. Huh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, look, I got this file I need valued.
dialog: Real estate thing. A lady has some property
text: next to a PG&amp;E plant that PG&amp;E wants to buy.
dialog: I need to know what to ask for it.
text: He plunks the box of files on her desk. She stares at it,
dialog: with no idea of how to go about that.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh. Okay.
text: He sees her staring at the box.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You do know how to do that, don't you?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. I got it. No problem.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Good.
text: Ed heads out, but pauses before leaving.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You're a girl.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How come you're not at lunch with the girls?
dialog: You're a girl.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I guess I'm not the right kind.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, FILE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Erin is at her desk, staring bewildered at the files from the
text: box Ed gave her, which are now spread across her desktop.
text: She sees Anna packing up her things, to leave.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Anna? With this real-estate valuing stuff -
dialog: - could you remind me, cause I'm a little
dialog: confused about how exactly we do that.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Erin, you've been here three weeks. If you
dialog: don't know how to do your job by now, I am
dialog: not about to do it for you.
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Katie and Matt are running up to the house. Erin follows,
text: toting Beth under one arm and the box of documents under the
text: other. She steps on another water bug.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Ugh.
text: As she wipes the bug guts off the bottom of her shoe:
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, neighbor, wanna beer?
text: She spots George on his stoop, with a six-pack beside him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: C'mon. I bought 'em for you, to make up for
dialog: that night.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Return 'em. Maybe you'll get your money
dialog: back.
text: He gets up and follows her to her house.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Now, why're you giving me such a hard time?
dialog: I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
text: Erin turns to him. The kids are waiting at the door.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I had a good neighbor, George. She was 60
dialog: and Mexican and she watched my kids for
dialog: free. Something tells me you're not gonna
dialog: be able to measure up to that.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You need help with your kids? I could
dialog: probably do that.
text: George reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Cause I don't even know you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, and whose fault is that?
dialog: He's got a point there. After a beat:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What, you got so many friends in this world,
dialog: you don't have use for one more?
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: George is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War.
text: Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: What's that stand for?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's for Harley Davidson. The best damn
dialog: motorcycle ever made.
text: Erin comes in from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And if I catch either of you anywhere near
dialog: one, I'll knock you silly. Go on to bed,
dialog: now -- I'll come tuck you in in a minute.
dialog: They get up ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Night.
speaker_heading: KATIE/MATT
dialog: Night.
text: ... and head into bed. George starts cleaning up the cards.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Great kids.
text: Erin bends down to help him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. I'm probably ruining them.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm never here. I gotta leave 'em with this
dialog: weird sitter all afternoon who costs a
text: fortune and smells like chicken fat.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I was serious before, you know. If you need
dialog: someone to keep an eye on them -- after
dialog: school or something -- I don't have a job
dialog: now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: Great. Another deadbeat.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm not a deadbeat. I work when I need to.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the
dialog: time, live off your trust fund?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I do construction, which pays real good.
dialog: And I make it last by living cheap.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (with a little laugh)
dialog: I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Are you this hard on everyone who tries to
dialog: help you?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of
dialog: practice.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is
dialog: to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer,
dialog: I don't mind taking you up on it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Why in the hell would you want to watch my
dialog: kids?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Right.
text: She starts cleaning up the cards.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I do. I like how they keep it all simple,
dialog: you know? They don't get all complicated
dialog: about life, like grown-ups do. A bicycle
dialog: and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're
dialog: happy.
text: Erin thinks about the offer.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You're around every afternoon?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yup. Usually working on my bike.
dialog: (she's tempted)
dialog: No big deal. If it doesn't work out, you
dialog: can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
text: Tempting. Erin looks him over.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The wee hours. Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress
text: on the floor. The paperwork from the box is now spread all
text: over the floor around her. She's reading a letter.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE LETTER
dialog: It's from PG&amp;E, to Donna and Peter Irving. We see the
dialog: phrases, "purchase your house ...", "fair market value ..."
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT
dialog: It's a list of comparable house sales in the area. Owner,
dialog: cost; owner, cost. Every house is in the $65,000 range.
text: From another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING. Still
text: reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into:
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib. Beth quiets.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Erin lies down on the mattress and rests Beth on her chest.
text: She sets down the file she was reading and picks up another.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE FILE
text: It contains a letter from a Dr. Howard Reeves. The first
dialog: paragraph contains the phrase "... medical examination of
dialog: Donna and Peter Irving ..."
text: Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns. One is
text: headed: "IN RANGE". The other: "OUT OF RANGE". Under that
dialog: head appear the following: "lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes,
dialog: natural killer cells, T Helpers, T8 suppresser cells".
text: Erin stares at it, confused.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY
text: Erin is talking to Jane, who's pouring herself coffee.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It was in this real estate file I'm valuing.
dialog: And -- see, I know they're the medical
dialog: records from the people selling the house --
dialog: but it talks about things like lymphocytes
dialog: and T8 suppressers.
text: Erin sees Ed pass behind Jane. She lowers her voice, so he
dialog: won't see her asking for help.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but
dialog: -- I'm just a little unclear on what those
dialog: things are. I thought maybe you'd know.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What do I look like, Erin? A library?
text: And Jane walks away with her coffee.
scene_heading: EXT. UCLA MAIN LIBRARY - DAY
text: Large. Looming. Very establishment. Through the windows,
text: we see Erin at the desk, talking to a LIBRARIAN. She has the
dialog: file in her hands. Over this:
speaker_heading: ROSALIND (O.S.)
dialog: Masry &amp; Vititoe, can I help you?
speaker_heading: ERIN (O.S.)
dialog: Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin. Brockovich.
dialog: From the file room? I was wondering if you
dialog: could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up
dialog: on that real estate thing out of the office.
text: The librarian gives her directions to somewhere else.
scene_heading: EXT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY
text: Smaller, but still establishment. Erin's Hyundai pulls into
dialog: the parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY
text: Erin is at the reference desk, eating a candy bar while she
text: talks to the LIBRARIAN. He checks something on the computer.
text: A couple of WHITE-COATED MEDICAL STUDENTS pass her, double-
dialog: taking. They don't see many like her around here.
scene_heading: INT. UCLA SCIENCE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
text: A long, academic hallway lit by fluorescents. Erin gets off
text: an elevator and heads down the hall. She finds a door with a
text: nameplate that reads "Jim Paulsen, Epidemiology" and KNOCKS.
text: The door opens and DR. JIM PAULSEN appears. He's a classic
text: scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses. Nothing like Erin has
text: ever shown up at his door. He reels at the sight of her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Dr. Paulsen?
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich. I was just over in
text: the library there, asking a mess of
dialog: questions about -- I guess they call it
dialog: epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me
dialog: to find you, cause you know all about it.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Is this a joke? Did Baxter put you up to
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Who's Baxter?
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: He did, didn't he? Baxter!
text: BAXTER, another scientist, leans out of a door down the hall.
speaker_heading: BAXTER
dialog: Yeah?
text: Baxter and Erin look at each other. No recognition, of
text: course. Paulsen is immediately embarrassed.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: Oh. Oh.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No one put me up to anything. I was just
dialog: hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: (mortified)
dialog: Of course! Oh, gosh, of course --
scene_heading: INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Orderly chaos. Dr. Paulsen, still recovering, has Erin's
text: file in his hands. Erin is sitting across from him.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: Well, look, there isn't a ton of information
dialog: here, but from what there is, I'd say that
dialog: these two people here -- what are their
dialog: names? Shanna and Ashley?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Right, I guess those are the kids --
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: They've both got some immune system problem.
dialog: Can't say what from, whether it's viral or
dialog: genetic or what, but something's wrong. And
dialog: these guys -- Donna and Peter --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say
dialog: they both have some form of cancer.
dialog: Wow. That's more serious than Erin was expecting.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
text: CLOSE ON THE FILE on the kitchen counter. The Irvings' phone
text: number is written on the front. A PHONE IS RINGING.
speaker_heading: ERIN (O.S.)
dialog: Whoa, whoa! Easy, easy, easy --
text: WIDEN to see Erin, phone to her ear, grabbing a carton of
text: juice from Matt and Katie, who are fighting over it at the
text: table. Just as she takes it from them, the phone picks up.
speaker_heading: DONNA'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hi! You've reached the Irvings. Leave a
dialog: message and we'll get back to you just as
dialog: soon as we can. Bye-bye.
text: BEEP. Erin thinks a bit, then hangs up and looks at the
text: file. Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings' address, in
dialog: Hinkley, California.
scene_heading: EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - DAY
text: The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of L.A. DISCO MUSIC
text: blares from its speakers.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY
text: This is a dry, desolate part of California. No downtown, no
text: community. Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with
text: small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the
text: landscape like occasional tombstones.
text: A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA. POP: "
text: but the corner where the number would be has broken off.
text: As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto
text: Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY
text: Erin looks around. The house she's passing has been razed.
text: A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property.
text: As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she
text: drives by the PG&amp;E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray
text: structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from
text: the road. Erin passes it without noticing it.
text: She stops at an intersection. The house on the corner has
text: been boarded up with plywood. Erin notices it -- depressing
text: -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street.
scene_heading: EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY
text: A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of
text: nothing. There's a pool out back and a chain link fence
text: hugging the property. No landscaping. Dull, but clean. A
text: few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.
text: The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops. Erin gets
text: out. As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into
text: the dirt. She rings the bell. It has a melody chime.
text: DONNA IRVING opens the door. She's 35, petite, with a
text: scrappy, high-strung manner. She's wearing tight jeans, and
text: her dark curls are piled on top of her head.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hi. Donna Irving?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry &amp; Vititoe?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (a little surprised)
dialog: You're a lawyer?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hell, no. I hate lawyers. I just work for
dialog: them. You got a minute?
scene_heading: INT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care.
text: Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows.
text: Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: This is a real nice place you got here.
speaker_heading: DONNA (O.S.)
dialog: Well it oughta be, with all the work I put
dialog: into it.
text: She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I added air conditioning, put in the pool,
dialog: made all those pillows by hand ...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah? I should learn to do stuff like that.
dialog: They make the place feel real homey.
text: Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Thank you. I think so too. That's why I'm
dialog: being such a stickler on this house price
dialog: thing. I don't mean to be a pain in PG&amp;E's
dialog: backside, especially after all they've done
dialog: for Hinkley, but I look around here and I
dialog: think, if they want this place, they're
dialog: gonna have to pay for it. And I don't just
dialog: mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay
dialog: me for the trouble of starting over.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Cause first you gotta move, then there's
dialog: decorating, and if the windows aren't the
dialog: same size, you know -- you're making all new
dialog: curtains. Honest to God, I don't know if I
dialog: have the energy. You know, I've been sick.
dialog: Me and Peter both have.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up. I
dialog: was going through your file here, and I ran
dialog: into these medical records. They kinda
dialog: surprised me --
dialog: This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self-
dialog: pitying. But not Donna. Life's handed her a shitload of
dialog: lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I know. They're more than a bit unusual.
dialog: See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's
dialog: disease. That's a kind of cancer --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Thank you. It's in remission now, thank the
dialog: Lord, but you never know. And then while
dialog: that's going on, I end up having to have a
dialog: hysterectomy. Plus a whole mess of lumps
dialog: removed from my breasts. All benign so far,
dialog: but still, no matter how positive you stay,
dialog: an operation can still take it out of you.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'll say. Holy moley.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: So the whole idea of selling the house --
dialog: don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to
dialog: some better place, but if they aren't gonna
dialog: pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah, I can see that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I guess the only thing that confused me is -
dialog: - not that your medical problems aren't
dialog: important, but -- how come the files about
dialog: them are in with all the real estate stuff?
text: Donna tops off their iced teas.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Are you kidding? With how our lives are, if
dialog: I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk. I
dialog: just kept all PG&amp;E correspondence in one
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you
dialog: were corresponding with PG&amp;E about it in the
dialog: first place.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: They did?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You bet. Paid for a check-up for the whole
dialog: family. And not like with insurance where
dialog: you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed,
dialog: either. They just took care of it. Just
dialog: like that. We never even saw a bill.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Wow. Why would they do that?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Cause of the chromium.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this
dialog: whole thing off.
scene_heading: INT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON A BOX, with "CHROM INFO" scrawled on it.
speaker_heading: DONNA (O.S.)
dialog: PG&amp;E came around a few years ago, told us
dialog: they put chromium in our well by mistake.
dialog: And since we shouldn't have to drink it if
dialog: we don't want to, they gave us free spring
dialog: water and offered to buy our house.
text: WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What's chromium?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: It's a chemical they used over at that
text: compressor station up the road there.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have
dialog: been so sick --
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I thought the same thing, right off the bat.
dialog: That's why we went to see the doctor. But
dialog: hunh-uh. Turns out one's got nothing to do
text: with the other.
text: She rifles through the box.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: This is the info they gave us. You'll see
dialog: if you look through it, chromium's good for
dialog: you. When I saw what they charged for it at
dialog: the health-food stores, I about fainted.
text: She hands Erin a printed fact sheet. Erin scans it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your
dialog: water being messed with and you being so
dialog: sick.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Not around here. This is a rough part of
dialog: the world. Hard times, not a lot of money,
dialog: not a lot of luck.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town
dialog: like this. Heck, even our dogs up and die.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Erin's driving away from Donna's house. A street lamp throws
text: light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat.
text: She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at
text: the massive COMPRESSOR STATION. Six stories high, lit up
text: like a Christmas tree, with all sizes of PIPES criss-crossing
text: the outside and GIANT COOLING TOWERS sticking up out of it.
text: Far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over
text: the horizon like the Capitol in D.C. or St. Peter's in Rome.
text: Erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns
text: onto Community Boulevard and drives away.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
text: Erin is holding Beth, making her a bottle, when she hears
text: NOISES coming from outside. She follows them.
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

dialog: windows.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Better safe than sorry.
text: She shakes her head, amused by his persistence.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You want some coffee, George?
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: George follows Erin in.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front
dialog: door, too. This isn't exactly the safest
dialog: neighborhood in the world, you know.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Thanks for reminding me.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
text: Erin pours him some coffee, hands it to him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You think it could make you sick, living in
dialog: a place like this?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you mean?
text: George settles in, helps himself to sugar.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I was talking to this lady -- she and her
dialog: husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's
dialog: cause they live in a bad neighborhood. You
dialog: think that's possible? That living in a bad
dialog: neighborhood could give you cancer?
text: George laughs a little at the thought.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Man, I hope not. You got enough damn
dialog: problems.
text: But Erin's still mulling it over.
scene_heading: EXT. NORTHRIDGE, ERIN'S BLOCK - DAY
text: Erin clips down the block in short-shorts and high-heeled
text: boots. Up ahead a few of DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK MEN are out on a
text: stoop, drinking their breakfast. Erin approaches them.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hi, y'all -- how you doing today?
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: Hangin' in, baby. How about yourself?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm okay, I'm just fine. I was wondering --
dialog: could I maybe ask you a couple questions?
text: She settles down on the stoop with them for a chat.
scene_heading: INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Dr. Paulsen and Erin are sitting, talking. He's thrilled to
text: have her back in his office.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... and when I realized our area's just as
dialog: bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors
dialog: are all sick too. So I went and asked.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You did?
text: Erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Uh-huh. Spent the last few days knocking on
dialog: doors. And you know what? They're not.
dialog: (reads from the pad)
dialog: I mean, they got problems, but none of this
dialog: cancer stuff. And their pets are fine. So
dialog: I don't know -- I just can't shake the
dialog: feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they
text: put in the water.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: Well, if you're talking about contamination,
dialog: you're getting out of my area of expertise.
dialog: Let me give you the name of a toxicologist
dialog: friend of mine over at USC.
text: Paulsen reaches for a notepad, scrawls on it.
scene_heading: INT. UCLA MEDICAL BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Paulsen is seeing Erin out of his office.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I
dialog: did not peg you as the kind to go off and
dialog: conduct her own epidemiological study.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Don't go telling anyone. It'll ruin my
dialog: reputation.
scene_heading: EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY
text: Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus
dialog: with him. He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia,
text: Birkenstocks, bushy beard. He's as dry as dust, and as much
text: as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her.

dialog: What kind of chromium is it?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: There's more than one kind?
speaker_heading: FRANKEL
dialog: Yes. There's straight-up chromium -- does
dialog: all kinds of good things for the body.
text: There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and
dialog: then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium,
dialog: which, depending on the amounts, can be very
dialog: harmful.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Harmful, like -- how? What would you get?
speaker_heading: FRANKEL
dialog: With repeated exposure to toxic levels --
dialog: God, anything, really -- respiratory
dialog: disease, liver failure, heart failure,
dialog: reproductive failure, chronic headaches,
dialog: bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of
dialog: course, any type of cancer.
text: He rattles it off coolly. Just facts. Erin's stunned.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: So that stuff -- it kills people.
speaker_heading: FRANKEL
dialog: Oh, yeah. Definitely. Highly toxic, highly
dialog: carcinogenic. Bad, bad stuff.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, how do I find out what kind of
dialog: chromium is up in Hinkley?
speaker_heading: FRANKEL
dialog: Have you been to the water board?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hunh-uh. What's that?
speaker_heading: FRANKEL
dialog: Every county has one. They keep records of
dialog: anything water-related within their
dialog: jurisdiction. You should be able to find
dialog: something there.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: County water board. All righty, thanks.
speaker_heading: FRANKEL
dialog: Good luck.

speaker_heading: FRANKEL (O.S.)
dialog: ... Incriminating records have a way of

text: then heads into the building.
scene_heading: INT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL COUNTY WATER BOARD - DAY
text: Drab, government-issue. ROSS, the bored desk clerk is
text: thumbing his way through ROAD &amp; TRACK. Just as he stops to
text: stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling
text: the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Whew! Goddamn, that's a heavy door.
text: Ross looks up. It's like the girl from the ad walked right
text: off the page. He jumps up, to help her with the door.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Thank you very much. Aren't you a
dialog: gentleman? Mr. ...
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Ross.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Ross. Real pleased to meet you. I'm Erin.
text: She smiles. He can't believe his luck.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Erin. Cool. What can I do for you, Erin?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl
dialog: for some water records.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: You come to the right place.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (laughing along)
dialog: I guess I did.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: You just tell me what you want to look at
dialog: and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I wish I knew. It's for my boss. He's
dialog: fighting his water bill, and he wants me to
dialog: find all manner of bills from all kinds of
dialog: places. The easiest thing would probably be
dialog: if I just squeezed back there with you and
dialog: poked around myself. Would that be okay?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Heck, yeah. Come on back. Just gonna need
dialog: you to sign in here --
text: He hands her a pen. He reads over her shoulder as she signs
dialog: her name -- Erin Pattee Brockovich.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Pattee? That your middle name?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Nope. Maiden.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: You're married.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Not anymore.
text: She smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter
text: with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well. Here goes nothing.
text: She heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files.
dialog: They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande,
text: Helendale -- in no particular order. Finally, Erin spots one
text: that says Hinkley. She pulls it down.
speaker_heading: IN THE FILE
text: are pages and pages of Xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts,

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: No, it's not!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sure it is. Here, I'll show you.
text: He picks up Matt's chicken, tears it in two ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Most people think a sandwich's gotta have
dialog: bread on the outside. Not true. Chicken is
dialog: a perfectly good outside for a sandwich.
text: ... then places the broccoli neatly between the halves.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: See?
text: Katie and Matthew look at it, then up at George, and smile.

speaker_heading: ERIN

text: Anna looks up.
speaker_heading: ANNA

speaker_heading: ERIN

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --

speaker_heading: JANE
text: -- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of
dialog: hose. Here.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: There may be jobs where you can disappear
dialog: for days at a time, but this isn't one of
dialog: them. Here, if you don't do the work, you
dialog: don't get to stay.
text: She hands her the box. Erin doesn't take it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I've been working. Shit, that's all I've
dialog: been doing. Ask Mr. Masry. He knows.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ed's at his desk, dialing the phone when Erin barrels in.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You said to fire me?
text: He sets down the receiver.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin, you've been gone for a week.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I left a message. I've been dealing with
dialog: that real estate thing. I was gonna write
dialog: up a whole damn report and --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's not how we work here. You don't just
text: leave a message and take off.
text: Jane follows her in, still carrying the box of stuff.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What am I supposed to do, check in every two
dialog: seconds?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes. It's called accountability.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I am not talking to you, bitch.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay, enough --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I
dialog: don't think this is the right place for you.
dialog: So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on
dialog: your behalf. Find you something else, okay?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Don't bother.
text: She turns to Jane, takes her box, and heads out.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Come on, I'm trying to help here.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Bullshit. You're trying to feel less guilty
dialog: about firing someone with three kids to

dialog: And she leaves.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don't suppose any one of you cunts could
dialog: open the fucking door for me.
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house. Erin
text: shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of

text: As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs
text: into the MAILMAN. He hands her a packet of mail.
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: Here ya go, Miz Brockovich.
text: Erin looks at the top of the stack. It's the electric bill.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: Erin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail.
text: Bills, bills, and more bills. As she throws them on the
text: table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Fixing a leak under your sink.
text: She heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated.
speaker_heading: ERIN

dialog: George, I don't ask you to do things like
dialog: that.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm gonna clean it up.
text: Erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Relax, Erin, I'll do it -- I'm not --
text: Before he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Ugh -- Jesus --
text: She jumps and brushes it off.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah -- you had a whole family of those
text: things hanging out back there.
text: She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Damn it --
text: The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard. Erin
text: chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don't worry about it, I'll get it later.
text: But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into
dialog: killing that one bug.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Come here, you little motherfucker --
text: The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt,
text: the pepper, the napkin holder. Erin keeps after it, BANGING
text: the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey, whoa -- relax --
dialog: 
text: The salt and pepper skid off the table. The napkins fly from
text: their holder. Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips
text: into a crack in the wall and disappears. Erin hurls her shoe
text: at the crack. It SMASHES into the wall.
speaker_heading: ERIN
speaker_heading: GOD DAMN IT!
text: As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts
text: to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears.
text: She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (almost a whisper)
dialog: ... God damn it.
dialog: 
text: She looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What kind of person lives like this? Huh?
dialog: What kind of person lets her kids run around
text: in a house crawling with bugs the size of
dialog: housecats?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's a simple thing. Everybody gets them.
dialog: All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I can't call an exterminator. I can't afford
dialog: one. God, I can't even afford my phone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I got fired.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What? But you been working so hard --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Doesn't matter. Doesn't make one bit of
dialog: difference.
dialog: (then, fragile)
dialog: Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me?
dialog: How'd I end up so ... so nothing?
dialog: 
text: George picks a napkin up off the floor, hands it to her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're not nothing, Erin.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I
dialog: was gonna be. I was supposed to have one of
dialog: those great lives, with everything all laid-
dialog: out and perfect. I mean, hell -- I was Miss
dialog: Wichita, for God's sakes. Did I tell you
dialog: that? You live next door to a real live
dialog: beauty queen.
dialog: (wipes her nose)
dialog: I still got the tiara. I kept it cause I
dialog: thought it meant something. I thought it
dialog: meant I was gonna do something great with my
dialog: life. I thought it proved I was gonna grow
dialog: up to be someone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You are someone.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No I'm not. Look at me. I'm not.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You're someone to me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're someone real special to me.
dialog: 
text: He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very
text: close. He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on
text: her foot. Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm no good, George. I make people
dialog: miserable.
dialog: 
text: But he kisses her anyway. And for the first time in so long,
text: she feels like something other than a failure. He pulls her
text: into him, and she lets herself be pulled.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Erin and George are in bed, naked, curled around each other.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I got an interesting call this afternoon.
dialog: It was from a Dr. Frankel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He wanted you to know the legal limit for
dialog: hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per
dialog: million. And that at the rate you
dialog: mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for
dialog: the cancers in that family you asked about.
dialog: The Irvings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny
dialog: how some people go out of their way to help
dialog: people and others just give 'em the ax?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just
dialog: assumed you were off having fun.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't know. Maybe cause you look like
dialog: someone who has a lot of fun.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
dialog: 
text: Ed takes a beat, copping to the charge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So what's the story on this thing? This
dialog: cancer stuff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You wanna know, you gotta hire me back. I
dialog: got a lot of bills to pay.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Fine.

scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: Erin has let Ed in. They're sitting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But, PG&amp;E told her about the chromium?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: They told her something, but it can't have
dialog: been too specific, cause I talked to her,
dialog: and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So what made you think it was?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It doesn't take a genius to look at those
dialog: medical records and think something's wrong.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What medical records?
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: The ones in the box of files.
dialog: (off Ed's blank look)
dialog: The box of files? The one from your office?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I didn't see any medical records in there.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it
dialog: then, huh?
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: And you fired me. Jesus.
dialog: 
text: Ed thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That document you found, the one that says
dialog: it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen
dialog: to make a copy did you?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Course I did.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Lemme see it, will you?
text: Before getting it for him, she looks at him, weighs her odds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I want a raise. And benefits. Including
dialog: dental.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, Erin, this is not the way I do

dialog: 
text: Erin doesn't budge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay. A 5% raise, and --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Ten.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: There's a lot of other places I could work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: A ten percent raise and benefits. But
dialog: that's it. I'm drawing the line.
text: She goes to her box of stuff from the office and digs out the
text: document for him. He scans it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This is the only thing you found?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: So far. But that place is a pig sty. I

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Stay out of the road. I'll be right back.
text: She wanders up the drive, onto PG&amp;E property, moving around
text: the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle.
text: As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the
text: plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and
text: notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue.
text: She looks at the dirt right her feet. Kicks the ground.
text: Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green. Erin
text: notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt.
text: Worry comes over her face. She heads back to them.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY MART - DAY

speaker_heading: BRENDA

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: An on-site monitoring well? That means --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It was right up on the PG&amp;E property over

speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: And you say this stuff, this hexavalent
dialog: chromium -- it's poisonous?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Well -- then it's gotta be a different than
dialog: what's in our water, cause ours is okay.
dialog: The guys from PG&amp;E told me. They sat right
dialog: in the kitchen and said it was fine.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I know. But the toxicologist I been talking
dialog: to? He gave me a list of problems that can
dialog: come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And
dialog: everything you all have is on that list.
text: Donna resists this idea hard.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: No. Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the
dialog: doctor said. He said one's got absolutely
dialog: nothing to do with the other.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by
dialog: PG&amp;E?
text: Donna sits quietly, trying to make sense of this. The only
text: sound is the LAUGHING and SPLASHING from the pool out back.
text: Then, gradually, Donna realizes what it is she's hearing --
text: her kids playing in toxic water. She jumps up ...
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: ASHLEY! SHANNA!
text: ... and runs out to the pool. Erin follows her.
scene_heading: EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY

text: OUT OF THE POOL! BOTH OF YOU, OUT OF THE
scene_heading: POOL, RIGHT NOW!
speaker_heading: SHANNA
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: CAUSE I SAID SO, THAT'S WHY, NOW GET OUT!
dialog: OUT! NOW!!!
text: Erin watches compassionately as Donna flails to get her kids
text: out of the contaminated water.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: It's morning. Ed is checking the lie of his tie in his
text: reflection in the window. Erin is on his couch, high-heeled
text: legs stretched out in front of her.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
text: Jane is delivering paychecks. When Brenda gets to her desk,
text: Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it
text: out. Brenda peers in and sees Erin.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: What's she doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He hired her back. With a raise.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: What?? Why?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, let's see. It's not cause she's
dialog: smart, and it's not cause she's
dialog: professional. That leaves ...
text: Brenda's stunned. Takes a beat. Makes assumptions.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: And dumb old me thought working hard and
dialog: being loyal was the way to get ahead.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Ed is still checking his reflection.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the
dialog: fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed
dialog: that send button -- PG&amp;E claims department
dialog: is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: So you think we got 'em scared?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It sure as hell sounded like they were
text: sitting up and taking notice.
text: Brenda pops her head in, ignores Erin.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
text: David Baum from PG&amp;E is at reception.
dialog: 
text: Erin feels the chill Brenda's sending her way.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Nice to see you again, too, Brenda.
text: Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: Ed and Erin come out and see DAVID BAUM waiting at reception.
dialog: Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of
text: twelfth grade. Not a hair on his chin. His suit and shoes
dialog: look brand new.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Not to question your judgment or anything,
dialog: Mr. Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look
dialog: like sitting up and taking notice to me.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum. To say
dialog: this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement. He
text: doesn't talk; he squeaks.
speaker_heading: BAUM
dialog: ... in the interest of putting this whole
dialog: thing to rest, PG&amp;E is willing to offer the
dialog: Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.
text: Ed laughs a little in disbelief.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: 250,000?
speaker_heading: BAUM
dialog: In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr.
dialog: Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What about in terms of medical expenses?
dialog: 250,000 doesn't come close to what this
dialog: family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
speaker_heading: BAUM
dialog: I understand they've had a bad run of luck,
dialog: health-wise, and they have my sympathies.
dialog: But that's not PG&amp;E's fault.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You're kidding, right?
dialog: (Baum doesn't answer)
dialog: Look at these readings for Christ's sake.
dialog: PG&amp;E's own technicians documented toxic
dialog: levels of hexavalent chromium in those test
dialog: wells, on numerous occasions.
text: Ed shoves them across the table. Baum doesn't look at them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Everything the Irvings have had is a proven
dialog: reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium.
dialog: They've had ...
text: He stalls a moment. Erin jumps in.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: -- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's
dialog: disease, immune deficiencies, asthma,
text: chronic nosebleeds.
text: Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously
dialog: the party line:
speaker_heading: BAUM
dialog: A million things could have caused those
dialog: problems. Poor diet, bad genes,
dialog: irresponsible lifestyle. Our offer is final
dialog: and more than fair.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Wait a minute -- I thought we were
dialog: negotiating here.
speaker_heading: BAUM
dialog: 250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
text: Ed looks across at this pissant little kid.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Jesus Christ.
dialog: (he stands, to leave)
dialog: I will present your offer to my clients. I
dialog: doubt they'll accept it.
dialog: As Ed starts out:
speaker_heading: BAUM
dialog: Mr. Masry, before you go off on some
dialog: crusade, you might want to remember who it
dialog: is you're dealing with here. PG&amp;E is a 28-
dialog: billion dollar corporation.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (containing his anger)
dialog: Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.
text: And Ed leaves the conference room. Erin follows him out.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: At least they made an offer.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That wasn't an offer. A million would've
dialog: been an offer. When they send the God damn
dialog: mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my
dialog: time, it's a fuck you.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don't get why they'd do that.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Because they can. You heard that kid --
dialog: they have 28 billion dollars at their
dialog: disposal. They can afford to waste all the
dialog: time in the world.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And you can't?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What, you think I'm made of money?
text: Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room.
speaker_heading: BAUM
dialog: Hey, you know where I can get a cab? My
text: plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes.
text: Ed turns and looks at him. He gets a tiny smile.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Tell you what, why don't you go on over to
dialog: reception, tell them I said Mario should
dialog: take you to the airport.
speaker_heading: BAUM
dialog: Hey, excellent. Thanks.
text: Baum heads out to the reception area.
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the
dialog: bathroom. They'll be driving around the
dialog: valley for hours.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (gleeful)
dialog: Yeah. Isn't that a shame?
text: She watches him go into his office, impressed. Big smile.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well I'll be God damned.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: End of the day. Most everyone has left. Erin is at her new
text: work space near Ed's office. She's poring over a fat file of
text: documents. ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on.
speaker_heading: ROSALIND
dialog: You've been reading for hours.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact
dialog: that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
speaker_heading: ROSALIND
dialog: Hey, just so long as you see Him.
text: Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out.
text: Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to
text: a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's. These are MANDY and
text: TOM BROWN. He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope
text: under his arm. Rosalind points to Erin. The Browns enter
text: the office and approach her.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. Who are you?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I'm Tom Brown. This is my wife Mandy. We
dialog: used to live across the street from the
dialog: Irvings. PG&amp;E bought our house last year.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S DESK - LATER
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON photos of chickens, each with a twisted, limp neck.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It's called wry neck. It's when they're
dialog: born without any muscles in the neck.
text: WIDEN to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Wow. How many were born like this?
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Twelve, maybe thirteen.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: When Donna told us about you, and what you
dialog: told her about the chromium, we figured that
dialog: might have something to do with this, too.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It sure could, yeah. Thanks a lot.
text: She tucks them into a file, as if that's it.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: There's something else, too.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well. Mandy here's had nine miscarriages.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Are you kidding? My God --
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: I know. It's an awful lot.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: She doesn't know. No one does. It's not
dialog: something you want to talk about, you know?
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: I figured it musta been something I did,
dialog: like when I smoked marijuana, maybe. Or
dialog: took birth control pills. But then Donna
dialog: told me you thought this chromium might be
dialog: to blame for her problems, so I figured ...
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Matt and Katie are in bed, with the light off. Erin comes
text: in, quietly, in clothes from work.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hey. You guys still awake?
text: CLOSE ON MATT AND KATIE. They're awake and pissed.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Come on, now. No faking. George told me he
text: just shut out the light a few seconds ago.
text: They still don't answer. She comes in and sits on a bed.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Look, I know you're mad. But the way this
dialog: job is, things come up at the last minute,
dialog: real important things, and I gotta deal with
dialog: them. Now I don't like me missing dinner
dialog: any more than you do, but we're all gonna
dialog: have to get used to it, cause the fact is,
dialog: it's gonna happen sometimes.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: It happens all the time.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That's not true; we had dinner together just
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You were reading the whole time.
dialog: He's got a point there. Erin feels like shit.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm sorry, pumpkins. I'll try a whole lot
dialog: harder to be around, okay? I promise.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The room is dark. Erin enters and flops down onto the bed,
text: exhausted. George is lying on the bed next to her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If it's any consolation, I love you.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 10, INLAND EMPIRE - DAY
text: Dry, flat California. Ed's big old Mercedes is toodling down
text: the freeway, at an overly safe, almost-geriatric speed.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S MERCEDES - DAY
text: Frank Sinatra is playing on the stereo. Ed is swaying in
text: time. This is his kind of music. He smiles, looks at Erin.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's Sinatra's world, we just live in it.
text: Whatever. Erin glances at the speedometer. Oy. So slow.
text: His car phone rings. He picks it up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello? ...
dialog: (his voice softens)
dialog: Hi, babys. Baby's fine. Yes, I did. I
dialog: did, too, you just didn't feel it.
text: He starts swerving across the lane markers. THWACK THWACK
text: THWACK. Ed doesn't notice. Erin's getting nervous.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You think I could leave without kissing my
dialog: babys? Okay, here you go.
text: He kisses into the phone. Swerves. A car barely misses
text: them. Erin's eyes widen. Not fun at all.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bye-bye ... bye-bye ... no, you. Okay,
dialog: together. Bye-bye.
text: He finally hangs up, smiling to himself. Erin clears her
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Um -- you mind pulling over? Just -- for a
dialog: second?
scene_heading: EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
text: The Mercedes pulls to a stop on the shoulder. Erin gets out,
text: walks around to the driver's side. Opens the door.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: First of all, don't talk baby talk to your
dialog: wife in front of me. It really undermines
dialog: your authority. And second, I know you're
dialog: my boss and all, but you are the worst
dialog: fucking driver I've ever seen. Move over or
dialog: I quit.
text: He moves over. She gets in, turns off the Sinatra. They
text: pull back out onto the freeway in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. MANDY BROWN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The Mercedes and a truck are parked out front.
speaker_heading: PETE (O.S.)
dialog: There's something about this whole thing I
dialog: don't quite understand, Mr. Masry.
scene_heading: INT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Donna and Pete Irving, and Mandy and Roy Brown are all
text: seated, sipping iced tea. While they talk, Erin hands them
text: all information packets on chromium. Ed is standing in front
text: of them, a little stiff.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: If PG&amp;E messed with our water, why would
dialog: they bother saying anything about it to us?
dialog: Why not just keep quiet about it?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: To establish a statute of limitations. See,
dialog: in a case like this, you only have a year
dialog: from the time you first learn about the
dialog: problem to file suit. So PG&amp;E figures,
dialog: we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the
dialog: people the water's not perfect; if we can
dialog: ride out the year with no one suing, we'll
dialog: be in the clear forever.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: But it was more than a year ago that they
dialog: told us --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's okay. We're not suing. All we're
dialog: doing is using this information to get you
dialog: a real nice purchase price on your house,
dialog: and get you two --
dialog: (to the Browns)
dialog: -- a comparable retroactive bonus added to
dialog: your sale price. This way, and PG&amp;E can
dialog: still look good to their shareholders, cause
dialog: they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all
dialog: they're doing is buying a little property.
text: Roy looks up from his retainer agreement.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: It doesn't say here how much this whole
dialog: thing's gonna cost us.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: My fee's forty percent of whatever you get
dialog: awarded.
text: Erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the
dialog: figure.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Boy, do I know how you feel. First time I
dialog: heard that number, I said you got to be
dialog: kidding me. Forty God damn percent?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm the one who's injured, and this joker
dialog: who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk
dialog: away with almost half my reward?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin --
text: Erin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop. But
text: just almost. She shifts gears.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Then I asked him how much he makes if I
dialog: didn't get anything.
dialog: They look at Ed. Well?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Then I don't get anything either.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
text: When they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they
text: all reach for their pens and sign. They hand the agreements
text: over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed. He
text: stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up. That's that.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: All right, then. Let's hit the road.
text: Boy. Cold as ice. Erin stares at him, stunned by his
text: brusque manner, then leans in to him, close.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Mr. Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you
dialog: got a lot to learn about being friendly.
dialog: These people just hired you as their lawyer.
dialog: The least you could do is make a little
dialog: pleasant conversation.
text: She gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Donna, let me help you clean all this up.
text: She picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the
text: kitchen. Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete
text: and Roy. He stands there, awkwardly. Then, finally:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So, what's, uh ... what's new?
scene_heading: INT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Erin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses. Mandy
text: is scanning the chromium pamphlet Erin gave her.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: You know that thing it says in here about
dialog: rashes?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Uh-huh?
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood
dialog: -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed
dialog: like someone in his family always had a rash
dialog: somewhere or other. I just figured it was
dialog: something in the genes. And you know how it
dialog: is -- you don't like to ask about things
dialog: like that ...
text: Erin listens, interested.
scene_heading: EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY, BARN - DAY
text: Another day. BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn,
text: tossing hay around.
speaker_heading: ERIN (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me. Are you Mr. Linwood?
text: He sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels.
speaker_heading: LINWOOD
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm Erin Brockovich. I work at the law firm
dialog: that represents your former neighbors the
dialog: Browns. They suggested I give you a call.
text: She steps in a cow patty. Laughs at herself good-naturedly.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Boy howdy, did I ever wear the wrong shoes.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON A SIGN that reads: THE DESOTOS, hanging on the side
text: of a small, paint-chipped house. Erin is at the door talking
text: to MARY DESOTO, 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... and Mr. Linwood seemed to think that
dialog: your husband had been sick as well.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer. Never
dialog: smoked a day in his life, neither.
scene_heading: INT. LAURA AND MIKE AMBROSINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Erin is talking to MIKE and LAURA AMBROSINO -- 30's. Solid,
text: family folks. But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look
text: swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that
text: she's in a lot of pain.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly
dialog: what it was that you had --
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: She's not alone on that one.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Well, they know what it is -- it's called
dialog: fibrous dysplasia --
speaker_heading: PETE
text: The bones start growing again. Gives her
dialog: headaches like you wouldn't believe.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: -- they just don't know what caused it.
scene_heading: INT. RITA AND TED DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY
text: Erin is talking to TED AND RITA DANIELS. Their daughter
text: ANNABELLE, 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing
dialog: you folks at the hospital from time to time
dialog: too, so I thought I'd just stop by.
dialog: (to Annabelle)
dialog: You must be Annabelle.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Whew, are you ever a beauty. I mean, you
dialog: must drive those boys crazy.
text: Annabelle smiles a little.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Late night. George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is
text: empty. He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into:
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's
text: chair in Matthew and Katie's room.
text: Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep. Erin
text: hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Tell me something, George. What kind of God
text: lets a beautiful little 10-year-old girl get
dialog: brain cancer? Isn't He supposed to be in
dialog: charge of stuff like that? Make sure it
dialog: doesn't happen?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I swear, any other job, He'd be fired.
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY SIDEWALK - DAY
text: Ed and Erin are walking down the street, take-out coffee cups
text: in their hands. Ed is sipping his, but Erin is in too much
dialog: of a lather to drink hers.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hunh-uh. Absolutely not.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That's crazy -- why not?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Because I said no. Look -- the only reason
dialog: PG&amp;E's even talking to us is cause this is a
dialog: quiet little real estate dispute. We add
dialog: plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle
dialog: of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem --
dialog: against a massive utility. No, thank you.
text: They go into their office building.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Erin and Ed are riding up.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Okay, so here's what I'll do. I'll go on up
dialog: to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest
dialog: people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend
dialog: every single day watching their little girl
dialog: fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll
dialog: tell them we can't help them cause you don't
dialog: feel like working that hard.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's not about working hard --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: -- It's about being realistic. Something
dialog: like this, Erin -- it could take forever.
dialog: They're a huge corporation. They'd
dialog: completely bury us in paperwork. I'm just
dialog: one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: -- who happens to know they poisoned people
dialog: and lied about it.
text: The doors open. Ed gets off. Erin follows.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY LAW OFFICE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Erin's dogging Ed down the hall, to the office.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry. Not
dialog: only does it attack every organ of the body,
dialog: it fucks with your DNA, too. That means
dialog: these people's genes, and the genes of their
dialog: kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know how DNA works, Erin --
text: He gets to the Masry &amp; Vititoe doors. Opens them.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE - DAY
text: Erin tails Ed back to his office.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: We can get these people. With a little
dialog: effort, I really think we can nail their
text: asses to the wall.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise,
dialog: you believe that?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Okay, fine. I don't know shit about shit.
dialog: But I know the difference --
text: He shuts his office door on her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
scene_heading: -- BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG!
scene_heading: INT. ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ed goes over to his desk, sits down. He sees a stack of
text: messages there, starts flipping through them. Then he stops.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Damn it.
text: He shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands.
text: He sits like that for a moment, GROANS to himself. Then he
text: pushes himself up and heads over to his door.
text: When he opens it, he finds Erin still standing there, exactly
text: where he left her, arms crossed. She hasn't budged.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How many families we talking about here?
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: Four more. Eleven people. So far.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You think there's more?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well -- I found one document at the water
dialog: board that had a toxic test well reading
dialog: from 1967. A hell of a lot of people have
dialog: lived on that land since then.
text: Ed pauses, groans again, realizing what decision he's making.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This is a whole different ball game, Erin.
dialog: A much bigger deal.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole
dialog: fucking family.
dialog: (heavy sigh)
dialog: Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if,
dialog: you find me the evidence to back all this up
dialog: -- I'll do it. I'll take it on.
text: She smiles victoriously.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Remind me of that when I'm
dialog: filing for bankruptcy.
text: He heads back to his desk. Erin follows him into his office.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Course, gathering evidence -- now, that's a
dialog: big job. A hell of a lot bigger than just
dialog: filing. I'm gonna be working a lot harder
dialog: now, taking on a lot more responsibility ...
text: He gives her a look. Knows what's coming.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Another raise wouldn't hurt. And with all
dialog: the time I'm gonna be spending on the road,
dialog: I'll probably be needing my own cel phone,
dialog: won't I?
scene_heading: INT. TOYS 'R' US - DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A BEEPING CEL PHONE
text: as Erin tries to program numbers into its speed dial. WIDEN
text: to see she is reading from the phone's manual as she enters
text: Toys 'R' Us with George, Matthew, Katie and Beth.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You each can pick out four things. But
dialog: nothing huge. Look at the price. Nothing
dialog: crazy.
text: Matthew and Katie fan out into the store. Erin keeps messing
text: with the phone.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but
dialog: come Monday, when you split again, they're
dialog: still gonna be pissed.
text: Erin looks over at him, weary.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: George, I am just trying to do something
dialog: nice for my kids on my one day off. Could
dialog: you please not give me a hard time about it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: One toy per kid is doing something nice.
dialog: Four is ... something else.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh?
dialog: They're scarred for life. They're gonna
dialog: start holding up 7-11's any day now.

dialog: I'm just saying --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (with intensity)
dialog: I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna
dialog: hear it. I am doing the best I can.
text: And she walks away from him.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY, ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY
text: Erin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch,
text: scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic
dialog: containers. Over this:
speaker_heading: ERIN (O.S.)
dialog: Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich. Tell me
dialog: something: if I wanna find as much evidence
dialog: of hexavalent chromium contamination as I
dialog: possibly can, what should I do?
text: As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side
text: of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT
text: Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked
text: "No Trespassing". Her arms are full of more containers.
speaker_heading: FRANKEL (O.S.)
dialog: Well, what you have to remember is, if you
dialog: have hex chrom in the water, you have it in
dialog: anything that lived off the water.
text: She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the
text: trunk of her car.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
text: Another day. This time it's RAINING. Erin minces her way
text: down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels.
speaker_heading: FRANKEL (O.S.)
dialog: What I'd do is start a collection. Anything
dialog: that existed in water, on water, under water
dialog: ...
text: She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of
text: rancid pool water and seals it.
speaker_heading: FRANKEL (O.S.)
dialog: anything that had water flow over or under
dialog: it ...
text: Erin spots a few dead frogs in the water. She picks one up
text: by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well.
scene_heading: EXT. WELL - DAY
text: With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up
text: over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against
text: one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts
text: shimmying down the well.
speaker_heading: FRANKEL (O.S.)
dialog: anything that had water pass through it ...
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE WELL
text: she winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as
text: she descends to the water level. When she's low enough, she
text: takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY
text: Erin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt,
text: adding reports to the TOXICOLOGY binder.
speaker_heading: FRANKEL (O.S.)
dialog: ... collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em
dialog: to me. I'll analyze 'em, see what we got.
text: ON THE REPORTS: We catch a few words: "water sample A ...",
dialog: "soil sample D ...", "frog sample A ...", "... traces of
dialog: hexavalent ..."
text: Brenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: For God's sake, Erin, I can see your
dialog: panties.
text: Erin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Liar. I'm not wearing any.
text: Ed, in his office, laughs. He's starting to like this gal.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It's a hot night. George is playing on the floor with the
text: kids. Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading
text: a book labeled, simply, CHROMIUM. The phone RINGS. Erin
text: picks it up.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's
dialog: been snooping around the water board?
text: His voice is flat, creepy. Not friendly.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yes. Who's this?
text: CLICK. Erin stares at the phone, freaked.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: George watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone
dialog: call, George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Come on, Erin. A job's supposed to pay your
dialog: bills, not put you in danger.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm not in danger. I have a dead bolt.
dialog: Remember?
text: She goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks
text: in there. George follows.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Look, don't take this the wrong way, but
dialog: don't you think you might be out of your
dialog: league here?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No, see -- that's exactly what those
dialog: arrogant PG&amp;E fucks want me to think -- that
dialog: because they got all this money and power,
dialog: we don't stand a chance in hell against
dialog: them. But you know what? They're wrong.
text: She heads into the bedrooms.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It doesn't have to be this complicated,
dialog: Erin. There's a lot of jobs out there.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (off-hand)
dialog: How would you know?
text: George reacts, a little stung. He follows her into:
scene_heading: INT. MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Matt and Katie are asleep. Erin is checking their windows.
text: George comes in. They whisper.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You mind telling me what that's supposed to
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If you got a problem with me taking care of
dialog: your kids instead of getting some job, just
dialog: say so.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I didn't say that.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can
dialog: start leaving the kids with the chicken fat
dialog: lady again. Would that make you happy?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Keep your voice down.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know what they can sleep through, Erin. I
dialog: probably know it better than you.
text: She gives him a glare, then leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. WATER BOARD - DAY
text: Erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of
text: files. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hey, Ross. Tell me something. Does PG&amp;E
dialog: pay you to cover their ass, or do you just
dialog: do it out of the kindness of your heart?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (a bad liar)
dialog: I don't know what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: The fuck you don't. No one calls me Pattee.
dialog: That heavy-breathing sicko that called the
dialog: other night could've only found out about me
dialog: from you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: People are dying, Ross. You got document
dialog: after document here, right under your nose,
dialog: that says why, and you haven't said word one
dialog: about it. I wanna know how the hell you
dialog: sleep at night.
text: Ross is speechless. He just stands there. Erin drags the
text: box to the floor and goes to work.
scene_heading: EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT
text: Erin's car is parked in front. A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes
text: rumbling up the road. When its lights hit Erin's car, it
text: slows, then pulls over. The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to
text: get a better look at the car. The truck sits there for a
text: bit, a dark presence. Then, as the headlights of another car
text: appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out
text: and drives off.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - NIGHT
text: A pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat. An
text: empty coffee cup rolls around the floor. Erin's driving,
text: exhausted. She yawns as she dials her phone.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
text: INTERCUT between Erin in her car, and George in bed.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the
dialog: road. Keep me awake, willya?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: What do you want, a joke?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me
dialog: about your day. What went on back there?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, come to think of it, we did have a big
text: event around here. Beth started talking.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Beth? My Beth?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah. We were sitting around at lunch and
text: she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
text: Erin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway,
text: feeling all hollowed-out.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'd never seen that before -- someone's
dialog: first word. Pretty intense.
text: Erin just nods. Keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls
text: down her cheek.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S AREA - DAY
text: CLOSE ON SOME FILES as Erin hands them to Ed. As he takes
text: them from her, he notices a crematory urn on Erin's desk.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Is that what I think it is?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: She lived on the plume. You never know.
dialog: 
text: Ed laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking
text: at her. She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine.
text: CLOSE ON THE FAX LED as Brenda types in the number. The
text: recipient's name comes up again: PG&amp;E CLAIMS DEPT.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY BARBECUE - DAY
text: Open pits, pony rides, watermelon. George is watching Katie
text: and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped
text: being fun hours ago. Now they're just hot and tired.
text: BY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they
dialog: sign retainer agreements.
text: ELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a
text: swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN. The water is green.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: This was the community pool?
speaker_heading: WOMAN 1
dialog: Yeah, that PG&amp;E built. The whole time we
dialog: thought it was algae that made it so green.
text: LATER ...
text: Erin's trunk is open. She and Ed are clipping new clusters
text: of retainer agreements into the "PLAINTIFFS" binder.
scene_heading: LATER STILL ...
text: Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets. She
text: sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm bored, and so are the kids.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Just a few more minutes, then we can go.
dialog: (as he heads off)
dialog: Take her, will you?
text: George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin. He heads
text: over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log.
text: As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he
text: dropped. It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET. He's in his
text: 50's, strong and sinewy. Military-style dark glasses obscure
text: his eyes. He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working
text: the crowd. Watches her carefully. He slides the pamphlet
text: into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY
text: OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board.
scene_heading: LATER STILL ...
text: Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave,
text: when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Erin, this here's Frank Melendez. He works
text: over at the compressor station --
text: Erin stops in her tracks, very interested.
scene_heading: LATER STILL ...
text: Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking. Out of the corner of
text: her eye, she sees her car drive off. George's hand sticks
text: out the driver's side and flips her the bird. She watches
text: him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm sorry. What were you saying?
text: LATER ...
text: The barbecue is winding down. Ed is heading for his
text: Mercedes. Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I need a ride.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S CAR - DAY
text: Ed is driving. He glances over at Erin, fuming in the
text: passenger seat. After a beat:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You wanna talk about --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No.
text: Another beat. Then Erin's cel phone rings. She digs into
text: her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can. Answers.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What, asshole?
text: There's a pause. Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the
dialog: line, very strained:
speaker_heading: MIKE AMBROSINO (O.S.)
dialog: Um, Erin? This is Mike. Ambrosino.
scene_heading: EXT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY
text: The curtains are drawn; everything is dark. Ed and Erin are
text: at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: She was about to take a handful of these --
text: He shows them a bottle of prescription pills.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's a morphine thing -- for pain --
text: Erin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward:
scene_heading: INT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY
text: Erin opens the door. Very dark, very quiet. Laura is lying
text: in bed. Erin goes over to her. They speak in whispers.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I'm embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That's okay. I understand.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It's just -- the pain. It's only getting
dialog: worse. I can't be a good wife. I can't be
dialog: a good mother.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm real sorry, Laura.
text: Erin sits down on the chair next to the bed. Takes a beat.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Know what I always thought I wanted outta
dialog: life, Erin? A Jaguar.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I thought if I could spend that kinda money
dialog: on a car, it'd mean everything else was
dialog: fine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't even know how much they cost.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: A lot. But you hang in there, maybe you'll
dialog: get one.
text: Laura shakes her head.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Wouldn't mean the same thing.
text: Erin watches her sadly.
scene_heading: INT. PG&amp;E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY
text: A LOUD, industrial plant. Erin and Frank Melendez walk
text: through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress. Both
text: in hard-hats. He's giving her a tour.
scene_heading: EXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY
text: George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the
text: sidewalk. As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER.
text: He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change.
text: In the stroller, Beth starts to whine. George reaches in his
text: pocket, finds her pacifier. As he's leaning down to give it
text: to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him.
text: The roar grows. He stands, looks. A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN
text: BIKERS has pulled up next to him. He looks at them. They
text: look at him, then at the stroller. George feels ridiculous.
text: When the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out.
text: George just stands there and watches them go.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE - NIGHT
text: His office is all about Hinkley. A map of the plume area and
text: a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant
text: cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface;
text: Erin is up at the map, eating Chinese food.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: They used the hex chrom here, in these
dialog: cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive. Then
dialog: they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
text: She bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: They covered 'em over. And not too
dialog: carefully either, cause you dig one inch
text: under the surface, and the dirt is green as
dialog: a fucking shamrock.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And that's what caused the contamination?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It didn't help, but no. The real problem's
text: on the bottom.
text: She reaches for a document, reads from it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: See, according to this, they were supposed
dialog: to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep
dialog: into the ground. But guess what --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They skipped that step.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I guess it was a little too inconvenient.
dialog: So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed
dialog: into the groundwater, free as you please.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't even wanna ask what you did to make
dialog: this Melendez guy talk.
text: In response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: For your information, Frank cares what was
dialog: in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half
dialog: his day wading around them. That was his
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No --
text: Suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: SHIT! SHIT! Hot! Hot! Hot!
text: Tears spring to her eyes. She fans furiously at her mouth.
text: Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her.
text: She takes a swig. There's a nanosecond of relief ... until
text: the tequila hits. Her eyes redden. She spews and gasps.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You ... asshole ...
text: Ed chuckles.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - LATER
text: The tequila's been dipped into. Ed and Erin are each lying
text: on a couch, staring at documents. Late-night working.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin -- lemme tell you something. If I'da
dialog: put three researchers on this, I wouldn't
dialog: expect them to dig up all the information
dialog: you got here. This is some damn good work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah? Then gimme another raise.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I
dialog: haven't billed a minute of my time since I
dialog: started on this case, so you can quit
dialog: hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
text: He gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room
text: with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Don't give me that. You're gonna get plenty
dialog: rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent. We got
dialog: those PG&amp;E fuckers by the balls here.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We've got the PG&amp;E fuckers in Hinkley by the
dialog: balls. But nobody's getting rich unless we
dialog: can pin this on the corporate PG&amp;E fuckers
dialog: in San Francisco.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: PG&amp;E corporate is claiming they had no way
dialog: of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, they knew. They had to know.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Show me the document that proves that.
dialog: She doesn't have one.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Then they didn't know. And if they didn't
dialog: know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages.
dialog: And punitive damages is where the money is.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I
dialog: work on this thing, the more I realize what
dialog: a crock of shit this legal system is. Here
dialog: we got a company that poisoned a whole
dialog: aquifer -- that built a pool for a town,
dialog: then filled it with toxic water -- and we're
dialog: the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving
dialog: things? That's just not right.
text: Beat. Ed smiles.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I like this case.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Really? It makes me sick.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Me too. That's why I like it. It's been a
dialog: long time since I had a case I cared about.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You didn't care about my case?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I would now.
text: He gives her a long look.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey. I like working with you.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, good, Ed. I like working with you
dialog: too.
text: They both smile a little awkwardly. Take a beat. Then:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: When'd you start calling me Ed?
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE - NIGHT
text: The Christmas party. The office is decorated; someone is
text: Santa. Erin and George enter, all dressed up.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Erin's giving George a guided tour. As they head down the
text: hall, every desk is decorated and has a present on it
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm just saying -- we have one night to
dialog: ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Cause it's my office party. If you had an
dialog: office, I'd go to your party.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - NIGHT
text: It's dark. The door to Erin's area opens.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And here, ta-daa, is my desk.
text: She flicks on the lights. Brenda's desk is decorated and as
text: a present on it. Erin's is empty.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Which one?
dialog: (it's obvious)
dialog: Maybe they didn't think you were coming.
text: Erin shakes her head. She's surprised by how hurt she is.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: God damn. I work so hard. The least they
dialog: could do ...
text: George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little. He
text: goes over to her, wraps his arms around her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Hey. Fuck 'em, babe. Who needs 'em, huh?
text: He kisses her. She leans into him. He kisses her some more.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: See? All we need is each other.
text: She kisses back. She's gonna let him take care of her. Some
text: more kisses, heating up. He slides her onto her empty desk.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Good thing there isn't a present there, huh?
dialog: That mighta hurt.
text: She laughs a little. He slides his hands up her skirt. She
text: pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY OFFICES, HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Ed is coming down the hall with his wife, JOEY. Joey is much
text: younger than Ed, and very pretty.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'll show you what we did back here --
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT
text: Erin and George, in a rapidly-heating-up clinch on her desk,
text: hear the voices. Erin pulls away.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That's Ed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Lock the door.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No, I wanna say hi.
text: He pulls her back into him, not wanting to move.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We'll say hi later. Lock it.
text: But Erin pulls away ...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Come on, George, it's a party.
text: He watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from
text: him. It's just one step, but it feels a hell a lot farther.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER
text: Erin and Ed are at the reception desk, talking and laughing.
text: NEARBY, Joey and George are standing together, awkwardly.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Your wife's real pretty.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She's not my wife.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Matthew lies awake in his bed, listening to George and Erin
dialog: fight.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: It wouldn't kill you to talk about
dialog: something other than yourself and your own
dialog: fucking job once in a while --
speaker_heading: ERIN (O.S.)
dialog: What do you want to talk about instead?
dialog: Your day? That's a fascinating subject.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Erin and George are fighting while they get ready for bed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Fuck you. Just cause I don't spend all day
dialog: trying to prove what hot shit I am --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That is not what I'm --
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Bullshit, Erin. Bullshit.
text: The fight is interrupted by the sound of BETH CRYING.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Great. Excellent. Thank you very much.
text: She leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. BETH'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Beth is wailing in her crib. Erin comes in in her nightshirt
text: and lifts Beth out. Then, more to herself than to Beth:
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It's okay, baby. It'll be okay.
text: She runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall
text: and crumples onto the floor. As she curls around Beth, Erin
text: starts to COUGH. Deep, raspy coughs from way down low.
scene_heading: EXT. PG&amp;E STATION - NIGHT
text: Late, late at night. The plant is silent. The property
text: seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone
text: inside the gates, staring up at the station.
text: After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant.
text: It misses. Not that it would do anything if it hit. He
text: reaches for another, throws it. Then another, and another.
text: He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant. Then,
text: overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL.
scene_heading: INT. IRVINGS' HOUSE, DONNA'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Donna's sitting quietly in bed. Erin is sitting on the edge
dialog: of the bed.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I'd got so used to having 'em come up
dialog: benign, I guess I just didn't expect it.
text: She looks down her shirt front.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Sure wish I had longer to get used to the
dialog: idea.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You think if you got no uterus, and no
dialog: breasts, you're still technically a woman?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Sure you are. You're just a happier woman,
dialog: cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads
dialog: and underwire.
text: Donna smiles a little. Then her face crumbles.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: We're gonna get them, aren't we, Erin? You
dialog: gotta promise me we're gonna get them.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, DAY
text: CLOSE ON THE FAX LED
text: as DOCUMENTS are faxed once again to the PG&amp;E CLAIMS DEPT.
text: THEN AGAIN, on another day.
dialog: AND AGAIN, on another day.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ed is once again checking the lie of his tie in a window.
text: Erin is popping some aspirin, trying to kill a headache that
dialog: has brought with it a healthy dose of intolerance.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: If they've sent that little shmuck Baum
dialog: again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd
dialog: say they're taking us more seriously.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah, I heard that one before.
text: Brenda leans her head in.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Webster, Mr. Buda, and Ms.

scene_heading: Talk about moving up the food chain. MS. SANCHEZ, MR.
text: WEBSTER, MR. BUDA, and MR. COOPER mill slowly about the
text: reception area like sharks. They all ooze importance.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, OUTSIDE OF ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Erin, Ed and Brenda are staring out at them.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Jesus. They look like the Secret Service.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They're trying to intimidate us.
dialog: (then, to Brenda)
dialog: Tell them to wait in the conference room.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Sanchez, Webster, Buda, and Cooper are seated.
text: The door opens and Ed enters, legal pad under his arm.
text: Followed by Erin, legal pad under her arm. Followed by Anna
text: (looking professional in Brenda's suit coat), legal pad under
text: her arm. Followed by Mario (in a suit produced from who
dialog: knows where), legal pad under his arm. If you didn't know
dialog: better, you'd assume it was a team of lawyers as well.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Counselors --
speaker_heading: MR. SANCHEZ
dialog: Counselors.
text: Ed and Erin sit down and get to work. Mario and Anna,
text: clearly told to just follow along, sit down a moment later.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
text: Mario and Anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside Ed
text: and Erin, firing blank looks across the table.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ
dialog: Let's be honest, here. Two million dollars
dialog: is more money than these people have ever
dialog: dreamed of.
dialog: Erin has no patience for this today.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, see, now that pisses me off. First of
dialog: all -- we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs.
dialog: They may not be sophisticated, but they do
dialog: know how to divide, and two million dollars
dialog: isn't shit when it's split between them.
text: Mario and Anna exchange a look. This is getting interesting.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin --
text: But there's no stopping her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And second of all -- these people don't
dialog: dream about being rich. They dream about
dialog: being able to watch their kids swim in a
dialog: pool without worrying they'll have to have a
dialog: hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a
dialog: client of ours -- or have their spine
text: deteriorate like Stan Bloom. Another client
dialog: of ours. So before you come back here with
dialog: another lame-ass offer, I want you to think
dialog: real hard about what your spine is worth,
dialog: Mr. Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to
dialog: pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez --
dialog: then you take out your calculator and
dialog: multiply that number by a hundred. Anything
dialog: less than that is a waste of our time.
text: And she gets up and storms out of the meeting.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY
text: Erin drinks a big swig of coffee and pops a few more aspirin.
text: Beyond her, the PG&amp;E lawyers are filing out of the office.
text: Anna wanders over to Erin, a little uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Um, Erin?
dialog: (Erin turns)
dialog: Listen. Even though you're not necessarily
dialog: my favorite person in the world ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm gonna assume that was meant as a
dialog: compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT
text: Erin's at her desk, which is completely buried in documents
text: and files. She's visibly exhausted, struggling to focus on
text: the page, and COUGHING while she works. Ed calls to her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey. A new plaintiff called, wants to meet
dialog: you. I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: D'you get his name?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Course not. Jesus, Ed --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Boy, this job takes me to some of the best
dialog: damn places, huh?
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET
text: Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the
text: bottle. She checks her watch: 6:30. The GAS STATION
text: ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: This is the only station in town, right?
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Yup.
text: He gets in his car and drives off. Erin sits down again.
text: Looks down the road in both directions. Nothing.
text: Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint
text: of chrome. She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees:
text: the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.
text: Erin looks around, realizes she's alone. As she looks back
text: at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab.
text: She realizes she's being watched. The driver's door opens.
text: Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys. She
text: jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it
text: won't turn over. Panic. The Man in the Dark Glasses has
text: gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around
text: again. Not a soul. She tries the engine again. And again.
text: Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages. Erin peels
text: out of the gas station.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus
text: on the road. She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing.
text: She reaches the train tracks. A train is passing. She has
text: to stop. As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce
text: off her rear view mirror. Truck lights, coming her way.
text: Fuck. She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back
text: at the headlights closing in on her. The train, the
text: headlights, the train, the headlights ...
text: Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last
text: train car zips by. Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car
text: over the tracks. The truck follows.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT
text: The Hyundai zips down the road. And behind it, the truck.
scene_heading: INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
text: She looks out at the landscape around her. It's black. No
text: other cars on the road. She starts to panic, accelerates.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT
text: The Hyundai going faster. The truck still following.
scene_heading: INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
text: Erin comes up on a stop sign. She runs it. So does the
text: truck. A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST
text: CAUSE SALOON. In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's
text: Mercedes. She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car.
scene_heading: INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
text: Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door. She
text: rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Someone's following me.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What? Who?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was
dialog: alone, then he followed me, like, two miles.
dialog: Jesus, I'm shaking. Get me a beer.
text: Ed gets up and heads toward the door.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (to the counter guy)
dialog: Beer, please.
text: As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What kind of truck?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don't know. Big. Dark.
speaker_heading: ED
text: He's gone.
dialog: (back to the table)
dialog: Did you get a license plate? Or a make?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No, Ed -- what with me running for my life,
dialog: I didn't have time to check those things --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I was just asking. Are you all right?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, I'm ... fine.
text: Ed looks at her. She looks terrible. Shaky, tired, drawn.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Jesus, you look like shit. When was the
dialog: last time you had a decent night's sleep?
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Crappy and pink. Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot.
text: Erin's Hyundai follows. Ed stops, gets out.
scene_heading: INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
text: Ed swings by Erin's open car window.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't worry. I'm getting two rooms.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each
text: rattling a key. They find their adjacent rooms and stop.
text: Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Lock the door every which way you can. And
dialog: if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever
dialog: -- pound on the wall. I'll come right over.
text: She nods a little. Then before she goes into her room:
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I think you should know -- there's very few
dialog: people in the world who don't piss me off 90
dialog: percent of the time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're one of 'em.
text: It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it. They look
text: at each other. Maybe even considering. But after a long
text: beat, she reaches for her door again. Moment over.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm triple locking my door, so don't even
dialog: think of trying to take advantage.
text: She smiles, goes inside. He watches her close her door
text: behind her before going inside himself.
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT
text: George is sitting alone on the stoop, drinking a beer. Music
text: is coming from his house next door. He stares out into the
text: street with a lot on his mind.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
text: Katie and Matt are making a mess of breakfast. Beth is on
text: the floor, grinding cereal into the linoleum.
speaker_heading: ERIN (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
text: Erin enters, having just gotten home, and sees the mayhem.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What are you doing? Where's George?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: George!
text: She heads out.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: George is sitting on the bed when Erin enters.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Jesus, George, they're turning the kitchen
dialog: into a hellhole. You know you can't leave
dialog: them alone like that.
text: He doesn't answer. Doesn't move. She notices this.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What's going on? What are you doing?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thinking.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: About what?
text: He's very calm. He holds out a small jewelry box.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: About this.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's a pair of earrings. I saw 'em in the
dialog: mall one day, and I thought, damn, those
dialog: would look good on those beautiful earlobes.
dialog: So I bought 'em. And I said to myself, next
dialog: time Erin says something nice, does
dialog: something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Know how long ago that was? Six months. In
dialog: six months, you haven't said one nice thing
dialog: to me. That's a long time.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm just working so hard --
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I know. But still. Six months.
dialog: (he stands)
dialog: I think you oughta either find a different
dialog: job or a different boyfriend. Cause there
dialog: may be men who don't mind being the maid and
dialog: getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as
dialog: shit not one of 'em.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I can't leave my job, George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People
dialog: do it all the time.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I can't. Look -- this job -- it's the best
dialog: thing that ever happened to me. I mean it.
dialog: For the first time in my life, I got people
text: respecting me. Up in Hinkley, I walk into a
text: room and everyone shuts up just to hear what
dialog: I got to say. I never had that. Ever.
dialog: Don't ask me to give it up. I need it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: More than you need me.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I need it.
text: He nods, then stands, to leave.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Maybe you didn't like who you were before,
dialog: Erin, but I did. That's who I fell in love
dialog: with.
text: Only then does she see the packed duffel bag in the corner.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You already packed up your stuff?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I pretty much knew what your answer was
dialog: gonna be.
text: He picks it up and walks out the door, tossing the earring
text: box on the bed as he goes.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Erin is at her window, looking out at the street below.
text: George is strapping a couple of bags onto the back of his
text: bike. He gets on the bike, starts it up, and drives away.
scene_heading: INT. HYUNDAI - DAY
text: Erin is driving, looking weary. Her kids are in the car.
text: Matthew turns on the radio. Erin reaches over and turns it
text: off. Matthew turns it back on. Erin glares at him, turns it
text: off. On/off/on/off. A test of wills. Finally, when Matthew
text: turns it on one more time, Erin turns it off, yanks the knob
text: off the stereo and throws it out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The Hyundai pulls into the lot.
scene_heading: INT. HYUNDAI - DAY
text: Erin parks the car, unclips her seat belt.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Wait here.
text: She gets out.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: Business as usual. Erin comes in, goes straight to her desk.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY
text: Erin flips through her "in" box, looking for something in
text: particular. Doesn't find it. Grrr. She heads off to:
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Jane is at her desk when Erin comes in.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Where's my paycheck?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Have you been logging on?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JANE
text: I moved payroll onto the computer. It only
dialog: knows to process paychecks for employees who
text: log on in the morning and off at night.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (seething)
dialog: Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not
dialog: in here most mornings and nights?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You're clever. I'm sure you'll think of
dialog: something.
text: Erin glares at her ...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don't believe this --
text: ... then turns and storms out of Jane's office.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ed is on the phone when Erin barges in, rage in her eyes.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I want my fucking money --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold
dialog: for just one second here --
dialog: (puts the call on
dialog: hold, then, to Erin)
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (seething)
dialog: Yeah, I mind. You bet your ass I mind.
text: Clearly, she's in a dander he's going to have to deal with.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, Jesus. You wanna tell me what the
dialog: problem is here, or --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It's my paycheck. Which I earned. Which I
dialog: deserve. Which I shouldn't have to beg for.
dialog: That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin, you're a big girl. If you got a
dialog: problem with Jane, work it out for yourself.
dialog: I don't have time to deal with --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Fuck you. Make time. Cause I bust my ass
dialog: for you. I watch everything else in my life
dialog: go straight in the toilet, for you. And
dialog: what do you do for me? Huh? You see the
dialog: way I'm treated around here -- but have you
dialog: ever stood up for me once? Have you ever
dialog: mentioned to everyone what good work I'm
dialog: doing? Have you ever bothered saying, hey,
dialog: Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has
dialog: the best tits; she gets paid the most cause
dialog: she's the best God damn employee I've ever
dialog: had?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Is that what you want?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I want my paycheck. By the end of the day.
text: Ed sighs. Realizes he's going to have to take this on.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You might want to think real hard about the
dialog: amount, too. My kids are sitting in the God
dialog: damn parking lot right now, cause I still
dialog: don't make enough to afford good child care.
dialog: Makes me think about looking around for a
dialog: job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
text: She storms out.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Erin is standing at the sink, visibly exhausted, trying to do
text: the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort Beth, who's
text: CRYING, with the other. Matthew comes in.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Can I play roller hockey?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: We'll see.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: When?
text: The DOORBELL RINGS. Erin goes to get it. Matthew follows
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: Matthew is dogging Erin on this. Beth is still crying.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Randy's mom said yes right away.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom
dialog: doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's
dialog: dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's
dialog: gonna take who where is a little easier over
text: at Randy's house.
text: Erin opens the door. A MESSENGER is there.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: Erin Brockovich?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: Package from Masry &amp; Vititoe.
text: He hands her a manila envelope. She signs for the package,
text: then tears into it as the Messenger heads away.
text: A CHECK and a SET OF KEYS fall out. She looks at the check.
text: It's made out for $5,000. A note attached reads "HIRE A
scene_heading: NANNY. AND LOOK OUTSIDE. - E."
text: Erin looks up and sees A BRAND-NEW CHEVY BLAZER parked on the
text: curb. She looks at the keys in her hand. Chevy keys. Whoa.
scene_heading: EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Erin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, LAW LIBRARY - DAY
text: It's dark. Ed's seated at a table, alone. Erin walks by the
text: door, then spots him and stops in the doorway.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Believe it or not, I would've been satisfied
dialog: with just the check.
text: Ed turns, sees her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, you go threatening to leave, I can't
dialog: take any chances. You're the only person
dialog: around who understands what I'm doing.
dialog: Things come up, I gotta know I got someone
dialog: to turn to.
text: She sits, reading him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What kind of things come up?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Things like the head counsel for PG&amp;E
dialog: calling me with an offer.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 20 million, plus attorney's fees. Take it
dialog: or leave it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Whoa. No shit.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: So what are you thinking?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to
dialog: make this decision.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 50 thousand bucks is more than any other
dialog: California toxic plaintiff has gotten.
dialog: Ever. But ...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's
dialog: medical bills.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And it's less than pocket change for PG&amp;E.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Do you think we'd do better by going to
dialog: trial?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Maybe. but maybe not. We still don't have
dialog: anything linking this to PG&amp;E corporate.
dialog: Plus, there's the statute problem. Plus,
dialog: we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to
dialog: bring on more lawyers ...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot
dialog: of money.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's eight million dollars, Erin. Eight
dialog: million dollars.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That's a fucking fortune, Ed. And you know
dialog: I'm the last person on Earth to walk away
dialog: from a big payday. But you and me didn't
dialog: get into this to get rich. We did it cause
dialog: we both have this voice in our heads saying,
dialog: do the right thing; get these plaintiffs
dialog: what they deserve -- the right to live and
dialog: die in some kind of comfort and peace. If
dialog: 50,000 isn't gonna buy that, then we gotta
dialog: say no.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Trust me. If you don't do the right thing
dialog: for these people, getting that 6 million
dialog: dollars is gonna feel like shit.
text: He nods to himself, and looks up at her, his mind made up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I knew I put up with your bullshit for a
dialog: reason.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S NEW CAR - DAY
text: It's raining. They're driving through the tall buildings of
text: Century City. Ed is full of nervous excitement.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This guy, Erin -- he's got more toxic tort
dialog: experience than anyone else in California.
dialog: He's huge. And he said yes to me on the
text: first phone call, right off the bat.
dialog: (points to a building)
dialog: That's it. The big one. They've got the
text: top three floors.
scene_heading: INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, RECEPTION - DAY
text: It feels more like the lobby of a five-star hotel than an
text: office. Erin and Ed step off the elevator. Erin gawks.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Holy shit. Who do they represent, God?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't joke. They might. So do me a favor
dialog: and behave yourself for once.
dialog: (to receptionist)
dialog: Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
text: As Ed turns to check his reflection, a YOUNG LAWYER comes
text: through the reception area. Erin watches him pass, then,
text: still miffed, calls out to him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Scuse me, sir, you got a real nice ass, you
dialog: know that?
text: The lawyer double-takes on her, then retreats into the
text: office. Erin turns to Ed, smiles.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. Was that not what you meant
dialog: by behaving myself?
scene_heading: INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD RECEPTION AREA - DAY
text: THERESA DELLAVALLE, 38, junior partner, comes out to greet
text: them. She's everything Erin isn't: conservative, restrained,
text: unemotional. And about as sexy as a station wagon.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Ed. Good to see you again.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Theresa, hey -- this is Erin Brockovich.
scene_heading: INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD HALLWAY - DAY
text: Theresa leads Ed and Erin down a long hall of teak desks.
text: The sound of their footfalls is swallowed up by the plush
text: carpeting. Occasional ATTORNEYS and PARALEGALS glance at
text: Erin. She feels their stares.
scene_heading: INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, KURT POTTER'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Potter is sitting behind his giant desk when Theresa leads Ed
dialog: and Erin in.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Kurt, Ed Masry's here. And this is Erin
dialog: Brockovich, Ed's assistant. Erin, this is
dialog: Kurt Potter.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: (to Ed, with a wink)
dialog: Well. Now I know what you meant when you
dialog: called her your secret weapon.
text: Erin gives Ed another look. What the fuck? Ed gives her a
dialog: firm look back. Behave.
scene_heading: INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Potter, Ed, Erin, Theresa and few PARALEGALS are sitting
text: around the table. As the conversation ping-pongs between Ed
text: and Potter, Potter completely ignores Erin.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: When'd they file the demur?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yesterday.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What's a demur?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's PG&amp;E saying to the judge that we don't
dialog: have a case. Their lawyers go --
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: How many counts?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sixty-nine. We've got good answers to all
dialog: of 'em.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Counts?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Reasons PG&amp;E thinks it shouldn't go to --
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Who's the judge?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Corey.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Why good?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He's got a reputation for doing all his --
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: How long's he gonna take?
text: Erin's starting to steam at Potter. Theresa sees it brewing,
text: tries to intercede.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You know what? Why don't I take Erin down
dialog: the hall, so we can start in on this stuff?
text: Erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hey -- those are my files --
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Yeah, we had them couriered over. And
dialog: listen, good work. They're a great start.
dialog: We're just going to have to spend a little
dialog: time filling in the holes in your research.
dialog: Okay, these people are starting to piss her off.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Excuse me -- Theresa, was it? There are no
dialog: holes in my research.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: No offense. There are just some things we
dialog: need that you probably didn't know to ask.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay? I
dialog: may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18
dialog: months on this case, and I know more about
dialog: those plaintiffs than you ever will.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Erin. You don't even have phone numbers for
dialog: some of them.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Whose number do you need?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Everyone's. This is a lawsuit. We need to
dialog: be able to contact the plaintiffs.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I said, whose number do you need?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs'
dialog: numbers by heart.
text: Erin just stares at her. Theresa sighs, reluctantly glances
text: down at a file.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Annabelle Daniels.
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: Annabelle Daniels. 714-454-9346.
text: As Theresa starts to write it down:
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: 10 years old, 11 in May. Lived on the plume
dialog: since birth. Wanted to be a synchronized
dialog: swimmer, so she spent every minute she could
text: in the PG&amp;E pool. She had a tumor in her
dialog: brain stem detected last November, had an
dialog: operation on Thanksgiving, shrunk it with
dialog: radiation after that. Her parents are Rita
dialog: and Ted. Ted's got Chron's disease, and
text: Rita has chronic headaches and nausea and
dialog: underwent a hysterectomy last fall. Ted
dialog: grew up in Hinkley. His brother Robbie and
dialog: his wife May and their five kids Robbie,
text: Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose, and Peter lived on
text: the plume too. Their number's 454-9445.
dialog: You want their diseases?
text: Beat. Erin glares at Theresa, indignant.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Okay, look -- I think we got off on the
dialog: wrong foot here --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet.
dialog: In fucking ugly shoes.
scene_heading: INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: It's still raining. Erin is following Ed to the car. He's
dialog: furious.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: She insulted me!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding. But
text: instead of handling it politely, instead of
dialog: treating her with respect --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Why the fuck should I respect her?
text: Ed stops in his tracks, furious. He glares at her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Because that's how people treat each other!
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Not in my world.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Gee, I wonder why.
text: On that, he gets in his car, slams the door, and drives off,
text: leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hey! You're my ride!
scene_heading: INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Potter and Ed are walking down the hallway, mid-conversation.
text: A FEW PARALEGALS follow them with files.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: I've also been thinking about the team.
dialog: Responsibilities, who should cover what --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: I think we should makes some changes.
scene_heading: EXT. LINWOOD'S DAIRY - DAY
text: Bob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out. Theresa is at
text: the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his
text: attention by yelling and waving her arms. In her expensive
text: shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield.
scene_heading: INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON A CLIENT FILE as a hand fills in a phone number.
text: WIDEN TO SEE Erin seated with a PARALEGAL, rattling off facts
text: and numbers from memory. She's seized by a COUGHING FIT.
scene_heading: EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY
text: Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention. Finally,
text: rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses
text: it at the barn. It hits the window and BREAKS IT.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - DAY
text: Erin's desk is empty: no Erin, no files, nothing. Ed comes
text: out of his office and hands Brenda a STACK OF DOCUMENTS.
text: CLOSE ON THE FAX LED
text: Brenda types in the number. The recipient's I.D. comes up
text: again, only this time it says: POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD.
scene_heading: INT. POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY
text: A SECRETARY carries the documents to Potter's office. On the
text: way, she passes THE CONFERENCE ROOM. Inside, Erin is still
text: dictating to the PARALEGAL. She's shivery with fever now.
text: The floor around her is littered with tissues.
scene_heading: INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY
text: Theresa is talking to Rita and Ted Daniels. Annabelle is
text: curled up on the sofa, wrapped up in a blanket. Rita and Ted
text: notice that Theresa doesn't even look at Annabelle.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY
text: Erin is lying in bed, home sick, talking on the phone. She's
text: talking over the noise of TANIA, her 20-something Eastern
text: European nanny, vacuuming the hall.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I know she isn't real warm, but they say
dialog: she's a real good lawyer ...
speaker_heading: INTERCUT WITH
scene_heading: INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY
text: Ted Daniels is on the phone. Rita is next to him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That may be. But I don't want her coming to
dialog: the house again. She's kinda stuck-up, and
dialog: she upsets Annabelle. Now, I hate to say
dialog: this, but when she left today, Rita asked if
dialog: we should get a new lawyer.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Ted, no -- don't do that. If you don't like
dialog: Theresa, you don't have to work with her.
dialog: Me and Ed are still here for you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I called Ed two days ago, Erin, and he still
dialog: hasn't called me back.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY
text: The phone rings. Brenda picks up.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: Ed Masry's office ... Sorry, he can't be
dialog: interrupted.
text: INTERCUT WITH Erin at home, still in bed, so irritated.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Don't be a pain in the ass, okay, Brenda?
dialog: Just put him on.
speaker_heading: BRENDA
dialog: (with finality)
dialog: I said, he can't be interrupted.
text: Erin hangs up. Then, with a groan, she pulls her weary body
text: out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY
text: Erin drags herself into the office.
speaker_heading: ROSALIND
dialog: Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: So did I.
text: She heads toward Ed's office, but stops when she sees a
text: meeting in progress in the conference room. Ed is on the
text: side of the table facing her, flanked by Potter and Theresa.
text: On the other side of the table, are FOUR SUITED BACKS.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What's going on in there?
speaker_heading: ROSALIND
text: Some meeting. With PG&amp;E people.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: PG&amp; -- Are you sure?
speaker_heading: ROSALIND
dialog: Yup. They must be important, too, cause
text: they came on a special plane.
text: Erin feels this like a sock in the gut. She stares at the
text: meeting, stunned.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
dialog: This band of PG&amp;E lawyers is the oldest and most impressive
text: of all. Ed, Potter, and Theresa are listening to the most
dialog: senior PG&amp;E lawyer, MR. CORBIN, talk.
speaker_heading: CORBIN
dialog: ... we would enter into binding arbitration
dialog: -- judge, no jury -- with a settlement to be
dialog: between 50 and 400 million dollars.
text: Ed and Potter hear this and think about it.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Any preconditions on the settlements?
speaker_heading: CORBIN
dialog: The plaintiffs have to agree to it
dialog: unanimously. And they're barred from ever
dialog: discussing their settlement with anyone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: 50-400 million dollars isn't a whole hell of
dialog: a lot of money for your company, Mr. Corbin.
speaker_heading: HEAD COUNSEL
dialog: 50-400 million dollars is a great deal of
dialog: money for your plaintiffs, Mr. Masry.
text: As Ed mulls this, he sees, beyond Mr. Corbin,
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: staring at him from the other side of the glass wall, her
text: face cold with hurt and anger.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Could I -- just take a brief break here for
dialog: a moment? I'll be right back.
text: He gets up and goes out into:
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: Ed comes out. Erin's so angry she can barely breathe.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your
dialog: fucking head off --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin, it's just a meeting.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: People don't fly down in their own god damn
dialog: plane for "just a meeting" --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, you said you weren't feeling great. I
dialog: thought you should rest.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Bullshit. You'd drag me off my deathbed if
dialog: it suited you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay, look. It's an important meeting.
dialog: Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Kurt thought? What about you? Do you think
dialog: anymore?
text: He resists being dragged into an knock-down, drag-out fight.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, this is serious now. They're talking
dialog: serious money --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And, what, I'm not serious?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You're emotional. You're erratic. You say
dialog: any God damn thing that comes into your
dialog: head. And I'm not saying that's bad. That
dialog: can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: "Fun?" Jesus, "fun?" I kill myself for a
dialog: year and a half, hand you the best case of
dialog: your life on a God damn silver platter,
dialog: remind you of why you became a lawyer in the
dialog: first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay, now you're making this personal, and
dialog: it isn't --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Not personal? That's my work in there, Ed.
dialog: My sweat, my labor, my time. If that's not
dialog: personal, I don't know what is.
text: She starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (weakened)
dialog: How dare you take that away from me.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No one's taking anything --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Bullshit. You stuck me in Siberia dictating
dialog: to some God damn steno clerk so you could
dialog: finish this thing without me. After all
dialog: I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
text: By now the entire office is watching. As are the lawyers in
dialog: the conference room.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty.
dialog: You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of
dialog: perks ...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Perks? Jesus -- perks?
text: Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: If this piece of shit is supposed to take
dialog: the place of your respect, you can take it
dialog: and shove it up your ass.
text: She throws it at him and storms away. The phone hits the
text: glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it. Ed just
text: stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the
text: splintered glass wall.
scene_heading: EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Erin gets to her car. As she opens the door, the ALARM
text: SOUNDS. She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it
text: off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out. With the
text: siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Erin's driving home. As she turns onto her street, her
text: headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small
text: boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Holy shit --
text: She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark.
text: She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street. A CAR HONKS.
text: Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again. Holy shit,
text: is right. It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Matthew --
text: She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk,
text: blocking his path. When he sees her car, he turns and runs
text: the other way. Erin leaps out and follows him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Matthew! MATTHEW!
text: She catches up and collars him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: God damn it, Matthew. What the hell are you
dialog: doing out here?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I'm gonna go live with George.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MUSIC is playing. TANIA is on the phone. The receiver is
text: yanked from her hand. She turns to see Erin hovering over
text: her, barely containing herself.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: If you leave here real fast, I might not
dialog: kill you.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall. Erin sitting on the
text: foot of his bed, near tears. Katie's watching from her bed.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: We'll work out the roller hockey thing,
dialog: okay? Whatever you want, we'll work it out.
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: You always say that. Then you go to work
dialog: and forget you promised.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I never forget, honey. I try, real hard.
dialog: It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to
dialog: be able to organize things right and -- when
dialog: it comes to you guys, I end up falling
dialog: short.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: You never fall short for the work people. I
dialog: guess maybe you just love them more.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, God, sweetheart, no. There's nothing on
dialog: Earth I love more than you. Nothing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I promise.
text: She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and
text: inches away from her.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Erin comes out of the bedroom. As she turns to close the
text: door, she collapses to the floor in a heap. Out cold.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
text: A busy Southland ER. George bursts through the doors with
text: Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow. He goes up to the desk.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'm looking for Erin Brockovich. They
dialog: brought her in in an ambulance?
scene_heading: INT. ER WAITING AREA - DAY
text: The kids are waiting. George is talking to a DOCTOR.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Meningitis? What the hell is meningitis?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and
text: part of the brain.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a
dialog: pretty advanced case. I'd say she's been
text: walking around with it for a few weeks now.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How does someone get meningitis?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to
dialog: bacteria or a virus or ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Matt and Katie sit on the cheap plastic chairs outside the
text: room. Katie is holding Beth, who's sleeping.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: They can stay at my place till you go home.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Erin's in bed, hooked up to an IV, looking exhausted. All
text: untouched food tray is beside her bed. George is standing
text: across the room from her, arms crossed tight across his
text: chest, keeping his distance.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: They said that'd be tomorrow. They just
dialog: wanna keep an eye on me another night.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Fine. I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
text: A moment of thick silence.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (giving nothing)
dialog: Mm-hm.
text: As she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet, to leave,
text: she's hit with a wave of regret.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: George, hang on.
dialog: (he pauses)
dialog: Look ... I'm sorry. I just --
text: There's a KNOCK at the door, and Ed enters. George looks at
text: him. Not interested in her apologies.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll drop 'em by tomorrow.
text: And Erin watches George leave the room, then turns to Ed.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: If you're here to fire me, your timing's
dialog: lousy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm not gonna fire you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wanted to. But then you got sick, and
dialog: that woulda made me look like a shit.
dialog: (serious)
dialog: You embarrassed me, Erin.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I know. I'm sorry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER
text: Ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to
text: Erin's bed. He's eating the pudding off her tray.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And if you had to guess ...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: With nothing linking it to the corporate
dialog: offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the
dialog: lower end of that. Still a lot of money.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: So why would PG&amp;E offer it?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Because. They know the evidence; they know
dialog: they're gonna lose a jury trial. Maybe they
dialog: wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once
dialog: you factor in all they'd spend on this case
dialog: in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that
dialog: for the appeal.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing
dialog: goes to trial, it'll be ten years before
dialog: these plaintiffs see their money?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey, that's not so bad. Compare it to the
dialog: Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and
dialog: those people still haven't seen a dime. So
dialog: in legal terms, ten years is --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Fuck legal terms. We're talking about human
dialog: beings here. Sick people. A whole bunch of
dialog: them are gonna be dead in ten years. They
dialog: need their money now!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We gotta get 'em to agree to the
dialog: arbitration, Ed. We gotta get every damn
dialog: one of those plaintiffs to --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know. We're having a meeting, it's all
dialog: set up --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: When? Where?
speaker_heading: ED
text: Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Okay, good. I think I should be the one to
dialog: tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You're not gonna be there.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: The fuck I'm not. I don't care what the
dialog: doctor says --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This isn't doctor's orders. It's mine. I'm
dialog: saying you can't come.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you.
dialog: He thinks you're a loose cannon.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Fuck Kurt.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No, I'm serious. You know what Kurt Potter
dialog: is? He's the kind of guy who never would
dialog: have taken this case in the first place.
dialog: He's the kind of guy who would have sold
dialog: these plaintiffs down the river when PG&amp;E
dialog: offered 20 million. He doesn't work like
text: us, Ed. There's no little voice in his head
dialog: telling him to do the right thing.
text: But his mind's made up. He stands to leave.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't come, Erin. I mean it. If you do,
dialog: I'm gonna have to fire you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just ... concentrate on getting well.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes. Ed,
text: Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their
text: notes. A TRUCK pulls into the lot.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
text: Katie and Matt are watching TV. Beth is playing near them.
text: Behind them, Erin is lying on the couch, under a blanket,
text: distractedly trying to watch TV. She checks her watch.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights
text: criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Erin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit
text: still. She checks her watch again. 6:30. She can't take
text: it. She throws off the blanket and gets up.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Come on, kids, we're going for a ride.
scene_heading: INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON HANDS. As people stream in, they are each handed a
text: release form with a space for a signature on the bottom.
scene_heading: INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - LATER
text: It's sweltering. The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with
text: horse flies and tension. People are fanning themselves with
text: the release forms. Potter's addressing them from a raised
text: platform. Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Binding arbitration isn't all that different
text: from a trial. It's overseen by a judge.
text: Evidence is presented in much the same way.
scene_heading: EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: One more car pulls into the lot. It's Erin's Chevy.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Erin unbuckles her seat belt.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Stay in the car, babies, I won't be long.
scene_heading: EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a
text: window and looks in at the packed meeting.
speaker_heading: PLAINTIFF (O.S.)
dialog: And then a jury decides?
speaker_heading: POTTER (O.S.)
dialog: No, sorry, I should have mentioned that.
dialog: There's no jury in binding arbitration. No
dialog: jury, and no appeal.
text: She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view.
speaker_heading: BOB LINWOOD (O.S.)
dialog: No appeal? So what are our options if we
dialog: don't like the result?
speaker_heading: POTTER (O.S.)
dialog: Well -- you have none. The judge's decision
dialog: is final. But I really don't anticipate
dialog: that as a problem.
scene_heading: INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Now, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is
text: thick with mistrust. People are shifting in their seats,
text: whispering to each other.
speaker_heading: TOM BROWN
dialog: You don't even know what it's gonna be; how
dialog: do you know we're gonna like it?
text: Agreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: As I said before, it will definitely be
dialog: somewhere between 50 and 400 million
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: MANDY BROWN
dialog: Which? There's a big difference there.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: I wouldn't want to speculate at this point.
speaker_heading: MANDY BROWN
dialog: Ed -- what do you think it'll be?
text: Potter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I think ... Kurt's right. We shouldn't
dialog: speculate.
speaker_heading: MANDY BROWN
dialog: So then, what, that mystery number's divided
dialog: up at the whim of some judge --
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Judges don't make decisions based on whim,
dialog: ma'am. They make them based on precedent
dialog: and evidence.
text: The GRUMBLE of discontent has overtaken the room. More
text: whispering, more movement.
scene_heading: EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Erin watches the meeting fall apart. It's driving her crazy.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Fucking idiot --
scene_heading: INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Potter sees he's losing them, too. Tries to gain control.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Look. Everyone. Is this a big decision?
dialog: Absolutely. But I do believe that if you
dialog: put a little faith in the system, you'll be
text: quite pleased with the outcome.
text: Ted Daniels gets up from his seat.
speaker_heading: TED DANIELS
dialog: Mr. Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd
dialog: know that being pleased isn't an option for
dialog: me anymore. Now don't take this personally,
dialog: sir, but I've never seen you before in my
dialog: life. I'm not about to put my faith in
dialog: anything just cause you tell me to.
text: He drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand
text: and heads for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Meeting's over. The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse.
text: Cars start up, headlights flick on. People pull away.
scene_heading: INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Everyone has left. Erin enters and looks around. The floor
text: is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms.
text: She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea. She picks up a
text: release form, and leaves the firehouse.
scene_heading: EXT. MINI MALL - NIGHT
text: Everything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end.
text: Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. KINKO'S - NIGHT
text: A BORED EMPLOYEE is at the register, painting with Wite-Out
text: on a blue piece of paper. Erin enters, dragging her kids.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Can I have one of those counter thingies,
dialog: please?
text: The Employee gives it to her. Erin crosses to the copiers.
text: She slips the release form into one, then taps in the number
text: of copies: 635. Presses "START." The machine WHIRS to life.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Erin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW (O.S.)
dialog: I don't want to stay here. It smells.
scene_heading: INT. HINKLEY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Erin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: We got no choice. I'm not gonna make it
dialog: home tonight. Now go wash up and climb into
dialog: bed.
text: As the kids wander toward the bathroom, Erin picks up the
text: phone and dials. RING, RING.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hi. It's me.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: I got a favor to ask you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't do favors for you anymore.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It's not for me; it's for my kids. You're
dialog: the only one I trust them with.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - DAY
text: Very early. Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to
text: the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot. She
text: turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy.
scene_heading: EXT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Erin comes up to him, hands him a key.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I got you your own room.
text: He takes it, glances toward the motel room.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: They up?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hunh-uh. Not yet.
dialog: (awkward beat)
dialog: Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike,
dialog: okay? Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
text: She hands him a wad of cash.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: How long's this whole thing gonna take?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don't know. Few days.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Thanks for helping me. I appreciate it.
text: He nods. She gets into her car. Before closing the door,
text: she turns back to him.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And I miss you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
text: She sees how mad she's made him. Takes a beat.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I treated you real bad, George. I know
dialog: that. But, my problem was -- I never been
dialog: with anyone who deserved better than that.
dialog: You're the first nice guy who ever liked me.
text: George softens, shifts. He steps toward the truck and gently
text: closes her door, so he's standing close to her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I just ... didn't know how to handle it.
dialog: That's all.
text: He thinks about this. Finally:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Think you could learn?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: You know me. I pick things up real fast.
text: He smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of
text: hair out of her eyes.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You shouldn't be driving around, you know.
dialog: You're sick.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah, but I'm gonna get better. A lot of
dialog: these folks aren't.
text: He nods, understanding. Then he taps the side of her truck
text: and turns toward the motel room. She puts the truck in gear
text: and pulls out.

scene_heading: EXT. DONNA'S NEW HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. DONNA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Erin is sitting with Pete and Donna.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I don't know, Erin -- the way he was talking
dialog: to us, telling us everything was gonna be
dialog: fine -- I just didn't trust him.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And after all we been through -- no jury, no
dialog: appeal. It just makes me nervous.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I understand all that. And I don't wanna
dialog: force you into anything. If you don't want
dialog: to sign, that's fine. But why don't we talk
dialog: it over a little, cause I'd sure hate for
dialog: you to turn this down for the wrong reasons.
scene_heading: EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The door opens. Erin emerges, holding two signed agreements.
text: Donna is letting her out.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You wouldn't happen to have a little time
dialog: right now, would you, Donna?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns
dialog: now. I was thinking -- Mandy really values
dialog: your opinion ...
scene_heading: INT. MANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

dialog: of plaintiffs.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY MART - EVENING
text: People are going about their shopping. Rita Daniels is

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's
dialog: gonna take years
scene_heading: INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT
text: The signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk.
text: Erin drops five more agreements into the "signed" box.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: In the wee hours. While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the
text: cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing,
dialog: alphabetizing.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON ERIN, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed
text: against the linoleum. There's some NOISE in the room,
text: WHISPERING. Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind
text: her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Real early. We're just gonna take your car
dialog: to get some breakfast.
text: Erin forces herself awake.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No, I need my car --
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We'll just be a minute. Get a little more
dialog: sleep.
text: He picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the
dialog: room to Matthew.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: C'mon, pal. Leave that alone, we gotta go.
text: Erin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay?
dialog: I got 'em all organized. Just put it back.
text: But he's reading it. And something has caught his attention.
text: He looks up at Erin.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: This girl's the same age as me.
text: Erin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to
dialog: shield him from the harsh realities of this case.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That's right, sweetheart.
text: She replaces the form on top of the stack.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: She's one of the sick people?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. She is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you know what? That's why I'm helping
dialog: her. So she can get some medicine to make
dialog: her feel better.
text: Matthew mulls this over a bit more.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: How come her own mom isn't helping her?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
text: Matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the
text: door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him.
text: Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast.
dialog: You want eggs?
text: She looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward
text: acceptance. Smiles, moved.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Eggs'd be great, baby. Eggs'd be perfect.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY
text: Erin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs
text: out of a take-out container with her fingers.
scene_heading: EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY
text: Morning. A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work. Erin's truck
text: pulls up. She grabs some release forms from the truck and
text: wanders up to the men.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hey, y'all. How you all doing today?
scene_heading: INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY
text: She tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack.
scene_heading: EXT. HINKLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

scene_heading: INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - DAY
text: Another day. Erin has set up shop here and is at a table

dialog: Mike! I been looking all over for you.
dialog: Come here, I wanna talk to you.
scene_heading: INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT
text: The signed stack is getting bigger.
scene_heading: INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY
dialog: And bigger.
scene_heading: INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY
dialog: And still bigger.
scene_heading: EXT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON ERIN'S TRUNK. A bunch more forms get thrown onto
text: the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned.
speaker_heading: ERIN (O.S.)
dialog: I'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to
dialog: some folks out there tonight.
text: WIDEN TO REVEAL Erin talking on a nearby pay phone.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (O.S.)
dialog: Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I will. Bye.
text: She hangs up. As she turns to get into her car, she finds
text: herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Jesus!
text: He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit.
text: She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Okay, what're you gonna do? You gonna kill
dialog: me? Dump my body in a ditch somewhere? Or
dialog: maybe you just wanna inject me with some
dialog: poison too -- why change tactics at this
dialog: stage of the game?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Get outta my way, you make me sick.
text: She pushes past him. But he grabs her by the arm. He's a
text: big guy; it's a strong grab. Now she's scared. For a
text: moment, he does nothing. Just looks at her. Then:
speaker_heading: DARK GLASSES
dialog: If PG&amp;E made someone destroy a whole lot of
dialog: documents -- would that matter to you?
text: Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him. She
text: gently pulls her arm away.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well ... I guess that depends on what the
dialog: documents were.
dialog: (she takes a beat)
dialog: I'm sorry -- I didn't get your name.
speaker_heading: DARK GLASSES
dialog: Embry. Charles Embry.
scene_heading: INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
text: Erin and Embry are the only patrons. Erin's eating a burger.
text: Embry has a beer. He's talking quietly, not looking at her.
speaker_heading: EMBRY
dialog: I was working in the compressor, and out of
dialog: nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the
dialog: office and says, we're gonna give you a
dialog: shredder machine, and send you on down to
dialog: the warehouse. We want you to get rid of
dialog: all the documents stored out there.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Did he say why?
speaker_heading: EMBRY
dialog: Nope. And I didn't ask.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Did you get a look at the stuff you
dialog: destroyed?
speaker_heading: EMBRY
dialog: Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding --
dialog: you gotta find some way to entertain your
dialog: mind. So yeah, I took a look.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And ...?
speaker_heading: EMBRY
dialog: There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation
dialog: schedules, the like.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But then there were a few memos about the
text: holding ponds. The water in them. They had
dialog: readings from test wells, stuff like that.
text: Erin tries to hide her excitement at this information.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And you were told to destroy those?
speaker_heading: EMBRY
dialog: That's right.
text: Destruction of evidence. Pretty big deal. Erin plays it
text: down. Wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer.
speaker_heading: EMBRY
dialog: Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good
dialog: employee.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: EMBRY
dialog: Well. There were a few documents that I
text: somehow didn't get around to shredding.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That I kept instead.
text: Erin stops, mid-bite.
scene_heading: INT. EMBRY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
text: He's dug out an inch-high stack of documents. Erin looks
text: them over, stunned. Embry is standing apart from her, hands
text: shoved deep in his pockets.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: How come you didn't say anything when you
dialog: found these things?
speaker_heading: EMBRY
dialog: At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some
dialog: of 'em want to go to college. I can't
dialog: afford to lose my job. I told myself I was
dialog: being honorable.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But there's nothing honorable in what I did.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe that's why they picked me for the job.
dialog: Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
text: Rosalind is at the desk. Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping
text: themselves to coffee. Erin enters, with a big box in her
dialog: arms and a whole lot of attitude.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hey, Ros, where are they?
speaker_heading: ROSALIND
dialog: In the conference --
text: But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can
text: finish. Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her
text: gait. They watch her with interest.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated
text: slew of paper that PG&amp;E is sending them. Ed, Kurt, Theresa,
text: Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them.
text: Erin breezes in like sunshine.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Morning!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Erin? What are you --
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: (ignoring Ed)
dialog: You know what, Mr. Potter? I completely
dialog: forgot your birthday this year. And seeing
dialog: as how you've been so good to me, I think
dialog: that is a terrible oversight. So what I
dialog: been doing over the last few days is I've
dialog: been putting together a present for you.
text: She plunks the box down on the table. Potter opens the top
text: of the box. Looks in.
speaker_heading: ERIN
text: 635. They all signed. Every single one.
text: IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering
text: what's up. A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads
text: across Ed's face.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ho - ly - shit.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed. I got a
dialog: little something for you, too.
text: Erin hands Ed a manila envelope. He opens it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Internal PG&amp;E documents, all about the
dialog: contamination. The one I like best says,
dialog: and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes,
dialog: the water's poisonous, but it'd be better
dialog: for all involved if this matter wasn't
dialog: discussed with the neighbors. It's to the
text: Hinkley station, from PG&amp;E Headquarters.
dialog: Stamped received, March, 1966.
text: Potter and Theresa reel. Ed shakes his head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: POTTER
dialog: Where did -- how did you do this?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, what with me not having any brains or
dialog: legal expertise, I just went on up there and
dialog: performed sexual favors. 635 blow jobs in
dialog: five days. Whew, am I ever tired.
text: And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed.
text: The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away.
scene_heading: EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads
text: down the hall. She presses the elevator button. The doors
text: open. As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey!
text: Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing. He
text: stares at her, in awe.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Say you were wrong.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I was wrong.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I did. Both.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on
dialog: Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe,
dialog: Erin. The luckiest son of a bitch in
dialog: history.
text: He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in
text: the elevator. He walks toward her, stops right outside the
dialog: elevator.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Cause you got a little voice in your head
dialog: saying, do the right thing. Give him
dialog: another chance.
text: Of course she will. She releases her hand so he won't see
text: her smiling. Ed watches the doors close.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PCH - DAY
text: One of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball.
text: Erin's Chevy moves up the PCH. DISCO music emanates from it.
scene_heading: INT. ERIN'S CHEVY - DAY
text: Erin's at the wheel. Time has passed -- her hair's a little
text: different. She's singing along with "Funky Town."
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a
text: little cluster. Donna's under an umbrella. Pete is
text: slathering on sunscreen. The two girls zip out toward the
text: water. Erin waves. Pete and Donna spot her, wave back.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - LATER
text: Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her
text: girls boogie board in. Erin comes up behind her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: How you feeling today?
text: Donna turns, sees her. Smiles.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: It's a good day. I feel good.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it,
dialog: maybe we should talk shop.
text: Erin sits down on a rock.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: The judge came up with a number.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: A number for the whole group, or for us?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Both.
text: Donna sits down next to her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: He's making them pay the maximum.
text: Tears of vindication spring to Donna's eyes.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Oh, my God.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: And he's making them give five million of it
dialog: to you all.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Five million dollars?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Five million dollars.
text: She reels. After a breathless beat:
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I don't even know how much money that is.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It's enough -- for whatever you need, for
dialog: whatever your girls need, for whatever your
dialog: girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
text: Donna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light
text: flickering off her girls playing in the surf.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I can put them in a good school.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Any school you want.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: And get someone to help around the house.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God.
text: Donna is overwhelmed. Erin pulls her close.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Oh, my God.
scene_heading: EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
dialog: Now this is where the hot lawyers work. A gleaming testament
dialog: to power.
scene_heading: INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE - DAY
text: Boxes everywhere. They just moved in. Everyone is unpacking
text: at his or her desk. Rosalind is manning the new phones.
speaker_heading: ROSALIND
dialog: Masry &amp; Vititoe, can I -- shoot!
text: She lost them. Her reaction indicates this isn't the first
text: time. The front doors open and Erin enters.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Hey, Ros. Nice view, huh?
speaker_heading: ROSALIND
dialog: Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Masry &amp; Vititoe, can I -- damn it.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Does anyone know anything about these
dialog: phones?
text: Erin heads on down a hall to:
scene_heading: INT. ED'S NEW OFFICE - DAY
text: A beautiful corner office. Ed is unpacking when Erin enters.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Careful you don't spit from here; you could
dialog: kill someone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You see your office?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah. Yours is nicer.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, okay. Here it comes.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Here what comes?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The extortion, the threats ...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I wasn't gonna --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: "I can always find someplace else to work.
dialog: Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give
dialog: me a view of the French Riviera ..."
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Ed, I swear, I'm not --
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay, fine. Fine You backed me into a
dialog: corner again. You're holding me hostage ...
text: He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a check. Hands
dialog: it to her.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Take it.
text: Erin does. Looks at it. Her eyes bug out.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Two million dollars?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The firm took in sixty. That's three
dialog: percent. Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
text: She stares at it, speechless. He goes back to unpacking
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, now I suppose you're gonna say it's not
dialog: enough. Well, tough, Erin. Too goddamn
dialog: bad. Cause this is absolutely, positively
dialog: where I draw the line.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
