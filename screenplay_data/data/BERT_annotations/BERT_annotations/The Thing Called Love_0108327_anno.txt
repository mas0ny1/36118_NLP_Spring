scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - DAY
text: A small New York City apartment, sparsely furnished. MIRANDA
text: PRESLEY, 21, sits on the floor amid moving boxes and suitcases
dialog: packing to move
text: out. She@s sorting through a stack of old record albums, looking
dialog: through them as she
text: piles them in a box. We catch sight of some relics from the disco
dialog: era as well as several
dialog: classic country albums - Donny Osmond and the @Saturday Night
dialog: Fever@® soundtrack
text: mixed in with Patsy Cline and Hank Williams and Elvis. After a
text: brief look, she piles
text: them in a box and closes the lid. She looks outside her window
dialog: and sees the sun
text: coming up; she@s been up all night.
text: Miranda goes over to the window and opens it. It@s barely light
dialog: out, but already the
text: sound of someone@s radio filters in. We hear a car alarm going off
text: in the distance.
text: Miranda drags a large, full trash bag over to the window, looks
text: down, and heaves it
dialog: out.
scene_heading: EXT. MIRANDA@S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: The trash bag falls from a fifth-floor window and into a dumpster
text: overflowing with
text: about ten huge trash bags; Miranda@s thrown out a lot of stuff.
dialog: The garbage truck
text: arrives just as the bag lands in the dumpster.
scene_heading: EXT. MIRANDA@S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: The sun@s all the way up now. It@s a bright June morning. Two
text: teenage boys sit on the
text: stoop next to Miranda@s building. They have a boom box, and we
dialog: hear loud street
text: music. Miranda comes out of her building carrying a moving box.
text: She wears Levi@s cut
text: off mid-thigh, sneakers, and a black leather jacket over a white y-
text: shirt. She carries the
text: box down the front steps and drops it on a pile on the sidewalk in
text: front of a waiting cab.
text: The cab driver just leans against his car, watching her work.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You know what would be great? If you
text: could just stand there, watching me carry
dialog: all these boxes out by myself. Don@t
dialog: carry out any yourself, don@t hold the
dialog: door for me, and whatever you do, don@t
dialog: put them in your cab. And if you could
text: possible start the meter running now.
text: She leans over and peers into the cab. The meter@s running. She
text: smiles at the cab
text: driver, who doesn@t seem to understand English.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Perfect. Good job. Thank you.
text: She gives him a thumbs up. He smiles and gives her one back.
dialog: She goes back for
dialog: another box
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: We see the cab parked in from of a luxury high-rise apartment
text: building. The cab driver
text: leans again the car, waiting.
scene_heading: INT. ELLEN DALY@S APARTMENT - DAY
text: A large, expensively furnished apartment. Miranda@s boxes are
text: piled in the hallway.
text: ELLEN DALY, 43, and immaculately dressed socialite, looks with
dialog: mild distaste at the
text: boxes cluttering her hallway.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I just never imagined there would be this much, Miranda.
text: Miranda stands in the living room, looking at pictures of Ellen and
dialog: a family that doesn@t
text: include Miranda - a respectable, clean-cut husband and two perfect
dialog: little boys. There is
text: one small picture of Miranda; she looks like she@s still in high
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You should see how much I threw out.
text: Ellen walks in and sits on the couch. She sits formally; she
dialog: doesn@t exactly radiate
text: warmth. Miranda turns away from the photos.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: You can ship them to me as soon as I get
text: an apartment.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Maybe I should keep them in storage until
dialog: you come back.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m not coming back.
text: Ellen looks at her like she doesn@t believe her, but she@ll go
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Mom, I told you, I@m moving.
text: Ellen occupies her hands by compulsively straightening the books on
text: her coffee table,
dialog: which were already pretty straight.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Saying you@re going to do something and
dialog: actually doing it are two entirely
dialog: different things. I hate to see you give
dialog: up everything to go and pursue this
dialog: fantasy you have about being a... . country
dialog: singer. Have you taken a moment to stop
dialog: and look at your behavior?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@11 do it on the bus, O.K.?
text: Ellen assumes the role of the voice of reason.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I know you father made Nashville sound
dialog: very romantic. I wish he were here now to
dialog: see you acting this way. He could tell
dialog: you how difficult it is.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That@s not what he@d tell me.
dialog: (sadly, remembering)
dialog: Daddy would tell me I can anything in
dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Yes, he probably would, but in the real
dialog: world, the chances of making it are a
dialog: million to one.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How can I pass up a one in a million
dialog: opportunity?
text: She smiles. Ellen doesn@t.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: I don@t expect you to understand why I
dialog: have to do this. I just want you to send
dialog: me my stuff.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: I really think you should think about this
dialog: for a few days.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (determined)
dialog: I@ve been thinking about it my whole life.
dialog: It@s time for me to do it.
text: Miranda@s saying this more for her own benefit; her mother doesn@t
text: seem to be listening.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
text: I have to go. My cab is waiting.
text: She goes to her mother and kisses her on the cheek.
scene_heading: APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Miranda comes out of the building and crosses the sidewalk to the
text: cab. She talks to the
text: driver, not expecting him to understand
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: My mother thinks she can control my life.
text: Surprisingly, the driver speaks, with a heavy foreign accent.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: She stills sees you as a little girl.
text: Miranda looks only mildly surprised that the driver has understood
dialog: everything she has
text: said. She gets in the cab.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: We hear a simple country ballad. A Greyhound bus travels through
dialog: the mountains.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - DAY
text: Miranda sits in a window seat, asleep, resting her head against
text: her jacket.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT
text: Miranda@s in the same seat, awake now, staring out the window into
text: the darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: The bus is making a rest stop. (We see that the destination sign
dialog: reads @Nashville@.)
text: Passengers walk around, stretching their legs. Miranda leans
text: against a wall, checking
text: her watch, impatient.
scene_heading: INT. NASHVILLE GREYHOUND STATION - DAY
text: We still hear the country music. Miranda comes into the terminal,
text: carrying a huge
text: suitcase and a guitar. She squints at the light, reaches into her
text: jacket pocket, pulls out
text: her sunglasses and puts them on. She looks around. Aman ina
text: cowboy hat sits on a
text: bench. He gives Miranda a friendly smile and an almost tip of the
text: hat. She looks at
text: him like she@®s trying to figure out what species he is and drags
text: her stuff outside.
scene_heading: EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - DAY
text: Miranda looks around and spots a taxi across the street. She puts
dialog: her index and middle
text: fingers inside her mouth of whistles. Everyone within earshot
text: turns and looks at her.
text: The taxi driver looks up from his newspaper.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - DAY
text: Miranda gets in the back of the cab. The driver closes the trunk
text: and gets in front.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Where to?
text: Miranda hands him a newspaper clipping.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Do you know where this is? Lucy@s Caf@?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: They@d have to take away my license if I
dialog: didn@t.
text: He starts to drive.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
text: Close on a guitar case. Then another, and another, separated by
text: a row of blue-jeaned
text: knees and cowboy boots.
text: Now we see faces, some young, some not-so-young, some hopeful,
text: some weary. All
text: are patient, lined up against a brick wall, an incongruous sight
dialog: at any mini-mall but this
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: O.K. Listen up. Gentlemen, ladies.
text: Everyone in line quiets down. They turn their attention to LUCY
dialog: JENKINS, 30@s, the
dialog: owner of Lucy@s Caf@.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: As you go in, make sure you take an
dialog: application. No one tries out without
dialog: filling one of these out. Hurry it up,
text: doors close at 3:05. Anyone not inside
text: by 3:05 gets locked out.
text: Lucy goes back inside. The line files in.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - DAY
text: The driver turns to talk to Miranda.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: You a songwriter?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Lucky for you. Town@s full of them. 1@n
dialog: a songwriter myself.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m a singer.
text: The driver reacts to this silently; she@s not lucky after all.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ -DAY
text: A cozy restaurant with small tables, country music memorabilia on
text: the walls, and a
text: small stage.
text: Lucy stand on the stage with a stack of completed applications in
text: her hand.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Thank you all for coming today. When I
dialog: call your name, come right up on stage.
dialog: Pretend like you@re in a hurry, we got all
dialog: day but there@s a lot of people want to be
dialog: famous here. If it@s your first time
dialog: here, you should know: if you don@t pass,
dialog: it just means I don@t think you@re ready.
dialog: Go home and keep at it and come back
dialog: again. Don@t give up unless you can@t
dialog: stand to listen to your own material. All
dialog: right, let@s get to it.
text: Lucy looks at the first application.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT@D)
dialog: Cash Wilneck, get on up here.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - DAY
text: The driver hands the clipping back to Miranda. She takes it, then
text: moves her hand in the
text: air over the back of the driver@s seat.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Where@s the safety glass?
text: He glances over his shoulder at her; what safety glass?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: I could shoot you if I wanted.
text: This is an observation, not a threat.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Appreciate it if you didn@t.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - DAY
text: A young man takes the stage, sits on the stool and begins singing
dialog: a mediocre country
text: ballad, slightly out of tune.
scene_heading: EXT. LUCY@S CAF@ - DAY
text: Miranda, carrying her guitar in one hand and her suitcase in the
dialog: other, gets out of the
text: cab and heads for the entrance of Lucy@s
text: At the same time, JAMES WYNN, 23, gets out of his pick-up truck in
dialog: Lucy@s parking
text: lot. James is good-looking in a somewhat dangerous way. He
text: picks up his guitar case
text: and strides over to Lucy@s, getting there just before Miranda. He
text: tries the door. It@s
dialog: locked.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It@s locked?
text: James looks at her, the way she@s dressed, the huge suitcase she
text: carries. He looks
dialog: amused.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Was your bus late?
text: She gives him the same attitude back.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: As a matter of fact
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Well, it@s a long way from... New York
dialog: City.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes it is. Who are you? The psychic
dialog: welcoming committee?
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: James Wynn. The door is locked.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Miranda Presley. T@11l just knock.
text: She goes up to the door.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No, don@t. Lucy doesn@t let anyone in
dialog: late. That@ll set me back a month. We@ll
dialog: have to get in some other way.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m sure there@s a secret underground
dialog: tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - DAY
text: Another young songwriter auditions. This one plays the fiddle and
dialog: has a friend backing
text: him up on guitar. He@s energetic, but the song isn@t very good.
text: Lucy sits in the back of the crowded room. She reveals no
text: expression as she watches
text: the songwriter, but we see her head shake @no@® slightly as she
text: makes a notation on his
text: application and places it in what is presumably the reject pile
scene_heading: EXT. LUCY@S CAF@® - DAY
text: Miranda sits on the sidewalk outside the caf@. James locks her
text: suitcase in his truck and
text: comes and sits down next to her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe someone will come out.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: There@1ll be a lot of people coming out in
text: about two hours.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Did I mention that I can vaporize myself
dialog: like @I Dream of Jeannie@?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: A lot of good that does me.
text: They sit there a moment.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: I have an idea. Let@s knock.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It@s true. Everyone is slower down here.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - DAY
text: Onstage, a woman with teased blond hair, fringed cowboy shirt,
text: and matching white
text: cowboy hat and boots, stands with her guitar, dancing around as
text: she sings off-key.
scene_heading: EXT. LUCY@S CAF@® - DAY
text: Miranda knocks quietly on the door. No answer. She knocks a
text: little louder. The
text: door opens. She gives James a look. A face appears from inside;
dialog: it belongs to
text: LINDA LUE LINDEN, 20, a sweetly attractive Southern belle. She
text: puts her finger to
text: her lips and lets them in.
text: The blond woman finishes and steps off the stage. Lucy calls out
dialog: the next name.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Nick Reynolds.
text: NICK REYNOLDS, early 30@s, gets up to and goes to the stage.
dialog: James and Miranda
text: sit down with Linda Lue at a table near the door. Linda Lue finds
dialog: some blank
text: applications on the next table and hands them to James and Miranda.
text: Nick takes the stage. He wears a baseball cap with a trucking
text: company logo. He sits
text: at the microphone and addresses the room.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hi, I@m Nick Reynolds. I@m from Memphis,
dialog: originally. This one@s called @Shoot me
dialog: up, run me down, take me back,@ and it@s
dialog: dedicated to you, Lucy.
text: Lucy seems unmoved by the sentiment. A few auditioners smile
text: knowingly. Nick
text: starts to play. He seemed like a pretty soft-spoken guy up till
dialog: now, but he was
text: apparently saving his personality for his performance. The song
dialog: is humorous, about
text: cartoonishly extreme devotions to a woman who won@t pay him any
dialog: attention. Nick@®s
text: fellow musicians are a good audience, laughing in the appropriate
dialog: places.
text: Lucy doesn@t laugh at the song; she matter-of-factly moves Nick@s
dialog: application into the
dialog: @yes@ pile.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: LUCY (0O.S.)
text: Next. Linda Lue Linden.
text: We see Lucy look up, amused.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT@D)
dialog: Goodness, honey, is that your name?
text: Linda Lue hurries toward the stage.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I@m afraid so.
text: (smiling, into the microphone)
dialog: Hi, I@m Linda Lue, from Briar Hill,
dialog: Alabama. I jut finished this one, it@s
dialog: called @Heaven knocked on my door.@
text: Linda Lue starts her song; she has a sweet voice, but it@s weak.
dialog: Her song is cute,
dialog: using silly metaphors. She@s not awful, but she@s not especially
dialog: good, either.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Onstage, a young singer, eyes closed beneath his cowboy hat, sings
text: a heartfelt ballad.
text: He@s pretty good. While he@s performing, James takes his and
dialog: Miranda@s completed
text: applications over to Lucy@s table. He presents them confidently,
dialog: as if he has no doubt
text: she@ll accept them. Lucy raises any eyebrow at him, but takes the
dialog: applications.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: KYLE DAVIDSON, 22, sits on the stool. He@s clean cut, wearing
text: jeans and boots, but
text: no hat. He looks a little jumpy.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I@m, um, Kyle Davidson. I@m from Texas.
dialog: (laughs nervously)
dialog: I@m a little nervous, but it doesn@t
dialog: really show.
text: Kyle clears his throat and stares at the floor.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: This song is called @Blue and Blue.®
text: Kyle seems to be more than just a little nervous; he barely
text: manages to raise his head
text: high enough to sing into the mike. He sings without confidence,
text: his voice cracking.
dialog: The songs sounds like it might actually be good if he wasn@t
text: butchering it. Lucy stares
text: at Kyle, deep in thought, holding his application. Miranda watches
text: him too, listening
text: closely to his song.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Lucy@s down to the last two applications. She calls James@ name
text: out, an edge in her
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: James Wynn
text: James gets up and picks up his guitar. He strides up and sits on
text: the stool. He looks
text: straight out at the audience and introduces himself. His stage
dialog: manner is folksy.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Howdy. James Wynn, from Austin, Texas. I
dialog: call this one @Friends no more.®
text: He strums the guitar and starts to sing. His voice is strong,
dialog: and he@s a charismatic
text: performer. His song is great too (a ballad, e.g. @lIt Only Hurts
dialog: Me When I Cry@). The
text: audience is drawn into his performance.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Lucy holds the last application.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Miranda Presley, looks like you get to be
dialog: the fat lady.
text: Miranda takes the stage. She looks good. Not too nervous.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hi, I@m Miranda Presley from New York
dialog: City.
text: She starts to play. She didn@t mention the name of her song, but
dialog: that@s all right because
dialog: we already know this song. It@s @Desperado. Miranda closes
text: her eyes as she starts
dialog: the lyrics
text: She has a beautiful voice, very distinctive, and the song
dialog: sounds great. Just as she
text: finishes the first verse, we hear:
speaker_heading: LUCY (0O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me. Excuse me. Miranda? Honey,
dialog: do you have another song?
text: Miranda smiles, rolling with the punches.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Sure. I know lots of songs. What do you
dialog: want to hear?
speaker_heading: LUCY (0O.S.)
dialog: Try something I haven@t heard before. A
dialog: Miranda Presley composition, maybe. This
dialog: ain@t @Star Search®.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Oh. Well, I don@t have anything right
dialog: now.
text: Lucy picks up her pile of applications and approaches the stage.
text: Auditions are over.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well, come on back when you do, 0O.K.?
text: Miranda hops off the stage, spirit intact.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Sure thing.
text: Lucy shakes her head in wonder at the girl and walks up to the
text: microphone.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Now. I@m going to read off the names of
dialog: the people who passed for next month@s
dialog: performances. If I read your name, come
dialog: see me to sign up for which night you want
text: to play. Nancy Butterworth, Nick
dialog: Reynolds, Tom Mortenson, Ricky Hogan,
dialog: James Wynn.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: James and Miranda stand next to his truck. He opens the passenger
text: door and takes out
text: her suitcase. He sets it on the ground. She looks disappointed;
dialog: she doesn@t know
dialog: where she@s going to go now.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You want a lift somewhere?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why, I would be much obliges if you would
dialog: convey me in this Glen Campbell Hee-Haw
text: pick-up truck.
text: James picks up the suitcase and tosses it in the back of the truck.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Just so you know, I@m not taking this
dialog: personally, these little jabs and put-
text: downs about what a yee-haw hillbilly town
dialog: you have landed your cosmopolitan self in.
dialog: Where are you staying?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I haven@t decided.
text: Miranda sees Linda Lue crossing the parking lot next to her car and
text: calls to her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Linda Lue Linden.
text: Linda Lue turns around. She looks pleased to be noticed, and
text: comes over.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Thanks for sneaking us in.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Oh, you@re welcome. I don@t normally
dialog: flaunt the rules, but my little voice told
dialog: me I should open that door. And I do
dialog: believe it was right.
dialog: (to James)
dialog: You were real good. You got a lot of
dialog: presence up there. Some people, they sing
dialog: real good, but they got no presence, you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Thanks.
text: One of the singers approaches; his truck is parked next to James®.
dialog: We recognize him as
text: Kyle, the one with stage fright. He notices James.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: James, right? Kyle Davidson.
text: They shake hands
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: Nice job tonight. First time?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (nods)
dialog: First week in town.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to Kyle)
dialog: Did you make it?
text: He seems a little startled by her directness.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Too bad. I liked your song.
text: He looks at her skeptically; is she making fun of him?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah, I liked yours too. Always have.
text: She laughs, then starts to sing Kyle@s song a cappella. If we
dialog: didn@t know it before, we
text: now know it@s a beautiful song. She sings just the first verse
text: and stops. Kyle stares at
text: her, drawn into her singing, hearing his song the way it should
dialog: be. Even after she
text: stops, he stares at her. Finally, he grins.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That@s it exactly. How did you know that?
text: Miranda doesn@t see what he@s so excited about.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: All I did was sing it on key.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Are you going to Red@s? A bunch of us are
dialog: going to Red@s. For a beer.
text: Kyle looks like it@s important to him that she goes.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: That sounds like fun.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to James)
dialog: Are you going?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to Kyle)
dialog: See you there.
scene_heading: INT. REDS BAR - NIGHT
text: Miranda, James, Kyle and Linda Lue sit together at a table. We
dialog: see quite a few familiar
text: faces from Lucy@s audition at surrounding tables. Everyone has a
dialog: bottle of beer except
text: for Linda Lue, who drinks a Shirley Temple.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to Linda Lue)
dialog: Don@t even tell me; you have least.
dialog: three relatives who have died of
dialog: consumption.
text: Linda Lue seems pleased with Miranda@s accuracy.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Well, it@s four if you count Eddie. He
dialog: was my mother@s second cousin on her
text: mother@s side. He was found at the bottom
text: of my inflatable play pool. I found him,
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (Whispering, to James)
dialog: The bottom of the pool?
text: Linda Lue goes on cheerfully, oblivious of the stunned reaction.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I noticed you have your suitcase. Do you
dialog: have a place to stay?
text: Miranda just looks at her.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@D)
dialog: I have a real cute motel room, with two
text: beds. There@s even a pool, shaped like a
dialog: guitar. We could share it.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (To Miranda, pointedly)
text: She has a pool.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@ve known me fifteen minutes and you
dialog: want me to move in? I could be a serial
dialog: killer, for all you know.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Oh, I can see that you@re not. I@m an
dialog: excellent judge of character. I@ve got a
text: touch of the power.
text: Miranda doesn@t want to ask what the power is.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: My grandmother can tell when a tornado is
text: coming, a week in advance.
text: Linda Lue nods; she knows exactly what he means.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Some things are beyond our comprehension.
dialog: (to Kyle)
dialog: Let me see your palm.
text: He gives it to her.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
dialog: Now you, you got a real strong heart line,
dialog: see it here.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Is that good?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Well, sure, but it can also be a little
dialog: dangerous. My cousin Lester, he had a
text: similar heart line, and he threw himself
text: in front of a speeding train in the name
dialog: of love.
text: Miranda smirks.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: My cousin Leon did the very same thing.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Isn@t that a coincidence. You want me to
dialog: do yours?
text: Linda Lue reaches for Miranda@s hand. Miranda drops the parasol
text: and lets her have it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If I1@m going to meet with a bizarre
dialog: premature death, I@d just as soon not know
dialog: about it
text: Linda Lue looks up from Miranda@s palm and answers her gravely.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: All right.
dialog: (looking at Miranda@s hand)
dialog: Oh, well I envy you this life line.
dialog: You@re going to make your mark. People
dialog: will remember you when you@re gone.
text: Miranda pulls her hand back.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@D)
dialog: I@m not saying it@1ll be soon. Don@t you
dialog: want me to read your heart line?
text: Miranda doesn@t offer her hand.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. Thanks.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Hey, let me see your heart line.
text: Miranda holds out her hand. James pretends to examine it.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: You will remain unmarried until the age of
dialog: 60 . . . at which time you will wed a series
dialog: of men with one common characteristic.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Namely?
text: He squints at her palm.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: They will all be named Bubba. Sometimes
dialog: it will be a nickname, or a middle name.
text: Miranda carefully extracts her hand from James@®. He looks at her
text: suggestively, as if
text: she@s fighting the impulse to jump him. She answers with a @get
dialog: real@ look.
text: The music on the jukebox has stopped. Miranda reaches for her
text: guitar. She starts to
text: play a song. James watches her, hears the opening chords, and
text: reaches for his guitar.
text: James starts playing the same song as Miranda, @I don@t know why
dialog: you don@t want
text: me.@ Miranda begins to sing.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (singing)
dialog: It@s the right time, and though I feel
dialog: fine tonight.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (singing)
dialog: I don@t know why you don@t want me
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (singing)
dialog: It@s the right place, IZ@ve got the new
dialog: face tonight.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (singing)
dialog: I don@t know why you don@t want me.
text: Kyle and Linda Lue join in. Soon the other hopefuls from the
dialog: audition are singing
text: along, commiserating abut their rejection.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Linda Lue has apparently had a hand in the decorating of this room;
dialog: it@s hard to believe
text: the motel provided matching floral chintz drapes, bedspreads, and
dialog: pillows, or a framed
text: photo of Loretta Lynn. Linda Lue@s dog, of the tiny furry white
text: variety, sits on his
text: own floral pillow. Miranda throws her suitcase on one of the beds.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: You can have either bed. I@ve been using
dialog: this one
text: She points to the one Miranda has not chosen.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@D)
dialog: but you can take whichever you want.
text: Miranda leaves her suitcase where it is and looks around. There
text: are several stacks of
text: Bibles in the room. She lifts the cover of one, verifying what
text: it is, and decides not to
dialog: deal with this information.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Is this the extra, the Loretta Lynn suite?
text: She flops down on the bed, her eyes closed. Linda Lue@s dog
text: comes over and sniffs
text: Miranda, then settles in next to her. Miranda opens her eyes,
text: sees the dog, and closes
text: them again. The phone rings. Linda Lue picks it up.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello? Hi, Mama. . . Well, I just got in
dialog: this second, Mama. . . Things are real
dialog: good.
text: Linda Lue sits up straight, her right hand flat on her bed.
text: Without looking down, she
text: crosses her fingers, first on her right hand, then on her left
text: the one holding the phone.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: I passed my audition.
text: Miranda@s eyes open; she tilts her head back and looks at Linda
text: Lue upside down.
text: She@s surprised at the lie but, then again, she really doesn@t
dialog: give a shit. Miranda gets
text: up and opens her suitcase. She takes out a pair of jeans.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
dialog: Well, I was waiting for you take a
dialog: breath, Mama, so I could get a word in.
dialog: Yeah, just like Loretta.
text: Linda Lue rolls her eyes at Miranda, who@s changing into the jeans.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
text: Only prettier.
text: Miranda smiles. She pulls a black leather-bound notebook out of
text: her suitcase and picks
text: up her guitar. Linda Lue covers the mouthpiece with her hand.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
dialog: Are you going somewhere?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m just going to go to that coffee shop
text: across the street.
text: She takes her motel room key off the table and puts it on a chain
text: around her neck, next
text: to several other keys and a locket.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: But it@s late. Don@t you want to go to
dialog: bed?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m not tired. I@11l be quiet when I come
dialog: in.
text: Linda Lue is perplexed.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Well, all right. I@11 be seeing you.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Goodnight, Scarlett.
text: Miranda leaves.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I@m listening, Mama. Who died? Well,
dialog: what was it that killed him?
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
text: Miranda is settled into a booth, a full cup of coffee in front of
text: her, circling classifieds in
text: a newspaper. She doesn@t seem to be finding too much. Linda Lue
text: enters the coffee
text: shop, wearing a frilly pink robe over flowered pajamas with feet
dialog: and furry bedroom
text: slippers. Her hair is pulled back with a pink band. She looks
text: like an exceptionally tall
text: five-year-old. She spots Miranda and pads over to her table.
text: Miranda looks at her and
text: puts down her paper.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Did I remember to give the spare room
dialog: key?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Annette, I@ve got a hot tip that Frankie
dialog: and his friends are going to crash your
dialog: slumber party. You don@t want to miss
dialog: that.
text: Linda Lue sits down across from her.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Do you hate me?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How could anyone possibly hate you?
dialog: You@re Miss Congeniality.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I was hoping we could be great friends.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t know if that@s such a fabulous
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Why not?
text: Miranda glances down at Linda Lue@s foot, which sticks out from
text: under the table.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Your pajamas have feet.
text: Linda Lue waits for an answer.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Look, I came here to be alone. Nothing
dialog: personal.
text: Linda Lue looks hurt. Miranda smiles at her kindly.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Nothing personal. I swear. Cross my
dialog: heart.
text: Linda Lue draws herself up and speaks with conviction.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Some people aren@t exactly the people you
dialog: they are when you first meet
dialog: someone.
text: She gets up and pads out of the coffee shop. Miranda watcher her
dialog: go.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
text: The sun@s just coming up. Miranda@s still in her booth, her
text: head resting on her arm,
text: asleep. The waitress comes up with a pot of coffee and touches
text: her on the arm.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: More coffee, honey?
text: Miranda looks up, then out the window, squinting at the sun.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No, thanks.
text: The waitress leaves. Miranda puts a couple dollars on the table,
text: picks up her stuff, and
dialog: leaves.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Miranda enters the darkened motel room. The mess she left has
dialog: been cleaned up;
text: apparently Linda Lue unpacked for her. Miranda pulls off her
text: jeans, removes her bra
text: without taking off her t-shirt, and crawls into bed.
text: Meanwhile, in the other bed, Linda Lue opens her eyes, sees
text: Miranda, and stretches.
text: She gets out of bed, picks up her robe and goes to the bathroom.
text: The dog jumps off
text: Linda Lue@s bed and goes to sleep with Miranda.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Miranda@s still in bed, asleep. The air conditioner hums.
text: There@s a knock on the door.
text: Miranda reaches for the clock; it@s 3:10. She gets out of bed and
text: walks over to the
text: dresser. She opens a drawer, finds a pair of boxer shorts and
text: puts them on.
text: Another knock.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Who@s here at this ungodly hour?
text: She opens the door. It@s Kyle, holding his guitar. She looks
text: out at him sleepily, her
text: hair a mess, pillow marks on her face. The dog stands at her
text: feet.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hi. You look good.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What are you, getting ready to go out?
text: The dog growls at Kyle.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m thinking there@s some reason you@re
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I just saw Linda Lue. She said you@d be
text: asleep.
text: He looks at the dog, who continues a low growl.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Thanks. Let me know if she says anything else.
text: She starts to close the door.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Wait. I wanted to ask you something.
text: She open the door again. The dog steps up the growl.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: Is that your dog?
text: She looks at him; of course it@s not her dog.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: That@s not my question. Will you help me
dialog: with my singing?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Is that your question?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That@s it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: O.K.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Now?
text: She nods, tolerant of his excitement.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: Great. I@11 even make you dinner.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Give me a minute.
text: She closes the door. The dog stops growling.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOF - DUSK
text: Kyle and Miranda sit in beach chairs on the roof of his apartment
dialog: building, with their
text: guitars. There@s a grill next to Kyle; he@s barbequeing
dialog: something for dinner.
text: Kyle@s finishing up a song, a beautiful ballad (e.g. @Keep me
dialog: from blowing away@).
text: His voice is tentative, and he watches his fingers as he plays.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: All right. Now start the song again, but
dialog: instead of singing, tell me about your
dialog: guitar.
text: Kyle starts to strum the chords to the song.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What do you want to know about it?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t know, some kind of amusing
dialog: anecdote about how your daddy traded a pig
dialog: for it, or the ghost of Hank Williams Sr.
dialog: Left it on your front porch.
text: Kyle has started to watch his fingers again. He looks up,
text: decides not to let her get to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: My mom gave me this guitar. She said she
dialog: could tell I had a lot of creative energy.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What about your dad?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don@t know, what about him?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Anything. Keep playing.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: The first time I came to Nashville, I was
dialog: here four months before I ran out of money
dialog: and had to turn around and come back home.
dialog: I thought he@d want me to give it up,
dialog: since I hadn@t made it. But he just put
dialog: me back to work on the ranch. Said he
dialog: could use me until I was ready to give it
dialog: another go.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Letting life teach you its own lessons,
dialog: realizing your dreams weren@t the same as
dialog: his dreams.
text: Kyle laughs.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Stop me if you@ve heard my life story
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I saw that episode of Gunsmoke. Anyway,
dialog: the important thing is you@re playing the
dialog: guitar without looking at your fingers.
text: He stops playing.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Of course I don@t have to watch my
dialog: fingers. It@s part of my style.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Well, don@t do it anymore. Now, look at
dialog: me and sing some of the words.
text: Kyle starts to play again, looking Miranda in the eye. He stops,
dialog: and starts the song
text: over. He opens his mouth, then shuts it again. Finally, he
text: stops playing.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I can@t do it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It@s personal. It@s part of me. You and
dialog: me, here alone, my singing to you is
text: practically like stripping down naked.
text: Miranda raises her eyebrows, as if he might actually disrobe.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: Isn@t it like that for you, singing one of
dialog: your songs?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It seems to me that this is a rather
dialog: serious handicap for an aspiring
dialog: performer.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don@t want to be a performer. I@d have
dialog: to be insane to think I could ever make a
dialog: dime with this voice.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I thought you wanted to learn to sing.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I do. So I can sing on writer@s night. I
dialog: can@t get my songs recorded if nobody
text: hears them.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Is that the only way to get them heard?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I@ve done about a hundred demos, me songs
text: with other singers. Vince Gill put a song
dialog: of mine on hold last summer, was thinking
dialog: about putting it on his new album, but he
dialog: didn@t end up cutting it.
text: Miranda picks up her guitar.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Well, maybe if you see yourself as an
dialog: actor, like it@s not really you. Play the
text: part in the song.
text: She starts to strum a few chords. She looks Kyle in the eye as
text: she sings, acting as if
text: the words were meant for him. The sun is setting behind her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (singing)
dialog: I loved you yesterday
dialog: And I love you just the same
dialog: And none of the things you do
dialog: Could tear us apart
dialog: I loved you yesterday
dialog: And I love you just the same
dialog: When I gave myself to you
dialog: You took only my heart
text: She puts the guitar down. Kyle fell for the act; he
text: slightly lovestruck.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That@s nice. You write that?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (shakes her head no)
dialog: Lyle Lovett. He@s my favorite.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You@re not proving your point until you
dialog: play me one of your songs.
text: He gets up to check on the barbeque.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: One of what?
text: She smiles at him; she doesn@t have any songs.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You haven@t written any songs?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@re a songwriter. I@m a singer.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You just haven@t written any songs yet.
dialog: Nobody moves from New York to Nashville to
dialog: be a singer.
dialog: looks
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Nobody but me.
text: Kyle shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Country music@s all about the words,
dialog: having something to say. You wouldn@t be
dialog: here if you didn@t have those words inside
dialog: you. You just haven@t let them out yet.
text: Miranda considers the potential truth of this.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m the one who dropped my entire life and
dialog: moved someplace I@ve never even visited
dialog: before. I should get to figure out why
dialog: the hell I did it.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
text: Miranda sits at the same table as the day before, a cup of coffee
text: in front of her. She@s
text: been sleeping; she raises her head from where it was resting on
text: her arm and squints at
text: the daylight. She sticks a finger in her coffee; it@s cold. She
dialog: gets our of her both.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Miranda comes in and gets ready for bed. Linda Lue isn@t in her
text: bed. We hear water
text: running, then singing as she finishes her shower. The dog jumps
text: into Miranda@s bed.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hey, Buster.
text: Linda Lue comes out of the bathroom. She@s cheerful, a morning
text: person. She seems
text: a little hesitant about Miranda; she@s not sure if they@re
dialog: fighting.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: His name ain@t Buster.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Mr. Dog.
text: Linda Lue says this as if it@®s a perfectly normal name. Miranda
text: pulls on boxer shorts.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How do you know his first name isn@t
dialog: Buster?
text: Linda Lue thinks. Miranda picks up the dog, puts him on a
text: different part of the bed,
text: and gets in.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Well, he would have told me. We discuss
dialog: practically everything.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Did you unpack my stuff?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I put your t-shirts in the second drawer,
dialog: your underthings are in the top drawer,
dialog: and pretty much everything else is in the
text: closet, light to dark.
text: Miranda looks at her disbelievingly; Linda Lue gets nervous.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
text: Left to right. There was a lot of black.
dialog: I guess you know that. I can@t wear
dialog: black, it just washes me out. You ain@t
dialog: mad, are you?
text: She doesn@t seem the least bit mad.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Where are my tapes?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: There, in the night table. You are mad.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I was thinking about what you said in the
dialog: coffee shop.
text: Linda Lue sits at the foot of the bed, her tone apologetic.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I@m trying to be more forthcoming.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Well, then let me ask you something.
text: Linda Lue nods.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Don@t most motel rooms have one Bible?
text: Linda Lue hops up and takes a Bible from one of the piles.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I made these myself. I work at the Praise
dialog: The Lord print company.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You didn@t steal these.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Oh, lord no. These are all misprints.
text: (picks one up, pages through it)
dialog: This one has Chapter Four from Yogi Berra@s
text: autobiography right in the middle of Revelations.
text: Jesus comes back and says (CONT@D)
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
dialog: @lt ain@t over till it@s over.@ We
dialog: couldn@t ship it that way. People might
dialog: think Jesus had already come back, and
dialog: he@s been Yogi Berra all along.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@re making this up.
text: Linda Lue nods.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Did you think it was funny?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yes, I thought it was funny.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: These really are misprints, they@re just
dialog: mostly upside down, though. But here@s a
dialog: booklet that@s supposed to be on how to
dialog: accept Jesus Christ as your lord and
dialog: savior, and see, it@s all recipes for fun
dialog: desserts you can make with Cool Whip. I
dialog: didn@t make that up, swear to God.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m going to have to remember not to swear
dialog: to anything in this room.
scene_heading: INT. MUSIC ROW OFFICE - DAY
text: Miranda, holding her guitar case, stands in front of the

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I@m sorry, he doesn@t see anyone without
dialog: an appointment.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: O.K. Let@s make a appointment, then.
dialog: Wednesday is good for me.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: You realize I go through this eleven times
dialog: a day. I don@t let anyone slip through.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Ever? Not even like a really cute guy?
text: The receptionist smiles and holds out her left hand, revealing her
dialog: wedding ring.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: That@s how I met my husband. I@m afraid
dialog: I@m going to have to tell you what I tell
dialog: everyone: when you@re rich and famous,
dialog: you can look back on this and thank God
dialog: people like me no longer have any control
dialog: over you life.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MONTAGE of shots of Miranda trying to get past the front office at

text: shakes her head no firmly.
text: A receptionist pulls out a large cardboard box and shows it to
dialog: Miranda; we see that it@s
text: filled to overflowing with tapes.
text: Miranda open the door at another company and finds a four-piece
dialog: band auditioning for
text: an expressionless receptionist in the waiting area. Miranda turns
dialog: to leave, hoping she
dialog: doesn@t look as ridiculous as that.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF® - NIGHT
text: The place is about half-full; the show hasn@t started yet.
text: Miranda, Linda Lue, Kyle, and James share a table near the stage.
speaker_heading: MIRDANDA
dialog: So he told me to come back after they

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You didn@t say that.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA

speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Don@t we have a waitress?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: (to James)
dialog: Now, don@t you be nervous. You@re going
dialog: to be just fine. You get a case of the
dialog: nerves, you arteries can explode. You
dialog: could look healthy as a horse, except
dialog: you@d be dead. I@ve seen it myself.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don@t get nervous. Thanks for trying to
dialog: calm me down, though.
speaker_heading: MIRDANDA
dialog: I@m going to the bar. Anyone want
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Beer.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Nothing till after I go on.
text: Miranda looks at Linda Lue
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m not ordering a Shirley Temple.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Nothing for me, thanks.
text: Miranda makes her way over to the bar. Nick, the auditioner who
dialog: dedicated his song
text: to Lucy, sits on a barstool. Miranda orders from the bartender.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Two beers and a Shirley Temple.
text: The bartender raises his eyebrows. Miranda nods to confirm her
text: order, then notices
dialog: Nick.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hey, I know you, from the audition.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nick Reynolds
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Miranda Presley.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That@s right. Miranda Presley. Wrote
dialog: @Desperado® when you were eight years old.
text: Miranda smiles; she doesn@t seem embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m famous already, and I can@t even find a job.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Lucy just lost a waitress. Maybe she@1l
dialog: give you a job.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. I@m hot a waitress, I@m a singer.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I@m not sure I see the difference.
dialog: (calls to the back room)
dialog: Lucy, come on out here.
text: Lucy comes out of the back room, a look of annoyance on her face.
dialog: She recognizes
dialog: Miranda.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well, if it isn@t Miss Presley. What can
dialog: I do for you, honey?
speaker_heading: NICK
text: She@s interested in the waitress position.
dialog: I told her you@d probably want to hire
dialog: her.
text: Both women look at Nick like they wish he@d butt out. The
text: bartender pages through a
text: booklet, looking for a Shirley Temple recipe.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Look, I don@t want to be a waitress.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Then why am I out here?
text: Miranda looks at Nick accusingly.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don@t know, but you sure do look nice
dialog: tonight, Lucy. You want to go out later?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Nick, I@ve got a million things to do.
dialog: Darcy called me at four in the afternoon
dialog: to tell me she was quitting.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (mock surprise)
dialog: Quitting? Why?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh, she@s going on tour with Rodney
dialog: Crowell or some fool thing.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What@s she going to do? Drive the bus?
dialog: Nick knows very well what Darcy@s going to do.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (to Miranda)
dialog: Darcy@s a singer. She met Rodney Crowell
dialog: right in the very establishment, slipped
text: him a tape, which is against the rules,
text: and now she@s singing back-up on his tour.
dialog: Nick@s a sucker for a happy ending, but
dialog: they@re few and far between, if you ask
dialog: me.
text: Lucy heads for the back room.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Lucy.
text: She turns around.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: I just wanted to apologize. For singing
dialog: @Desperado® at the audition. I knew I was
dialog: supposed to sing something I wrote.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No apology necessary. Just don@t pull
dialog: that again. You@re welcome to try out
dialog: anytime with something of your own.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: And you can have the waitress job, if you
dialog: decide you@re interested by tomorrow
text: afternoon. But no passing tapes to the
dialog: customers.
text: Lucy goes into the back room. The bartender has finally finished
dialog: the Shirley Temple,
text: and Miranda picks up her drinks.
speaker_heading: MIRDANDA
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: You think I should take this job, don@t
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If you think opportunity keeps dropping by
dialog: until you like what he@s wearing, you
dialog: might as well pass this up.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Ever since I crossed the border into
dialog: Tennessee, It@s been an exercise in logic
dialog: to get a yes or no answer.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Personally, I think you should take the
dialog: job. You got the voice to make it
dialog: someday.
text: Miranda is surprised at the flattery, but still concerned.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How long did Darcy work here?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You don@t want to know.
text: Miranda goes back to her table. James is going onstage. The

text: He@s confident, poised. Two or three musicians assemble behind
text: him to back him up.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Hi. I@m James Wynn. I@m from Austin,
dialog: where we like our music with a few rough
dialog: edges. I hope that@s all right with
dialog: y@all. If you like this one, maybe you
dialog: can tell Lucy, let her know Nashville@s
text: ready for something new for a change.
text: Miranda looks confused. She turns to Kyle.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I heard he wanted Lucky to let him play
dialog: without an audition. He had all these
dialog: reviews from when he played in Austin. I
dialog: also heard that he shot a record executive
dialog: in Austin, but I don@t think that part@s
dialog: true.
text: James signals the band and they kick in with an energetic
text: rockabilly-flavored song.
text: He@s definitely showing he has the talent to back up his attitude.
scene_heading: EXT. LUCY@S PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: James leans against his truck, drinking a beer, talking to the
dialog: guys who played behind
text: him. Miranda, Linda Lue and Kyle come out of the bar. James
dialog: says goodnight to the
text: musicians and calls out to Miranda.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Miranda. Come here.
text: She walks over to him, leaving Linda Lue and Kyle waiting for her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You were good.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Did you ever have a nickname?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Is that why you called me over?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. That was an icebreaker.
text: He reaches out and takes her hand, surprising her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. Did you?
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You want to go out? Right now?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Only if you do.
text: Kyle@s talking to Linda Lue. He looks over and sees James holding
dialog: Miranda@s hand
text: and stops mid-sentence. Linda Lue turns to look and sees Miranda
dialog: get into James@s
dialog: truck.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I guess she found a ride.
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: James. How many beers have you had?
text: James hold up his beer bottle and tosses it in the trash.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: One half. O.K.? I promise not to run
dialog: down any of your relatives.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Have a nice time.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: A large, empty bowling alley parking lot. James@s truck travel
dialog: in circles, tires
text: squealing.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - NIGHT
text: Inside the truck, we see that Miranda is driving. She grinds the
text: gears and wrestles with
text: the steering wheel. Speed seems to be her only objective.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I can@t believe you@ve never driven
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m doing that well?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. I put that wrong. I believe you when
dialog: you say you@ve never driven before. A
dialog: blind man could see you@ve never driven
dialog: before.
text: Miranda gives him a look and drives over a cement parking divider.
text: James gets an idea.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
text: I know. Step on the middle pedal.
text: She hits the brake. The car stalls.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: My fault. I forgot to remind you about
text: the clutch.
text: He opens the glove box and pulls out a bandana. He holds it up in
text: front of Miranda,
text: trying to put it on her like a blindfold. She looks at him like
dialog: he@s nuts.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe this works with other girls
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Trust me.
text: She lets him blindfold her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - NIGHT
text: Miranda drives with the blindfold on. She@s doing much better
text: driving in slow circles.
text: James periodically tells her when to turn, putting his hand on the
text: steering wheel to help
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Not too many people know this, but
dialog: Nashville has a giant magnet - it@s right
dialog: under this very parking lot - that pulls
text: things in. People, pick-up trucks, old
dialog: Roy Orbison eight-tracks. It pulled you
dialog: here. Turn left.
text: She turns to look at him, but can@t because of the bandana.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why didn@t it pull anybody else I know?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It doesn@t attract everyone. Just hicks
text: and hillbillies and a few rednecks.
dialog: Songwriters. People who own cowboy hats,
speaker_heading: (CONT@D
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: guys with mustaches. If you have a
dialog: pick-up, sometimes it@ll get pulled with
dialog: you in it. Some people try to ignore it;
dialog: they get used to the pull and just never
dialog: come. My theory about you is that you@ve
dialog: got this stray piece of hillbilly lodged
dialog: in you, probably in one of your shoulders.
dialog: You were smart not to fight it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You know how you can have a job and an
dialog: apartment and friends and you think, this
dialog: is my life. If I leave this, I have no
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Mmm. Turn right.
text: She makes the turn easily, not thinking about the driving.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Well, I woke up a few weeks ago and it was
dialog: really hot out and sunny and there were
text: kids everywhere. It was the first day of
dialog: summer vacation, and it was just like
dialog: every other day to me. I wanted to be
dialog: out, like they were. I just wanted out.
dialog: And I thought, nothing@s holding me here,
dialog: I can do whatever the hell I want. And
dialog: if I don@t do it now, I@ll keep going
dialog: forever doing what I think I have to do
dialog: when actually the only thing that@®s
dialog: definite about my life is that I@m in it.
dialog: I@m the fucking lead. I left the next
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That happened to me when I was seventeen.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And I@ve always wanted to see Graceland.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: How fast are you going?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: About twenty?
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: Fourteen. Shift down and make a sharp
dialog: right when I say now. ... . Now.
text: Miranda follows his instructions and pulls smoothly onto the
dialog: highway
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Speed up.
text: She does, shifting into third.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Faster. Get into fourth.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Fourth? I can@t go that fast in a parking
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Promise me you won@t panic.
text: He pulls off her blindfold and she sees that she@s driving on the
text: highway. She smiles,
text: proud of herself.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT
text: Miranda and James lie on their stomachs in the back of his pick-up
text: truck, looking off
text: into the distance.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@ve got a strange idea of a good time.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It@s better this way.
text: We see that they are watching a drive-in movie, except they@re not
text: at the drive-in;
text: they@re parked overlooking the drive-in. They have a good view of
text: the screen, but no
text: speaker. It@s a clear summer night, just barely dark out. The
dialog: movie is @Love Story.®
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: You can make up your own story.
text: James sits up and reaches for his guitar. He starts to strum the
text: guitar, nods in the
text: direction of the screen and sings the first line of a song, making
text: it up as he goes along.
text: He plays, waiting for Miranda to do the second line. She doesn@t.
text: He keeps making up
text: lines, making the song about the characters in the movie.
text: Suddenly, Miranda comes up
text: with a line of her own; it@s just as good as one of James@. She
text: makes up the chorus and
text: they sing together.
text: Miranda rolls over on her back and stares at the sky, her head
text: flopped out the back of
text: the truck.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I didn@t know there were this many stars.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Giant magnet. What@s your favorite song?
text: Miranda answers without hesitation.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: @Hooked on a Feeling®.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Liar.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I think you can feel secure in your
dialog: position as the only person on the planet
dialog: whose favorite song is @Hooked on a
dialog: Feeling®.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What@s yours?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Y.M.C.A.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah. Me too.
text: James laughs.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What can you do that no one else can do?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: There@s always something.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I can do a country version of any Bon Jovi
dialog: song. Any Bon Jovi single. Except @Lay
dialog: Your Hands on Me.@ What about you?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I speak Spanish.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So do a billion other people.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Last month, I punched a record producer in
text: the face.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I heard you shot him. Only he was a label
dialog: executive.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: See, you should never believe rumors.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So what happened?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I met this producer in Austin, who wanted
dialog: to do some demos with me, try and get me a
dialog: record deal. then as soon as we got into
dialog: the studio, he started changing my songs,
dialog: fucking with them so they@d sound more
dialog: like everyone else. We had a fundamental
dialog: difference of opinion. And he was a dick.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So you punched him.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I believe in doing what you feel like
text: doing at any moment in time.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What@s it like, when you sing something
dialog: you wrote?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Don@t you write songs?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. I think I might try it, though. This
dialog: singing thing isn@t really working out.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: The first time I played one of my songs
dialog: and people connected with it, it was like
dialog: sex. Well, not exactly. Like the first
dialog: time you kiss someone and your heart kind
dialog: of flips, except it doesn@t make you feel
dialog: weak, it makes you feel strong. If you
dialog: think it@®s something you want to do, you
dialog: should try it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I think it@s something I want to do.
text: They look straight at each other, lean towards each other and kiss.
scene_heading: EXT. LUCY@S CAF@ MALL - DAY
text: Miranda walks down the sidewalk toward Lucy@s. she passes a
text: laundromat. Inside, a
text: man sits on a washing machine playing his guitar and singing while
text: his clothes spin in
text: the dryer. Miranda stops and listens to him a moment; he@s not
dialog: bad. She continues
text: down the sidewalk and goes inside Lucy@s
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF® - NIGHT
text: Two singers perform on stage. We see Miranda moving through the
dialog: crowd, working as
text: a waitress. She@s not having an easy time; she sets a beer in
text: front of a customer and he
text: indicates that it@s not what he ordered and makes her take it back.
text: She carries the bottle
text: back to the bar, where Nick sits at his usual post.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Did I thank you for bringing glamour and
dialog: excitement into my dreary life?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Did you mess up another one?
text: She slides the bottle over to the bartender.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: Michelob.
dialog: (to Nick)
dialog: Beer all tastes the same to me. Did you
dialog: ask her out yet today?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: She declined. Thanks for inquiring.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe it@s time to fish or cut bait.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You know that Lyle Lovett song? Waltzing
dialog: Fool?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (singing a capella)
dialog: The waltzing fool, he just might be crazy,
dialog: cause the waltzing fool keeps the moon in
text: his car.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Nothing.
text: Silence. Miranda stares at Nick, waiting.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT@D)
dialog: Just might no be so crazy, that@s all.
scene_heading: EXT. MUSIC ROW - NIGHT
text: It@s the middle of the night, pitch dark. A few of the houses
dialog: have their lights on.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Miranda is in a recording studio, singing the last few lines of a
dialog: ballad (e.g. @lIs there
text: life out there?@) over a guitar track recorded earlier. Kyle is
text: in the booth alone,
dialog: operating the board.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I could do it better. Let me do it one
dialog: more time.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No. I@m keeping that one.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: We have fifteen minutes. I can do it
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: Miranda. That one was perfect. Wynonna
dialog: Judd would use that one.
scene_heading: EXT. MUSIC ROW - NIGHT
text: Kyle and Miranda come out of the building where they were
text: recording. The walk down
text: the sidewalk, Kyle carrying Miranda@s guitar. Miranda looks down,
dialog: not stepping on
dialog: cracks.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So what are you going to do with the demo?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: They@1ll put it on a list of available
dialog: songs, and if someone comes in and wants
dialog: something like this, they might listen to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That@s it? That@s how you@re getting it
dialog: heard? That@s a great song, better than
text: most of the stuff on the radio.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: They all sound that way at first, when
dialog: you@re the only one who@s ever hear it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m telling you, someone wants this song.
dialog: Wynonna Judd want this song, she just
dialog: doesn@t know it yet.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: If that@s true, she@ll find out soon
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: O.K. It@s your song. I@m going to
text: say two more words.
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: Two words.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No wonder.
text: She keeps walking. Kyle stops.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No wonder what?
text: She doesn@t answer. He thinks.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: No wonder I can@t get anything recorded?
dialog: No wonder I@1l1l be just another guy who
dialog: never did what he said he was going to? No
dialog: wonder I work in a record store? Because
dialog: I didn@t push my songs on every singer I
dialog: met?
dialog: (seems to realize something)
dialog: Well, I did that, for awhile, but those
dialog: songs weren@t that good
text: Miranda stops walking. She turns and looks at Kyle.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: For your information, I stopped putting
dialog: all my energy into every new song because
dialog: I didn@t want to be so damned disappointed
dialog: all the time.
text: Miranda looks guilty. She begins an apology.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Kyle.
text: Kyle sits down on the curb. Miranda sits next to him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: You@re right. No wonder. How can I
dialog: expect anyone else to get excited about my
dialog: songs if I don@t? I shouldn@t just sit
dialog: back and wait for someone to find my
dialog: songs; I should do something to get my
dialog: songs heard
text: He tries to think of an idea.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: What do you think I should do?
text: Miranda takes the demo tape out of her pocket.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I think you should - we should - take this
text: song to Wynonna and get her to listen to
dialog: it.
text: She stands up. Kyle remains sitting. She tilts her head - a
dialog: gesture for him to come on,
text: then stars walking away.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What, right now?
text: He gets up and follows her.
scene_heading: EXT. WYNONNA JUDD@S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: There@s a car parked in the circular driveway. Kyle and Miranda
text: approach the car,
text: trying to be inconspicuous.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Are you sure this is the right house? She
dialog: parks right out front? Anyone could break
text: into her car.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I guess we@re the only ones who thought of
dialog: it. It@s her house. I came to a party
dialog: here once.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So you@re in her social circle, but we
text: have to lurk around at dawn to give her a
text: tape.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I was parking cars, and this wasn@t my
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Give me the thing.
text: Kyle hands her a slim jim.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: The thing? I thought you had done this
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What do you think I am, a criminal? I@ve
dialog: see it done. My sixth-grade boyfriend is
dialog: doing eighteen months for this.
text: Kyle puts his hand on her wrist to stop her.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: O.K. Time to go.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That was a joke. He got probation.
text: She carefully inserts the slim jim between the car window and the
text: door. She moves it
text: around expertly, and after a few seconds the door lock clicks.
text: Kyle jumps.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Give me the tape.
text: Kyle hands her the tape. She opens the car door. As soon as she
text: raises the handle, the
text: car alarm goes off.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Shit. Let@s go.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Wait. Let me put the tape in.
text: She sits in the driver@s seat and pop@s the tape in the car radio.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Take that out. It has my name on it.
text: Miranda rolls her eyes at him.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How else is she going to know whose song
dialog: it is?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: But she@ll know I broke into her car.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Of course she will. That@s the one
dialog: drawback to the plan.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I can@t believe I didn@t think of that.
text: The alarm continues to blare. A light comes on inside the house.
text: Kyle looks up and
text: sees it. Miranda follows his gaze and sees it too.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Don@t people ignore these things anymore?
text: She gets out of the car. Kyle gets in a pushes buttons on the
text: tape player.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Where@s the eject?
text: Miranda hears something; she looks down the driveway and sees a
text: police car pulling
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And when did the cops start responding so
dialog: quickly?
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
text: Kyle sits in one of a row of chairs against the wall. He looks
text: angry. Miranda leans over
text: the receiving desk, pleasing with an unsympathetic cop.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I told you, we weren@t trying to steal
dialog: anything. We were giving her a tape.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (weary)
dialog: Don@t arrest her. It was my idea.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It was my idea.
text: The cop looks from one to the other; he doesn@t care whose idea
dialog: it was.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: At least you admit that.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why are you mad at me? You agreed to it.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You didn@t mention the one drawback.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Any idiot would have figured out the one the one
dialog: drawback.
text: WYNONNA JUDD walks into the police station, a police officer at
dialog: her side. Everyone
text: turns to look at her. The unsympathetic desk cop seems
dialog: particularly impressed to see
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN

speaker_heading: POLICMAN (CONT@®D)
dialog: These here are your perpetrators.
text: Kyle extends his right hand.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hi. Kyle Davidson. It@s a pleasure to
dialog: meet you.
text: Wynonna shakes his hand. Miranda looks at him like he@s nuts.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: This is Miranda Presley.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: WYNONNA
dialog: Kind of polite for hardened criminals.
dialog: Which one of you jimmied open my car door?
text: Miranda raises her hand. The cop behind the counter stops staring
dialog: at Wynonna and
text: rushes over to a desk. He starts rummaging through drawers.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: We weren@t trying to steal it
speaker_heading: WYNONNA
dialog: (to Miranda)
dialog: Thanks for not scratching it. You@re the
dialog: one singing on the tape?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (nods)
dialog: It@s his song. You listened to the tape?
speaker_heading: WYNONNA
dialog: (to Kyle)
dialog: I guess this song is available? Or are
dialog: you waiting to hear from everyone else
dialog: whose car you broke into?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yours was the only car we broke into
speaker_heading: WYNONNA
dialog: Well, I@m flattered. I just wish I wasn@t
dialog: flattered this early in the morning. Is
dialog: your phone number on the tape?
text: Kyle nods, embarrassed at his stupidity.
speaker_heading: WYNONNA (CONT@D)
dialog: I@1ll have my manager give you a call about
text: putting it on hold.
text: Kyle@s mouth drops open. Miranda smiles. Wynonna turns to leave
text: the police station.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Miss Judd? Do you want to press charges?
speaker_heading: WYNONNA
dialog: All I want is to get some sleep.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Miranda)
dialog: Don@t think this means I forgive you.
text: The copy going through his desk finds what he@s looking for. He
text: holds up a tape,
text: triumphantly, looks up and sees Wynonna leaving.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN #2
dialog: Excuse me, Miss Judd?
text: She turns to look at him. He hurries to catch up with her.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN #2
dialog: Since you@re looking for new material.
text: He offers her the tape. She takes it from him patiently, promising
dialog: to listen to it.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
text: Miranda sits in her usual booth, but this time she@s awake. She
text: has her guitar next to
text: her and her notebook open in front of her, trying to write a song.
dialog: It doesn@t seem to be
text: going too well, most of what she@s written has been crossed out.
text: She reads what she

scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ TRUCK - AFTERNOON
text: Miranda and James are in the truck. Miranda drives.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m having trouble even getting started.
dialog: Maybe I can@t do it.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You learned how to drive two weeks ago and
dialog: you@re already the best driver I know.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Writing songs is different.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Maybe you need to try it with your eyes
dialog: closed.
text: She looks at him and shakes her head, swerving expertly around a
text: car at the same time.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Tried it. Didn@t work.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: When@s your night off?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Wednesday.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Wednesday. I@ll show you a few tricks.
dialog: But you have to promise not to get better
dialog: than me.
text: Miranda pulls into the parking lot for Lucy@s.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - AFTERNOON
text: The caf@ hasn@t opened yet. Miranda opens the door, showing up
dialog: for work. James is
text: with her; they kiss goodbye passionately. Lucy looks at them
dialog: disapproving. Miranda
text: comes in and ties an apron around her waist. Lucy puts glasses
text: away behind the bar.
text: Nick is onstage, doing a sound check for his performance later.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (into microphone)
dialog: Check, check. Lucy . . . Lucy? Is this
dialog: working right?
text: Lucy finally looks up.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: The microphone is fine, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You@re pretty fine, yourself, Lucy.
text: Lucy goes back to work. Miranda smiles.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: If you think there@s something you don@t
dialog: already know.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How long has he been after you like this?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: A little over a year.
text: In the background, Nick starts to strum his guitar.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And you@ve never even gone out with him?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: She won@t even give me a chance.
text: Lucy sighs; she doesn@t think this is nearly as interesting as
text: Miranda does.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I expect you@ll keep asking me about this
dialog: until you hear the whole sorry story.
text: Miranda looks at her expectantly.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: She calls me sorry, and that@s just what I
dialog: am
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I met Nick about. . . eight years ago. My
dialog: husband and him.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Your husband?
text: Nick starts a new song, with a different melody.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: That no good man wasn@t no good for you.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: My husband played guitar in Nick@s band.
dialog: Nick started acting pretty much the way he
dialog: acts now, only then I was young and didn@t
dialog: have much sense.
dialog: NICK (singing)
dialog: I wouldn@t give you a dollar, for all the sense
dialog: in the world.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I eventually left my husband and took up
dialog: with him
text: She jerks her head in Nick@s direction.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: It was the right love, at the wrong
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Nick got a record deal. He cut an album
dialog: and went on tour. His first night on the
dialog: road, he called me up and started talking
dialog: about. . . what was it, Nick? Space?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Now it seems all the space in the world,
dialog: is between me and you.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well, his album didn@t exactly set any
dialog: sales records, and his record label
dialog: dropped him. Before I knew it he was
dialog: hanging around here, thinking I was fool
dialog: enough to take him back.
speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: You don@t want to fool, with this fool in

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe he@s learned his lesson.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: But I@ve learned my lesson, you taught me
dialog: the hard way to fall.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: He hasn@t said anything so far to make me
dialog: think he@s learned one damn thing. I2@m
text: going to open up.
text: She walks over to unlock the front door.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Open up your heart to me, darling, this
dialog: time I won@t let you down.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Get off my stage, Nick.
scene_heading: EXT. LUCY@S CAF@® - NIGHT
text: Miranda@s just getting off work. She comes outside and looks
dialog: around for something.
text: She sees Kyle, leaning against his truck. Miranda stays where she
text: is. Kyle walks over
text: to her.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I told Linda Lue I1@d pick you up. I
dialog: thought we might celebrate.
text: She looks at him doubtfully.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: Any idiot would have figured out the one drawback.
text: Miranda smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
text: Miranda and Kyle walk along the strip on night clubs and souvenir
dialog: shops. It@s a warm
text: night, and they pass musicians playing on the sidewalk for tips.
text: They pass an open
text: bottle of champagne back and forth, drinking straight out of the
dialog: bottle.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It@s lucky for both of us that my song was
dialog: so good, or we@d be in jail right now.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It@s lucky for you that I sang on that
dialog: demo.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hey, I can sing pretty good, I@ll have you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@1l have to show me that sometime.
text: Kyle walks over to one of the street musicians and borrows his
text: guitar. He leans against
text: a wall and begins to play; Miranda and the musician watch him. He
text: starts to sing; it@s
text: the love song he did at the auditions, the one Miranda sang to him
text: in the parking lot.
text: Kyle does it a lot better than when he auditioned; he looks right a
dialog: Miranda and sings the
text: words to her. He finishes, showing no signs of embarrassment, and
text: hands the guitar
text: back to the musician.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Thanks, buddy.
text: He and Miranda walk away.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Not bad.
text: She hands him the champagne bottle.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Not bad? Not bad!
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@re Johnny Cash. You@re Vince Gill.
dialog: You@re George Strait.
text: He puts his arm around her, and she leans her head against his
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You know what@s funny?
text: Miranda doesn@t answer.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: The first time I saw you, I didn@®t even
dialog: realize how beautiful you were.
text: She seems affected by this, but only for a moment. She pulls away
dialog: from him.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Just once, I@d like a sober man to call me
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It@s not just that, it@s you. I didn@t
dialog: even care that I got arrested, really,
dialog: because I was with you. You know how I
dialog: got better at that song?
text: Miranda@s look says she doesn@t want to know.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: I thought about you. About everything I
dialog: wanted to tell you about how I feel. And
dialog: I was sober at the time, I promise.
text: Kyle moves toward her. She moves away, starts walking again,
text: trying to lighten the
dialog: mood.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So you realize there@s a song for
dialog: everything that happens in life?
dialog: Sometimes there are dozens for one moment
dialog: in time, like now. Yours could be that
text: REO Speedwagon song about wanting to be
dialog: more than friends, and mine could be @Baby
dialog: don@t get hooked on me.®
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I@ve always hated that song.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I got you arrested and I@ll always remind
dialog: you of a song that you hate. That should
dialog: be two strike against me.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Don@t count on it.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT
text: James and Miranda come up to a gate, carrying their guitars. James
text: walks up to the
text: window and watches a plan taxi up to the gate. Miranda plops down
text: in a chair.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I think you@re mistaken about how easy it
dialog: is to amuse me. It@s harder than this.
text: James walks over and sits next to her. He takes out his guitar.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We@re not here to amuse you, we@re her to
dialog: get you some inspiration. Look at him.
text: He points at an old man carrying a small bunch of daisies. The man
dialog: stands looking
text: expectantly at the gate. Miranda looks at him, unimpressed.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
text: Waiting for his wife. The woman he
dialog: married when she was barely seventeen.
text: The woman he loves just as much today as
dialog: the day he met her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You could write a song from that?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. Not me. I don@t write about
text: everlasting love.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Say he@s waiting for Gregor, his thirty-
text: year-old Dutch lover. They met in Venice
dialog: last Valentine@s day, and have been apart
dialog: since then.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Howard over there had to have his wife
dialog: killed, and her collection of exotic
text: parrots converted into hatbands.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Should be a touching reunion. Not a
dialog: country song, though. What about him?
text: James points at a man, about 35, who looks anxiously out the
text: window at the plane.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: He married his high school sweetheart,
dialog: they have a lovely home and a wonderful
dialog: marriage, or so everyone think. She@s
text: returning from a Mary Kay convention.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Or so she says. That has possibilities.
text: He plays a few chords and sings a line about the American Dream
dialog: gone wrong.
text: The door opens and passengers start coming into the gate area. The
dialog: old man searches
text: each face, almost as if he@s frightened. Suddenly his face lights
text: up. A short blue-eyed
text: woman comes to him, her smile just like his. He holds her
text: tightly, his fist clenching
text: the daisies behind her back. Nearby, a young couple kisses
text: passionately.
text: James looks at Miranda; he told her so. Miranda stars at the old
dialog: couple, who break
text: apart as if slightly embarrassed. The man picks up the woman@s
dialog: bags. He@®s forgotten
text: to give her the flowers. The young couple continues to kiss.
text: The man who was looking out the window is standing on the edge of
dialog: the crowd of
text: passengers, searching for someone.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Watch him.
text: Finally the man sees who he he@s looking for; a five-year-old girl
text: gets off the plane,
text: holding the stewardess@ hand. The little girl sees him and breaks
text: free of the stewardess.
text: She yells @Daddy!@ and runs to her father, who kneels down and
text: catches her, lifting her
text: in his arms. She wraps her little legs around him and hugs his
dialog: neck tightly; you couldn@t
text: find an inch of space between them.
text: The father closes his eyes for a moment, smiling.
text: James looks at Miranda, who stares at the father and daughter.
text: She looks like she@s
text: about to cry. She turns away, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Let@s go.
text: She picks up her guitar and walks quickly away from the crowded
dialog: gate, down the
text: corridor. James hurries to catch up with her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What@s the matter?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: O.K. You don@t have to tell me.
text: Miranda steps at an empty waiting area and takes a seat. James
text: sits next to her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I hate that. Someone goes away for two
dialog: weeks and it@s like the end of the fucking
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What@s wrong with missing someone?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If you know they@re coming back, you have
dialog: no right to miss them. It@s not like
dialog: they@re dead.
text: They sit there a little while, James sensing that Miranda@s really
text: upset about something.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I remember when my grandfather died. I
dialog: kept waiting for him to come to Sunday
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How old were you?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Twenty.
text: Miranda looks at him, a little surprised. She hesitates, then
text: opens her locket and shows
text: him inside.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That@s my dad.
text: One side has a black and white photo of her father, a handsome man
text: with a wide grin.
text: The other side has a black and white photo of Elvis pouting.
text: James tries a little joke.
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: He looks just like Elvis.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That is Elvis. He gave me this when I was
dialog: ten. My decitennial accolade, he called
dialog: it. He raised me since I was five. Just
dialog: me and him.
text: She looks at the pictures, then snaps the locket shut drops it
text: around her neck.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Presley@s my middle name. He had this
dialog: kind of Elvis thing. Nothing weird.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: When did he die?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Three months ago.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That@s not very long. It@s only natural
dialog: that you miss him.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t miss him. He told me not to.
text: Miranda@s quiet. James just sits with her, comfortable with the
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You want to go?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: O.K.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL POOL - NIGHT
text: James sits in a deck chair. Miranda sits on the diving board,
text: dangling her toes in the
text: water. It@s a hot summer night; she wears a t-shirt and shorts.
text: She has her guitar, and
text: is singing @Bad Medicine@, which she@s transformed from pop/metal
dialog: to country. She
dialog: does the first verse, then:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: When I get married, I@m going to have them
dialog: play @Bad Medicine® as I walk down the
dialog: aisle. The Bon Jovi version.
text: Miranda climbs off the diving board and sets her guitar in a chair.
text: She goes over to the
text: pool stops and starts to climb in fully dressed.
text: James starts to play something; it@s the song he started writing
dialog: earlier, in the airport,
text: about living the American dream, but only on the surface. He has a
dialog: few really good
text: lines. By the he@s done, Miranda has gotten all the way into the
dialog: pool, except for her
text: head. She@s been watching him intently the whole time he@s been
text: singing. James puts
text: down his guitar and sits at the edge of the pool.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Why do you always stay up all night?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Linda Lue snores.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Are you afraid of the dark?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If I was afraid on the dark, I wouldn@t
dialog: spend so much time in the dark, would I?
text: James pulls off his shirt and starts to climb into the pool.
dialog: Miranda ducks underwater
text: and comes back up.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Nightmares?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Not since I was eight.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What@d you do then, when you a
dialog: nightmare?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I would wake up my dad, he@d come get me,
dialog: and he@d let me stay up all night. We@d
dialog: light candles and make cookies and play
dialog: poker. We used to crank call foreign
dialog: countries. I learned the twist at four in
dialog: the morning. Then when it got light out,
dialog: I@d go to bed and miss half a day of
dialog: school. My dad once wrote a not for me;
dialog: @Miranda was unavoidably late to school
text: today due to a slight pterodactyl crisis
text: at home. The problem has been remedied
dialog: and it is unlikely that this will happen
dialog: again.@
text: They move around the shallow end of the pool, not approaching each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: So you@ve been sleeping during the day
dialog: since he died?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: At first, I couldn@t sleep at all, then
dialog: the only time I could even remember what
text: he looked like was in the middle of the
dialog: night. I sometimes think about what I@l1l
dialog: say when I see him again, and if I@ll
dialog: recognize him, then I realize I won@t see
dialog: him again at all.
text: James moves over to Miranda and stands in front of her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: I@ve been thinking about something. (He
dialog: takes her hands.)
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: I wonder if I@l1l1l know you in a year.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don@t know.
text: James moves toward her, trying to seduce her.
dialog: she@s going to respond.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If we go out, and we break up, I probably
dialog: won@t. I@ll be just another girl you used
dialog: to go out with. And someday there@1ll be
dialog: so many you won@t know which one I was.
text: James backs away from her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You want me to say we@ll be together ina
dialog: year? Because I can@t say that.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. That@s not what I want.
dialog: It@s not clear if
text: A look of realization crosses his face. He lets go of her hands.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You don@t want to do this.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t think it@s a good idea.
text: James gets out of the pool; he@s angry and he@s leaving. He picks
text: up his shirt and starts
text: to walk away, then stops and turns to Miranda.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I@m going to have to ask you to tell me
dialog: why.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I told you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I need the real reason. Then we@ll be
dialog: friends or whatever it is you want.
text: Miranda sits on the top step on the pool. She looks away from him
dialog: an tells him the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@ve been trying to write a song. Just
dialog: one song, to prove I can do it. Not even
dialog: a good song. And you, you see two
dialog: strangers at an airport and you turn it
dialog: into something so. . . incredible. Your
dialog: song was incredible.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What, you@re jealous? I might not even
dialog: finish that song. I have a song I started
dialog: three years ago that@s not done yet.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m not jealous. I@m overwhelmed. I just
dialog: can@t give you that, see?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don@t care.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I do.
text: She stares at him. He sees she@s set on this and gives up, walking
text: away. She sits in the
text: pool, holding her knees to her chest, watching him go.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF® - NIGHT
text: Later that night. The performances are over, and only a few
dialog: songwriters hang around,
text: making arrangements to get together and write. Miranda puts the
text: last chair up. She
text: goes over to Lucy, who@s counting receipts at one of the tables.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You can leave if you want, honey.
text: Miranda sits with her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Lucy, do you think anyone can be a
dialog: songwriter
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I@ve seen some people who tried about as
dialog: hard as a person can try and just never
dialog: get it, you know? I don@t think you can
dialog: learn it. I can@t do it.
text: Miranda looks discouraged.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT@D)
dialog: I didn@t mean to bring you down.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I always thought I wanted to be a singer,
dialog: then I came hear and realized I like to
text: sing, but it doesn@t seem like enough.
dialog: But songwriting@s so different; I just
dialog: don@t know if it@s worth it to try. It
dialog: comes so easily to some people, like
dialog: James.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You know what@s in this case?
text: She points to the glass case on the wall behind her, which
dialog: contains tacked-up papers
text: with handwriting on them: pages torn from notebooks, cocktail
text: napkins, an air-
text: sickness bag. Miranda looks and shakes her head no. Lucy stand
text: up and examines the
dialog: writing.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT@D)
dialog: These are all songs, by my songwriters.
dialog: Theyre not all hits, but they@re special
text: songs. @Like a miracle, some golden words
dialog: roll off of someone@s tongue.@ Some of
dialog: the took ten minutes, some if them took
dialog: years. Every one of these songwriters
dialog: would tell you it@s worth it. You write a
dialog: song like one of these, and you can@t ever
dialog: give up again. You know what it feels
dialog: like to be special, and there@s nothing
dialog: and no one that can give you that same
dialog: kind of special.
text: Lucy sits back down to get back to work.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT@D)
dialog: That@s why I worry about you, being with
dialog: James.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: James and I decided we@d just be friends.
text: Lucy nods.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It doesn@t matter how wonderful he is if
dialog: he@s only going to break you heart.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah, that@s what I decided. I@l1l see you
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Goodnight, honey.
text: Miranda leaves. Nick@s standing nearby. He watches her go.
scene_heading: INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
text: James is onstage, singing. There@s a band behind him. Some
text: people are dancing down
text: front; Linda Lue is among them. Miranda enters and finds Kyle
text: sitting down front.
text: She sits with him. James sees her come in and smiles at her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How@s he doing?
text: Kyle hesitates, then answers sincerely,
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Great.
text: Linda Lue returns, flushed, from the dance floor.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Hey, good, you made it. Come and dance.
dialog: This old stick-in-the-mud
dialog: (points to Kyle)
dialog: hasn@t danced with me once.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Miranda)
dialog: Who knew she was such a party girl?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Do you know how to do that?
text: She gestures toward the dance floor, where they@re doing an
dialog: elaborate country step.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Come on and show me how.
text: He hesitates only a moment before getting up and escorting Miranda
dialog: and Linda Lue to
text: the dance floor.
scene_heading: INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Miranda, Kyle and Linda Lue are on the dance floor. Linda Lue
dialog: and Kyle are expertly
text: performing the steps. Linda Lue smiles flirtatiously at the guy
text: next to her; she seems to
text: be in her element. Miranda stands in between them, trying to
text: follow. She smacks Linda
text: Lue on the arm to get her attention away from the cowboy. Linda
dialog: Lue does it slowly to
text: demonstrate, then smiles and nods when Miranda gets it right.
text: We watch the dancing for awhile - a dance floor full of people
dialog: performing intricate steps
text: in rapid, perfect unison, having the time of their lives.
scene_heading: INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
text: James finishes a song. Miranda, Kyle and Linda Lue are still on
text: the dance floor. They
text: stand and applaud.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: O.K. Thank you. We@re going to do one
dialog: more for you all tonight. I@ve got a
text: special guest singer on this number.
text: He looks straight and Miranda and smiles.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Her name@s Miranda Presley and I think
dialog: you@re gonna like her.
text: Miranda just stands there, disbelieving.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Go on up, Miranda.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Miranda, get on up here.
text: Miranda shakes her head. The other band members lean into their
dialog: microphones and
text: chorus her name, taunting her. She smiles and climbs onstage. The
dialog: band starts the
text: song. James takes off his guitar; he takes her hand and speaks
text: into her ear.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You know this one.
dialog: Miranda realized they@re playing @Hooked on a feeling@. She
text: laughs. The bassist hands
text: her a microphone. James starts to sing, then Miranda comes in,
dialog: grinning, not nervous
text: at all once she starts to sing. We haven@t heard the song quite
dialog: like this before; the
dialog: sound couldn@t be more country. They@re both having a good time.
text: Couples start to dance. Linda Lue watches, standing still among
text: the dancers, smiling
text: like a sentimental fool.
text: Kyle stares at James and Miranda, his expression serious, his
text: broken heart on his
dialog: sleeve.
text: The song ends and the audience applauds enthusiastically. James
text: hugs Miranda.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT- NIGHT
text: James, Miranda, Linda Lue, and Kyle come out into the parking lot.
dialog: James holds a
text: business card in his hands.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (to Kyle)
dialog: Do you know this guy? Doug Roberts?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah. He@s a good manager, been around
dialog: for twenty years. He has a good
dialog: reputation.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: He wants to do some master demos with me.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That@s great. He can get you a record
dialog: deal. Congratulations.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Come here a minute.
text: He takes Miranda@s hand and pulls her over to his truck. He looks
text: into her eyes.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Do you have the feeling that no matter how
dialog: conclusively we decide not to be attracted
dialog: to each other, forces beyond our control
dialog: will pull us together?
text: He moves slowly toward Miranda.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You think the entire universe is
dialog: controlled by magnets, don@t you?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Yes and no.
text: He@s standing right next to her now, and she@s not moving away.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What was the question?
text: He kisses her. She doesn@t resist.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A country love song plays on the stereo. James leads Miranda by
text: one hand into the
text: darkened bedroom. Miranda chatters nervously.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: We@ve been thinking about moving out of
dialog: the motel, but we don@t have any
text: furniture, and the dog seems to like it,
text: and they wrap the glasses in cellophane,
text: even though Lou always washes them again
text: before she lets me drink out of them.
text: They@re standing at the foot of the bed.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I need for you to shut up now.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I@m trying to picture you as Earlene
dialog: Mandrell, and you don@t sound a think like
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Well, lucky for me, you sound exactly like
dialog: Jim Nabors.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I really need for you to shut up now.
text: He kisses her on the neck and unbuttons her shirt. She responds,
text: undoing his belt
text: buckle. They fall onto the bed and continue to make love.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Later that night. James wakes up and looks around. He notices
text: Miranda is gone, then
text: hears music from another room. He gets up.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@® KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Miranda sits at the kitchen table, quietly playing guitar,
text: wearing a loose denim shirt
text: that must be James@. Her notebook is open in front of her and she
dialog: writes something
text: down, then looks up and sees James standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Maybe I@ll start staying up all night.
dialog: The best things in my life happen after
text: dark.
text: He passes by her, pulling back her shirt to kiss her shoulder,
text: and sits at the table. She
text: keeps playing quietly.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Lucy told me you@d break my heart.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I guess you didn@t believe her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe I just decided to risk it.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: How@s your song coming?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I have one line.
speaker_heading: JAMES
text: Every song starts with one line.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t know if it@s any good. My dad
dialog: always said I could do anything. I keep
dialog: thinking about this song he wrote for me.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Do you remember it?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Let me hear it.
text: Miranda plays the song. The lyrics are about a father@s unending
dialog: devotion to his
text: daughter. She stops after the first chorus.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That@s a nice line, about falling out of
text: the sky and landing in love.
text: He@s hesitant, like he@s searching for something nice to say.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Is that the only thing you liked?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It@s just. . . well, devotion is a tricky
dialog: theme. Of course a parent@s devoted to
dialog: his child. You have to have a point of
speaker_heading: (CONT@D
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: view. Like he wants a better life for you
dialog: than he had for himself. This song starts
text: at the end of the story.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Every song doesn@t have to be about
dialog: something you can relate to.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: A good song has something to say, even to
dialog: people who haven@t been in that situation.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: So it@s not a good song, because you don@t
dialog: like it.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I@m just telling you what I thought. 1@ve
dialog: spent half my life writing songs, I know
dialog: something about it. I thought you were
text: trying to learn.
text: She stands up.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If you had thought about it, you would
dialog: have realized this wasn@t a good example.
text: She picks up her notebook and walks out of the kitchen. James
dialog: looks like he@s
text: realizing his mistake.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Miranda has decorated her half of the room; there are photos of
dialog: Lyle Lovett and Jon
text: Bon Jovi over her bed.
text: Miranda sits in her bed, the dog on her lap. She looks terrible.
text: She rummages through

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: And I gave Fish-head four gallons of ice
dialog: cream for dinner, just like you said. Of
dialog: was that supposed to be one can of cat
dialog: food? I couldn@t remember, and Fish-head
text: insists that she always has ice cream on
dialog: Thursday. She also said to tell you she
dialog: misses you, and she caught a giant spider
dialog: that I thought looked a lot like that
dialog: Billy Warren kid you think is so cute. I
dialog: told her you@d be home soon. Remember, if
dialog: you get homesick, just keep your chin up.
text: Miranda hits the fast-forward button. When she hits play again, we
dialog: hear her father
text: singing, the same song she played for James. We hear the second
dialog: verse this time.
text: Miranda is visibly upset. She raises her chin; apparently she
dialog: takes that literally. She
text: doesn@t cry. She hits the stop button, her chin still in the air.
text: She reaches for her
text: notebook and opens it.

text: Kyle@s pick-up pulls up outside a house. He and Miranda get out.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How many people will be here?
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: Five or six. Everyone just plays
dialog: something they@re working on. Don@t
dialog: worry, no one@s going to insult your song.
dialog: They@1ll only say what they like about it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What if they don@t say anything?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: There are so many things a person can do
dialog: with her life. That girl in @Flashdance®

scene_heading: INT. NICK@S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kyle and Miranda sit in Nick@s kitchen, with Nick and three other
text: musicians, KEVIN, ERICA, and JOE. They@re sitting in a circle
text: around the small kitchen table. There@s a tape recorder on the
text: table. Everyone has a
text: beer and one or two of the guys smoke cigarettes. Erica has the
dialog: only guitar in the
text: room, and she sings a song, substituting la@s for one of the
text: lines. Kevin sings a line she
text: might use there. Erica sings it back, changing a few words.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Later that night. Nick has the guitar now, and he sings a song
dialog: that@s
text: uncharacteristically sober for him. It@s an apology to a woman he
text: betrayed; he admits
text: that he had no excuse to hurt her. The tape recorder is on,
dialog: recording Nick@®s
text: performance. Miranda watches him intently.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Everyone@s laughing. It must be getting late, because they@re
text: getting a little giddy. Joe
text: sings a song about how broke he is and they all join in the chorus
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Miranda takes the guitar from Kyle and begins to play her song.
dialog: She@s a little shy about
text: it but manages to perform pretty well. Her song isn@t bad; it has
dialog: a nice melody, but the
text: lyrics are not especially moving. All she has is the first verse.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t like that last line.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No. Keep that one. I like that line.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m not sure what it means.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: If you wrote it, you@ll figure out what it
dialog: means eventually. That@s the best line in
dialog: your song.

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Miranda sits cross-legged on her bed, her notebook open on her

text: is neatly made. Linda Lue emerges from the shower.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Oh good, you got in. Are you coming to
dialog: the audition today?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t know. I don@t think my song is
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Has it changed any in the last two weeks?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah, but I changed it back.
text: Linda Lue looks at her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Fine. I@11 go.
text: Linda Lue smiles. She sits in front of the mirror and proceeds to
dialog: examine every inch of
text: her face, looking for wrinkles.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
text: Signs of aging.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Find any?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Well, I like Barry Manilow more than I
dialog: used to. You know what I don@t get?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: You and James. You have one little spat
dialog: and you don@t call him and he doesn@t call
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I guess we both realized our mistake.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I thought you really liked him
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That was the mistake.
text: Miranda gets under the covers.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Wake me up for the audition.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - DAY
text: The weekly audition is in progress. Miranda and Linda Lue share a
text: table. Nick sits at
text: the bar. Lucy sits at her usual table in back. Kyle is onstage,
dialog: doing a nice job with one
text: of the songs we@ve heard before. He finishes triumphantly,
text: breathes a sigh of relief,
text: and walks back to the table.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Miranda Presley.
text: Miranda takes the stage. She introduces herself quickly and sings
dialog: the song she sang at
text: Nick@s house. She@s left in the line that the other musicians
dialog: liked. It@s the most
text: evocative line in the song, and it seems out of place with the
text: rest of the lyrics. Luc
text: watches Miranda with a small smile on her face; she@s impressed
dialog: that Miranda is taking
dialog: this seriously.
text: We see now that James is standing just inside the door; he must
dialog: have been there since
dialog: before Miranda started playing.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Linda Lue Linden, go on up and show us
dialog: your stuff, honey.
text: Miranda passes Linda Lue on her way back. They exchange smiles.
dialog: Linda Lue takes
text: the stage.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Hi there. I@m Linda Lue, from Alabama.
dialog: This song is called @I went looking for
dialog: Jesus .@
text: Linda Lue begins to sing; her song is about misprinted Bibles,
dialog: and, true to her style,
text: it@s unrelentingly cute. Miranda glances at Lucy to get her
text: reaction, but is unable to
text: read her expression.
text: James walks over and sits next to Miranda. She@s surprised to see
dialog: him. Kyle isn@t
text: happy to see him. They speak in low voices.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I like you song.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (cold)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I@ve missed you.
text: Kyle doesn@t have any choice but to leave. He makes a fist and
text: presses it firmly against
text: the table as he gets up.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Since my phone still ain@t ringin®, I
dialog: assume it still ain@t you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I@m sorry I didn@t call. I couldn@t call
dialog: you, I don@t now. That night, after we
dialog: made love.
text: Miranda@s eyes widen; she looks around as if someone might have
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Well, we did. And then I was a jerk. I
dialog: should have just kept my mouth shut. T@m
dialog: sorry. I should have told you then.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Look, it wasn@t that big a deal. You@ve
dialog: apologized. Let@s forget it, O.K.?
text: She glanced over at Lucy, who glares at her to be quiet while
text: Linda Lue is singing.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It wasn@t just my fault, you know.
text: Miranda looks at him questioningly.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: You said you were willing to risk it, but
dialog: you weren@t.
text: Miranda shakes her head no, agreeing with him.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m sorry.
dialog: She means she@s still not willing.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: I should have told you that night.
text: Lucy appears behind them and shushes him. They look at her
text: guiltily. She leaves.
text: James reaches for Miranda@s hand. She@s reluctant to give it to
text: him, but he gives her a
text: pleading look and gently takes her hand, placing it palm up in his
text: left hand. With his
text: right, he spells something onto her hand with his finger. When
dialog: she realized what the
text: message is, she turns and watches him finish spelling. He looks
text: into her eyes. She
text: closes her hand into a fist, turns away, and pulls it under her
text: other arm, hugging
text: herself. She watches Linda Lue finishing up her song. James,
dialog: recognizing the impact
text: his message had, reaches across Miranda to take her hand again.
text: She lets him take it in
text: his. James smiles.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - DAY
text: Lucy announces the results of the audition. She calls out Kyle@s
dialog: name; he passed this
text: time. Linda Lue lets out a whoop and hugs him. Miranda smiles
dialog: too.
text: Lucy get to the end of the list. Linda Lue wasn@t on it; neither
dialog: was Miranda. Linda Lue
text: looks disappointed. Miranda takes the news well.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You should have passed.
text: Miranda shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I knew it wasn@t ready. I can do it
dialog: better.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF® - NIGHT
text: Later that day, after the auditions are over, Miranda has shown
dialog: up for work and is
text: tying on an apron around her waist. Lucy comes in. Miranda
text: smiles at her, showing
dialog: her she@s not angry about the audition.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Hey, I thought you did real good today.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@re supposed to pass the ones you like.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You know why I bought my own place?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So you could play God.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That@s exactly right, honey. I think you
dialog: got a real good start, but I wouldn@t be
dialog: doing you any favors if I let you play
dialog: this soon.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Oh, I brought you something.
text: Miranda holds out a cassette . Lucy takes it.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What@s this?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If I tell you to just trust me and listen
dialog: to this, will you?
text: Lucy shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: It@s Nick, a song of his. I think you
dialog: should hear it.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: It@s all about you. And it won@t get any
text: laughs.
text: Lucy sets the tape on the counter. Miranda won@t take it back;
text: she walks away. Lucy looks at the tape.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY
text: Miranda and Linda Lue are taking the dog for a walk. Miranda
dialog: holds a flyer
text: advertising the Miss Nashville pageant.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: And there@s prizes, and scholarships, and
dialog: the winner goes to the Miss Tennessee
dialog: pageant.
text: They come up to a playground.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I hope you won@t be insulted if I tell you
dialog: I already think of you as Miss Nashville.
dialog: What about your illustrious songwriting
dialog: career?
text: They come up to the slide. Miranda picks up the dog and carries
text: him to the top of the
dialog: slide.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: You have no way of knowing this, since you
dialog: are asleep during most of my waking hours,
dialog: but I have been having serious doubts
dialog: about my future as a songwriter, which has
dialog: been my one goal since I was eleven years
dialog: old and saw @Coal Miner@s Daughter® for
dialog: the first time.
text: Miranda places the dog at the top of the slide and hold him steady,
text: facing towards the
text: drop. The dog starts to wiggle eagerly and she lets him go. He
text: slides to the bottom,
text: where Linda Lue catches him and carries him around to do it again.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@D)
dialog: But lately I@ve been thinking about
dialog: something my late grandmother Tilly use
dialog: to say. She would say, @lLook at your
dialog: breakfast. You@ve got your bacon, and
dialog: your eggs. Now, the hen was involved in
dialog: your breakfast, but that hog was
dialog: committed. @
text: Linda Lue releases the dog down the slide to Miranda. They
dialog: continue to take turns
text: putting the dog down the slide.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
dialog: Lately I@ve been feeling more like that
dialog: hen. If I thought I could really do it,
dialog: that might be another story.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: The pageant@s next week? Do you have time
dialog: to get ready? Don@t people train for
dialog: months for these things?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Miranda, I believe it is within my ability
dialog: to learn to walk in high heel, discuss (CONT@D)
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
dialog: the role of the woman in today@s society,
dialog: and tease my hair in one week.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If you could have one wish for today@s
dialog: children, what would it be?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: World peace. No, clean air.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You wouldn@t want them to be sick, or go
dialog: hungry, would you?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: What do I care? TI hate kids.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@re beautiful and queen-like, Lou.
dialog: You@re a beauty queen. You@ve got this
text: locked up.
scene_heading: INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
text: James is in the recording studio with a band of session musicians.
scene_heading: DOUG ROBERTS,
text: the manager who gave James his card at the Roadhouse, sits in the
dialog: booth with the
text: engineer. The musicians are all in their thirties and forties;
text: most of them look like
dialog: somebody@s father. They@re doing one of the songs we@ve heard
dialog: James do before, but
text: this version seems to lack energy. James is clearly dissatisfied
dialog: with the way things are
text: going, but is trying to be patient. He stops singing in the
text: middle of the song and cuts
dialog: the band.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We need to bring up the snares.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (over microphone)
dialog: They sound fine in here.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: This tempo@s all wrong.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Don@t worry. It sounds great.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I@m not deaf. I can tell how it sounds.
text: From the way he says this, we know he hates the way it sounds.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We@11l just get it down once this way, 0.k.
dialog: James?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. That@s not the way I wrote it.
text: James looks determined. Doug leaves the booth and comes into the
dialog: studio to talk some
text: sense into James. The musicians watch, uninterested. They@ve seen
dialog: this before.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: James, I know you feel strongly about your
dialog: song. You should, it@s your baby. But
dialog: I@ve been doing this since you were a
dialog: baby. I know what a hit sounds like.
text: Doug@s matter is soothing, condescending.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I know what shit sounds like.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It doesn@t sound like shit. It sounds
dialog: like what every country radio station is
dialog: looking for. I have to think in terms of
text: radio play.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I record this the way I wrote it, or I
dialog: don@t record it at all.
text: The musicians start to take notice; the fight is finally heating
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I@m already taking a big risk with you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Don@t do me any favors.
text: He starts to gather up his stuff.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Go ahead. Walk out. No one else will
dialog: touch you. Everyone knows about you.
text: James stands face to face with Doug.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What does everyone know about me?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You@ve got a hell of an attitude for a
dialog: pretty boy with a couple of good songs.
text: This is just part of Doug@s act, the way he keeps singers in line,
dialog: but James@® anger
text: flashes. Before Doug can see it coming, James punches him in the
dialog: eye.
text: The musicians look at each other, entertained. James walks out.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Miranda, wearing her t-shirt and boxer shorts with a glittery pair
text: of high heels, paces
text: the floor with a Bible balanced on her head.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the
dialog: United States.
text: Linda Lue calls to her from the bathroom.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (O.S.)
dialog: I think it@s highly unlikely I@11l be
text: reciting the pledge of allegiance.
text: Linda Lue sticks her head out the bathroom door, pulling rollers
text: out of her hair.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
text: Much less with a Bible on my head.
text: Miranda puts her arms straight out at her sides and the Bible falls
text: off her head.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I would think this is exactly the kind of
dialog: thing you@d be doing. I still think you
dialog: should learn that tap dance to @Dixie.®
dialog: Come on out.
text: Linda Lue throws open the bathroom door and strikes a pose in the
text: doorway, one arm
text: raised, head thrown back. She wears a low-cut sequined gown and
text: heavy make-up and
text: has her curled hair piled on top of her head. Miranda gasps.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Oh, you look beautiful.
text: Linda Lue drops the pose and looks down at herself.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: You think so? Is it enough?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes. It@s enough.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: It@s not too much?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. You look perfect. Except. . . let me
dialog: try one thing.
text: She reaches up and loosens a few strands of Linda Lue@s hair so
text: they fall around her
text: face. Miranda steps back and appraises her work.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Better. Wait.
text: Miranda reaches to the dressing table and gets a Q-tip. She runs
text: the Q-tip under Linda
text: Lue@s eye, removing some of the eyeliner, then does the same for
text: the other eye.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: What did you do, follow some kind of
text: eyeliner diagram in the beauty queen
dialog: handbook?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I@ll be on stage, I want them to see my
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: They will see your eyes. On the other
dialog: girls, all they@ll see is eyeliner.
text: They turn to face the mirror and look at themselves, standing side
dialog: by side. Linda Lue
text: gets a little emotional.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: You@re my best friend, you know.
text: Miranda@s emotional too, but embarrassed. She turns away from
text: the mirror.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah, well that@s cause you@re such a sap, Lou.
text: Linda Lue smiles.

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Eight o@clock.
speaker_heading: LUCY

scene_heading: EXT. ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Hey, James. How@s your career coming?
speaker_heading: JAMES

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Clue.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Memphis. What@s in Memphis?
text: James moves his lip in an Elvis sneer. Miranda screams.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Graceland? Graceland! Way cool.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You do not know what it is to worship
dialog: Elvis until you@ve seen his personal shit.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: They should put that on a plaque and hand
text: it on the gate.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: @Graceland, Graceland, Memphis Tennessee.

scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Only six hours to kill.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We@1l drive by the gate. I thought you
dialog: would want to see it at night.
text: They walk out of the supermarket. James stops by the gumball
text: machines. He puts a
text: quarter in one of the machines and turns the dial. He looks at
dialog: the prize, puts it in his
text: jacket pocket, and tries another quarter. This time he takes the
dialog: prize out of the plastic
text: bubble. He goes to Miranda and takes the grocery store back from
text: her. He sets the
text: bag on the ground and kneels in front of Miranda.
text: James takes her left hand and shows her the prize - it@s a gold
text: colored ring with a blue
dialog: plastic star.
text: Miranda looks around, embarrassed. The checkers, two middle-aged
dialog: women (one
text: white, one black), are both watching with smiles on their faces.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: They think you@re proposing.
text: James doesn@t reply. He tries to put the ring on her ring finger,
dialog: but it doesn@t fit. He
text: puts it on her pinky.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: Get up.
text: James looks over at the checkers.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Say yes first.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes to what?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Say yes, or I@ll look like a loser.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You are kind of a loser.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Say yes. I can@t live without you.
text: One of the checkers says, @how romantic.@ They ignore a customer
text: trying to buy a six-

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (loudly, angrily)
dialog: Yes. I said yes. Is that what you want?
dialog: Are you happy now?
text: James acts overjoyed; he smiles gleefully and hugs Miranda.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Happy? I@m the happiest man on earth!

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I would.

speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: You know what this reminds me of?
text: He looks at Miranda; she has no idea.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: When I was a kid, my dad used to take me
dialog: out every weekend. Told my mom we were
dialog: having a boys® night out, going bowling or
dialog: to the movies, or the rodeo, if there was
dialog: one. Then we@d go to his girlfriend@s
dialog: house; for a long time he was seeing my

dialog: and finding none.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: And I@d sit in the car, we had a blue
dialog: Pontiac, and he@d leave me the keys, and
dialog: I@d listen to the radio.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: One night, I taught myself how to drive in
dialog: that car, waiting for my dad. The antenna
dialog: had this bend in it. .
dialog: (motions with his hand)
dialog: and no matter what I did I couldn@t get
dialog: one damn FM station in that car. So I@d
dialog: sit there and listen to the country music

text: He takes Miranda@s hand, his eyes still on Graceland.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Just like all those damn cheating songs.
dialog: And all my life, people would tell me,
dialog: @James, you@re just like your father.@

dialog: not. I never lie. I don@t pretend to be a
dialog: great guy. The high point of my father@s
dialog: life was a football game in high school.
dialog: No way was I going to be just like him.
dialog: But now I wonder if I can help I it.
text: Miranda looks confused.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Sometimes I feel like I@m going to spend
dialog: the rest of my life with everyone thinking
dialog: I@m someone I@m not.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It@s hard to think about what you@re going
dialog: to do for the rest of your life. You have
dialog: to pick one thing. What if it doesn@t
dialog: work out?
text: James nods.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You look stupid. You@re a failure.
text: Miranda takes his chin in her hand and turns his face toward her.
text: She kisses him.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t think you could ever be a failure.
text: She climbs out of the truck bed. She reaches inside the truck and
text: turns on the radio,
text: tuning it to a slow song (e.g. @Asking us to dance@) . She
text: climbs back up into the back
text: and stands next to James, holding her hand out to him. He slowly
text: gets up, his eye
text: locked with hers, and takes her hand.
text: They start to dance underneath the stars, holding each other
text: close. James pulls her
text: closer, tight against him, until they aren@t dancing anymore.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I@m scared.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So aml.
text: The song plays on as they hold on to each other. Finally, James
text: pulls away until he
text: isn@t touching Miranda anymore. He takes his hand and moves it
text: along her arm, from
text: the shoulder down to her wrist, without touching her.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Do you feel that?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah.
text: The skies have become cloudy. There@s lightning in the distance.
text: Elvis comes on the
text: radio and it begins to sprinkle.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
text: It@s pouring now. James and Miranda con in, drenched. The same
text: two checkers are
text: there. Their names are SELMA and MARY. Mary is black.
speaker_heading: SELMA
dialog: Look, Mary, if it ain@t the newlyweds.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You two get married already?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: No. We couldn@t find an all-night wedding chapel.
text: Miranda plays her role low-key, convincingly bitchy.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Well, maybe if you had any sense at all,
dialog: you might have planned this a little
dialog: better and we wouldn@t have gotten lost in
dialog: the rain.
dialog: (to the cashiers)
dialog: He doesn@t have the sense he was born
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (to James)
dialog: You sure you wanna marry this one?
text: James smiles fondly at Miranda
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I know she@s a handful, but I1@d die if I
dialog: lost her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That@s cause you@d forget to breathe if I
dialog: didn@t remind you.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, if you@re sure, maybe I can help
dialog: you. Selma, you can cover me for five
dialog: minutes?
speaker_heading: SELMA
dialog: Sure can. You gonna wake Raymond?
text: Mary gets her purse from under the counter and pulls on a coat and
text: rain hat.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I@m going to wake that man and tell him
dialog: there@s two young folks here and can@t wait
dialog: till morning to get married.
text: Mary hurries out of the supermarket.
speaker_heading: SELMA
dialog: She@1ll be right back, she just lives down the street.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Who@s Raymond?
speaker_heading: SELMA
dialog: Raymond@s her husband. He@s a minister.
dialog: This is so romantic.
text: Miranda and James look at each other, amused, mildly panicked.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Cold feet, honey?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I left. . . something blue in the truck.
dialog: Come with me.
text: They leave the supermarket.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ TRUCK - NIGHT
text: They sit inside the truck, parked outside the supermarket.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Let@s go.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We can@t just go. We have to at least
dialog: tell them we changed our mind.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: We@1l have a big blow-out of a fight.
dialog: I@1l pretend to shoot you in the leg.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I@ve got another idea.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Let@s get married.
text: She seems to consider this, then come to her senses.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You don@t get married as a joke.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: It@s not a joke. We@re in love. What the
dialog: hell, let@s get married.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@re serious.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We are in love, aren@t we?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Then why haven@t you ever told me?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@re the one who had to write it on my
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I can@t say it.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@d be afraid to tell you how much.
text: James seems happy with this answer. He notices something behind
dialog: Miranda,
text: outside the window. Mary is back with her husband. He@s a huge
dialog: black man
text: with a lumbering gait. He wears a black raincoat and carries a
text: black bible.
text: Their skinny teen-age son is with them.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Oh my god.
text: Raymond comes up to the truck and puts his face against the
dialog: passenger
text: window. It@s a frightening sight. Miranda covers her mouth.
dialog: James reached
text: over and turns Miranda@s face towards his.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Marry me, Miranda
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: O.K. Yes.
text: She looks back at Raymond.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t see an alternative.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
text: The frozen foods section has been selected as the wedding site.
dialog: Mary and
text: Selma drape pastel toilet paper over the aisles. Raymond stacks
dialog: some crates to
text: use as a podium, placing one behind for him to stand on. Mary@s
dialog: son leans
text: against the freezer, flipping through a Playboy.
text: James is in the toiletries section, putting gel in his hair.
text: Miranda comes up
text: next to him and takes a toothbrush and toothpaste.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: I have chee-tos stuck in my teeth.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You know, this is exactly how I pictured
dialog: my wedding.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah, mine too. Except. . . oh, shit.
text: She quickly walks away, then back to James. She takes off her
dialog: ring and puts
text: it in his hand.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: The ring. See you at the altar. Aisle
dialog: twelve.
text: Miranda hurries away.
text: She goes to the frozen food section. Raymond has discovered his
dialog: son reading
dialog: Playboy.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: Benjamin, I have told you that pornography
dialog: will guarantee you reservation in the
dialog: depths of hell.
text: He gives special enunciation to the word @pornography@. Ben seems
text: unconcerned. He puts down the magazine, revealing the Metallica
dialog: logo on
text: his t-shirt. Raymond hands Miranda a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND (CONT@D)
dialog: Here@s your marriage license. Can@t no
dialog: one tell you for certain that@s not the
dialog: genuine article.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Thank you.
text: She takes Ben@s arm and pulls him aside.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Ben, I need a favor.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (wicked smile)
dialog: You want a lesson from the master. Before
dialog: your honeymoon.
text: She gives him a look.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Do you have a Bon Jovi tape?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Bon Jovi@s for girls, man. I ain@t a
dialog: girl. My sister likes Bon Jovi.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Does your sister have a Bon Jovi tape?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: She@s got every Bon Jovi tape.
text: Miranda smiles.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
text: It@s time for the ceremony. Raymond stands behind his podium,
dialog: towering
text: over James. Selma and Mary stand off to the side, beaming.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Ben, where are you? Get out here and be a
dialog: witness.
speaker_heading: BEN (0O.S.)
dialog: Coming
text: There@s a click, then music comes over the supermarket sound
dialog: system. It@s
text: @Bad Medicine.@ Ben escorts Miranda up the aisle until she is
text: standing next to
text: James, the runs back and cuts the music.
dialog: Raymond being the ceremony. He@s a fundamentalists preacher and,
text: apparently, even his wedding ceremony is delivered with the threat
dialog: of fire and
text: brimstone.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: Dearly beloved.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
text: Later in the ceremony. Sweat drips down Raymond@s face as he
text: towers over
dialog: Miranda and James.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Do you, James, take this woman to be your
dialog: wife, to love and treasure like gold,
dialog: forsaking all others, turning your back on
dialog: earthly temptations, or you will surely
text: know the fires of hell in the inferno of
dialog: eternal damnation.
text: Raymond glares down at James, pointing his finger. James didn@t
dialog: think it was
text: a question, but it seems safer to answer.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I do.
text: James slips the ring on her finger. Raymond draws a deep breath
dialog: and pulls
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: And do you, Miranda, take James to be your
dialog: husband.
text: Miranda seizes the opportunity to cut this short.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Then by the power vested in my by Almighty
dialog: God, his son, our savior, the baby Jesus
dialog: and the state of Tennessee, I hereby
dialog: pronounce you man.
text: He points at James.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND (CONT@D)
dialog: and wife.
text: His finger swings over to Miranda. Raymond wipes the sweat off his
text: forehead.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND (CONT@D)
dialog: You may kiss the bride.
text: James and Miranda kiss. Ben cranks up @Bad Medicine@® and Mary
dialog: and
dialog: Selma throw Minute Rice.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
text: James and Miranda dance. Eric Clapton@s @Pretty Girl@® plays
text: over the sound
text: system. Mary dances with Raymond, and Ben reluctantly dances
dialog: with Selma.
scene_heading: INT. GRACELAND - DAY
text: It@s morning. James and Miranda are inside Graceland. The tour
dialog: guide
text: describes the room in a loud, rehearsed voice. Miranda leans
dialog: against James
text: and gazes dreamily at Elvis@® stuff.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I had this dream that we got married.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: We did, remember?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. Me and Elvis. I had my hair ina
text: huge bee-hive.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER - NIGHT
text: The theater where the beauty pageant is being held. Linda Lue is
dialog: onstage,
text: doing a scene from @Coal Miner@s Daughter@. Someone read the
dialog: other parts
text: woodenly from off-stage. Linda Lue is an extremely emotional
dialog: actress and
text: several women in the audience wipe tears from their eyes at the end
dialog: of her
dialog: performance.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER - NIGHT
text: The pageant@s nearly over. There are five girls on stage: Linda
dialog: Lue is one of
text: them. Miranda and James slink into the darkened theater and take
dialog: two empty
text: seats next to Kyle.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Where were you two?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: We picked up a hitchhiker that turned out
dialog: to be the ghost of Elvis. Had to take him
dialog: to Graceland. She@s a finalist?
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: She was the best one. People were crying
text: when she did her scene.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So she@s going to win?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don@t know. I think that redhead is
text: married to at least one of the judges.
text: On stage, Linda Lue walks over to stand next to the host.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: And now, our last finalist, Louise Linden.
text: Miranda mouths the name @Louise@, amused.
speaker_heading: HOST (CONT@D)
dialog: You look lovely tonight, Louise.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Well, that@s the idea, ain@t it?
text: The host chuckles.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Yes, it is. Now, Louise, here@s your
dialog: question: Which do you consider more
dialog: important, family or career?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: By family you mean the family I plan to
dialog: have.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Well in that case, I would say neither.
dialog: My friends are more important to me than
dialog: my career, whatever that may turn out to
dialog: be, and my career is more important to me
text: than a husband and a bunch of screaming
dialog: kids.
text: The host clears his throat.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Thank you. A very good answer.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER - NIGHT
text: Later. Linda Lue and the redhead are the only contestants left
text: on stage.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: And this year@s Miss Nashville is... Tammy
dialog: Sue Phelps!
text: Tammy Sue squeals. Linda Lue hugs her, looking relieved.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: Linda Lue stands among a group of contestants, holding a bouquet
dialog: of roses.
text: Miranda come up to her and hugs her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Congratulations. Personally, I thought
dialog: you should have won.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I can@t believe they gave me runner-up
dialog: after I said that about screaming kids.
text: Miranda laughs.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You threw it? Cool. How come?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Did you see my talent?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. James and I got married. We got here
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Married?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Sort of. I@11 tell you all about it.
dialog: Tell me how your scene went.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: I was really good. I found something I
dialog: can do, Miranda. I can@t spend a year
text: cutting ribbons at supermarket openings.
speaker_heading: MIRDANA
dialog: Well, you@1l always be a beauty queen to
dialog: me.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Kyle is in his pick-up, playing with the radio as he drives. He
dialog: switches from
text: station to station to station, trying to keep an eye on the
dialog: traffic.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Love songs, nothing but love songs
dialog: Whose idea was love, anyway?
text: He pauses on a station where the dee-jay is introducing a song,
dialog: his hand
text: poised over the dial.
speaker_heading: DEE-JAY (V.O.)
dialog: : we@ve all been waiting for, here@s the
dialog: new one from Wynonna.
text: The song starts; it@®s Wynonna Judd, singing Kyle@s song. Kyle
dialog: realizes what
text: it is, lets out a whoop and turns up the radio. In his
dialog: excitement, he also puts
text: his foot on the gas and runs right into another truck. Even after
dialog: the accident,
text: he@s still grinning and listening to the radio. He opens his door
dialog: but stays in his
text: truck. The driver he hit gets out, more surprised by the accident
dialog: than angry.
text: He approaches Kyle, looking at him curiously. Kyle beams at him.
dialog: He points
text: at the radio.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That@s my song.
text: The driver doesn@t say anything. He leans against Kyle@s truck so
text: he can hear
text: the song, and listens appreciatively. Then he calls out to the
dialog: people who are
text: gathering around because of the accident.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: That@s his song. He@s got a song on the
dialog: radio!
text: The on-lookers move in closer sot hey can hear the radio.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ BEDROOM - DAY
text: Kyle@s song continues over:
text: James and Miranda in bed. Miranda@s wide awake, staring at the
dialog: ceiling.
text: James is still asleep. He stretches, waking up.
text: Miranda turns and closes her eyes, pretending to be asleep. James
dialog: looks a
text: little surprised to find Miranda in his bed; we see the memory of
dialog: the wedding
text: coming back to him. Now it@s his turn to stare at the ceiling.
dialog: He reaches
text: over and takes Miranda@s hand; the situation is serious but at
dialog: least they@re in it
text: together. She doesn@t look at him.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ BATHROOM - DAY
text: James is alone in the bathroom. He opens the medicine cabinet and
dialog: has to
text: search for his shaving cream. He looks down and sees two tubes of
dialog: toothpaste
text: resting on opposite sides of the sink. He closes the medicine
dialog: cabinet and starts
text: at the sight of his own reflection, as if he@s looking at himself
text: for the first time.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@® KITCHEN - DAY
text: Miranda looks in the refrigerator, which is nearly empty. She
text: lifts the lid ona
text: pizza box, takes out a slice and takes a bite. She sits down at
dialog: the kitchen table
text: and looks out at the quiet street. Her eyes move down to her
text: hands. She
text: holds them in front of her and examines them, like someone else@s
text: hands. She
text: touches the ring James gave her, which looks cheap in the bright
text: morning light.
text: She twists it off her finger and holds it in her fist, drawing her
text: knees up to her
text: chest.
scene_heading: EXT. MUSIC ROW - DAY
text: James pulls his truck up outside one of the houses, the office for
dialog: Doug
text: Roberts@ management company. He stays inside the truck, looking
dialog: at the
dialog: building.
scene_heading: INT JAMES@ KITCHEN - DAY
text: Miranda sits at the table, her notebook open in front of her, a
dialog: blank page.
text: She slides the ring back and forth on her pen.
scene_heading: INT. DOUG ROBERTS® OFFICE - DAY
text: Doug sits behind his desk. He has a black eye. James stands in
text: front of him,
text: pleading his case.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - NIGHT
text: The music ends. Miranda shows up for work. Lucy looks surprised
text: to see her.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You@re early.
text: Miranda looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I am?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Forty-five minutes. You feeling all
dialog: right? You look exhausted.
text: Miranda sits down at the bar.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: We got married.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You and James? Congratulations!
text: Miranda looks at Lucy like she things she might be joking.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I thought you might disapprove.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well, honey, I got me a whole new attitude
dialog: on the subject of love.
text: She holds out her left hand. There@s a diamond ring on her
text: finger. Miranda smiles.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: This can@t be from Nick. You can@t even
dialog: tolerate Nick. You@re never going to
dialog: forgive him for as long as you live.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I changed my mind.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I tried to tell you about that song.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I don@t know why he didn@t just come out
dialog: and tell me how he really felt.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe the same reason you didn@t tell him.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We@re having an engagement party Friday.
dialog: We@d like you to sing.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: O.K.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Original material only.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Oh. I don@t have anything good enough
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Well, you@ve got two days. You@11l come up
dialog: with something.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: When did you turn into such an optimist?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I have to admit, I@m starting to believe
dialog: in happy endings. Looks at you and James -
dialog: I never did figure that boy to be the type
dialog: to commit.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It kind of happened when he wasn@t
text: looking.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I don@t think he does anything without
dialog: looking first. If he said @I do@, then he
dialog: does.
text: Miranda smiles, reassured.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF® - NIGHT
text: Later that night, Miranda brings some customers their drinks and
text: heads back
text: to the bar. On her way, she runs into James.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hey. I know you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Can you take a break?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Not right now.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You want to know what I did today?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What did you do today?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I went to see Doug. I told him he@d be
dialog: all kinds of sorry if he let me get away.
dialog: That kind of line works like you wouldn@t
dialog: believe.
text: Miranda smiles.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I might.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I leave for Austin day after tomorrow. I
dialog: start recording next week.
text: The smile leaves Miranda@s face.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Austin? You@re aware you@re already in
dialog: the country music recording capital of the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I get to use my musicians this time. This
dialog: is everything I wanted. I thought you@d
dialog: be happy for me.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How long will you be gone?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I don@t know. A month or two.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You@re just taking off? Day after
dialog: tomorrow. And you aren@t going to ask me
dialog: if I want to come.
text: James is surprised that she@s upset. He looks around to see if
dialog: anyone is
text: looking at them. No one is.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What are you going to do, quit your job so
dialog: you can hang around and watch me record
dialog: all day? I thought you@d want to stay
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: The fact that we@re married doesn@t mean
dialog: that you get to decide what I want.
text: Now a few people turn to look.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: What does it mean?
text: She@s getting progressively louder, and so is James. Lucy
dialog: notices that they@re
dialog: fighting.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: 1@m not even sure we are married, so if
dialog: you want out, just let me know. I can
dialog: tear up the certificate.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Don@t pull this on me. You@re the one
dialog: who@s leaving. Maybe you@ve gotten what
dialog: you wanted out of this. You proved to
dialog: yourself that you could commit to
dialog: something. Well, a commitment lasts more
dialog: than two days.
text: They notice everyone staring at them and lower their voices.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You think you@ve got me all figured out.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe you can only commit to one thing at
dialog: a time. I guess we know what your one
dialog: thing is.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You@re the one who can@t see past two
dialog: months from now. I don@t think you can
dialog: see this marriage in a week from now.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I just don@t think there@ll be anything to see.
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: You asked me to marry you.
text: She twists the ring off her finger and holds it in her fist,
text: looking like she might
text: throw it. Instead she drops her fist, turns around, and walks
dialog: away. James
text: watches her for only a second before he turns and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Miranda sleeps in her old bed. In the other half of the room,
dialog: Linda Lue is
text: packing to leave. The dog climbs in her suitcase and she pulls him
text: out and sets
text: him on the bed. It looks like she@s almost done. Her side of
text: the room now
text: looks like a typical tacky motel room; no floral bedspread, no
dialog: picture of
text: Loretta Lynn. Miranda opens her eyes.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Hey, you. I thought you were going to
dialog: sleep through my departure.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And miss the opportunity to see another
dialog: piece of my life crumble away?
text: Linda Lue looks concerned.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Do you want to tell me what happened with
dialog: you and James?
text: Mirada sits up.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I think the marriage just woke him up. We
dialog: realized he didn@t want to be with me for
dialog: the rest of his life. The wedding thing
dialog: was a big mistake.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: (meaningful)
dialog: And you didn@t have any second thoughts of
dialog: your own.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: He@s the one who left me.
text: Linda Lue sits next to her on the bed.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Can I tell you a story?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How many people die in this story?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Just one. When my Aunt Lydia was
dialog: eighteen, she was engaged to marry Henry
dialog: Esterbrook. However, the week before the
text: wedding, Henry eloped with Marianna Fine.
dialog: Aunt Lydia was so devastated she thought
dialog: she@d rather be dead than be without
text: Henry, so she decided to hang herself.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Has it occurred to you that this story is
dialog: completely inappropriate for this
dialog: situation?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: There@s more. Lydia went to the hardware
dialog: store to buy a length of good strong rope,
dialog: she couldn@t have weighed less than two
dialog: hundred pounds, and the man that sold her
dialog: that rope turned out to be her destiny.
dialog: She married him that summer. My Uncle
dialog: Ernie.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Which one of them dies?
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: My Uncle Ernie was bitten by a poison
text: centipede later that same year. He died
dialog: instantly. But that is beside the point
dialog: and you know it. There is someone out
dialog: there for everyone, and even if your head
dialog: doesn@t know it, your heart does.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So her heart led her to the hardware
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: Just like yours took to Memphis.
dialog: Remember the night I met you? I read your
dialog: palm?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yeah. But you didn@t read my heart line.
text: Linda Lue gives her a knowing look.

dialog: Sometimes people want to be surprised.
text: Linda Lue reaches for Miranda@s hand. Miranda lets her take it.
dialog: Linda Lue
text: examines it; we get the idea she may inventing the reading.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE (CONT@®D)
dialog: See, it@s the same as before. You are not
dialog: one to settle for the easiest thing - I
dialog: think that@®s true. A challenging
dialog: relationship. . . that can be very romantic;
dialog: to me that seemed like you and James, both
dialog: of you so pig-headed.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: This isn@t helping.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: The important thing to know is to follow
dialog: your heart. Don@t go against what it@s
dialog: telling you, and don@t bury anything that
dialog: ain@t dead.
text: Miranda pulls her hand back.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Who@s going to die now?
text: Linda Lue smiles.
speaker_heading: LINDA LUE
dialog: No one that you don@t kill with your own
dialog: two hands. You know, maybe next week
dialog: would be a better time for me to leave.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No, honestly, I couldn@t stand you or Mr.
dialog: Buster Dog another day. Go to Hollywood
dialog: and tell them who the hell you are.
text: Linda Lue hugs her, then gets up and closes her suitcase.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Linda Lue and the dog are gone. Miranda sits cross-legged on her
dialog: bed, her
text: notebook open in front of her. We hear Pam Tillis passionately
dialog: singing
dialog: @Maybe it was Memphis.@®
text: Miranda picks up a piece of paper that looks like her marriage
dialog: certificate. She
text: folds it in half and cuts it into a heart shape. She unfolds it,
dialog: and cuts the heart
text: into pieces with a jagged break. She positions them on a page of
dialog: her
dialog: notebook.
text: There@s a knock at the door. Miranda opens it to find Kyle
text: standing there.
scene_heading: EXT. RED@S BAR - NIGHT
text: Kyle leads Miranda out of the bar; she@s a little tipsy. They
dialog: pass a man ina
text: cowboy hat standing on the sidewalk, singing for tips. Miranda
dialog: sings along
text: with him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don@t know how productive this was
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Well, I@m having a pretty good time.
dialog: Let@s go somewhere else. Wanna go to
dialog: Graceland?
text: Kyle@s just trying to get her into the car without incident.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Let@s get you home.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t get it.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: This whole thing. What@s the matter with
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Nothing. You are perfect.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. There@s something wrong with me.
dialog: Nobody wants me. Nobody cares about me.
text: She@s really getting upset. Kyle wraps his arms around her,
text: holding her like a
dialog: child.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (soothing)
dialog: I care. I want you.
text: She shakes her head no. He strokes her hair back off her face.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: I care. I care about you.
text: Miranda still doesn@t look like she@s herself.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Do you love me?
text: Kyle loosens his hold on her; he has to protect himself now.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Miranda, don@t ask me that right now.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (persistent)
dialog: Are you in love with me?
text: Kyle pulls away from her altogether.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yes.
text: She pulls him to her slowly and kisses him, passionately. He
text: kisses her back,
text: then breaks away gently and looks at her, quietly angry.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: I don@t know what you@re doing, but stop
dialog: it now. I won@t let you use me.
text: She feels terrible; she was using him.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m sorry. Really.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Damn it, Miranda, what do you want me to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don@t know. I want you to stay in love
dialog: with me always, and I want you to get over
dialog: me and be my friend forever.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Do you think I have some kind of choice?
text: Miranda gives him a questioning look; she really doesn@t
dialog: understand how he
dialog: feels.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: Sometimes you hear a song on the radio,
dialog: and it@s just the song you wanted to hear
dialog: right then. It@s like a gift. Then it@s
dialog: over, and you@re just glad you heard it.
dialog: You don@t want them to play it again right
dialog: away. You@1ll hear that song again, or
dialog: another one that@s just the perfect song
dialog: when you hear it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And I@m like that song, the first one.
speaker_heading: KLYE
dialog: No, you are nothing like that first one.
dialog: You@re like if there was only one song in
dialog: the world I could hear for the rest of my
dialog: life, what song would that be. You@re
dialog: that song.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe the needle@s just stuck.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You@re the song that stays in my head all
dialog: day, and I don@t even mind it. You@re my
dialog: favorite song.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: For awhile, my favorite song was @Shadow
dialog: Dancin@®. It@s not anymore.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: You know what the problem with you is?
dialog: You make it so hard for someone to care
dialog: about you that once they do, there@s no
dialog: turning back. It@s hot or cold, there@s
dialog: no lukewarm.
text: Kyle realizes something, sadly.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT@D)
dialog: That@s why James@1l come back
text: Miranda won@t allow herself to hope for this.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No he won@t. It@s o.k. This kind of
dialog: thing happens to me all the time.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Miranda. What are you going to do when he
dialog: comes back?
text: Miranda sits down on the curb. Kyle sits next to her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I@m not going to be here. I@m going back
dialog: home.
text: This is the last thing Kyle wants to hear.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: This is your home.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Do you know how hard it was to leave New
dialog: York? I had wanted to do it for years and
dialog: then my father died, and I just did it,
dialog: left everything behind. I think I thought
dialog: I could pay him back, for giving up his
dialog: dream. Now I know he would@ve given it up
dialog: sooner or later anyway. When you think
dialog: you have a dream, all it does is give you
dialog: hope that you can have something good,
dialog: then you find out you can never have that.
dialog: Maybe it wasn@t even there to be had.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Don@t think that. You can@t live your
dialog: life thinking that.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Kyle, all the signs are pointing in the
text: same direction. Away from Nashville.
dialog: Away from country music. At some point, I
dialog: have to pay attentions. I have to start
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You could do that here. You didn@t come
dialog: here because of your father. You came
dialog: here to write songs.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Saying you@re going to do something and
dialog: actually doing it are two different things.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You have them inside you. What if you go
dialog: to New York and you never get them out?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Don@t make me feel any worse. This is all
dialog: I have left.
text: Kyle shakes his head, disagreeing.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You still have everything that matters.
text: She doesn@t answer. They sit side by side, watching traffic pass
dialog: by.
scene_heading: EXT. JAMES@ HOUSE - DAY
text: It@s early in the morning. James comes out to his truck, throws
text: a bag in it,
text: and gets in.
scene_heading: INT. GREYHOUND STATION - DAY
text: Miranda, carrying her guitar and suitcase, buys a bus ticket.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: We see the Greyhound travelling down the highway.
scene_heading: INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
text: Miranda sits by a window, staring out. She reaches into her
dialog: backpack, pulls
text: out her walkman, and puts on the headphones.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: A different highway. We see James in his truck, heading out of
dialog: Nashville ina
dialog: different direction.
scene_heading: INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
text: Miranda fumbles through her backpack until she finds what she was
dialog: looking
text: for; a Bon Jovi cassette. She takes the tape out of its case and
text: pops it in her
text: walkman. She presses play. We hear what she hears, but it@s not
dialog: Bon Jovi.
text: It@s country music - her father singing one of his songs. Miranda
text: is startled.
text: She quickly hit stop, taking out the tape to look at it.
text: Verifying what it is, she
text: puts it back in her walkman and hits play.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ TRUCK - DAY
text: James is driving, absently singing @Bad Medicine® to himself.
scene_heading: INT. GREYHOUD BUS - DAY
text: Miranda stares out the window, the tape still going in her
dialog: walkman. We hear
text: what@s on the tape - now it@s a letter from her father.
scene_heading: VOICE ON TAPE
dialog: that one was your favorite when you
dialog: were two, you probably don@t remember.
text: And that concludes the musical portion of
dialog: our program. I hope they@re teaching you
dialog: how to skin rattlesnakes at that camp,
dialog: I@ve been setting snake traps all over the
dialog: yard. I used Ding-Dongs for bait. I
dialog: expect to have about thirty-seven by the
dialog: time you come home. So don@t worry about
dialog: me, I@m doing fine without you. I@1l miss
dialog: you now, and you can miss me when you get
dialog: home. That way I@ll be there. Chin up.
text: That@s the end of the tape. Miranda listens to the silence. She
text: raises her chin,
text: then lowers it and gives into her tears.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ TRUCK - DAY
text: James has picked up a hitchhiker, and old man who listens passively
dialog: while
text: James rambles on.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: thinks she knows everything about me.
dialog: Probably thinks I decided to leave because
text: of her, like the world revolves around
dialog: her . . . she thought she had me with that
dialog: marriage thing . . . I might have
dialog: better things to do with the rest of my
dialog: life
text: He trails off.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Like what?
text: James looks at the old man, startled.
scene_heading: EST. TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: The Greyhound is stopped at the truck stop. Miranda gets off. She
dialog: puts on
text: her sunglasses and looks around.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: James pulls over and lets the hitchhiker out at a gas station. The
dialog: old man
text: waves as the truck pulls back onto the highway. James drives in
dialog: the same
text: direction as before for about ten seconds, then pulls a U-turn and
text: heads back
text: toward Nashville.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: Miranda sits in a booth in the coffee shop, looking out the window
dialog: as her bus
text: pulls away.
scene_heading: INT. JAMES@ BEDROOM - DAY
text: James goes through a dresser, opening and closing drawers.
dialog: They@re all
text: empty. He goes into the kitchen and finds a house key on the
dialog: table.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: Miranda has fallen asleep on the table. The waitress comes by and
dialog: touches her
text: arm. Miranda raises her head and squints at her.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You@ve been asleep for an hour. IT@ve been
dialog: watching your stuff, but my shift@®s over
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Thanks.
text: The waitress fills her coffee cup. Miranda looks down at the
dialog: table. Her
text: notebook is open; the page is filled with words. She looks at
dialog: them, as if for
text: the first time. She doesn@t seem sure if she likes what she sees.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - NIGHT
text: James comes into the caf@ and finds Lucy and Nick@s engagement
dialog: party in
text: progress. A singer onstage dedicates a song to the happy couple,
dialog: who sit ata
text: table near the back. James looks around for Miranda and, not
dialog: seeing her,
text: goes over to Lucy and Nick.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Is Miranda here?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No, honey, I@m sorry.
text: Lucy doesn@t want to have to tell him
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: She told me she was going back to New
dialog: York.
text: This is a blow, but James still has hope.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: She left this morning.
text: James deflates, his hope gone.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT@D)
dialog: Honey, why don@t you sit down. I@ll get
dialog: you some champagne.
text: James shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Beer.
text: Lucy nods and gets up. James sits down next to Nick.
speaker_heading: JAMES (CONT@D)
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: You want some advice from an old married
dialog: man? Don@t leave her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The important thing is you came back for
dialog: her. No matter what happens, you did the
dialog: right thing.
text: James finds this little consolation.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY@S CAF@ - NIGHT
text: Later that night. Kyle is onstage, performing a love song for
text: Lucy and Nick.
text: James has moved to the bar; he faces away from the stage.
text: Miranda walks in, carrying her guitar. She finds Lucy and goes to
dialog: her. Lucy
text: is happy to see her. They have a brief conversation, which we
dialog: don@t hear
text: because Kyle is singing. We now that Lucy tells her James is here,
dialog: because
text: Miranda looks over to where he sits. She looks apprehensive, then
dialog: takes a
text: deep breath and regains her resolve.
text: Kyle finishes his song. Lucy comes onstage and speaks into the
text: microphone.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Kyle Davidson. Thank you, Kyle.
text: Everyone applauds as Kyle climbs off the stage. He sees Miranda
dialog: waiting to
text: go on and grins, surprised and glad that she@s back. He hugs her
dialog: and we see
text: from the look on his face that he knows he@s really lost her now.
text: The applause dies down.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Now, this next performer is kind of
dialog: special to me, and I@m real glad she could
dialog: make it here tonight. Here she is,
dialog: Miranda Presley.
text: James turns around. Miranda sits on the stool and positions the
dialog: stand so that
text: she can read the pages she tore from her notebook. She looks
text: nervous, but
text: determined. She doesn@t look at James.
text: Miranda begins to play. She begins to sing the lyrics, looking
dialog: down and
text: reading them. The song she@s written is beautiful, and expresses a
dialog: personal
text: journey. She@s realized that she has to accept her painful
dialog: emotions before she
text: can experience joy. The song hardly resembles the one she
dialog: auditioned with
dialog: earlier, but the one line she said she didn@t understand is still
dialog: there, and fits
text: perfectly in the new version of the song.
text: The audience recognizes the beauty of this song. Most just enjoy
dialog: it, but we
text: see pride on the faces of Nick, Lucy, and Kyle. James looks like
dialog: someone
text: who@d fallen in love all over again. Miranda realizes that
dialog: everyone is listening
text: to what she has to say, and she loves it. She looks at James,
dialog: letting him know
text: the man she loves in the song is him. She finishes the song, and
dialog: there@s a
text: pause before everyone applauds. James@ seat is now empty. She
dialog: smiles
text: triumphantly and gets off the stage. She@s looking for James but
dialog: she doesn@t
text: see him. People are congratulating her, but she@s starting to
text: worry. Suddenly,
text: someone takes her hand. She looks next to her and sees James.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: I thought you had left.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I did, but I came back. I thought you had
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I did, but I came back.
text: She notices something in her hand.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT@D)
dialog: What@s this?
text: She looks; it@s a thin silver wedding ring.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I figured out the best thing to do with
dialog: the rest of my life.
text: She holds the ring out to him. Confused, he takes it back. She
dialog: presents him
text: her left hand, and he slips it on her finger. They kiss. When
dialog: they break
text: apart, James notices something behind Miranda. He puts his hands
dialog: on her
text: shoulders and turns her around to look.
text: Lucy opens up the case where she keeps original copies of special
dialog: songs, and
text: pins Miranda@s song up next to them. Miranda watches, smiling.
