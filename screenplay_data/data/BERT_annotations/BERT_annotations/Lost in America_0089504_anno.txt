scene_heading: 2 INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT
text: The house is empty except for Bekins boxes which are
text: packed. They are all over the rooms. The CAMERA
text: SLOWLY MOVES IN AND AROUND the boxes until we REACH
text: the bedroom.
scene_heading: 3 INT. BEDROOM
text: The bed is the only piece of furniture left. The CAM-
text: ERA STOPS. In front of the bed is a small black-and-
text: white television. In bed are DAVID and NANCY HOWARD.
text: Nancy is rolled over on her side. David is lying on
text: his back with his eyes wide open.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nancy? Nancy?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sleeping?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe we shouldn't move.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: Oh God. What's the matter now?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing. It's just time to ask
dialog: these questions.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No. We've sold our house and
dialog: bought another one. These
dialog: questions should have been
dialog: asked before.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, fine. I can't talk to
dialog: you. Good night.
text: David pretends like he's actually going to go to sleep.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (in a monotone; obvi-
dialog: ously she's had to
dialog: say this many times
dialog: before)
dialog: Stop it. You're nervous about
dialog: tomorrow. You'll get your
dialog: promotion, don't worry. We'll
dialog: move into our new house and we'll
dialog: be happy, okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Boy, you should hear yourself.
dialog: The excitement in your voice
text: just fills the room.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Look, I'm tired. Stop questioning.
dialog: We made a wise decision. Let's try
dialog: and feel good about it, alright?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good night.
text: Nancy tries to go back to sleep. David just lies
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: But why that house?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think it's too close to here.
dialog: It's going to feel like the same
dialog: place. Maybe we really didn't
dialog: think about this long enough.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We thought about it forever.
dialog: We wanted more space. That
dialog: house has more space.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, but the point of a house is
dialog: not just space. You can rent
dialog: space. Maybe we should've moved
dialog: into a completely different
dialog: neighborhood, a step up or
dialog: something. Maybe we should've
dialog: gotten a house with a tennis
dialog: court.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Why? We don't play tennis.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure we don't play tennis. We
dialog: don't have a court. When you
dialog: have a court, you learn.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, possibly some day, we'll
dialog: have a court and then we can
dialog: learn.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let me ask you one more question?
dialog: Why did we let Bekins do all of
dialog: our packing?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Isn't that a waste of money? We
dialog: could've packed ourselves. Maybe
dialog: we were too irresponsible.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I don't believe you. One minute
dialog: you want a tennis court, the next
dialog: minute you're worried about Bekins
dialog: packing a box? My God. Sometimes
dialog: I wish we really were irresponsible.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nothing. Look, get some sleep,
dialog: okay? You'll feel better.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't assume how I'm feeling.
dialog: What do you mean "nothing"? If
dialog: you're saying we should be more
dialog: irresponsible, I imagine you mean
dialog: we're too responsible? Is that
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, sometimes I think that we
dialog: are too controlled, yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I see. Well, tell me
dialog: something? How do you go out
dialog: and buy a four-hundred-thousand-
text: dollar house and let a moving
dialog: company pack everything and get
text: maids and servants and live the
dialog: good life and not be controlled?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It doesn't matter what I'm
text: talking about.
text: David gets up. He takes his pillow with him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm going to sleep in the garage.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Don't do that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why not? I'm responsible. I
dialog: should be guarding the car.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You're insane.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (yelling from
dialog: the kitchen)
dialog: You're right. I am insane. I
dialog: am insane and I'm responsible.
dialog: A very, very good combination.
text: We STAY in the bedroom with Nancy. She lies there.
text: Her eyes are open. She's staring straight ahead. She
text: looks sad. After a moment, David reappears at the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am not an animal.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am not an animal. I will not
dialog: sleep in the garage.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Just come to bed. Come on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sitting down on
dialog: the bed)
dialog: I apologize, okay? But don't
dialog: call me names.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What names?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know what names. Calling me
dialog: responsible is saying what? That
dialog: I'm closed up. I'm old. I'm
dialog: stodgy. That's not fair. I
dialog: don't like the way things are any
dialog: more than anybody else does but
dialog: what am I supposed to do? I'm
dialog: trying. What about you? You're
dialog: as responsible as I am. Personnel
text: Director for a department store is
dialog: not the most irresponsible job in
dialog: the world. Go hire anyone you
dialog: want. Think you'd be fired fast
dialog: if you did that? How much freedom
dialog: do you have? We're all in the
dialog: same boat. We're trying to make
dialog: something of ourselves and it's
dialog: hard. Okay?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You're very upset. I'm sorry I
dialog: used that word.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I'm glad you used that word.
dialog: It's honest but things are going
dialog: to get better. They're going to
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You always say that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, but this time it's different.
dialog: After tomorrow I'm no longer an
dialog: employee, I'm a Vice President.
dialog: I'll be my own boss. I'll have
dialog: a piece of the company. You see
dialog: what I mean? I can be more
dialog: irresponsible because I'll be in
dialog: a position of responsibility.
dialog: That makes sense, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I don't know. I guess it does.
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, go to sleep.
text: Nancy and David both lie down, each facing the oppo-
text: site direction. After a few seconds...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It does make sense and things
dialog: will work out, don't you think
dialog: so?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Nancy?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Asleep already?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Maybe men are supposed to fall
dialog: asleep last. It could be a
dialog: protective thing.

text: ing the face he's seeing is the one of his boss.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What can I say? I'd be a liar if
dialog: I tell you I'm surprised. I do
dialog: feel it's deserved but yes, I
dialog: still am flattered... That's very
dialog: nice. Thank you... Oh, stop,
dialog: please. I've never been good
dialog: at taking too many compliments
dialog: at once... Well, I feel the
dialog: same way about you.
text: Nancy walks in during this. She watches him for a bit.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (interrupting him)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (caught off guard)
dialog: Why? Nothing.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Who are you talking to?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not talking to anybody.
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm leaving now. Mr. Taft will
dialog: be there in twenty minutes.
dialog: Please be on time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wait a second. I can't do this
dialog: today. I can't choose tiles.
dialog: This is my big day. Please?
dialog: You do it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We're trying to do this together.
dialog: I think it's important.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm very nervous and it's your
dialog: kitchen anyway. You'll make
dialog: the right choice.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You're in the kitchen more than
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But I'm not thinking about
dialog: anything when I'm in the kitchen.
dialog: I don't really care.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We said we would make these
dialog: decisions together.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on. It's just today.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (exasperated, turn-
dialog: ing around and
dialog: leaving)
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please don't be mad.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm not mad.
text: After a moment, she comes back in.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Good luck. You'll get it. You
dialog: deserve it.
text: Nancy exits.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you. And I trust any
dialog: decision you make. You have
dialog: great taste.
text: There's no answer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing; call-
dialog: ing after her)
dialog: Really, you have great taste.
dialog: (turns back around
dialog: to the mirror)
dialog: I'm sorry. That was my wife...
dialog: Yes, she has wonderful taste.
dialog: She's going to choose the whole
dialog: tile thing herself. Originally,
dialog: we were going to do it together
dialog: but it's nice to be able to trust
dialog: someone, don't you think?...
dialog: Well, that's very nice. I trust
dialog: you, too. Hey!... When our house
dialog: is finished maybe you'd like to
dialog: come over and play tennis... No,
dialog: but we might put one in.

scene_heading: 6 INT. MAJOR ADVERTISING AGENCY - DAY
text: David is walking down the corridor towards his office.
text: He's saying "Hello"'s to various people. He comes to

text: the telephone. Obviously, she's making a personal call
text: and she hangs up abnormally fast as soon as she sees
dialog: David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: Ten-thirty.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (thinking aloud)
dialog: Ten-thirty, eleven, eleven-fifteen
dialog: okay. Susan, don't let any

scene_heading: 7 INT. ROBINSON'S DEPARTMENT STORE

text: office next door. All offices are separated by glass

speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Hi.
text: Nancy looks up from her desk.
speaker_heading: NANCY
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Is it beautiful?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: The kitchen. What does it look
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (half-heartedly)
dialog: I chose an orange tile.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Orange?
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: A burnt orange.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Sounds pretty.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: Patty, close the door.
text: Patty closes the door and sits down.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm going to hate this house.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: When the contractor left this
dialog: morning, I was all alone there
dialog: and I sat in the middle of the
dialog: living room and I got so sad. I
dialog: got this preview of the next ten
dialog: years, I just started shaking.
text: Patty just stares at her. She knows that Nancy is
dialog: serious.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm so unhappy. I don't like
dialog: anything anymore. I don't like
dialog: my job. I don't like my life.
dialog: I don't like anything. I feel
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nothing's changing. I'm not
text: growing. David's not growing.
dialog: We've just stopped. Life is
text: passing us by.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Listen, you've had a tough week.
dialog: With the moving and everything
dialog: you're very tired. When you get
dialog: tired you feel bad. Things seem
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm not that tired.
dialog: Do you know I've been hiring
dialog: girls who are nineteen years
dialog: old, who've already had more
dialog: experience out of life than I
dialog: have?
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: You don't know that. You
dialog: can't tell what a person has
dialog: experienced just by interviewing
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay. Let's forget it. I
dialog: really haven't thought this
dialog: through enough. I don't want
dialog: to discuss it now. Let's get
dialog: to work.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
dialog: to say the wrong thing. Have
dialog: you talked this over with
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Of course not. That's the
dialog: problem. I can't talk anything
text: over with him. It's hopeless.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Are you thinking of splitting
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, that's not my first choice
dialog: but what's the alternative? And
dialog: I'm not blaming David. I know
dialog: he genuinely believes that being
dialog: made Vice President is going to
dialog: change things. But he genuinely
dialog: believed that every promotion
dialog: would change things. It never
dialog: does. Maybe for a few days, but
dialog: that's it. Then things are
dialog: always the same.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Well, this is vice president.
dialog: Maybe this time it will change.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: And what if it won't?
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Then it won't. Then you get
dialog: divorced, I don't know. Whatever
dialog: you have to do.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Oh, God. Maybe it will.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: It will or it won't.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay. I'm starting to feel sick
dialog: to my stomach. Thanks for talking
dialog: to me. Let's just say maybe it
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Good. Because if it won't, it
dialog: won't anyway so what can you do?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We said we'd stop on "will."
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: We did. We've stopped. It will.
text: Patty hesitantly backs out of Nancy's office.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It will. It will work out.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, then tax, license, out-the-

dialog: are we talking about?... Thirty-
dialog: six thousand, five hundred and
dialog: twelve. Jesus! For a car... No
dialog: I know, a Mercedes. It's still
dialog: a car... Well, I don't care. To
dialog: me, if it has wheels, it's a car.
dialog: But that's not the point. Now,
dialog: that's everything, right? That's
dialog: it? You don't have to pay that
dialog: money and then be told that there
dialog: are options? No extras, everything
dialog: included... Come on! - For thirty-
dialog: seven thousand, leather is extra?
dialog: What kind of seats are in there?...
dialog: What is Mercedes Leather?... So,
dialog: why don't you just say vinyl?...
text: Okay, thick vinyl, but it's still
dialog: vinyl... Okay, these kind of
dialog: semantic arguments are silly.

speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you. Susan, I have another
dialog: one of these Mercedes guys on the
dialog: phone, he won't hang up. Would
dialog: you do something with him please?
text: David hangs up. He stands and walks over to a small
text: mirror. He straightens his tie, fixes his jacket and
text: carries on one more little conversation with himself
dialog: as the boss.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What can I say? I guess, thank
dialog: you... Oh, no. I can't take your
dialog: office. This is too nice.
dialog: Where would you sit?... Well, you
dialog: are a very generous man.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thanks, Susan.

speaker_heading: MARGARET

scene_heading: 10 INT. PAUL DUNN'S OFFICE
text: PAUL DUNN is one of the heads of the advertising agency.
text: He certainly holds the top position on the West Coast.
text: His office is large. It smells of success. Obviously
dialog: this is a man who has made a great deal of money and spent
text: it where people can see it. As David enters, he sees
text: Paul sitting behind his desk and a baldheaded gentleman,
text: BRAD TOOLEY, seated on the couch. Brad Tooley is in his
text: early forties, very well-dressed in the upper Eastern
text: advertising establishment manner. As David comes in,
text: Brad and Paul both get up.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (his hand out-
dialog: stretched)
dialog: Hello, David. How are you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm fine. I'm excited.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's wonderful.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: David, I'd like you to meet Brad
dialog: Tooley.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Brad, it's a pleasure.
text: David and Brad shake hands.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Brad has recently joined the agency
dialog: in New York. He was one of the best
text: men at Doyle, Dane and Bernbach.
dialog: We were lucky to get him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, that's exciting.
text: They all sit down again. David doesn't know quite what
text: to make of the fact that Brad is in this meeting. He
dialog: just assumes this is part of the ceremony of being made
dialog: vice president.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: David, I don't have to tell you
dialog: what I think of you. You know I
dialog: feel you're one of the most
dialog: creative people in this company.
dialog: I was telling Brad earlier the
dialog: accounts you've been responsible
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Very impressive. The Knudsen
dialog: Orange Juice campaign was one of
dialog: the best I've ever seen. Ever.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (he smiles; he's
dialog: in his glory)
dialog: Well, thank you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Brad has joined this company for
dialog: a very special reason. David,
dialog: we're going to get Ford.
text: David, now thinking of himself as the vice president,
dialog: realizes that Ford is an account of such proportion,
dialog: that the profit participation could be enormous. His
text: eyes widen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, my God! That's wonderful!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, it finally puts us at the
text: top of the heap.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm stunned. When did this happen?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Just in the last few days. You're
dialog: really the first to know out here.
dialog: We didn't want to say anything until
dialog: it was final.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's wonderful. Just wonderful.
dialog: God, what a week. What a week for
dialog: all of us.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It certainly is. Now, David...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Paul, you don't have to say
dialog: anything. As the new vice president,
dialog: I know what this means to the
dialog: company. I'm here twenty-four
dialog: hours a day.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: David, you're too valuable to
dialog: become vice president. I'd like
dialog: you to move to New York and work
dialog: under Brad. You two are going
dialog: to be in charge of Ford. You're
dialog: going to have to hurry, though.
dialog: You start in three weeks.
text: David is not quite sure what he's just heard. He thinks
dialog: maybe he's heard a compliment. He's heard a name of a
text: city, a car, some weeks, but he hasn't put it together.
text: He needs to hear it again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wait a second. You gave me too
dialog: much information. I'm valuable
dialog: and I'm vice president?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, David. I've hired Paul
dialog: Shubano as vice president.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: He's giving you quite a compliment,
dialog: David. I asked him for the best
dialog: man he had and he didn't hesitate
text: for a moment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He didn't? Well, I don't want to
dialog: move to New York.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I want to be the vice president.
dialog: I want to be a stockholder in this
dialog: company. It was promised to me.
dialog: I don't mind working on Ford.
dialog: Don't get me wrong. I think it
dialog: would be a joy to work on but I'll
dialog: work on it as vice president. I've
dialog: been here eight years, Paul. I
dialog: don't want to be transferred to
dialog: just another account.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This is not "just another" account,
dialog: David.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: It's Ford.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Brad, I know it's Ford. I've owned
dialog: Fords, okay? Now, Paul, I feel it's
dialog: only fair to keep your promise.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn't promise you anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wait a minute. What about these
dialog: lunches that we've been having
dialog: for the last four years? I believe
dialog: we talked about grooming me for
dialog: vice president. Phil Shubano's
dialog: been here only three years. Why?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, first of all, quite frankly,
dialog: he's not as clever as you. He's
dialog: more of an executive type.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, great. I think that's wonderful.
dialog: So, by being extra clever, I get
dialog: thrown out of the town that I live
dialog: in, with no promotion, no nothing,
dialog: and just shifted to another account.
dialog: He, on the other hand, because of
dialog: his low intelligence and short time
dialog: with the company stays here, gets
text: a large amount of stock and becomes
dialog: vice president. Well, that makes
dialog: sense!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You keep referring to this as
dialog: "another account." It's not.
dialog: It's Ford.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why don't you stop saying that?
dialog: You sound like Dinah Shore. Now,
dialog: damn it, look, this isn't fair.
dialog: (stops for a minute;
dialog: begins to laugh)
dialog: Paul, if I'm working myself up and
dialog: this is a joke, I'll kill you.
dialog: Are they going to burst in here
dialog: and say, "Surprise!"? Goddamnit.
dialog: You almost had me fooled!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No one's bursting in here, David.
dialog: I'm offering you something very big.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No one's bursting in here?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No? Oh God. But, wait a minute,
dialog: I'm vice president, right?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Stop saying no! Just a minute.
dialog: I can't go to New York. This is
dialog: my home. My wife and I live here.
dialog: I just bought a four-hundred
dialog: thousand dollar house. I'm
dialog: picking tile out at this very
dialog: moment. What am I going to do?
dialog: Burn it down?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don't worry about that, please?
dialog: You won't lose a penny on the house.
dialog: We'll take care of it. I think
dialog: Ford is more important than a
dialog: single family dwelling, anyway.
dialog: We'll get you more than you paid
dialog: for it. The important thing is
dialog: that you and Brad get along.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Me and Brad get along? Are you
dialog: crazy?
dialog: I've worked here eight years, for
dialog: what? For me and Brad to get
dialog: along? I was born in this city.
dialog: All my friends are here. I like
dialog: it. We're joking, aren't we?
dialog: This is a joke.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What do you mean, a joke?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean, a joke?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn't say a joke.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm going to New York City?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'd like you there in three weeks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, you would?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This can be a stepping stone to
dialog: something bigger, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's bigger than being vice
dialog: president? That's all I want.
dialog: Maybe I'm wrong, but I think I've
dialog: already stepped on every stone
dialog: we have here, haven't I?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, someday you might be vice
dialog: president.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Someday? What do you mean? It's
dialog: today. I've got it!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You don't have it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who has it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: David, I can't say this again.
dialog: Phil Shubano.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, obviously, I'm blocking this
dialog: man's name, aren't I?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: David, I don't know all of your
dialog: work, but I do know you've got to
dialog: be the best here or you wouldn't
dialog: be working with me on this account.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Brad, shut up! Don't talk! This
dialog: is my day. Paul, look what you're
dialog: doing. I've been with this company
dialog: a very, very long time. I'm one of
dialog: the oldest employees on this coast
dialog: aren't I? Now, I must get what I
dialog: deserve. I will be made vice
dialog: president and I will get the stock
dialog: and I will participate in the
dialog: ownership of the company and that's
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My God, I thought you'd be thrilled.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You thought I'd be thrilled? I
dialog: can't believe it. Why the hell
dialog: don't you go to New York? If it's
dialog: so thrilling, come on, I'll take
dialog: you to the airport. I'll put you
text: on a plane right now.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don't talk to me like that. I
dialog: came from New York.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, that's right and you don't
dialog: want to go back because as soon
dialog: as you land at the airport,
dialog: people steal everything you've got.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I resent that. That's a clich®.
dialog: New York's the greatest city there
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sit down. Just sit down and shut
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: David, that's enough.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I haven't even started yet.
dialog: Now listen, let's say a giant
dialog: mistake was made. Pretend none of
dialog: this was ever said. I'm the vice
dialog: president. Everything will be
dialog: fine. I'll stay here. I'11 work
dialog: on Ford. I'll move into my new
dialog: house. You and Brad can come
dialog: over for drinks. And now, let's
dialog: bring out Allen Funt and everybody
dialog: will yell, "Surprise," right?
dialog: I'm vice president, right?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: David, the position is filled.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, then you can go fuck yourself!
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (gets up)
dialog: Paul, I can't work with this man.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can't either. David, you're fired.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fired! How dare you? I can't believe
dialog: this! You want to know something?
dialog: I was nervous about coming in here
dialog: today. I said to my friends, "Maybe
dialog: I won't get this." You know what
dialog: everyone of them said? "Stop it.
dialog: You're being stupid. You're the
text: best man. There's no one else.
dialog: You're the best man." And what does
text: the best man do? He stands next to
text: the groom and watches the groom
dialog: become vice president!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I can see you're upset. I'll forget
dialog: what you said earlier. I don't think
dialog: you want to jeopardize eight years
dialog: with this company.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fuck you!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's it. Get out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wasted my youth for you and
dialog: for what? What do you mean
dialog: jeopardize eight years? What
dialog: eight years? All I did was live
dialog: for the future. Why didn't you
dialog: tell me a long time ago that I
dialog: was too clever? You should have
dialog: told me five years ago, then I
dialog: could've gone somewhere else.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn't know it five years ago.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't say anything else. I'll
dialog: kill you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (presses a buzzer)
dialog: Get me security, please.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I can't believe it. Security.
dialog: Okay, listen to me. I want my
dialog: eight years back! Give me my
dialog: life back! I want my eight years
dialog: back! Give them to me!
text: Paul stares at him. Brad gets up.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I'm going back to the hotel. David,
dialog: you're making a big mistake.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You don't even know me, you
dialog: baldheaded fart!
text: Brad stares at him and then walks out. He turns back to
dialog: Paul.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I can't believe that I almost
dialog: wasted my entire life here!
dialog: I've been waiting very, very
dialog: patiently and I realize now what
dialog: would've happened. This would've
dialog: gone on for years and years and
dialog: years and when I was seventy, I
dialog: would've gotten a watch. Actually
dialog: you wouldn't even have given me a
dialog: watch. You would've told me I was
dialog: too clever, that I would instinctively
dialog: know the time. You know something,
dialog: Paul? I made fun of my friends who
dialog: dropped out of college and went to
dialog: "find themselves." I told them they
dialog: were stupid. I laughed at them.
dialog: And what did I do? I went with
dialog: you. Good choice, wasn't it? What
dialog: did I get for doing that? A transfer.
dialog: I could've gotten that from a bus.
dialog: You're a human bus, Jesus Christ!
dialog: You liar! I don't know where those
dialog: drop-outs are today, but I've got
dialog: to find them! I owe them a big
dialog: apology. 'Cause let me tell you
dialog: something. They have more integrity
dialog: on their little tab of acid than
dialog: you have in your entire body, you
dialog: big fucking jerk!
text: A security guard enters.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (stands up)
dialog: Would you escort Mr. Howard out,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He doesn't have to escort me out.
dialog: I'm honored to leave.
text: David opens the office door. He begins to yell so
text: everyone can hear him. This is reminiscent of the
dialog: scene from "Network."
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Before I leave, I think it's very
dialog: important for everyone in this
dialog: company to know what went on in
dialog: here today.
dialog: I don't know how many lunches you've
dialog: all had with that man and I don't
dialog: know what he's said over salad or
dialog: dessert or whatever he buys you,
dialog: but you better not believe it!
dialog: He's a real smoothie! He'll tell
dialog: you about the stepping stones!
dialog: That's his favorite expression.
dialog: He'll tell you about the stepping
dialog: stones and where they lead. Well,
dialog: I found out where they lead! To
dialog: a baldheaded fat man in New York!
dialog: Get out! Get out now! Smell the
dialog: roses! Smell anything! Just smell!
dialog: Smell before it's too late!!
text: The office is applauding wildly. We HOLD on them for
dialog: a second.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 11 BEVERLY HILLS ROBINSON'S DEPT. STORE - DAY
text: David's car enters the parking lot at high speed. The
text: car screeches to a halt. He jumps out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 12 INT. ROBINSON'S MAIN FLOOR
text: David walks hurriedly towards the elevators oblivious
text: to the others.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 13 INT. J.W. ROBINSON'S - DAY
text: David is walking towards the personnel office. We've
text: never seen him like this before. He's alive. He's got
text: more than bounce in his step. It's as if he weighs 12
text: pounds. He's on another planet. He's smiling at every-
text: body. He has the look of a "Re-born." As he enters
text: the personnel department, he sees Nancy in her office.
text: Because Nancy's office is separated from the others by
dialog: a thin piece of glass, if you speak too loudly everyone
text: can hear. David is not about to lower his voice. He
text: has no concept anymore of volume. He's just too excited.
text: David bursts in.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nancy!
text: Nancy looks up.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: God, you scared me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nancy, come here.
text: (he pulls her up
dialog: by her shoulders)
dialog: Quit. Quit, right now. We're
text: getting out.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now. Quit.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Quit?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now. Come on. I did. Now, you
dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You did? You quit your job?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Surprised, aren't you? You wouldn't
dialog: have believed me. You would've loved
dialog: it. No more me. No more waiting.
dialog: No more responsible David. Jesus,
text: they were leading me down a dead-end
dialog: street! I've been on the wrong road.
dialog: I realize what you meant. I've been
dialog: too responsible. So responsible, God!
dialog: I've been responsibly blind!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I never would've used the word
dialog: responsible if I thought you would
dialog: have taken it so literally. It was
dialog: just a word. I really didn't mean
dialog: anything by it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Stop. Don't do this. Don't. I'm
dialog: giving you the credit. You did mean
dialog: it and you were right.
dialog: I don't know where the hell I've
dialog: been for the last ten years. What
dialog: happened to me? I lost the feeling
dialog: of life. Jesus, I was being jacked
text: off. Nancy, they were just jacking
dialog: me off!
text: David's voice is a bit loud. We can see people look from
dialog: other offices.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Honey, shh.
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: A little lower, please?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Okay. They were jacking me off.
dialog: (his voice starts
dialog: to rise again)
dialog: They were leading me down this road.
dialog: You know, this road?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What road?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The road to nowhere. You know the
dialog: road. The Nowhere Road. I was
dialog: being tugged along with this carrot.
dialog: "Come here. Come here. Come here."
dialog: But no one told me it was a fucking
dialog: cul-de-sac! We've been on the
dialog: wrong road.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Who was made vice president?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (laughing it off)
dialog: Oh, Nancy, that's all over now.
dialog: That's kid's stuff.
dialog: (in a childlike voice)
dialog: Vice President. Class Secretary.
dialog: Cloakroom Monitor. Treasurer.
dialog: They're all stupid.
dialog: (regular voice)
dialog: If you really want to know who
dialog: it was, it was Phil Shubano.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No! Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We'll never know. The Lord works
dialog: in mysterious ways, but if there
dialog: is a God, you know what will happen
dialog: to Phil? He'll get his profit
dialog: sharing and he'll buy a boat with it
dialog: and he'll crash the boat and die.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Stop it. You like Phil. You don't
dialog: mean that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course I like him, the under-
dialog: qualified son-of-a-bitch. Okay
dialog: I was harsh. He'll crash the boat.
dialog: He'll have a serious injury but
dialog: he'll recover. But forget about
dialog: Phil! Forget about the vice
dialog: presidency! That's the past.
dialog: Nancy, it's time to do it. We're
dialog: still young. We can change courses.
dialog: We can do what we should've done
dialog: years ago, what our smart friends
dialog: did. We can get out there. We
dialog: can get out and see this country.
dialog: We can find out what it's about.
dialog: We can touch Indians. We can live
dialog: in the mountains. We can do
dialog: anything we want to do. And we're
dialog: still young enough to really
dialog: explore. So come on, let's go.
dialog: We're late. I'll wait here. Go
dialog: quit. Come on. We're leaving.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I can't just quit right now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (looking at her with
dialog: a lust we haven't
dialog: seen before)
dialog: Oh, God, I want to fuck you. Come
dialog: on. Let's fuck, right here.
text: Nancy is trying, without success, not to call anymore
dialog: attention to this particular discussion.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (lowered voice)
dialog: We can do it later. There's a
dialog: lot of people around now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There's always going to be people
dialog: around. That was the problem.
dialog: We lived for them, not for us. It's
dialog: okay. There are some people you
dialog: want to fuck in front of and some
dialog: people you don't. Maybe you don't
dialog: want to fuck in front of these
dialog: people, I don't mind. I'll be
dialog: outside. You quit. I'll wait!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I can't quit now, even if I want
dialog: to. There is no one I can quit to.
dialog: My boss is not here. We'll
dialog: talk more about it tonight, please?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, but we're saved. Honey, we're
dialog: saved. Somebody up there likes us.
dialog: I don't know who it is, but we're
dialog: going to find them. We'll find
dialog: everybody who likes us. We'll start
dialog: finding people who understand what
dialog: life is all about. We'll find people
dialog: who are really searching. We'll find
dialog: people who are willing to take a
dialog: chance. Look, I'll just get all
text: excited and get into it all again.
dialog: You go and finish what you have to
dialog: do and then I'll see you tonight.
text: David exits. Nancy watches him go. She's expressionless.
dialog: She doesn't quite know what to make of this. You can
text: sense that part of her thinks that maybe her prayers were
dialog: answered, maybe this is how the marriage can be saved.
dialog: You can also sense that part of her isn't sure her husband
dialog: is sane. Maybe this won't last more than an hour and you
text: can sense the last part of her is still embarrassed that
text: the other employees she works with have heard words like
text: "fuck" and "jacking off." This is a woman of many parts.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 14 INT. THE HOWARD'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: David and Nancy are sitting on the floor.
text: They're surrounded by various maps, atlases and cata-
text: logues that show different pieces of property around
dialog: the United States, property that most people forget
dialog: even exist. These places look amazing in their little
dialog: pictures and, in fact, they might be amazing. It's
dialog: just that almost no one ever gets there to see them for
text: real. The longer Nancy has a chance to see what her
text: husband is saying, the more excited she becomes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (looking in one of
dialog: the catalogues)
dialog: Look at this. This is the cutest
dialog: farmhouse I've ever seen. Twenty-
dialog: four acres near Darien, Connecticut,
dialog: five bedrooms, eighty thousand
dialog: dollars? How could that be?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Because it's there. It's not here.
dialog: We're used to this city. You know
dialog: what our new house would cost, if
dialog: it were where this farmhouse was?
dialog: Not four hundred thousand, maybe
dialog: sixty thousand if we were lucky.
text: Nancy is still looking at pages in the catalogue. She
text: stops at one picture. She is fascinated.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: My God. Look at this. A converted
dialog: lighthouse in Maine, fifty-five
dialog: thousand, two bedrooms, a living
text: room, a kitchen, a playroom. How
dialog: do you put this into a lighthouse?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, maybe you go to Maine and
dialog: find out. Or you don't. You do
dialog: anything you want. Nancy, look
dialog: at this...
text: He opens a piece of paper, showing her the arithmetic
dialog: he has worked on all afternoon.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This seems to make sense to me.
dialog: You tell me what you think.
dialog: The one good thing about spending
dialog: all this time in Los Angeles was
dialog: that we got a free ride on this
dialog: bullshit inflation train. Don't
dialog: ask me how it happened, but we made
dialog: a hundred and ninety thousand dollar
dialog: profit by staying in this house
dialog: for less than five years. Now,
dialog: that was money we were never going
dialog: to see 'cause we were about to put
text: it back into another stupid house.
dialog: Okay. We pull out of that house,
dialog: we lose our fifteen thousand dollars
dialog: in Escrow, we take the money from
dialog: this house, we liquidate everything
dialog: else we have, cars, stocks, bonds,
dialog: everything... Nancy, we have two
dialog: hundred thousand dollars!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We couldn't.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We do.
text: David shows her the figures. As Nancy looks at the piece
dialog: of paper, he continues:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: All we need to buy is a motor
dialog: home and we should get a great
dialog: one because we might live there
dialog: for the rest of our lives, or
dialog: for five years or ten years or
dialog: whatever.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What do you think a motor home
dialog: costs?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Guess who went motor home shopping?
dialog: We can get a great one for twenty-
dialog: five thousand dollars. If there's
dialog: one thing you can get a deal on
dialog: it's a motor home. This is the best
dialog: time in history to drop out. It's
dialog: a buyer's market!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: So that would leave us a hundred
dialog: and seventy-five thousand dollars.
dialog: I can't believe it!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes! On that kind of money we
dialog: could ramble across the country
dialog: for years! We can paint, we can
dialog: explore, we can meet amazing
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: And if we get to Connecticut and
dialog: we like one of these farmhouses,
dialog: we'd have enough money to put a
dialog: down payment on it, wouldn't we?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes! Then if we get sick of that
dialog: we could sell it and move on.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'd like to go to Alaska.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Great! Alaska's great! We can
dialog: do anything we want.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: This is what we talked about when
dialog: we were nineteen!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. We talked about finding
dialog: ourselves but we laughed it off
dialog: because we had no money. Now
dialog: we can do it in comfort. We've
dialog: got our nest egg. This is a
dialog: dream come true.
text: Nancy has a tear in her eye. David sees it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's wrong? Are you okay?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We really can do whatever we
dialog: want to, can't we?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who's stopping us?
text: Nancy stares. She thinks about that question. She
text: can't come up with an answer. Finally, almost in
dialog: tears.

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You were great. Man, it was great.
dialog: It was like "Network" and "Take
dialog: This Job and Shove It," all rolled
dialog: into one. When you left, we all
dialog: wanted to go with you. Really.
dialog: People really had to think for a
text: minute. They were ready to leave.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did anyone else leave?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No. I mean after a few minutes,
dialog: people just went back to work
dialog: but for the moment, it was real
dialog: exciting.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, when the time's right, if
dialog: people want to leave, they will.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Of course. I believe that. I
dialog: got to be honest with you, though.
dialog: I was thinking about my situation
dialog: and I don't think I have the guts.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know that it's guts. It
dialog: just takes a certain kind of person.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah, maybe it has nothing to do
dialog: with guts. 'Cause I think I have
dialog: guts. I guess I'm not that kind
dialog: of person. Let's say that I like
dialog: expensive things and I guess I
dialog: need my job to get what I like.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whatever makes you happy.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Right. I guess expensive things
dialog: make me happy. These shoes make
dialog: me happy. Do you like them?
text: He shows David his shoes. They look very expensive.
text: For a moment, David forgets he will no longer partic-—
dialog: ipate in this world.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Beauties. What are they? Bally's?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: A Bally copy. Bally's would be
dialog: three hundred bucks. These were
dialog: a hundred and eighty. Can't tell
dialog: the difference. The sole's just
dialog: as thick. Look, feel the sole.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: Just for old times sake.
dialog: Jack
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, come on, I'm just playing with
dialog: you. Listen, I'll tell you
dialog: something. What you and your
dialog: wife are doing, well, it's wonderful.
dialog: Carol and I were driving over here
dialog: tonight, and talking seriously
dialog: about breaking the mold ourselves.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You bet. We haven't been that
dialog: happy lately. Have we, honey?
text: How can a person respond to this? Carol just stares
text: at him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I told her, if I can get some time
dialog: off, we're going to try to get down
dialog: to La Costa for a weekend and just
dialog: let it all out.
text: David now realizes that breaking the "mold" has many
dialog: different meanings to different people.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: La Costa? For a whole weekend,
dialog: huh? That's great.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's if I can get away. If not,
dialog: at least for an afternoon. Just
dialog: the idea of getting to San Diego,
dialog: maybe take in Sea World. Anyway,
dialog: did Nancy tell you what Robinson's
dialog: plans to do?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Actually we haven't talked too much
dialog: about American business lately.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, there is a rumor and I would
dialog: appreciate you not telling anyone
dialog: this, but our store may just be
dialog: buying up the May Company. This is
dialog: just the kind of expansion that can
dialog: make a man like me very, very
dialog: wealthy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, if it's good for you, I'm
dialog: real happy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, let's just say it could make
dialog: me a million dollars, minimum. But,
dialog: David, please keep this down. God,
dialog: I probably shouldn't have said
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack, we're not going to be around
dialog: people who will care. I promise
dialog: you. I don't think a guide at
dialog: the Grand Canyon knows or cares
dialog: too much about the acquisition of
dialog: a department store in L.A.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You want a surprise? You want to
dialog: know about the Grand Canyon and
dialog: business? The 7-Eleven at the
dialog: Grand Canyon does more volume
dialog: business per year than any other
dialog: 7-Eleven in the country, especially
text: around Muscular Dystrophy time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, that's good to know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I think it has something to do
dialog: with the hiking and the tragedy
dialog: of the children who can't hike.
dialog: I don't know, but last year they
dialog: did two million, eight-hundred
dialog: thousand. Now, of course, there
dialog: are no other quickie stores around
dialog: so they have a good one there. A
dialog: lot of people moving in and out
dialog: of that canyon. Have you seen
dialog: these new U-Tote-M stores?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jack, I don't want to be rude but
dialog: I can't talk business anymore. I
dialog: hate to sound "sixties" to you
dialog: but I'm in a different place.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, I understand. I remember
dialog: the sixties.
dialog: As a matter of fact, the concept
dialog: of U-Tote-M is a sixties concept.
dialog: See, the 7-Eleven is a rush-rush
text: place. U-Tote-M is lay-back. Their
dialog: store in Tarzana this year is
dialog: going to gross almost...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Jack, please?
text: Pete Hirsch yells from across the room.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'd like to make a toast.
text: People mumble, "Great." "Good." "It's about time."
text: Everybody gathers around. People raise their glasses
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: To our beautiful friends, David
dialog: and Nancy Howard... Good luck!
text: He drinks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's it, huh? What a well thought
dialog: out toast. Thank you, Pete.
text: People laugh. Scattered laughter around the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, I think it's time for me
dialog: to say something right now.
text: We hear a little applause. "Speech! Speech!"
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing; calling
dialog: Nancy over)
dialog: Sweetheart, would you come here?
text: David and Nancy stand together, arm-in-arm.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I have a surprise for my wife and
dialog: I would like to share it, not only
dialog: with her, but with you, who we
dialog: consider our closest friends. We
dialog: do have some other close friends.
dialog: I'm sure they got lost.
text: People laugh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: When Nancy and I were married we
dialog: had dreams and plans and I guess
dialog: in the pursuit of those things,
dialog: we kind of lost each other.
dialog: Tomorrow morning, when we leave
dialog: here, we have no destination.
dialog: Our only goal is to find out who
dialog: we really are and what it is that's
dialog: really out there. We're going to
dialog: be adventurers in the classic sense
dialog: of the word, but there is one place
dialog: that we will stop at first.
dialog: (reaches into his
dialog: pocket and takes
dialog: out a little box)
dialog: That place is Las Vegas, Nevada.
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: (her eyes open up
dialog: wide; excited)
dialog: Las Vegas? Really?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, if this is to be a new
dialog: beginning, I think there's only
dialog: one way to really show it to this
dialog: woman that I love. So, tomorrow
dialog: evening my wife and I are going
dialog: to be remarried.
text: People applaud. Nancy is overwhelmed. She opens the
text: little box and there is a ruby ring.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Oh, my God! Oh! My!
text: People are trying to get a glance at the ring. We can
text: hear OOHING and AAHING.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This is the most beautiful thing
dialog: you've ever done.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I'd like to say it was
dialog: nothing, but that small little
dialog: ruby cost a fortune.
text: People laugh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That's okay, it's budgeted for.
text: A little laughter again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And now, I would like to propose
text: a toast.
text: Everyone raises their glasses.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: To you, our loyal friends, we will
dialog: miss you. To my lovely new bride,
dialog: I want to know you all over again...
dialog: And to America, get ready. Here
dialog: we come!
dialog: Everybody drinks. As they do we...

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Boy, does this smell good. How
dialog: long did it take to melt this?
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: Twenty seconds.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Can you believe it? Boy! I
dialog: never really tasted melted cheese
dialog: on toast before. I must have
dialog: eaten it a million times, but
dialog: this is the first time I've really
dialog: tasted it. It's good and I bet
dialog: it gets better the further we
dialog: get from L.A.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We'll actually be breathing clean

dialog: how many years?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Forever. I hope we can recognize

text: Nancy smiles. This is certainly the best mood she's

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Last night was so nice, don't you
dialog: think? Those are good people.
dialog: We had good friends there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know. It's just that we weren't
dialog: good friends there.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Every once in a while I can't
dialog: believe what we're doing. Are
dialog: you scared? Be honest.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, not at all. Well, let's say
dialog: I'm scared in the same way
dialog: Columbus was scared.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Columbus must have really been
dialog: scared, huh? That took a lot
dialog: of guts, didn't it? What if
dialog: the world was flat? They really
dialog: didn't know anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I think he covered himself.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, let's say there was the Pinta,
dialog: the Nina and the Santa Maria. I'd
dialog: bet everything I have that Columbus
dialog: was in the Santa Maria. If the
dialog: world was flat, I think he'd watch
text: the Pinta and the Nina go. Then
dialog: he'd tell the Santa Maria to turn
dialog: around. He'd probably just go back
dialog: and have sex with the Queen again.
dialog: I don't think he was a complete
text: schmuck.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: So, actually, we're braver than
dialog: Columbus. We don't have two motor
text: homes in front of us.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's right. However, we should
dialog: keep our eye on that Buick ahead.

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Aren't you tired?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm excited.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You know what we should do? We
dialog: should get married tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why? We should get married now
dialog: and then drive out to the Grand
dialog: Canyon and have our second
dialog: honeymoon under the stars. What
dialog: could be better than that?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, here's what I'd like to do.
dialog: I'd like to get married in the
dialog: morning. We're trying to start
dialog: a new life. We should do it at
dialog: the beginning of a new day. We'll
dialog: both be fresh. We'll be up. We
dialog: can get married at the crack of
dialog: dawn.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That sounds nice. Alright. We'll
dialog: camp out some place tonight and
text: then come back before dawn. As
dialog: a matter-of-fact, these places will
dialog: be less crowded then. Good idea.
dialog: Nancy, you're a genius.
text: He starts the engine.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Are we sure we want to camp out
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 21
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Why don't we make tonight a real
dialog: old-fashioned honeymoon? Let's
dialog: go to the best hotel and get
dialog: the honeymoon suite and celebrate
text: our heads off.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sweetheart, we don't want to stay
dialog: in a Vegas hotel. This is what
dialog: we've left, this money-grabbing,
dialog: horrible society.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I agree, but one night? We'll
dialog: have room service and make love
text: in a big bed and watch porno
dialog: movies. I think it'll be fun.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We want to touch Indians.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We will. Just tonight and then
dialog: that's it.
dialog: Don't you want to take a bath
dialog: together in one of those big
dialog: tubs?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, okay.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: If you really don't want to, we
dialog: don't have to. We can camp out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, it's okay. As a matter-of-fact,

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My wife and I have dropped out of
dialog: society and we're making this
dialog: statement, but we want to spend
dialog: one last night here. We're
text: planning to get up at the crack

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (interrupting David,
text: she whispers to him)
dialog: Just ask him for the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (whispering back)
dialog: I'm getting to it. I know what
dialog: I'm doing.
dialog: (to the Clerk)
dialog: Anyway, we're going to get up
dialog: very early and get remarried
dialog: so we want something very special
dialog: because we're doing something
dialog: special. My point is, we'd
dialog: like your finest bridal suite.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Do you have a reservation?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I told you, we just dropped
dialog: out. We don't do reservation
dialog: things anymore. We're living
text: spontaneously.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Well, we're not. We thrive on
dialog: reservations and I'm sorry but
text: the bridal suite is occupied.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What other rooms do you have?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (to the Clerk)
dialog: Just a minute, please?
dialog: (she pulls David
dialog: aside, whispering)
text: The bridal suite isn't occupied.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NANCY
text: It's not occupied. I can see it
text: in his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Give him money.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Give him fifty bucks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We'll get the bridal suite.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Trust me.
text: David approaches the desk again. He takes out fifty
text: dollars. He puts it in the Clerk's hand, like he's
text: shaking hands with him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello, again.
dialog: (slips him the
dialog: fifty)
dialog: Do me a favor? I've worked with
dialog: computers. I know what can happen.
dialog: Sometimes these things get fouled
dialog: up. Would you check one more
dialog: time?
dialog: Maybe the bridal suite was empty
text: and the room next to it was occupied
text: and the computer got mixed up.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (takes a look)
dialog: I know what you mean. That can
dialog: happen sometimes. Let me check.
text: (he looks at the
dialog: reservation com-
dialog: puter for a moment)
dialog: Nope. It's occupied. These are
dialog: state-of-the-art computers. Very
dialog: rarely do we have those kind of
dialog: mistakes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're sure?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yes. Says right here, "Bridal
dialog: Suite full."
text: Nancy leans over and whispers to David.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Give him more.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus. Really?
text: Nancy nods yes. David turns back to the Clerk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Listen, I'm not very good at this.
dialog: I don't get good seats in shows
dialog: because of this problem. I don't
dialog: get good tables in restaurants.
dialog: I've really never been good at
dialog: this particular kind of exchange
dialog: of money so, how much do you
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: A hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fine.
dialog: (hands him more cash)
dialog: Here you go. A hundred.
dialog: Now, I assume we don't have to
dialog: continue this computer talk
dialog: again and say that it's working
dialog: now and everything?
text: The Clerk doesn't even bother to answer. He reaches
text: behind the desk and hands David his key.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Here you are, eight-twenty.
text: He rings for the porter.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now, this is the best bridal
dialog: suite?
speaker_heading: CLERK
text: Heart-shaped bed. Everything.
dialog: You'll love it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you very much. I'm sure
dialog: the hundred doesn't apply towards
dialog: the room at all.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You're kidding, right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course. I was kidding all
dialog: along.
text: David and Nancy leave the desk and walk towards the
dialog: elevator.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Tell me we didn't do the right
dialog: thing, getting out of this horrible
dialog: society? Jesus Christ, I told the
dialog: guy we dropped out. Did that make
dialog: any difference? No. I said we're
dialog: making a statement. What did he do?
dialog: Stare at me. I said we're getting
dialog: remarried. What does he finally
dialog: say? Give me more money. God!
dialog: How does a guy like that even live?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, think of all the people
dialog: checking in here. Everyone giving
dialog: him a hundred dollars, he probably
dialog: lives well.

dialog: No, I meant with himself. How
dialog: does he... Never mind.

scene_heading: 23 INT. BEDROOM SUITE - DESERT INN
text: David and Nancy enter. Apparently, the hundred
dialog: dollars was not quite enough. This could not be

text: are two twin heart-shaped beds. Above them, there's a
text: mirror, heavily-flocked with gold specks. The rest of
text: the room is decorated in standard red velour. Nancy is
text: disappointed. David is confused. He can't figure out
dialog: how any manufacturer could make a living turning out
text: twin heart-shaped beds.
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: I'll go down and get your luggage
dialog: for you. Where is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: you very much.
text: David reaches into his pocket and gives the man a dollar.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I haven't been here in years. I
dialog: hope this is enough. If it isn't,
dialog: take some from the clerk. I gave
dialog: him a hundred.
text: The Porter looks at David and walks out without saying
text: a word.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: So? What do you think?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think if Liberace had children,
dialog: this would be their room. Cute
dialog: little hearts, aren't they?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We should ask for a bigger bed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let's hold onto the cash we have.
dialog: I don't want any more favors.
dialog: We can try and push these together.
text: They try but they find very quickly that hearts don't
text: fit together. After a few attempts, they give up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Look, we can crawl over the
dialog: ventricles when we want to have
dialog: sex. It'll be exciting. Why
dialog: don't you order something up,
dialog: okay? Order up a great meal and
dialog: some great champagne. I'll go
dialog: run the bath.
text: David walks into the bathroom. Nancy sits down on the

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: How's the bath?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (walking out of
dialog: the bathroom)
dialog: There's no bath in there, honey.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I have no reason to lie to you.
dialog: Go look for yourself. There's a
text: very teeny, heart-shaped
text: shower and a medium sized, heart-
dialog: shaped sink. At best, we can
dialog: wash our socks together.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Are you disappointed?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Maybe we shouldn't order room
dialog: service. We should get dressed
dialog: and go down and check out some
dialog: of these restaurants. Hey, do
dialog: you want to see a show?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't want to leave the room.
dialog: I just want to be with you tonight,
dialog: here. It's our honeymoon. We
dialog: should order up like we planned
dialog: and then we can figure out a way
dialog: to make love. Somewhere in this
dialog: room, there has to be space.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay.
text: (gets up and walks
dialog: toward the bath-
dialog: room)
dialog: I'm going in to take a nice hot
dialog: shower, okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good. You get nice and sexy
dialog: because when you come out, we'll
text: pack and leave.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Come on. We're going to have fun.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm joking with you. Now, hurry
dialog: up, I'm getting horny. When you
dialog: come out, I'll be the naked one
dialog: on the right heart. I might even
dialog: be looking at myself in the mirror
dialog: and masturbating. Although, I
dialog: don't think I can see myself

speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: Howard, please.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE

dialog: on a lucky streak. Now, it's
dialog: not our place to stop her, but
dialog: possibly, you should.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean she's not been
dialog: on a lucky streak? She's losing?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, why don't you talk to her?
text: David runs back to the table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Honey, I want to talk to you.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Get away!
dialog: (to the Dealer)
dialog: Once again! Give me eight!
text: The Dealer spins the wheel. The ball goes around and
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Come on, baby. Come on, lucky
dialog: baby. Baby, baby. Baby, baby.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Eight it is.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (jumping up,
dialog: excited as
dialog: can be)
dialog: Yes! Great!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (now a little
dialog: excited himself)
dialog: Hey, that is great. You're a
dialog: winner.
dialog: (to Dealer)
dialog: How much was that? How much did
dialog: she win?
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Sixty dollars.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alright. Nothing wrong with that.
dialog: What's wrong with that? Now, what
dialog: does this man mean who says you
dialog: weren't on a lucky streak?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I was down earlier. Just go away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But you're up now, right?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm still down.
dialog: (to Dealer)
dialog: Eight again! And make it happen
dialog: for me!
text: David turns to the Man who spoke to him on the phone.
text: The Man is standing at a distance watching what's
text: happening with a slight look of pity on his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (walking over to him)
dialog: Boy, she keeps betting eight, huh?
dialog: How down is she exactly?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh, she's very, very down. I
dialog: don't know how much money you
dialog: have, but on the average I'd
dialog: say this is what we call "very
dialog: down."
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean? A thousand?
text: At this moment, we hear a GROAN from the roulette table.
text: The ball has dropped into double zero. David runs back
text: over. He sees the Dealer taking the chips off of eight.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Dammit! That keeps coming up,
dialog: that zero. Jesus Christ!
dialog: Now, once again, eight! Come back
dialog: eight! Come back, eight!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just a minute. Nancy, stop.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Please, David! Please! You're
dialog: bringing me bad luck.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, according to some people here,
dialog: I'm not bringing anything. You're
text: already having bad luck.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's changing! Now come on,
dialog: eight! Eight's my mate! Take
dialog: the bait, number eight.
text: The Dealer spins the ball. It drops into the number four.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Four.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: See what you did? Bad luck! Get
dialog: away, please.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This man over here says you're
dialog: very down. What does he mean?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Fuck the man! I don't know who
dialog: you're talking about.
dialog: (to Dealer)
dialog: Try it again! Eight!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nancy, stop betting eight. There's
dialog: hundreds of numbers on this table.
dialog: Why the hell do you keep betting
dialog: eight? Now, how much have we lost?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Everything. Come on, eight.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean everything? Did
dialog: you say everything?
text: At this moment, the ball falls into number nine. The
text: Dealer takes the last of Nancy's chips.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Goddammit! Son-of-a-bitch! You
dialog: can't get any closer to eight
dialog: than nine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (beginning to
dialog: take charge)
dialog: Come over here. Come with me.
text: He drags Nancy away from the roulette table. She turns
text: around. She's yelling at the Dealer.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Eight again! One more time!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There's nothing on the board.
dialog: You're not at the table. You
dialog: haven't placed a bet. Stop
text: yelling eight. He doesn't care
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I gotta find some money. Please.
dialog: I'm about to hit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, you're about to get hit. Come
dialog: on. We have some serious talking
dialog: to do.
text: David starts to pull Nancy out of the casino. He passes
text: by a one-dollar progressive slot machine with Nancy in
text: tow as BELLS START TO RING and LIGHTS FLASH. An OLDER
text: WOMAN has hit the jackpot and starts to scream.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I won!! I won!!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Look. She won... I want to play!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's too late. You chose the table.
dialog: Let's get out of here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 26 INT. COFFEE SHOP
text: They sit down at one of the tables. David looks a
text: little worried. Nancy is still frantic. She's mixed
text: up. She's also looking around for a Keno girl. She's
text: obviously in some sort of a daze.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, talk. What's going on?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: At two-thirty this morning, I was
dialog: up three hundred thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Three hundred thousand dollars?
dialog: That's a lot of money!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: More chips than you've ever seen
dialog: in your life. You wouldn't have
dialog: believed it. They were all over
dialog: the place.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But when I came downstairs they
dialog: were all gone. You didn't have any.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes, but I can get them back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let's wait on that for just a
dialog: second. So, everything is gone
dialog: and I'm trying to figure out the
dialog: word "everything." We had a
dialog: little bit of cash with us and
dialog: you lost that?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So, what did you do? You got
dialog: more cash?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So, you wrote a check then?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You started drawing cash from our
dialog: nest egg?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes. Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much of the nest egg did
dialog: you take? What's left?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, my God. By "everything" you
dialog: mean "nothing."
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You didn't lose a hundred and
dialog: eighty thousand dollars?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Maybe. I don't know. Give or
dialog: take a thousand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Give or take a thousand? Give
dialog: or take a thousand?
text: David is holding on to one of his testicles so as not
text: to kill this woman. This is the first time in his life,
text: where he truly can't comprehend what he has heard.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh my God! Oh my God! I understand
dialog: what we mean now. I understand what
dialog: we all mean. Oh my God! My God!
dialog: My God!
text: David puts his hand to his forehead. He looks around.
text: He's thinking. Something must be done. Something must
dialog: be done quickly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh my God! Alright. Let's not
dialog: panic.
text: David thinks of something. He stands up from the
text: table and yells as loud as he can.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Bellhop, please. Bellhop, in here,
dialog: please. There's an emergency!
text: He sits down, he's rubbing his head.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing. Just wait. Oh my God!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Sweetheart, there were these
text: Persians around me, staring at
dialog: all these chips that were on
dialog: the table and I've never had
dialog: that feeling before, the feeling
dialog: that I was completely in control.
dialog: I was the one. I didn't need
dialog: anything. I didn't care. I
dialog: didn't have any problems. Do
dialog: you know that feeling?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not now. I don't know that feeling
dialog: now, no.
text: The BELLHOP approaches.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: First of all, I was speaking to a
text: gentleman in the casino who seemed
dialog: to be in charge there. He's what?
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: The Pit Boss?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. What's his name?
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Mr. Shuster.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fine. Does he have an office?
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
text: Yes, it's behind the front desk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fine. Alright. Now would you
dialog: please do me a favor? My wife
dialog: is tired and would you escort
dialog: her to 820.
dialog: (hands the Bellhop
dialog: his room key)
dialog: Would you please sit with her,
dialog: maybe she'll want to take a shower
dialog: or whatever, and just don't leave
dialog: the room. I'll be up in a little
dialog: while. But please don't leave.
dialog: I don't want her to be alone right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Why are you treating me like an
dialog: animal?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll explain it to you later.
text: They all get up. They exit the coffee shop.
dialog: 27
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY OUTSIDE COFFEE SHOP
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (speaking to Nancy as
dialog: if she has just had
dialog: a nervous breakdown)
dialog: Just relax. Lie down, if you want.
dialog: Have some water. I'll be up ina
text: few minutes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Stop talking to me this way.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not talking to you in any
dialog: particular way. I'm just trying
dialog: to keep everything calm and I'm
dialog: trying to remain calm. I'm also
dialog: trying to think what I can do to
dialog: help us out now.
dialog: (to the Bellhop)
dialog: The man's name again? The Pit Boss?
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Shuster.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you.
text: They are now at the elevators.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: David, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Save it. Just go upstairs.
text: He leaves her at the elevators.
scene_heading: 28 INT. LOBBY
text: David walks very slowly towards Shuster's office. You
text: can tell he's thinking. He approaches the front desk
text: and clears his throat, trying to act dignified. The robe
text: diminishes this a bit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to the Clerk)
dialog: Mr. Shuster, the Pit Boss, may I
dialog: speak to him, please?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I don't know if he's in. Just a
dialog: moment.
text: The Clerk picks up the phone. He buzzes.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Yes. There's a gentleman here
dialog: to see you.
dialog: (to David)
dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm David Howard. He knows me,
dialog: we spoke on the telephone. My
dialog: wife was the one who was up for
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: David Howard. Yes. Yes.
dialog: (hangs up phone)
dialog: He'll be right out.
text: David stands there. He's thinking, staring straight
text: ahead. Out of an office emerges JACK SHUSTER, the Pit
dialog: Boss, the man we saw earlier. Shuster's a large man,
text: in his early fifties. He's as intimidating as his
text: job calls for. He looks like he might have killed
dialog: somebody once, and actually enjoyed it. He walks
text: over to David.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Mr. Howard? Come on in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 29 INT. SHUSTER'S OFFICE
text: David tries to compose himself even more as he follows
text: Shuster into his office. David's story is now formed.
text: He knows what he wants to say. He feels confident.
text: David enters the office. He sits down in front of
text: Shuster's desk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: First of all, let me say, I've
dialog: heard a great deal about you.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: What do you mean? From who?
dialog: What did you hear?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I just meant I've heard
dialog: wonderful things from everybody
text: in general, from the whole hotel.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Well, that's very nice. Thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, thank you.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Is your wife feeling better?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, she is.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: So, what can I do for you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I have a very interesting idea.
dialog: I think you'll be taken by it.
text: Shuster stares at him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I was a key executive with a major
dialog: advertising agency - one of the
dialog: biggest in the world.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Yes, right. So?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I was the Idea Man there.
dialog: So, when I say I have an interesting
dialog: idea, I'm not speaking like any slob
text: that walks in off the street.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (clearing his throat,
dialog: about to enter into
dialog: The Big Story)
dialog: My wife and I, we dropped out of
dialog: society. She had a very important
dialog: position in a department store and
dialog: again, I remind you that I was one
dialog: of the highest executives in the
dialog: world's largest advertising firm.
text: Shuster just stares at him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Anyway, we were going to find
dialog: ourselves. Then, we thought, maybe
dialog: we're too old, it's too late. We
dialog: can't find ourselves, that's only
dialog: for kids. And then we thought about
dialog: it some more and it hit us. Wait a
dialog: minute. Who's to say at what age
dialog: you stop being a kid?
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: You gotta have some age. How else
dialog: could a court separate rape from
dialog: fun? In this state, it's eighteen,
dialog: by the way.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. But my point is we wanted
dialog: to find ourselves and we did and
dialog: we dropped out, just like they
dialog: did in "Easy Rider."
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Easy what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The movie, "Easy Rider." Famous
dialog: movie. Important movie.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Didn't see that, I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's a classic. If it comes on
dialog: cable here, see it. Anyway, we
dialog: did something that no one has done
dialog: for a long time. Maybe no one has
dialog: ever done it because in the movie
dialog: they were movie stars, so they
dialog: didn't really do it, even though
dialog: they portrayed people that did it.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: I'm getting mixed up here. What
dialog: is your point?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, we did it for real. We
dialog: quit our jobs and we sold everything
dialog: that we had. The only thing we own
dialog: is our little motor home, which is
dialog: parked outside. That's all we've
dialog: got and we were going to spend
dialog: years roaming around this beautiful
dialog: country, but we knew we couldn't
dialog: do it unless we had our little
text: nest egg tucked away in the bank.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: I'm going off duty in a few minutes.
dialog: Now, your point is what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm getting to it. Why did we
dialog: come to Las Vegas? Because it was
dialog: a new beginning and I wanted to
dialog: remarry my lovely wife. That's
dialog: nice, don't you think?
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Very nice.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wanted to get remarried but I
dialog: wanted to spend our honeymoon in
dialog: the Grand Canyon, places like we
dialog: intend to spend the rest of our
dialog: lives in, but my wife is very fond
dialog: of your hotel and all of the
dialog: employees and she said, "Oh, come
dialog: on, let's spend our honeymoon here."
dialog: And we did and the room was very
dialog: lovely and everybody was very nice
dialog: to us, but my wife lost the nest
dialog: egg.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Mr. Howard, stop right here. I
dialog: think I know what you're getting at.
dialog: I realize you've lost a great deal
dialog: here and I want you to know that
dialog: your room and your meals are comped.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's very nice but that's not
dialog: exactly what I'm saying. I think
dialog: I have a multi-million dollar idea.
dialog: Now, you have to be very secretive
dialog: about what I'm going to tell you
dialog: because the other hotels, if they
dialog: heard about it, well, they'll grab
text: it in a minute.
text: David leans over Shuster's desk and whispers to make
dialog: the idea really sound secretive:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I think, as an experiment, you
dialog: give us back the money we lost.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, imagine the publicity? I
dialog: mean, the Hilton, for example,
text: they have billboards all over L.A.
dialog: where they put the faces of the
dialog: winners of those slot machines.
dialog: Now, those people win a couple
dialog: hundred thousand dollars, but the
dialog: hotel is getting millions of
dialog: dollars of publicity with those
dialog: billboards because people drive
dialog: by and say, "Gee, the Hilton looks
dialog: like a nice place. Look at those
dialog: smiling people." So, what about a
dialog: billboard with my wife and I on it
dialog: and we would be smiling and there
dialog: would be a saying, something like,
dialog: "These people dropped out of society,
dialog: they couldn't take it any longer,
dialog: but they made a mistake. They
dialog: lost their nest egg at The Desert
dialog: Inn, but The Desert Inn gave it
dialog: back." And maybe there could be
dialog: some kind of a visual with you
dialog: handing us an egg or something.
dialog: Now I mean, I'm just formulating
dialog: this now, as I'm talking, but you
dialog: can imagine, when it's worked
dialog: out how effective it could be.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: That's wonderful.
dialog: (he gets up)
dialog: Well, Mr. Howard, nice to meet
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean nice to meet
dialog: me? You said this is wonderful.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: We're kidding each other here,
dialog: right?
dialog: (starts to
dialog: laugh again)
dialog: I gotta tell you, this is one of
dialog: the best things I've ever heard.
dialog: What's the board gonna say again?
dialog: "Gamblers, come and get your
dialog: money back."
dialog: (he laughs)
dialog: Great. That's great.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: No. No. Wait... Not "Gamblers,
dialog: get your money back."
dialog: That's wrong. We're not gamblers.
dialog: We're the few people in society
dialog: that have tried to do something
dialog: with our lives. See? We're drop-
dialog: outs. We're finding ourselves.
dialog: Someone's got to help the few
dialog: people like us, because if they
dialog: don't, nobody will ever drop out
dialog: again. Nobody will ever have
dialog: the courage to find themselves.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Well, I understand what you mean,
dialog: but I don't think The Desert Inn
dialog: can help find you. I'm sorry, but
dialog: thank you for the idea and good
dialog: night.
text: He begins to escort David to the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (stopping him)
dialog: Listen, I've experienced this
dialog: before. I've had clients that
dialog: didn't understand the idea until
dialog: they saw it on television and
dialog: then they said, "My God! What a
dialog: brilliant idea! Why didn't I
dialog: understand this?" I might have
dialog: used the wrong phrase. Okay
dialog: picture this: maybe, my wife
dialog: and I will do a television
dialog: commercial for you and there
dialog: could be a jingle and it could
dialog: go:
dialog: (begins to sing)
dialog: "The Desert Inn has heart! The
dialog: Desert Inn has heart! The Desert
dialog: Inn has heart!" Something like
dialog: that. See what I mean?
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: That's a nice jingle. Mr. Howard,
dialog: let's assume you're serious here.
dialog: What if this caught on? Could you
dialog: imagine what would happen? Why,
dialog: we would have to return everybody's
dialog: losses. The casino would just
dialog: crumble. We couldn't pay our bills.
dialog: You know the casino accounts for
dialog: a great deal of our profits.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I understand. Of course, you don't
dialog: pay back everybody's losses. You
dialog: make a distinct division between
text: the bold, who are out there searching,
text: and all the other schmucks, who come
dialog: here to see Wayne Newton.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: I see. Now, I like Wayne Newton.
dialog: So, I fall into what category?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (realizing this was
dialog: not the best example)
dialog: Oh, look, I picked a name out of a
dialog: hat. I like Wayne Newton, too.
dialog: I'm saying a schmuck, representing
dialog: the gambler and a bold person,
dialog: representing me and my wife and the
dialog: one or two others that probably
dialog: wouldn't come here anyway. You
dialog: wouldn't have to do this more than
dialog: once or twice, there's not too many
dialog: bold people around. I think it was
dialog: a mistake to use entertainers as
dialog: the dividing line. We could find
dialog: another system. Anyway, what do
dialog: you say? We do need that nest egg
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: I say good luck to you and stay
text: away from the tables next time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, that's for sure, but come on?
dialog: Half the money, for courage?
text: Shuster opens up his office door. He escorts David out.
dialog: 30
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY AT FRONT DESK
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Mr. Howard, nice to meet you.
dialog: A pleasure.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hold it. What about "Miracle
dialog: on 34th Street?"
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Christmas picture, right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (now rambling on very
text: fast, desperate, rea-
text: lizing his plan is
dialog: about to fail)
dialog: More than a Christmas picture. What
dialog: happened there? Macy's didn't want
dialog: to send their customers to Gimble's
dialog: because the president of Macy's
dialog: thought they would lose all of their
dialog: customers and lose a tremendous
dialog: amount of money and it would be taken
dialog: wrong. But it wasn't taken wrong.
dialog: What happened? Macy's did much better
dialog: than they ever did before. And that's
dialog: what would happen to you. The Desert
dialog: Inn would do much, much better because
dialog: you would get Gimble's business and
dialog: the casino would be full.
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Well, I'm not too familiar with
dialog: that picture but didn't Macy's have
dialog: Santa Claus to help them out?
dialog: (he starts to laugh)
dialog: I mean, if they didn't have Santy
dialog: Claus there, they might have done
dialog: very badly.
text: He continues to laugh. David now starts to laugh along
text: with him, except David's laugh has a pitiful ring to it.
text: He senses this is not going to work.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. I guess they did have Santy
dialog: Claus. Well, thank you. Thank you.
dialog: And just so I understand, we can t
dialog: get any of our money back, right?
speaker_heading: SHUSTER
dialog: Well, not today, no. But if the
dialog: policy ever changes, we'll write
dialog: you.
text: (still chuckling as
text: he goes back into
dialog: his office)
dialog: That's wonderful. Very good.
text: He closes the door. The desk Clerk, who has just seen
text: Shuster laugh, turns to David, who is standing there
text: looking as bad as he's ever looked.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I think he likes you. He rarely
dialog: laughs at anything.
text: David just nods a sickly "thank you."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 31 EXT. MOTOR HOME - DAY
text: David and Nancy are driving. They are well outside of
text: Las Vegas. Nancy is staring out of the window. David
text: is driving in silence. Obviously, they have been driving
text: for a great deal of time without saying anything. Nancy
text: finally breaks the silence.
scene_heading: 32 INT. MOTOR HOME
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I can't take this. Say something.
dialog: Yell at me. Hit me. Drive off
dialog: the road. Do anything. Just stop
text: being so silent.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I have nothing to say.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I can't keep apologizing. I'm
dialog: sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
dialog: I feel horrible. I would do
dialog: anything to change it.
text: David says nothing. He just clears his throat.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You're going to make yourself
dialog: sick. It's unnatural. I
dialog: understand. If I were you, I'd
dialog: be furious. Don't hold it in.
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (looking at her)
dialog: I'm fine.
text: More silent driving. Nancy is desperately uncomfort-
dialog: able. Obviously, David is not fine. How could he be?
dialog: He's seen ten years of earnings dissipate in less than
dialog: three hours and he didn't participate in any of the
text: dissipation. After a while, Nancy tries a new approach.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Obviously, I can't apologize anymore
dialog: for what I did so we should talk
dialog: about what we're going to do.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And what would that be?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, our dream is still the same.
dialog: We just don't have any money.
text: David clears his throat again.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And, also, we should stop saying
dialog: we don't have any money. We do
dialog: have some.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (very patiently)
dialog: We have eight hundred and two
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: That's something.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It is something. Yes.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, look, I think we should
dialog: try to make the rest of the day
dialog: as pleasant as we can. Since
dialog: we're heading towards Hoover Dam
dialog: anyway, we should make that our
dialog: destination for today. We can
dialog: go there, look around, maybe
dialog: have a picnic or something, and
dialog: maybe just see the dam and just
dialog: have a nice day outside. What
dialog: do you think?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (staring straight
dialog: ahead, speaking
dialog: in a monotone)
dialog: Is that what you'd like?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Maybe it would be fun.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still staring,
dialog: still speaking
dialog: in a monotone)
dialog: Fine. Hoover Dam.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 33 EXT. HOOVER DAM - DAY
text: There are people walking around, tours going on and
text: children playing. The motor home pulls up. They park.
text: Nancy gets out with a bounce in her step, hoping David
text: might copy her. David gets out like Frankenstein,
text: walking very slowly, with no expression.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Look at this! Come here. God!
dialog: Just think. Men built this!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still with no
dialog: expression)
dialog: Yes. Men did build this.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What about something to eat?
dialog: Hungry?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm starved.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't think you can eat now.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because with the little bit of
dialog: money that we have left, I think
dialog: we have to sit down and make up
dialog: a new budget. Until we do, maybe
dialog: we shouldn't spend it all on
dialog: cotton candy and other various
text: knickknacks here at the dam.
text: Nancy is beginning to get irritated and frustrated that
dialog: he will not talk to her like an adult.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, if that's your attitude,
dialog: I think you should give me half
dialog: the money and let me eat whatever
dialog: I want and you can do what you
dialog: want with your half. I think
dialog: that's the fair thing.
dialog: People
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (the release of his
dialog: anger now begins)
dialog: The fair thing? The fair thing?
dialog: That's it! You're right. I've
dialog: been controlled! Boy, have I
dialog: been controlled! I guess any
dialog: doctor could have spotted it.
dialog: I was about to die, I was so
dialog: controlled. You took all the
dialog: money we had!
text: can hear this echoing for miles around.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing; now
dialog: yelling)
dialog: You took our nest egg and you
dialog: broke it up! You got yoke all
dialog: over the casino! You got the
dialog: white all over the coffee shop!
dialog: You threw the shells in the
dialog: parking lot! Fair? Fair?!
dialog: Where was I when you were
text: playing with the egg? Sleeping.
dialog: Sleeping. Goddammit!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Good. Get it out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shut up! Don't talk to me like
dialog: I'm an insane patient!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Let's just go back inside. You
dialog: can yell at me. You should, I
dialog: think it's right. I just don't
dialog: want you to yell out here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Out where? This is where we're
dialog: going to have to live. Why not
dialog: yell out here? We're going to have
dialog: to do everything else out here.
dialog: We'll be sleeping out here and
dialog: eating out here and going to the
dialog: bathroom out here! Get used to
dialog: this cement, baby! This is it!
dialog: Out here is it! We found ourselves!
dialog: We found ourselves, alright! We
dialog: found ourselves with eight hundred
dialog: dollars in the middle of nowhere!
text: Nancy walks away. She sees a crowd that is gathered
text: around and she does not want to have an argument in
text: front of these people. David follows her.
scene_heading: 34 EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - HOOVER DAM VISITOR AREA
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I don't want to have an argument
text: in front of those people.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why not? I think those people
dialog: are entitled to know how stupid
dialog: you are.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: This is going to turn into a
dialog: personal attack, isn't it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What else? A general attack? Who
dialog: am I going to attack? Nevada? I
dialog: can't attack the state. It wasn't
dialog: their fault. I can't attack the
dialog: motor home. It stayed in the
dialog: parking lot. I can't attack me.
dialog: I was fast asleep. By process
dialog: of elimination, who's left?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I am. I'm left, okay? And I'll
dialog: say it one more time - I'm sorry.
dialog: They are off by themselves now. They have reasonable
text: privacy. They are both very upset.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't want your apologies. I
dialog: want to know why? I want to try
dialog: to understand how it happened. Tell
dialog: me. How did it happen?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You couldn't sleep. I see. Now,
dialog: I remember nights where I couldn't
dialog: sleep. I'm just trying to think
dialog: what I did. Let's see. I tried
dialog: warm milk or I took a long walk or
dialog: I took Nytol and then, if all that
dialog: didn't work, I gave away all the
dialog: money I ever earned. But you
dialog: didn't try any of those things
dialog: first. You just gave away the
dialog: money first, right? What did you
dialog: intend to do? Have warm milk
dialog: afterwards? Tell me. I'm mixed
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You're not even listening.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry. You're right. Go
dialog: ahead. You couldn't sleep. Then
dialog: what happened?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I don't remember. I just went
text: downstairs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why didn't you wake me up?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What would you have done?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What would I have done? I would
dialog: have followed you.
dialog: I would've seen you. I would have
dialog: watched you take your money and
dialog: begin to lose it and I would have
dialog: stopped you at thirty dollars,
dialog: maybe thirty-two dollars, at the
dialog: most. I would have said,
dialog: "Sweetheart, come back to bed.
dialog: We don't want to fool with our
dialog: nest egg." You know, Nancy, I
dialog: think you just considered nest
dialog: egg to be a term but to me, it
dialog: was a key to this whole experiment.
dialog: Why, I considered it like a third
dialog: person. It was our best friend,
dialog: our guardian angel. It was going
dialog: to allow us to do everything we
dialog: wanted to do. It was going to
dialog: watch over us during bad times
dialog: and laugh with us during good times.
dialog: It was going to help us roam and
dialog: purchase and eat and explore. It
dialog: was going to help us make love
dialog: and laugh and cry and now, it's
dialog: gone and who's got it? The Desert
dialog: Inn! They've got our nest egg.
dialog: They can sure use it, can't they?
dialog: They don't have their own. They're
dialog: a poor little organization. They
dialog: need our nest egg. Gee, I hope
dialog: they use it wisely. I know someday
dialog: those mirrors are going to have
dialog: to be reflocked and the red velvet
dialog: was looking kind of worn. And
dialog: those little heart beds are going
dialog: to need new sheets. I'm glad we
dialog: could help them pay for that. I'm
dialog: glad our life savings will go
dialog: towards making that room look a
dialog: little prettier. I'm glad we
dialog: gave it all to them, Nancy. I'm
dialog: just going to miss the little nest
dialog: egg, that's all. Won't you,
dialog: sweetheart? Won't you miss the
text: nest egg? In the middle of the
dialog: night, won't you feel kind of
dialog: lonely because little nest egg
dialog: is paying for the gas in Frank
dialog: Sinatra's limo?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Shut up, David!
text: (begins to cry; she's
dialog: getting hysterical)
dialog: Shut up! I don't want to hear nest
dialog: egg anymore! I don't want to hear
dialog: that word. Let me tell you something.
dialog: That's not the way you drop out
dialog: anyway. If you're really going to
dialog: drop out, you drop out with nothing!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You drop out with nothing? Oh
dialog: where did you read that? In the
dialog: Las Vegas Guide?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I didn't read that. I know that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I see. Who told you?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Friends, people who know. I don't
dialog: have to answer you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. You don't have to answer me.
dialog: You can't answer me because no one
dialog: ever told you that. You never
dialog: had friends who dropped out. You
dialog: don't know anybody who dropped
dialog: out except for us. So how the
dialog: hell did you know that? Come on,
dialog: tell me?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Alright. The movie you're basing
dialog: your whole life on, "Easy Rider,"
dialog: they dropped out with nothing.
dialog: They had no nest egg.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Bullshit. They had a huge nest
dialog: egg. They sold cocaine. They
dialog: didn't get on their motorcycles
dialog: till their nest egg was giant,
dialog: fifty times the size of ours.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, look. I'm not going to stand
text: here, in front of one of the seven
dialog: wonders of the world and argue about
dialog: an old movie. I'm going to go now
text: and get back in the motor home and
dialog: maybe you can wander around out here
dialog: and figure out something to do. We
dialog: have eight hundred dollars left and
dialog: an entire lifetime. See what you
dialog: can come up with.
text: David starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We could sell cocaine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (stops and turns
dialog: around)
dialog: Well, my God. Why didn't I think
dialog: of that? Great idea. As a matter-
dialog: of-fact, I remember after seeing
dialog: "Midnight Express" I went out of
dialog: the theater saying to myself, "That's
dialog: for me. Sex with hundreds of
dialog: Turkish men."
text: David turns around and walks towards the motor home.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Come on. Let's go.
text: Nancy doesn't go with him.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No. Forget it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Forget what?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Forget everything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You know, I'll tell you one good
dialog: thing that came out of all of this.
dialog: We forgot to get remarried. That
dialog: was one good thing that happened
dialog: and no one has mentioned that yet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm saying that if we got remarried
dialog: it would be much more difficult to
dialog: get divorced. Now it's easy. It's
dialog: over. I'll just stay in Nevada for
dialog: six weeks and then we'll be legally
dialog: through. This is how it should
dialog: have happened anyway, David. We
dialog: were stupid to think it could have
dialog: happened any other way.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you really believe that?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You bet your life I do. I realize
dialog: now, you're never going to let me
dialog: forget this. For the rest of our
dialog: lives, you'll blame me and I won't
dialog: take it. So, goodbye. I'm sorry.
dialog: It didn't work out.
scene_heading: 35 EXT. SIDE OF ROAD
text: Nancy walks to the side of the road and sticks out her
text: thumb. David walks after her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you expect to do? Where
dialog: do you think you're going?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I still have my dreams. I'1l have
dialog: to find somebody else who understands
dialog: them a little bit better and then
dialog: I'll start over.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay. Enough is enough. I
dialog: understand your dreams. You said,
text: "Explode." I exploded. It's done.
dialog: Now, come on. Let's not act stupid.
dialog: I'm over it.
dialog: We see
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (crying)
dialog: You'll never be over it. I know
dialog: you. You're right. I'm stupid.
dialog: You don't want to be with a
dialog: stupid person so leave me alone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: None of your business. Now get
dialog: out of here, please.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You told me to be angry. You said
dialog: it was unhealthy not to be angry.
dialog: You'd be angry, too. God knows
dialog: you'd be angry.
text: a car approaching in the distance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
text: Nancy, there's a car coming and
dialog: there's a man in there who looks
dialog: like an animal. Now if you don't
dialog: put your thumb back, he's going
dialog: to pick you up and if he picks
dialog: you up, you're going to be in
dialog: his car. I don t know him. You
dialog: don't know him. We don't know
dialog: where we are, so why don't we
dialog: stop acting like this?!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Goodbye.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What is happening? You said it
dialog: fifteen hundred times, "Get
dialog: angry." I got angry. I thought
dialog: I got angry well. I'm over it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Sure you're over it. You're
text: still yelling.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm yelling because you're about
dialog: to get in someone else's car!
text: An old Chevy pulls over. A guy in his late thirties,
text: large, ugly, RED-NECK-looking fellow says to Nancy:
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: Where ya headin'?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: With you.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: Alright. You got it. Come on.
text: Nancy gets in the car. David starts to run after them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: This has gotten out of hand. Look
dialog: around you, Nancy, you're in another
dialog: car! That man is not me! Nancy!
dialog: I apologize! I'm sorry!
text: David stops yelling. He just stands there for a minute.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing; to
dialog: himself)
dialog: Listen to what I'm saying. I was
dialog: sleeping and I'm yelling I'm sorry.
dialog: What's going on? Jesus Christ!
dialog: She's going to get killed!
scene_heading: 36 EXT. ROAD TO HOOVER - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY
text: David runs back to the motor home. He starts the
text: engine. David tries to catch up to the Chevy. The
text: Chevy's gotten a large lead. He goes faster but it
text: doesn't help. He loses the car.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 37 INT. MOTOR HOME
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: I've lost my wife in the desert.
dialog: This is just silly. You lose
dialog: your wallet or your keys but I've
dialog: lost a whole woman.
text: David continues to drive. After a short while, he spots
text: a road stop, a gas-food-rest stop.
text: There's a small restaurant. He spots the Chevy. He
text: pulls in. David gets out of the motor home. Through
text: the window, he can see this Red-Neck and Nancy sitting
text: at a table.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 38 INT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT
text: David walks in. He approaches the table where Nancy
text: and the Red-Neck are sitting.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nancy, I think we should go.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: I don't think she wants to speak
dialog: to you, buddy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've known her for a long time.
dialog: I think I would rather have direct
dialog: communication with her. Nancy,
dialog: come on.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: I said she don't want to talk to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're leaving now, okay, honey?
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: You're not listenin', are you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm listening. This is my wife.
dialog: It's between her and me. Nancy?
dialog: We're going to work things out
dialog: now. Thank this gentleman for
dialog: the ride and let's go.
text: Nancy says nothing. The Red-Neck stands up. He is huge.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: Mister, I'm gonna count to three
dialog: and I want you out of here. One...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nancy, this man's counting. Who
dialog: is he?
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: Two.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Honey, there's one number left.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: Three.
text: The Red-Neck takes David by the shoulder and starts to
text: lead him outside.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let's go. You and I, we have
text: some fighting to do.
text: David is being shoved outside. He looks back at Nancy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is this what you want? Is this
dialog: what was supposed to happen? I'm
dialog: now going to be killed by a gorilla?
text: David and the Red-Neck are outside. Nancy realizes
text: David is probably right. He will be killed. She gets
text: up. She runs after them.
scene_heading: 39 EXT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT
text: By the time she gets outside, David is already being
text: punched in the stomach and then in the face. In be-
text: tween punches, David is yelling to Nancy:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Call him off! He'll obey you!
dialog: Tell him it's alright!
text: The Red-Neck is now really angry.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: I hate you. I'm going to kill you.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It's okay. Stop. Please? Thank
dialog: you for the ride but we can handle it.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: You're out of this now. This is
dialog: between him and me.
dialog: I haven't hated somebody so much
dialog: in a long time. He reminds me
dialog: of everything I hate.
text: David is on the ground. The Red-Neck picks him up.
dialog: Nancy,
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: Come on. Come on. Let's really
dialog: go at it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is going to disappoint you
dialog: but I have really gone at it.
dialog: I haven't had a fight since I
dialog: was in the third grade. I'm just
dialog: not used to it. Nancy, tell him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Please! It's okay. My husband
dialog: and I had a fight but we can handle
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: I said get out, lady. I'm ona
dialog: mission now.
text: realizing that she can't stop the fight, begins to
dialog: scream:
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Help! Help! Police! Help!
dialog: Murder! Help!
text: People start to come out of the restaurant. This is more
dialog: attention than the Red-Neck wanted.
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: Well, look at this. A woman has
dialog: to help you by yelling for the
dialog: police. Well, if I wasn't wanted,
dialog: I wouldn't care. I'd stay here
dialog: and beat the shit out of you, but
dialog: right now I can't afford to see
dialog: the police. But I'll get you. I
dialog: don't know where or when, but I'll
dialog: get you, mister.
text: The Red-Neck starts to walk back to his car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Yell "Police!" more. Keep yelling.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Police! Police!
text: We see the Red-Neck hasten a bit. He starts his engine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: More. Yell. Yell. Police!
dialog: Help! Help!
text: The Chevy pulls out. The Red-Neck yells back:
speaker_heading: RED-NECK
dialog: I'll get you.
text: David is holding his jaw.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That man will spend the rest of
dialog: his life trying to find me. I'll
dialog: be killed, Nancy.
text: Nancy helps him towards the motor home.
scene_heading: 40 INT. MOTOR HOME
text: They get inside. David is holding his jaw.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Are you sure you're okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, I'm okay. Next time, if
dialog: you're going to hitch, get a ride
dialog: with a small woman, will you?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I'm proud of you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For what? Getting beat up?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: For rescuing me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I had no choice really. I
dialog: thought about just forgetting it
dialog: and finding someone new, but I
dialog: realized I had nothing to offer
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: David, listen to me... We're going
dialog: to be alright.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I hope so. Maybe we will.
text: David starts the engine. The home slowly begins to
dialog: move.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What do you think we should do
dialog: first?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: First? First, I think we fill this
dialog: thing with gas so we can get as far
dialog: away as possible from that mental
dialog: patient. Then, I guess we'll head
dialog: east. We'll drive until we finda
dialog: place we both like and that'll be
dialog: our new home. We'll start there
dialog: and we'll begin to rebuild.
speaker_heading: 41A
dialog: thru
dialog: 41c
dialog: A)
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I swear to God I think this is a
dialog: blessing in disguise. The whole
dialog: idea of going to Las Vegas was to
dialog: get remarried so we could have a
dialog: new beginning, right? Well, that
dialog: would've just been a ceremony. Now,
dialog: we really are starting from the
dialog: beginning. I think this way is
dialog: much better.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I hope it is. But since we
dialog: really will never know the other
dialog: way, let's not compare.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: But after all, the whole purpose
dialog: was to find ourselves and to be
dialog: free and now we really are free.
dialog: The other way...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Hold it, honey. Another comparison,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, I'm just excited. I think
dialog: this is a blessing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It very well might be. All I'm
dialog: saying is let's just let our
dialog: original plan rest in peace.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ARIZONA HIGHWAYS
text: We see the motor home driving along. In the
text: background there is MUSIC. As they head east,
text: the sun slowly is setting behind them. After
text: various SHOTS of David and Nancy moving along
dialog: the desert...
text: B) ... we finally see them pass a sign that says,
text: "WELCOME TO PRESCOTT, ARIZONA."
text: C) They drive on further until they pull up toa
text: trailer park. The sign above the park says
text: "PRESCOTT TRAILER PARK." He stops. He pulls
text: the motor home into this park. He sticks his
text: head out the window, as if to feel the climate.
dialog: It feels right.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 42 INT. MOTOR HOME
text: The sun has set. This is where they've chosen to live.
text: Nancy is lying on the bed as David is at the kitchen
text: table, figuring out the money they have left.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, so, gas and the payment
dialog: here and the electricity hook-up,
dialog: the water hook-up, lunch... Oh my!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Three hundred and twenty dollars.
text: He takes that amount out of his pocket. He lays it out
text: in front of then, like a magician doing a card trick.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There it is, sweetheart. That's it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Okay. Let's call this "emergency"
dialog: money. We'll get jobs right away
dialog: so we don't have to touch this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Absolutely. This money we seal away.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We'll both have jobs by tomorrow.
dialog: It's going to be good.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We have no choice. We have to
dialog: have jobs by tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We should celebrate tonight.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Celebrate what?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: This! This is the real beginning!
text: David sits there. He smiles. He's staring at Nancy.
text: After a while he feels a little uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's the matter? What are you
dialog: staring at?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your legs. They look different.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Different?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: They look longer.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You're joking, right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I have long legs, remember?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Remember what?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: That was the first thing you
dialog: ever said to me. You said I
dialog: had sexy long legs. That was
dialog: before you even asked me my
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My God. You're right. We talked
dialog: about your legs for a long time
dialog: before your name came up. Was I
dialog: rude?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You were great.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You didn't think I was so sexy
dialog: the first time you saw me, did
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes I did.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes I did.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No you didn't.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes. I remember I told you I
dialog: thought curly hair was very,
dialog: very sexy. I said I liked your
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, sweetheart, you said curly
dialog: hair was sexy and then you asked
dialog: me if that was my own hair.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, I was shy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't worry. I took it asa
dialog: compliment.
text: Nancy smiles. David walks over and gives her a passionate

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 43 EXT. MOTOR HOME
text: We hear MOANING. We see the home rocking gently back
text: and forth. Older people who live in the trailer park
dialog: start to come out and watch this new residence move
text: from side to side. Some have folding chairs, others
dialog: have picnic baskets. This is one trailer park that
dialog: hasn't yet put in cable television. So, to these
dialog: people, this is entertainment they so badly needed.
dialog: We SLOWLY...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO:
scene_heading: 44 INT. MOTOR HOME - NEXT MORNING
text: David is still in bed. Nancy is almost dressed. She has
text: an extraordinary amount of energy.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: David, I love you. That was the
dialog: best. It was amazing.
text: David is a bit dazed. Obviously they've had the best sex
dialog: of their lives. It's given her energy. It's made him a
text: little confused.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It never happened like that in
dialog: L.A. I wonder why?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We stopped having sex in L.A.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That must be it.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Seriously. What do you really
dialog: think happened? What did we do
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't think it had anything to
dialog: do with us.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What was it? The air?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe. My guess is extreme poverty.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well, then I say we should stay poor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look, I was just guessing. I think
dialog: we have to make some money, we don't
dialog: want to starve to death and then find
dialog: out it really was the air. We'll
dialog: feel so stupid.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I have so much energy. I can't
dialog: wait to get out and just explore
dialog: this city. I'm going to get a
dialog: great job. I know it.
text: David gets out of bed. He puts on his robe.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Me, too. Now, I think we should
dialog: have some kind of a plan. What do
dialog: you say we look for work together?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I don't think so. I think we
dialog: should go in separate directions.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We'll cover more territory.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alright. That sounds right. Good.
dialog: Good idea.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Let's say we meet back here no
text: later than five o'clock.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Five o'clock. Good.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (kissing him)
dialog: I can't wait for five o'clock.
text: Nancy exits. David stands at the door calling out to
dialog: her:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good luck! Go for the high pay!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And buy a cheap lunch!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Don't worry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The delivery job, I'm interested
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: This is for your son?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, for me.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: For you? Well, you have your own
dialog: car? -
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Gee, I'm sorry, but it's a delivery
dialog: job. You would need a car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I have transportation. I
dialog: own a motor home.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: A motor home?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: I don't really think that would
dialog: suit this particular job. I have
dialog: just a few small deliveries a
dialog: day. Those things aren't too
dialog: efficient and you probably wouldn't
dialog: be able to pay for gas with what
dialog: I'd pay you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I didn't know I'd have to pay
dialog: for my own gas.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Yes. Actually, my intention was
dialog: to get a high school kid with a
dialog: Rabbit or something.
dialog: I think an older man with a motor
dialog: home would be impractical for the
dialog: both of us. You understand, I don't
dialog: have that many deliveries. Also,
dialog: you'd have trouble parking. I
dialog: don't think this would work out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: You know what I should do? I should
dialog: cross out "man" and put "boy,"
dialog: "delivery boy" is more correct.
dialog: I guess "delivery man" is misleading.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, the sign's alright. It looks
dialog: fine. You don't know of any
dialog: immensely high-paying jobs in the
dialog: immediate area, do you?
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Um, let me think. No, not in the
dialog: immediate area.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What about in the outlying areas?
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Uh, no. I don't know of any high-
dialog: paying jobs anywhere in the whole
dialog: country. Do you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Um, no. Not now. Well, good day.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Good day to you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is there an employment agency in
dialog: 47

speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Yes. Just continue down this

dialog: miss it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EMPLOYMENT OFFICE
text: It's a small employment agency befitting a small town.
text: David is just sitting and waiting his turn along with
text: various other types. David looks a little out of
dialog: place in that the others look like they want some job
text: relating to alcohol. The AGENT steps out of a small
text: glass cubicle and asks David to step in. David does
text: and sits down.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: So. What can we do for you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I'm originally from Los
dialog: Angeles and I'm now living here.
dialog: I need a job.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Alright.
text: He takes out a piece of paper and begins to write down
dialog: information.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What was your previous working
dialog: experience?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, for the last eight years I
dialog: was a major executive with one of
dialog: the biggest advertising agencies
dialog: in the country.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Oh, I see. And your previous salary?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Seventy thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: AGENT
text: (looks up; he hasn't
dialog: heard this figure
dialog: in a long time)
dialog: You said seventy thousand?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Over how long a period are we
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A year. Seventy thousand a year.
text: The Agent begins to laugh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Nothing. That's very good. So,
dialog: what brings you around these parts?
dialog: Trying to double up that income?
text: Agent laughs again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I came here to live. I
dialog: wanted to change my life.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: You couldn't change your life
dialog: on seventy thousand?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Could we just get back to what
dialog: we're doing here?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Sure. Uh, I don't think I have
dialog: anything at all right now. I
dialog: mean the only thing I have, you
dialog: wouldn't be interested in. Why
dialog: don't you check back with me in
dialog: a month?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, you don't know what I'd be
dialog: interested in. Why don't you just
dialog: tell me what you have?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: I don't think that coming from
dialog: your position and your salary
dialog: you'd be interested in it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, you don't know me. What is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: AGENT
text: It's a crossing guard.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A crossing guard? You mean at a
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Yes. Where else do you see them
dialog: work?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I just didn't know if there
dialog: were different kinds. Well, what
dialog: does that pay?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: A hundred thousand dollars.
text: He starts to laugh. David laughs along with him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But, really, what does it pay?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: It pays three twenty-five an hour,
dialog: plus benefits.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Benefits meaning what?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Benefits meaning you can get a
dialog: ride to and from work if you need
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, listen, I've just started
dialog: looking for work and I don't want
dialog: to rule anything out but I think
dialog: I probably can find something where
dialog: I can use my ability a bit more.
dialog: Would you have another kind of
dialog: file, like an executive box or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: What kind of box would that be?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know, a box of higher-paying
dialog: jobs.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: My goodness, I forgot. Sure.
dialog: You mean the hundred thousand
dialog: dollar box?
text: Agent begins to laugh again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Well, I'm happy I could provide
dialog: you with your morning's entertainment.
dialog: You can laugh at me but let me
dialog: tell you something. I made a
dialog: statement. You understand what
dialog: I'm saying? I made a statement.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: A statement?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Never mind. Thank you.
speaker_heading: AGENT

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Well... alright. I would be
dialog: an assistant manager.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus! After one day? Assistant
dialog: manager! Where?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: That's all I'm saying. The manager's
dialog: thinking it over. He said he'll let
dialog: me know tomorrow. I don't want to
dialog: jinx it. Now, come on. Let's hear
dialog: about you. What happened?
text: David can't get over the words "Assistant Manager." His
dialog: own search hasn't brought him words of that caliber.
text: He hedges.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I'm not saying anything
dialog: either, but I'll also know in
dialog: the morning.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I gave you a hint, you have to
dialog: give me one.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't. I have too many leads.
dialog: I've had many firm offers and
dialog: right now I'm just mulling them
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What kind of offers?
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Now, I don't have the sign here,

dialog: on one side...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Yes. Go on the other.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No. If you're going to interrupt
dialog: me I'm not going to be able to
dialog: explain it. It's stop an one
text: side and stop on the other. It's
dialog: just a stop sign. So, when you
dialog: want people to go you'll have to
text: hide the sign.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's right. I remember. You
dialog: just put it down so people can't
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: That's right. Behind your back
dialog: is generally the best place.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. I think, basically, this job
dialog: hasn't changed since I went to
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Aren't you a little young for this
dialog: kind of work?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't think so. Why?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, all the other guards here
dialog: have been in their late sixties or
dialog: seventies. We had one who was
dialog: fifty once but that's as young
dialog: as I can remember.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, times are changing. I
dialog: mean stereotypes have to be
dialog: broken sometime, don't they?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I guess they do. I never thought
dialog: they did but yeah, I guess they do.
dialog: Okay. Happy to have you here and I
dialog: guess all you should know is that
dialog: some of these children are rude.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, all children are rude.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, these children are a little
dialog: ruder than they used to be. You
dialog: see we had this cutback in the
dialog: school lunch program and sometimes
dialog: they're hungry. And you know what
dialog: happens when you're hungry? You
dialog: get a little bit ornery. I guess

speaker_heading: CHILD #1
dialog: Screw you!
speaker_heading: CHILD #2

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, my goodness. More hungry
dialog: children. You want to cross the

speaker_heading: OLDER KID #1
dialog: Yeah, Retardo.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My name is David. I would appreciate
dialog: not being called that name. It's an
dialog: ugly name.
speaker_heading: OLDER KID #2
text: Ugly name for an ugly face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I see no reason to walk future
text: prisoners across the street. Why
dialog: don't you get some practice working
dialog: on your own right now since you'll
dialog: probably be in solitary most of your
dialog: life. You can handle it.
speaker_heading: OLDER KID #2
dialog: No, man. That's what you're paid
dialog: for. Come on. Take us across the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I can't take you across the
dialog: street and, also, I'm allowed to
dialog: make judgments. If I think someone
dialog: shouldn't be allowed to cross the
dialog: street I'm allowed to deny them
dialog: that privilege. So, if you want
dialog: to cross, you'll have to cross on
dialog: your own.
speaker_heading: OLDER KID #2
dialog: Hey, no. No, man. You work for
dialog: us. Let's go.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean let's go? Is
dialog: that a threat? Be careful. I've

speaker_heading: OLDER KID #2

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Knife wins. Come on.

text: electrically lowered. A GUY, in his early 30's, calls
dialog: to David.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Mister?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Call me David. I'm your age. I
dialog: look a little older because I'm

speaker_heading: DRIVER

dialog: place?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean?

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DRIVER

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You have to get on Highway 90. So,
dialog: what you do is go down about two
dialog: miles, you'll come to a stoplight,
dialog: you turn right and keep going and
dialog: you'll see a sign.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Two miles down and then right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Thanks, man.
speaker_heading: DAVID

text: starts sniffing, rather intensely.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What are you doing? Stop doing
dialog: that. Get away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: I'm just smelling the interior.
dialog: This is leather, isn't it?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: It's Mercedes Leather. They call
text: it leather but it's vinyl. Smells
dialog: like leather, though. Huh?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still sniffing)
dialog: Yeah it does. You like this car?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What's not to like? Hey, thanks,
dialog: man. See ya.
text: He floors it and tears off into the distance. David
text: watches the car slowly disappear. He's still sniffing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: It smelled like leather. They
dialog: must spray it with something.
text: Interrupting David's thought is a CHILD'S VOICE coming

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: my friends call me. Hey, your wife's
dialog: really something. Man, I think what
dialog: you're both doing is amazing. She
dialog: told me all about it. It's really
dialog: great. You've got a lot of courage.
dialog: It blew my mind. I'll tell ya, man,

speaker_heading: SKIPPY
dialog: Hey, thanks. Well, you know the
dialog: fry machine? We were never using
dialog: it right. See, no one ever told
dialog: us. I mean we did everything the
dialog: instructions said. You know, we
dialog: put the oil in and everything, but
dialog: we took the fries out, like, much
dialog: too soon and no one knew. And
dialog: your wife said, "Hey, these are
text: frozen in the middle." And then
dialog: we took them outside and we looked

dialog: I know. I feel the same way.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, my God, that's wonderful.
dialog: I mean the experiences that we
dialog: went through in the last two weeks,
dialog: it did that. It showed us that
dialog: we're going to be married forever.
dialog: Nancy, we're together for the rest
dialog: of our lives and I'm so grateful
dialog: to finally have that peace of
dialog: mind. It's wonderful.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I told you this would all be a
dialog: blessing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know you did. But now, let's
dialog: talk facts. Our nest egg broke.
dialog: Forget who did it, no blame.
dialog: That's not the point. The point
dialog: is we didn't split up.
dialog: We stayed together and decided to
dialog: rebuild. And it was the best
dialog: decision we ever made. Because
dialog: for the first time we really know
dialog: how to share. Whatever we have we
dialog: can enjoy it together.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: But we don't have anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There! Now we're getting to it.
dialog: This afternoon I was guiding some
dialog: children across the street and I
dialog: realized something. Given our age,
dialog: and the years we have left together,
dialog: and the way we're going about this
dialog: rebuilding program, we will never
dialog: have another egg in our lifetime.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: I was thinking the same thing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Yes. As a matter-of-fact, I began
dialog: thinking what we might do to speed
dialog: things up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's amazing. So was I. Denver?
dialog: Is that what Denver is about?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No. Not exactly. I was just kind
text: of thinking of a general plan.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Great. What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, you tell me yours first.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: No, you go first.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I'm almost embarrassed to
dialog: tell you, mine's like a last resort.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Don't be embarrassed. What is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay. I thought we'd just get to
dialog: New York as fast as we can...
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: And you eat shit?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your plan too, huh?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We really are a team.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: We certainly are.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 54 EXT./INT. MOTOR HOME - MONTAGE - DAY
text: It does a fast U-turn away from the northern direction
text: and begins heading east. They are now on their way
text: to New York going as fast as they can. As they do the
text: THEME from the commercial "I LOVE NEW YORK" BEGINS TO
text: PLAY. It grows and grows in intensity as David and
dialog: Nancy cross the United States. Their trip from Arizona
dialog: to New York will take place in a space of about thirty
text: seconds. States whiz by. Signs "ENTERING MISSOURI"
scene_heading: "LEAVING MISSOURI" "ENTERING VIRGINIA," "LEAVING
text: VIRGINIA," all taking place in a period of seconds. The
text: MUSIC is getting more intense. It's now filling our
text: ears. VOICES BEGIN SINGING, "I LOVE NEW YORK."
scene_heading: 55 EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NEW YORK CITY -
speaker_heading: SNOW - DAY
text: We see the mobile home approaching the George Washington
text: Bridge. As it enters the tollbooth we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 56 EXT. MADISON AVENUE - SNOW
text: It's Monday morning, 8:45. Thousands of New Yorkers
text: are filing into their offices. We see the motor home
text: pull up in front of the advertising agency. Hundreds of
text: people are entering this building. We see that one of
dialog: these people is Brad Tooley, the baldheaded man David
text: was supposed to work under. From a LONG SHOT, we see
text: David exit the motor home. He's still in his crossing
text: guard uniform. He's been up for three days, taking No
text: Doz and drinking hundreds of cups of coffee. He looks
text: like hell. He runs down the street and corners Brad
text: near the front entrance. Brad sees David. He's scared.
text: He can't believe it. He starts to run. He tries to
text: escape. David turns after him. All this is shown ina
text: LONG SHOT, with the busy Madison Avenue traffic in the
text: foreground. We hear David yelling:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Brad, I made it! Three weeks on
dialog: the button! Let's go to work.
dialog: We got Fords to sell!
text: Brad looks frightened. He'd like to get away but he
text: can't. David catches up to him. He grabs him around
text: the waist. He drops to his knees. He begins to plead.
dialog: As New Yorkers pass by going about their business, we
text: see David begging. Brad just staring down at him.
text: OVER THIS SCENE the following CRAWL appears on the screen:
dialog: "Most people lead their entire lives
dialog: without ever having the courage to
dialog: break the mold, to find out who they
dialog: really are and what life is all about.
dialog: Those that do should take Route 16.
dialog: This goes through Utah, avoiding the state
dialog: of Nevada completely."
