scene_heading: INT. NELSON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: VINCE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Almost. Meet you in twenty.
scene_heading: INT. NELSON'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA - DAY
text: He hangs up the phone, and takes a deep breath. He is in

speaker_heading: NELSON

speaker_heading: VINCE

speaker_heading: BEATRICE

speaker_heading: NELSON AND VINCE
dialog: Morning, Beatrice.
scene_heading: INT. JABE AND DUNNE - NELSON'S OFFICE - DAY 11
text: A temple of California corporate cool, the place looks
text: like a hip playpen for a kid who never grew up.
text: Nelson immediately settles down to work, furiously typing
text: new copy into his computer as Vince nervously peers over
text: his shoulder to observe the changes, wants to distract
dialog: him, change subject.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Hey, did you hear? Edgar Price is
dialog: coming out of retirement. Says
dialog: everybody's ripping him off; might

text: rip himself off.
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Edgar Price, huh? He's great.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Remember that Mercedes spot he

dialog: (folds hands together
dialog: as if in prayer)
dialog: Genius.
speaker_heading: NELSON

speaker_heading: NELSON

dialog: your help --
dialog: (pauses )
dialog: Client's gonna love ‘em.
text: By now they are inside the room and Nelson is quickly

speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Sort of. Reschedule.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: The deadline to renew is today.
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: So let it expire.
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: It was expired when you got the
dialog: ticket. That's why you have to go.
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Beatrice, I don't have time for
dialog: this. Wait till the
dialog: presentation's over...
speaker_heading: BEATRICE
dialog: If you don't renew today, they'1l
dialog: suspend your license, which means
dialog: the next time you get pulled over,
dialog: they can throw you in jail. And I
dialog: bet you don't have time for that,
dialog: either.

speaker_heading: VINCE

scene_heading: INT. DMV - DAY 12

text: salami log under Nelson's chair...
speaker_heading: PROCTOR
dialog: If you need to go to the bathroom,

speaker_heading: SARA

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What?! 30 days! That's a long
dialog: time -- that's so unfair! I

speaker_heading: NELSON

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: How'd the test go? Hope you

dialog: Here, call my secretary, she'll

text: She takes the card, peers quizzically at it.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Is this quest for redemption
dialog: coming from true remorse, or are
dialog: you just worried that my sitting

speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: The dent, I guess.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: That's what I thought.
text: There's a flicker of recognition in her eyes, as if she

dialog: mutters:
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Just for the night.

scene_heading: INT. SARA'S LOFT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NELSON

speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: That, too.

text: then guiltily peeks to see if Sara's around, muttering:
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Nice cat... nice kitty...
text: Sara's gone. Nelson abruptly drops the cat -- it streaks

text: Nelson jumps out, throws on his boxers, momentarily
text: puzzled -- where's the rest of his clothes? Grabs his
