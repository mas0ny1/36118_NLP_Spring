dialog: That New York City No More"..
text: We're in midtown. The 15TH PRECINCT BUILDING.
text: DETECTIVE TONY CARUSO, JR. pulls up out front. He gets out
text: and starts up the steps. Then he pauses.
text: He's noticed some LITTER on the sidewalk. A plastic cup or
text: fast-food wrapper. Tony picks it up, and dutifully drops it
speaker_heading: into a TRASH CAN.
text: Then he continues up the steps. Through the doors. To start
dialog: work.
text: NOTE: This credit sequence will ALTER SLIGHTLY each episode.
text: As Tony arrives for work, he'll stop and perform a DIFFERENT

scene_heading: EXT. POLICE TRAINING FACILITY- BRONX, NY- DAY
text: BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!
text: CLOSE ON: a PAPER TARGET, a SILHOUETTE OF AN ARMED THUG. The
text: shooter's aim is PERFECT. A tight cluster, around the heart.
text: We're at Rodman's Neck, a huge training facility in the
text: Bronx. It's like a Hollywood backlot. Fake buildings. Mock
text: bad guys. Another TARGET swings into view. The shooter
dialog: spins! BLAM BLAM!
text: The shooter is LT. TONY CARUSO JR, lead detective on New
text: York's elite All-City Homicide Squad. A man of quiet

scene_heading: INT. TRAINING FACILITY- MAIN OFFICE- LATER
text: Tony is at the counter. The range supervisor, SGT. CHET
text: FINCH, a weathered, veteran cop, tallies up his score.
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH

dialog: 800.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He probably cheated.
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: I know he cheated.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. TONY'S CAR- INTERSECTION- BROOKLYN- NIGHT
text: It's late. Tony and his father are driving home.
text: BIG TONY is a natural-born hustler. Irreverent. Shameless.
dialog: We don't want to love him, but we love him.
text: They're stopped at a RED LIGHT. The streets are empty.
dialog: Brooklyn is dead. You would run this light. So would I.
text: Anybody would. But Tony is a boy scout. Obsessively honest.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: You can go.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The light's busted. You can go.
text: Tony doesn't move.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT’D)
dialog: It's been busted all week.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm gonna give it a minute.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: You don't believe me?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: If you told me you were lying, I
dialog: wouldn't believe you.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: That's very funny. That's a nice
dialog: way to talk to your father.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I talked to Chet Finch. He said
dialog: you crushed it at the range on
dialog: Saturday.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You talked to Chet Finch?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: It didn't surprise me. You could
dialog: always shoot. Remember Boy Scout
dialog: camp? You won all those medals-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Badges.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Badges. Whatever.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: If you were there, you would know.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: I wasn't there. I was a shitty
dialog: dad. But it doesn't matter now
dialog: because we're both gonna die
dialog: tonight in this car. They're gonna
dialog: find us tomorrow, staring at that
text: facacta light, dead of starvation.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're not supposed to have contact
dialog: with anyone in the department.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: It wasn't contact.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's a condition of your parole-
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: It wasn't contact. We weren't
dialog: exchanging bodily fluids. We
dialog: talked for ten minutes.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's contact! Conversation is
dialog: contact! Especially with Chet
dialog: Finch. He was on your crew, for
dialog: God's sake.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Someone buys me a Heineken, I'm
dialog: gonna sit down. That's how God
dialog: made me. Especially if they're
dialog: bragging on my boy.
dialog: 4.
text: A CAR behind them HONKS impatiently.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT’D)
text: Now they're honking.
dialog: (Tony doesn't move)
dialog: You can go. You're a cop.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Exactly. I'm a cop.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: You think running a red light is
dialog: gonna turn you into me?
text: Tony doesn't respond. Or move. HONK HONK. HONK. HONK.
scene_heading: EXT. AMBROSE PARK- QUEENS- DAWN
text: Early morning. TWO TEENAGERS on DIRT BIKES roar through the
text: park. CYCLISTS and JOGGERS scramble out of their way.
text: There's something up ahead, lying across the trail. Holy
text: shit! It's a BODY! The FIRST BIKER swerves! He wipes out!
text: The Biker recovers, and takes a closer look. The Dead Man
text: has been shot in the chest. Multiple times. And there's a
text: BLACK PLASTIC BAG over his head.
scene_heading: EXT. CARUSO HOUSE- BROOKLYN- SAME TIME

text: We PAN THE WALLS. PHOTOS of EVAN, his 8 year old son.. books
dialog: on Forensics, Abnormal Psychology.. medals and citations.

text: are old newspaper articles: HIT AND RUN KILLS MOTHER OF TWO.
text: And DIAGRAMS and PHOTOS of the corner in Queens where she was
dialog: killed.
text: The ALARM CLICKS ON. It plays his favorite music, BOSSA
speaker_heading: NOVA.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER
text: Downstairs. Big Tony is a foodie. He's preparing a multi-
text: course gourmet Italian breakfast, while talking on the
dialog: phone. .
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Diagonally? What does that mean?
dialog: So diagonally is bigger? So the
dialog: next time I measure my pecker I'm
text: gonna measure it diagonally.
text: Tony enters.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT’D)
dialog: I'll catch you later. The girl
text: from Ipanema just woke up.
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: That was Wendell Kirk. He just
dialog: found us a new TV. A 62 inch
dialog: Vimeo.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: We don't need a new TV.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: It's a gift. What was I supposed
dialog: to say? Sit down. Tony, sit. The
dialog: first thing every cop learns: never
dialog: pass up a real breakfast. You
dialog: catch a case, who knows when you'll
dialog: eat again.
text: Big Tony lovingly serves his son breakfast. They're
text: basically an old married couple. Tony eats a muffin.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT’D)
dialog: You can't eat that dry. Put some
dialog: butter on that.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: When's your interview?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
text: About ten.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: Not "about ten". Ten. It's ten.
dialog: It's a job interview. You should
dialog: get there early.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Will you relax. You're making the
text: coffee nervous.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm just saying. Gabby went to a
dialog: lot of trouble-
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: She's Gabby now?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (embarrassed)
text: Gabriel. Inspector Vasquez.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: How cozy is that? My son and the
dialog: bitch who can't wait to throw me
text: back in jail.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm not involved with your P.O.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: I'm not blind. I was at the
dialog: release hearing. I had to step
dialog: over your tongue to get out the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Do you have a shirt?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Yes I have a shirt.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: With a collar? A real shirt?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Yes. With a collar. Who's the
dialog: parent here?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Exactly.
text: During this, Tony fiddles with a handheld BALL AND STRIKE
scene_heading: COUNTER. CLICK CLICK CLICK.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: For Evan's little league game.
dialog: They asked me to umpire. Four
dialog: o'clock. And you're coming.
dialog: (Big Tony winces)
dialog: Dad. You're coming. You haven't
dialog: been to a game all year.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: What would I do, sit in the
dialog: bleachers with your ex and her
dialog: lesbian wife?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You don't have to say "lesbian
dialog: wife". You can just say wife.
text: During this, Tony starts to use a NAPKIN. Then he puts it
text: back, and tears off a PAPER TOWEL instead.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm good.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
speaker_heading: (indicates the NAPKINS)
dialog: Why? Because they say "Wendys"?
dialog: You are pathological, you know
dialog: that? They're just napkins!
dialog: Everybody takes them!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That doesn't make it right. If you
dialog: break one rule, they all break.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Hey. Don't have to quote your
dialog: mother to me. I was married to the
dialog: woman for 17 years.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You were married to her. But I
dialog: listened to her.
text: Big Tony collects the "stolen" napkins.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: You know what, Saint Francis? This
dialog: time I'm calling your bluff. You
dialog: want me to return the napkins?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. You come with me. We'll go
dialog: back to Wendys. We'll find the
dialog: Manager. "Here are the ten napkins
dialog: you've been looking for. I
dialog: confess! It was me!"
dialog: (waving a PACKET)
dialog: Oh wait. Here's a Splenda from the
dialog: I-Hop in Fairfield. I'11 mail it
dialog: to them.
text: During this, Tony's CELL PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: TONY
speaker_heading: (answering PHONE)

speaker_heading: FIRST ROOKIE
text: He's in the Camry.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Did you lose your razor, Officer?
speaker_heading: FIRST ROOKIE
dialog: No sir.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's an infraction.
speaker_heading: FIRST ROOKIE
dialog: I'll take care of it. Thank you,
dialog: sir.
text: Tony walks away. After he's gone..
speaker_heading: FIRST ROOKIE (CONT’D)
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: It's like having a den mother.
speaker_heading: SECOND ROOKIE
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: FIRST ROOKIE
dialog: You heard of Tony Caruso? Diamond
dialog: Tony? That's his son.
speaker_heading: SECOND ROOKIE
dialog: He's on the job?
speaker_heading: FIRST ROOKIE
dialog: Top of the food chain. All City
dialog: Homicide.
speaker_heading: SECOND ROOKIE
dialog: He's a cop?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And he didn't change his name?
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LOOMIS'S SEDAN- STAGING AREA- SAME TIME
text: Tony approaches a PARKED SEDAN. His partner, DETECTIVE SGT.
text: BURL LOOMIS, is behind the wheel. 50's. Rumpled. Cynical.
text: Burnt out. He's fast asleep.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hey Cowboy. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Hhhmm. Waiting for you.
text: Tony shakes Loomis. Offers him some coffee.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What if somebody saw you? They'd
dialog: pull your badge.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Yeah. That would be terrible. I'd
dialog: have to retire early.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Here's a question. When you do
dialog: finally retire, how will anyone
dialog: know?
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: EXT. CRIME SCENE- CONTINUOUS
text: Tony & Loomis walk up a hill, toward the body. Loomis is out
text: of shape. He falls behind.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Don't wait for me. I promised your
dialog: old man I'd watch your back, so
dialog: that's what I'm doing.
text: They reach the dump site. A uniform officer, SGT. CHEADLE,
text: greets them.
scene_heading: SGT. CHEADLE
dialog: Lieutenant. Glad you're here.
dialog: This one's a real freak show.
text: Loomis joins them, wheezing from the climb.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (indicates Loomis)
dialog: Well, we know HE didn't do it.
dialog: (resuming, to Cheadle)
dialog: Any I.D.?
scene_heading: SGT. CHEADLE
dialog: Not yet. Nobody's touched him. It
text: looks like a taxpayer.
text: Tony examines the BODY. He's a world-class investigator.
text: Out of respect, the other cops step away and give him space.
speaker_heading: SGT. CHEADLE (CONT’D)
dialog: What the hell is wrong with this
dialog: town?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Nothing a well-placed hydrogen bomb
dialog: couldn't cure.
text: The victim has been shot in the chest, multiple times. Plus
text: there's a BLACK PLASTIC TRASHBAG over his head.
scene_heading: SGT. CHEADLE
dialog: Should we cut the bag?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No. Let's wait for the good
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Time of death?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm guessing. Two days.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: So Saturday night?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Maybe. This isn't the primary. He
dialog: was killed somewhere else.
dialog: (examines the shoes)
text: No scuff marks. He wasn't dragged,
dialog: he was carried. Who found him?
text: Nearby: the DIRT BIKERS are being questioned.
scene_heading: SGT. CHEADLE
dialog: A couple of dirt bikers. It's
dialog: illegal in the park, so they ride
text: at dawn.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Get a statement. Separately.
dialog: Separate cars. And stay away from
dialog: that bush.
scene_heading: SGT. CHEADLE
dialog: Did you see something?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yeah. Poison sumac.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: (chuckles )
dialog: One of the perks of having a boy
dialog: scout for a partner.
text: Tony looks around. He misses nothing.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: They parked down the hill. They
text: carried him 35, maybe 40 yards.
dialog: Why'd they leave him here, out in
dialog: the open? Another ten feet they're
text: in the woods.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Maybe they were interrupted.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Maybe.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe they wanted him found.
dialog: 12.

text: probation officer. Street smart, with a mischievous sense of
dialog: humor.
text: Gabby on her chopper: the sexiest thing on the internet.
text: She's parked in front of a FIRE HYDRANT. Gabby picks up an
text: EMPTY TRASH CAN, flips it over, and drops it over the
dialog: hydrant. Problem solved.
text: An ELDERLY NEIGHBOR, sitting on a stoop, watches her. Gabby

text: Gabby enters. The guys are distracted and don't notice her.
text: She picks up the REMOTE and CLICKS THE TV OFF.
text: For a beat, the guys are confused. They think the monitor is
text: broken. They finally notice Gabby.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I left you two messages.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: I know. My phone died. Sorry.
speaker_heading: WENDELL

speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I doubt it.
dialog: (to Wendell)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: (gulp)
dialog: Wendell Kirk.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Wendell Kirk. Do you have a
dialog: receipt for this TV?
speaker_heading: WENDELL
dialog: It was a floor model. They don't
dialog: give receipts-
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Bullshit. You always get a
dialog: receipt.
speaker_heading: WENDELL
dialog: Not at Target.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: You want a receipt? Give me twelve
dialog: hours. I can get you a receipt.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Pack it up, Wendell.
text: Wendell anxiously carries some boxes out the door.
speaker_heading: GABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I called the lumber yard. They
dialog: said you showed up but then left
dialog: before the interview.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Okay. Here's the thing. I got
dialog: there. The supervisor was a guy
dialog: named Randy Buttons. I don't know
dialog: Randy too well, but I know his
dialog: wife, Mrs. Buttons, very well. So
dialog: I bailed. Believe me, I saved
dialog: everyone a world of trouble.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: WHAPPP!
dialog: There's a
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: So we have to find an employer

text: Gabby SNAPS THE TOWEL at him again.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT’D)
dialog: YOW! Gabby, Inspector, give me
dialog: some credit. I'm walking the line
dialog: here. You asked me to sell my
dialog: liquor license, I sold it, no
dialog: problem. You asked me to move in
dialog: with my kid, here I am. I'm
dialog: walking the line. You gave me 90
dialog: days to find a job. I'll do it. I
dialog: have three weeks left.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Three weeks, Tony.
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: Why do I let you slide like this?

speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Hatred is too weak a word.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Then why- ?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY

dialog: Kayla's son.
speaker_heading: KAYLA & AVERY
text: COME ON, EVAN! GET A PIECE OF IT.
dialog: I can't look.
text: Evan takes a pitch.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: BALL ONE!
dialog: (quietly, to Evan)
dialog: Good eye, buddy. Wait for your
dialog: pitch.
text: The next pitch. Evan connects! The FIRST BASEMAN fields the
text: ball. It's a funny, sloppy play; typical little league
text: stuff. Evan dodges the tag. The First Baseman chases him
text: around. Finally, somehow, Evan reaches first base. He's
dialog: safe!
text: PARENTS IN THE STANDS
text: YEAH! WAY TO GO! EVANNNNN!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're OUT!
text: Out?!? A confused beat.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Dad!? He missed me by a mile!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You were out of the baseline.
dialog: Sorry, buddy.
scene_heading: The PARENTS BOO. The PLAYERS BOO. EVERYONE BOOS.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: If you break one rule, what
dialog: happens? That's right. They all
dialog: break.
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STANDS- SAME TIME
text: Kayla, the ex-wife, knows what's coming.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Oh no. Not the rulebook..
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE FIELD
text: Tony takes out a RULE BOOK. The LOUD BOOING continues.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Here it is. 15 J. "A
dialog: batter/runner cannot deviate more
text: than 3 feet from the baseline while
dialog: avoiding the tag".
text: Evan sighs, and sulks away.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Good hit though. Way to hustle.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD- LATER
text: The game is over. The PLAYERS are collecting their stuff.
text: Kayla and Avery step up. Tony and the women exchange tense,
text: overly-polite greetings. Divorces are tough.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Could I see that rule book? I'm
dialog: just curious.
text: Kayla takes the RULE BOOK.. and playfully FOLDS it.
speaker_heading: KAYLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh look. It bends. Unlike the
dialog: umpire.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I get it. Very cute. Well, I
dialog: think he learned a valuable lesson.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Oh we ALL learned a lesson, Tony.
dialog: How's tomorrow morning?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'll have to call you. An ex cop
dialog: was killed, so it's all hands on
dialog: deck.
speaker_heading: KAYLA
dialog: Well, let me know.
text: Kayla and Avery & Evan walk away. Big Tony IMPROVISES a
text: sweet goodbye with his grandson. Then he crosses to Tony.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: An ex cop?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I was about to tell you. It was
dialog: Jack Livingston. They found him
dialog: this morning in Ambrose Park.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: It wasn't pretty. Abducted.
text: Drugged. Suffocated. Then shot.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: I wouldn't have done it in that
dialog: order, but still-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Jesus! Dad!
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: I'm not gonna lie to you. I have
dialog: mixed feelings here.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Where would you start?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: If it was my case? I'd be looking
dialog: at me.
text: Tony gestures, "be serious".
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT’D)
dialog: Why not? Who has a better motive?
dialog: I did 12 birthdays inside for that
dialog: bastard.
dialog: (grins)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe I'm your blind spot. Every
dialog: cop has one.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Are you gonna help me here or not?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Livingston took five other cops
dialog: down with me. Every one of ‘em
dialog: told me they'd take him out if they
dialog: could.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You believe them?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: I did at the time. But that was 12
dialog: years ago. Grudges have a way of,
dialog: what's the word?- dissipating.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I heard he was broke. I heard he
dialog: owed the Newmark Brothers.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: They're serious people. But what
dialog: you described- abducted, drugged,
dialog: shot- it doesn't sound like
dialog: business. It sounds personal.
dialog: Have you met the wife?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Donna.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: She's a real people-pleaser. Half
dialog: of Brooklyn would love a ride on
dialog: that pony.
dialog: (chuckles )
dialog: You've got your work cut out for
dialog: you. There won't be a lot of tears
dialog: at that funeral.
scene_heading: ALL-CITY SQUAD ROOM- 15TH PRECINCT- NIGHT
text: The All City Task Force occupies a LARGE ATTIC-LOFT of the

speaker_heading: Meet RYAN
dialog: Earnest.
text: an iPAD.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: My old man was right. Bookies,

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Lieutenant? Dr. Zee just posted
dialog: the autopsy.
text: DOMKI, the squad's civilian technician. 20's.
text: Eager to please.. a little TOO eager. He holds up

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sorry. "Between 4 PM Saturday and
dialog: 4 AM Sunday."
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's a pretty big window.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: He had eight mills of nembutal in

text: a syringe.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: They jacked him up before they
dialog: killed him.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes sir. That's my conclusion as
dialog: well.
dialog: (resumes )
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: "C.0.D.: acute asphyxia." That
dialog: would be the plastic bag. Then,
dialog: postmortem, five gunshots, 9
text: millimeter, upper chest.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Five shots after he died. Cowboy?
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
text: Sound premeditated.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Back in the day, a case like this,
dialog: I'd run it past your old man.
dialog: (to Ryan)
dialog: Big Tony was the best street cop I
dialog: ever knew. Every morning, they'd
dialog: be four, five detectives outside
dialog: his office, waiting to run their
text: cases past him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He thinks we should look at the
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Rings true to me. The first time I
dialog: met Donna Livingston she was
text: dancing at a club by the airport
dialog: and her name was Dory-Anne. This
dialog: was two dead husbands ago.
text: During this, faintly- BEEP BEEP BEEP.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell?
text: Ryan proudly indicates his HIGH-TECH WRIST WATCH.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That's me. It's called the
dialog: VitaLink. I'm beta testing it for
text: a friend. It has a skin sensor on
dialog: the back. It reads your hydration
dialog: level.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: It's a watch that tells you when
dialog: you're thirsty?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I guess, yeah. Pretty much.
dialog: 25.
text: The stupid watch continues to BEEP BEEP BEEP.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Does it tell you when you're being
dialog: a douchbag?
speaker_heading: (BEEP BEEP BEEP..)
dialog: The answer is yes.
text: BEEP BEEP BEEP. Ryan can't turn it off.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Just take it off.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Maybe if I..
text: Ryan gulps down some water, trying to turn it off. BEEP BEEP
text: BEEP BEEP..
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: If I killed you right now, no jury
dialog: in the world would convict me.
text: Finally, somehow, the watch stops.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hey. Guys. We're on the job.
dialog: Let's do the job. Ryan, check the
dialog: phone records- his and hers. Make
text: sure the DA's office is looped in.
dialog: Cowboy, turn these guys over, check
dialog: their alibis. We've gotta start
dialog: clearing this board.
text: Capt. Delgetty enters. She looks concerned.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Captain?
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: A few years back, during the
dialog: troubles, we started stamping every
dialog: round of ammunition that we issued,
dialog: so every bullet discharged could be
text: traced back to the officer who
dialog: fired it.
text: She holds up an EVIDENCE BAG containing FIVE SLUGS.
speaker_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY (CONT’D)
dialog: These are the slugs they just
text: pulled out of Jack Livingston.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY (CONT’D)
dialog: I was there. They never left my
dialog: sight.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They're all stamped. They're
dialog: department issued.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You're saying.. a cop did this?
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: They were issued to this unit. To
dialog: one specific officer.
text: She hands Tony a CLIPBOARD. A tense, expectant beat.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (reading list, baffled)
dialog: It's me.
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: Lt. Caruso, I need you to surrender
dialog: your weapon. And follow me.
text: DEAD SILENCE. Tony, stunned, unholsters his Glock and hands
text: it to her. Then- BEEP BEEP. It's Ryan's stupid watch.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sorry.
text: Ryan drinks water, frantically, trying to turn it off.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE BALLISTICS LAB- MOMENTS LATER
text: Later. They're testing Tony's weapon. A POLICE TECHNICIAN
text: fits and locks the gun into a metallic vice, then attaches a
text: wire to the trigger.
text: Capt. Delgetty and Tony watch, anxiously.
text: Everyone puts on ear-protectors. BLAM! A bullet is fired
text: into a TESTING CHAMBER filled with ORDINANCE GELITAN.
text: The Technician digs the bullet from the gelitan, washes it
text: off, and places it in a COMPARISON MICROSCOPE.
text: MICROSCOPE POV: The two bullets. Side by side. They're
text: rotated until the grooves and striations line up.
dialog: 27.
text: The Technician looks up, concerned. Tony steps up to the

scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM- POLICE STATION- LATER
text: Later. Tony is being questioned by Captain Delgetty and

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: Has everyone been sworn? Note the

text: (starting a TAPE RECORDER)
dialog: I am Matthew Quinn, Senior
dialog: Inspector, Internal Affairs. I'm
dialog: here with Capt. R.H. Delgetty.
dialog: We're talking to Detective Anthony
dialog: Caruso. Detective, is there
dialog: anything you'd like to tell us?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: There's been a mistake.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: I hope you're right, son.
text: Quinn indicates the Glock on the table, in an EVIDENCE BAG.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN (CONT’D)
dialog: We have your gun here. According
dialog: to the ballistics, this is the
dialog: weapon that killed Jack Livingston.
speaker_heading: UNION REP
dialog: Excuse me. The union doesn't
dialog: consider those results definitive.
dialog: Lt. Caruso has a right to retest
dialog: the weapon in an independent lab-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (overruling his own
dialog: counsel)
dialog: That won't be necessary. I'll
dialog: stipulate the shots came from my
dialog: gun. I ran the test myself, twice.
speaker_heading: UNION REP
dialog: Ah.. I'd like to talk to Tony
dialog: privately-
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: There's no need for that. We're
dialog: all here for the same reason,
dialog: right? We're trying to figure out
dialog: what happened.
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: Absolutely. We're just trying to
dialog: figure this out.
speaker_heading: UNION REP
dialog: Then let's start here: What
dialog: possible motive could he have? He
dialog: barely knew the victim.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: Family honor.
speaker_heading: UNION REP
dialog: Family honor? Twelve years after
dialog: the trial? Where does I.A. get the
dialog: nerve?
text: (waving a PRINT OUT)
dialog: Have you seen his record? Not a
dialog: single complaint. You could eat
dialog: off this. You know what they call
dialog: him around here?
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: The Choirboy.
speaker_heading: UNION REP
dialog: That's right. The Choirboy. He
text: doesn't step out, he doesn't drink,
dialog: he doesn't curse. Most cops I know
dialog: won't work with him, he's such a
dialog: Goddamn pain in the ass.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Thank you, Phil.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: We'll stipulate. It's an admirable
dialog: record.
dialog: (resuming)
dialog: Let's talk about the weapon. When
dialog: was it issued?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Eight years ago. Same day I got my
dialog: shield. Best day of my life.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: You keep it with you?
text: Tony pats his EMPTY SHOULDER HOLSTER.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: 24-7.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: Did you ever loan it to anyone?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: Did you ever lose track of it? For
dialog: an hour? It happens.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Not to me.
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: Tony, you said 24-7, but that's not
dialog: really possible. When you take a

speaker_heading: TONY
text: It's on the counter by the sink.
dialog: It's never out of my sight.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: You've got to sleep.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's next to the bed. In my
text: nightstand. In the top drawer.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: Is the drawer locked?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: Jack Livingston was killed some
dialog: time on Saturday, possibly Sunday
dialog: morning. We know where you were
dialog: during the day. Tell us about
dialog: Saturday night.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I was at Dino's, watching the

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: Until when?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: Ten thirty. Home by eleven, asleep

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: Did you sleep alone?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: And the Glock was..?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: In the drawer. All night.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR QUINN
dialog: You don't know that, do you? I
dialog: mean, you were sleeping. Somebody
dialog: could've taken it, and returned it
text: two hours later.
dialog: Tony considers this.
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: You live with your father, don't
dialog: you?
text: BOOM. The question hits Tony like a hammer.
scene_heading: INT. ALL-CITY SQUAD ROOM- LATER
text: In the Squad Room. The CASE BOARD illustrates the episode's
dialog: baffling puzzle:

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I know you have.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: My C.O. wants him back inside.
dialog: Everybody does. But I've been

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: GABBY

speaker_heading: BIG TONY

speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: We are someplace. What's going on?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I can't do it here.

dialog: Jack Livingston was killed with my

speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Your Glock? That's not possible.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's more that possible. It's a

speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: I'll ask around. I still got a lot

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You can't ask around, Dad. They're

speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Who's looking at me?
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: BIG TONY

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I am the badge.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Dad-
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Maybe I tuned some people up
dialog: myself. I don't deny that. But I

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Here's what I know. Livingston was

speaker_heading: BIG TONY

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Uncle Manny drew 5 to 10 and died in prison.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I know it's thin.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: I wish I was that thin.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's something. It's a connection.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Let's play it out. For kicks and
dialog: giggles. Here's your house..
text: Gabby crosses to a DRY ERASE BOARD. She sketches a crude
text: FLOOR PLAN of a three-story house.
speaker_heading: GABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is you. This is your dad.
text: She draws TWO STICK FIGURES asleep in bed.
speaker_heading: GABBY (CONT'D)
text: Gunther Welles is in the basement.
dialog: At some point after one AM, he
dialog: sneaks upstairs. He finds your
dialog: room. He enters your room. He
dialog: finds your gun..
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: In the dark. Without waking you
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I have a sound machine.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: A sound machine. God help us.
speaker_heading: GABBY
text: He sneaks out of the house. He
text: finds Jack Livingston, drugs him,
text: strangles him, shoots him five
text: times, then carries the body to
text: Ambrose Park and dumps it by the
dialog: trail.
text: They're interrupted. BEEP BEEP BEEP. It's Ryan's awful
dialog: watch.
text: Loomis grabs a PITCHER OF WATER.. crosses to Ryan.. and
text: calmly pours water onto Ryans's hand, drowning the watch.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Not cool, man.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: (resuming)
dialog: Ambrose Park..?
speaker_heading: GABBY
text: He dumps the body, then sneaks back
text: into the house, locks the door
text: behind him, returns the gun, then
text: goes back downstairs.
dialog: Everyone considers this.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: The DA's never gonna buy it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's all we've got. It was my gun.
text: Nothing else makes sense.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: You people aren't even asking the
dialog: right question. Has anyone read
dialog: this?
text: He holds up an AUTOPSY DIAGRAM of the BULLET-RIDDLED BODY.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: None of these bullets passed
text: through the body, so the shooter
text: had to be at least 20 yards away.
dialog: Look at that grouping. From 20
dialog: yards? Who is this guy, Daniel
dialog: Boone? Where'd he learn to shoot?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: He's not ex-military.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Has he ever fired a gun in his
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Can we ask him?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: We can ask but it won't do any
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: The golden rule, kid. The first
dialog: thing every homicide investigator
dialog: learns-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Murderers lie.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Murderers. Lie.
dialog: They're stumped. Then-
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I have an idea.
dialog: (to Tony)
dialog: You're not gonna like it.
dialog: 41.
scene_heading: INT. DINO'S BAR- NEXT DAY
text: The joint is quiet, nearly empty. Tony, Gabby and Loomis are
text: at a table with their suspect, Gunther Welles. They're
text: having a friendly chat. Laughs. Drinks. A CLASSIC ROCK
text: SONG plays.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: I love the old songs. Why doesn't
dialog: anybody write old songs anymore?
text: Loomis fills Gunther's glass.
scene_heading: GUNTHER WELLES
dialog: I've been braced before, but never
dialog: like this.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're a friend of my father's.
dialog: You get the VIP treatment.
scene_heading: GUNTHER WELLES
dialog: You can buy me drinks till the moon
dialog: turns blue, it won't change my
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: We're just talking, Gunther. A
dialog: friendly chat. You were telling us
dialog: about your Uncle Manny..
scene_heading: GUNTHER WELLES
dialog: Like I said. He was a mean old
dialog: prick. I'm surprised his own
dialog: shadow kept him company.
text: During this, TWO BADASS GANGSTERS enter the bar. They look
text: around, warily. THEY'RE CASING THE PLACE.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: You weren't angry when he died? In
dialog: prison? Alone?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: You didn't hold anyone responsible?
scene_heading: GUNTHER WELLES
dialog: Why should I?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Okay. We'll come back to that.
dialog: Let's talk about Saturday night.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: GUNTHER WELLES
dialog: Nothing to tell. My sister brought
dialog: a guy home and they kicked me out.
dialog: It happens every few weeks. I
text: knocked on a few doors and ended up
dialog: in your basement.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sorry about the smell, by the way.
scene_heading: GUNTHER WELLES
dialog: Hell, I'm up to my ass in asphalt
dialog: all day. Nothing bothers me.
speaker_heading: FIRST GANGSTER
scene_heading: NOBODY MOVE!

speaker_heading: FIRST GANGSTER (CONT’D)

scene_heading: JIMMY THE BARTENDER
dialog: We just opened. There won't be
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: FIRST GANGSTER
dialog: We'll take what you have.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Hey. Douchebag. You know where
dialog: you are?
speaker_heading: SECOND GANGSTER
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: This is Dinos. It's a cop bar.
dialog: We're all blue.
speaker_heading: SECOND GANGSTER
dialog: Well. That makes it even sweeter.
text: While everyone is distracted, the Bartender pulls a SAWED-OFF
text: from under the bar.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: JIMMY! NO!!!
text: The Bartender FIRES! BLAM! The SECOND GANGSTER collapses,
dialog: dead.
dialog: 43.
text: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE! The FIRST GANGSTER spins, fires!
text: BLAM BLAM! The Bartender collapses. He's dead.
text: Gabby and Loomis scramble and return fire! BLAM BLAM!
text: Gunther cowers behind the table.
text: BLAM! Loomis is SHOT IN THE CHEST. He collapses. He's
text: dead. You read that right. Loomis is dead. As he falls,
text: his SERVICE REVOLVER- a Glock 19- flies loose and slides
text: across the floor. It stops near Gunther.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (into CELLPHONE)
scene_heading: CODE 998! SHOTS FIRED! OFFICER
scene_heading: DOWN! 42 EUCLID STREET!
text: The gunfight continues. BLAM BLAM! GABBY IS SHOT. She
text: collapses. She's dead. Tony is shot, too. He's hit in the
text: chest, seriously wounded.
text: Then it's over. The aftermath: blood and bodies everywhere.
text: The Surviving Gangster crosses.. menacingly.. toward Tony.
speaker_heading: FIRST GANGSTER
dialog: Sorry brother. Gotta finish it.
dialog: No witnesses.
text: He AIMS AT TONY. Tony braces himself. This is the end. But-
text: CLICK!- the gun is empty. The Gangster starts to reload.
text: Gunther, of all people, is the last man standing. He's still
text: cowering behind the table. LOOMIS'S GLOCK is within reach.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Gunther! The gun! GRAB THE GUN!
dialog: DO IT! SHOOT HIM!
text: Gunther grabs Loomis's gun. He stands. He's shaking. He
text: fumbles with the safety, closes his eyes and- BLAM BLAM!-
text: FIRES WILDLY! The recoil sends him flying backwards!
text: A beat. Then..
text: Tony sits up.. unhurt! The gunshots were fake. BODY SQUIBS.
text: Loomis and Gabby sit up. The Bartender and the Gangster
text: stand. IT WAS ALL STAGED. They applaud each other's
dialog: "performance".
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: All those improv classes finally
dialog: paid off.
dialog: 44,
scene_heading: GUNTHER WELLES
dialog: What's going on..?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (introducing the
dialog: "Gangsters" )
text: Gunther Welles, meet Lt. Marson and
dialog: Sgt. Diaz.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: We were testing you, Gunther. This
text: is a Glock 19. The same model as
dialog: the murder weapon. You've never
dialog: fired a gun in your life, have you?
dialog: (Gunther shakes his head)
dialog: I didn't think so.
dialog: (to Tony)
dialog: Now we know.
text: Suddenly- BAM!- Loomis is "Shot" again. Another SQUIB CHARGE
text: ON HIS CHEST explodes.
text: Ryan appears, holding a SFX CONTROL BOX. He's been the
text: "stunt coordinator", controlling SQUIB CHARGES from behind
dialog: the bar.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sorry.
text: BAM! Another SQUIB on Loomis explodes. Ryan pretends the
text: controller is broken.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (mock surprise)
dialog: Sorry. Sorry. I think it's stuck.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Cut it out, kid. I mean it. It's
dialog: not funny..
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD ROOM- NIGHT
text: Later. Tony is in the Squad Room. Alone. He studies the
text: LIST OF POSSIBLES on the CASE BOARD. GUNTHER'S PHOTO has
text: been moved to the bottom. He's been eliminated.
text: So.. they're back to TWO SUSPECTS. TWO PHOTOS. One of Tony.
text: One of his father.
text: Gabby appears in the doorway, carrying her MOTORCYCLE HELMET

dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: You can't avoid it forever.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Going home.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: You should be a detective.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I'm thinking about it. There's an
dialog: exam in March.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: So am I. If you can do it, how
dialog: hard can it be?
text: Gabby sits. She makes herself comfortable. She pours
text: herself a glass of wine.
speaker_heading: GABBY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (ve: the CASE BOARD)
dialog: We're back where we started.
dialog: You'll have to testify.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I am aware.
text: As always, Tony is playing BOSSA NOVA music.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Bossa nova?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It helps me think.
speaker_heading: GABBY
speaker_heading: (offering the BOTTLE)
dialog: You want some of this? It helps me
dialog: NOT think.
dialog: (Tony demurs)
dialog: I forgot. The Choirboy.
text: Gabby considers Tony's carefully organized desk. She picks
text: up a PILE OF REPORTS and MIXES THEM UP.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What are you doing?! No don't-
dialog: Gabby!
text: (sighing, fixing his desk)
dialog: Why do you torture me?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I can't resist. You're so.. damn..
dialog: good. I bet you don't pee in the
dialog: shower.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Do you want me to pee in the
dialog: shower? Would that make you happy?
text: Their eyes meet. Tony considers her, warmly.
text: Tony nods.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: How was your childhood?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: How was my childhood?
dialog: (a painful subject)
dialog: I didn't really have one. Thanks
dialog: for asking. How was yours?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Outstanding, until my mother died.
dialog: Whatever we needed, whatever we
dialog: wanted, the old man took care of
dialog: it. Diamond Tony Caruso. A house
text: in Florida. A new car every year.
text: Seats behind the dugout..
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: And you never suspected?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I never asked.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: You were afraid to ask.
text: She's right again.
speaker_heading: GABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What about your mom?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I think she knew. She had to know.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: They don't wash off easily, do
dialog: they?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: The sins of the father.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN- CARUSO HOUSE- DAWN
text: Later. Tony arrives home. He starts upstairs. Big Tony
text: appears. He's been waiting up.
text: Both men are guarded. Suspicious of the other.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: It's 4:30.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: I was worried.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: About who?
text: This, of course, is THE question. A tense beat.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Gunther told me he's been
dialog: officially cleared.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: We'll talk about it later. Come
dialog: here.
text: Big Tony embraces his son. They HUG. Tightly. Big Tony
text: pats Tony's back. He pats Tony's lower back. Then he pats
text: Tony's chest. Pat pat pat. HE'S LOOKING FOR A WIRE.
text: Defiantly, Tony removes his shirt and his undershirt. He
text: stands there, exposed, to prove he's not wired.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: There's some tortellini in the
dialog: fridge.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: VARIOUS MOURNERS
dialog: It was a beautiful service... Sorry
dialog: for your loss.. (etc)
speaker_heading: ELDERLY UNCLE
dialog: Do they know who did it?
speaker_heading: DONNA LIVINGSTON
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: They know exactly who did it. They
dialog: have all the evidence they need.
speaker_heading: (LOUDLY, to the room)
dialog: But they're too chickenshit to do
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY UNCLE
dialog: Shhh.
speaker_heading: DONNA LIVINGSTON
dialog: I don't care who hears me!
scene_heading: ON THE FRONT DOOR- HALLWAY
text: At the door. Tony arrives. Loomis intercepts him.
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Are you mental? What are you doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I had to show up. How would it
dialog: look?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: It would look like you had some
dialog: common sense. Donna's on the
text: warpath. She's threatening to call
dialog: the Post.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What does she want?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: She wants an arrest. Yesterday.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: My father?
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Or you. Or both. She doesn't seem
dialog: particular.
dialog: (sighs )
dialog: All right. But stay out of the

scene_heading: ON CAPT. DELGETTY & LOOMIS
text: The reception continues. Capt. Delgetty and Loomis talk
dialog: privately.
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: This is the damndest case I ever
dialog: saw. Diamond Tony Caruso was
dialog: crooked as hell, but he was a first-
dialog: rate detective. Why would he use
dialog: that gun? He knew we could trace
text: it back to his own house. It
text: doesn't make sense.
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: A lot of things don't make sense.
dialog: Why are pennies bigger than dimes?
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: I guess that's true..
speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Why does Hawaii have an Interstate
dialog: highway?
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY

speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Why doesn't Tarzan have a beard?
scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY

speaker_heading: LOOMIS

scene_heading: CAPT. DELGETTY
dialog: Including today?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM- SAME TIME
text: Across the room. SGT. CHET FINCH- who we met earlier- is

scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: I've never been up this way. Nice
dialog: area.
speaker_heading: FRIENDLY AUNT
dialog: I remember when Jack and Donna

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: DONNA LIVINGSTON

speaker_heading: TONY

scene_heading: SGT. FINCH

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Obviously.
text: Finch SCRATCHES HIS LEG AGAIN.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you okay, Sergeant? You've
dialog: been scratching your leg all night.
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: It's a rash.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: From here, it looks like poison
dialog: sumac.
dialog: (then, accusingly)
dialog: How did you do it?
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: Do what?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Kill Jack Livingston with my gun.

dialog: She sent me to find you-
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Tony-
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Remember the poison sumac by the

speaker_heading: LOOMIS
dialog: Tony- Tony- it's over.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (finally focusing)

speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: You don't remember Harry Corkrin?
dialog: Harry The Horse? He's practically
dialog: your Godfather.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: He's two cells over. I got more

text: During this, Big Tony is shamelessly smoking a CIGAR.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You can't smoke in here.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: No. YOU can't smoke in here.
dialog: (resuming)
dialog: Plus I'm eating better. Plus I

dialog: about me, kid. The devil watches
text: over his own.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You didn't answer my question.
dialog: Why'd you sign that statement?
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Because I did it. I killed him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: No you didn't.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: You're a good cop, Tony. But
dialog: you're not a father.
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: I'd take a bullet for you. Don't
dialog: you know that?
dialog: (clarifying)
text: Not in the gut. The leg maybe. A

text: A PRISON GUARD appears, as a waiter would, with a MUG OF
speaker_heading: COFFEE.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY (CONT’D)
dialog: Thank you, Corey. Is there any of
dialog: that cinnamon?
text: The GUARD adds some cinnamon to the coffee.
speaker_heading: TONY

dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: (gesturing: people might
dialog: hear)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I didn't kill anybody.
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Of course you didn't.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It wasn't either of us. It was
dialog: Chet Finch!
speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: Finch?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: And Livingston's wife. They

speaker_heading: BIG TONY
dialog: With your gun?

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: GABBY (V.O.)
dialog: Oh my God!
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: TONY (VO)

text: The FIVE BULLET HOLES are clearly marked.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I knew that cluster pattern looked
dialog: familiar.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Wait. Hold on. You remembered the
dialog: pattern of the bullets holes, from,
dialog: like, ten days ago?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I guess I did.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: From one target? Out of how many,
dialog: twenty? Caruso, that's not normal.
dialog: That's pretty freaky.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's a pretty distinctive pattern.
text: It's an almost perfect hexagon-
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: A perfect hexagon? It's five
dialog: random holes. You're a freak of
dialog: nature, Caruso. You're like
dialog: Rainman-
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (interrupting, annoyed)
dialog: Excuse me. I have a plan. Would
dialog: you like to know where we're going?
speaker_heading: GABBY

text: Gabby are looking around.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Maybe he threw it out.
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: "May 24. Caruso, Junior".

text: the AUTOPSY DIAGRAM. They compare the pattern of holes.
dialog: Tony was right. They're identical.
speaker_heading: GABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. Is that enough?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's more than enough. It's
text: incontrovertible.
text: Gabby starts to roll up the target.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't touch it. We have to
dialog: preserve the chain of evidence.

speaker_heading: GABBY

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Maybe we are. I could talk to the
dialog: Captain.
text: Suddenly they stop. The hood of Tony's car is open. The
text: DISTRIBUTOR CAP has been ripped out.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH'S VOICE
dialog: Right there. Right there.
text: They turn. Sgt. Finch is pointing a GUN at them.
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: First your phones. Let's drop
dialog: them.
text: Tony and Gabby slowly take out their CELL PHONES, and drop
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You don't want to do this, Chet.
dialog: You're not a murderer.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: (reminding him)
dialog: He is a murderer. That's why we're
dialog: here.
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: Now your guns. You first.
text: Tony opens his jacket. No holster. No gun.
speaker_heading: SGT. FINCH (CONT'D)
dialog: (gloating)
dialog: Oh I forgot. It's in the evidence
dialog: room. It is, after all, a murder
dialog: weapon.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Inspector?
text: Gabby opens her jacket. No weapon.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I left it home.
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: Why would you do that? You're on
dialog: the job.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: When he called, all he said was he
dialog: wanted to see me.
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I thought he was asking me out.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (surprised, flattered)
dialog: Really?
dialog: 63.
text: Now we reveal: Gabby really DOES have a gun! It's holstered
text: behind her, out of sight. She SLOWLY REACHES FOR IT, as..
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: I thought I covered every angle.
dialog: How did you figure it?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: He remembered the pattern of the
text: bullet holes.
scene_heading: SGT. FINCH
dialog: From one target? From ten days
dialog: ago? It's not possible.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: That's what I said!
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It was a unique pattern. It's an
dialog: almost perfect hexagon-
dialog: (to Gabby)
dialog: Was that true? You thought I was
dialog: asking you out?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: No. Sorry.
text: Suddenly Gabby pulls her GUN- spins- and BLAM!- fires at

text: They race toward the OUTDOOR TARGET RANGE..
scene_heading: EXT. TARGET RANGE- CONTINUOUS- NIGHT
text: Tony and Gabby run through the dark, quiet, sprawling TARGET
text: RANGE. Past PROP BUILDINGS and WOODEN CARS. It's other-

text: Suddenly- FLOOD LIGHTS! The range is bathed in light. Tony
dialog: and Gabby are exposed!
text: BLAM BLAM! Finch fires at them! But from where?
text: Tony and Gabby scramble away. Now the TARGETS are switched

speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: "Jiminy Cricket"? This is a
dialog: gunfight, Caruso. You're allowed

speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I got him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Give me the gun. I'ma better
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Because you're a guy?
text: Tony grabs the gun from her. He checks the clip. It's
text: almost empty.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Do you have another clip?
text: Gabby shakes her head.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: How many rounds?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: One.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Make it count.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You think?
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: WITH FINCH- BEHIND A FACADE
text: Twenty yards away: Finch is hiding behind a facade.
text: Finch hears: CLICK CLICK CLICK. It's obviously Tony, trying
text: to fire his gun, which is empty. CLICK CLICK.
text: Finch smirks. He confidently steps into the open. Tony is
text: standing there, in the open, holding the empty weapon. It
text: continues to CLICK CLICK CLICK.
text: Finch raises his gun. He's about to execute Tony. But-—
text: BLAM! Tony's gun ISN'T empty! He had one round left.
text: He shot Finch in the shoulder. Finch falls, wounded. He
text: drops his gun.
text: It's all over. Tony kicks Finch's gun away. Gabby joins
dialog: him.
text: Finch looks at Tony, defeated, baffled.
