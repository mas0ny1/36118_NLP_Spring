scene_heading: EXT. A SYCAMORE TREE - DAY - FIVE YEARS AGO
text: A beautiful huge sycamore tree at the top of a hill somewhere
text: outside Seattle, in one of the computer suburbs near Redmond.
text: A moving truck is coming up the hill, followed by an SUV.
scene_heading: EXT. LOSKI HOUSE - STREET - DAY
text: The moving truck pulls up in front of a very pleasant house
text: with a neat, manicured front lawn and some pretty flowers.
text: It’s one of the larger houses on the street.
text: BRYCE LOSKI, 8, gets out of the passenger side of the moving
text: van. He’s already handsome for good. His father RICK gets
text: out of the driver’s side. Bryce and his father dress
dialog: similarly.
text: The SUV pulls into the driveway and Rick’s wife PATSY LOSKI
text: and their daughter LYNETTA, 12, get out. Patsy is trim,
text: blond, cheerful, pert, the kind of woman who is always a
text: little too pulled-together.
scene_heading: POV: LOSKI HOUSE - FROM THE UPPER FLOOR OF THE HOUSE ACROSS
speaker_heading: THE STREET
text: The four Loskis walk up the front walkway to their new house
text: and stand there staring at it. Then Bryce turns to look at
text: the house across the street and we hear:
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: The first day I met Bryce Loski, I
dialog: flipped.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET - DAY
text: In the upper window we see JULI BAKER, 8, looking out the
text: window across the street. She’s a tomboy, freckled,
dialog: adorable.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O., CONT)
dialog: Honestly, one look at him and I
dialog: became a lunatic.
text: She throws open the window and shouts across the street.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Hi!
text: The Loski family turns to look at the Baker house across the
dialog: street.
dialog: flippedldmay21 2.
text: It’s one of the smaller houses on the street, and it’s as
dialog: eccentric a house as the Loski house is conventional. It’s
text: not exactly ramshackle, but the lawn needs cutting, there’s a
text: Santa Claus on the roof, there are several whirligigs in the
text: front yard and an old Toyota in the driveway. The climbing
text: rose needs pruning. A dog is sitting on the front porch and
text: he wakes up and barks in a kind of half-assed way as Julie
text: throws open the window.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Hey, hi. I’m Juli Baker!
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Bryce, how nice. I think she’s
dialog: exactly your age.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: (up to Juli, re: Bryce)
dialog: I’m Lynetta. This is my brother
dialog: Bryce. Say hi, peabrain.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Lynetta, zip it.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Welcome to the neighborhood! It’s
dialog: a great neighborhood! You'll love
dialog: it!
dialog: On Bryce:
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: (voice over)
dialog: All I ever wanted was for Juli
dialog: Baker to leave me alone.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I’1l be right down!
text: Juli slams the window shut.
text: Rick Loski is looking at the Baker house, at the Christmas
text: decorations on the roof.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What are we going to do about those
dialog: Christmas decorations?
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: I thought you liked the Christmas
dialog: decorations.
dialog: flippedldmay21 3.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: When we bought the house it was
dialog: Christmas. I had no idea they kept
dialog: them up all year.
text: Rick starts toward the moving van.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: How are we ever going to sell this
dialog: house if the house across the
dialog: street has Christmas decorations
dialog: all year?
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: We’re not selling this house. We
dialog: just bought it.
scene_heading: INT. MOVING VAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Bryce and his father are in the moving van, unloading boxes.
text: Juli pops up. She’s carrying her soccer ball.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Here I am. I love moving.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: Who loves moving?
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I’m great at moving.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: I found out later she’s great at
dialog: everything. Absolutely everything.
text: She climbs in, agile as a monkey and begins moving boxes.
speaker_heading: RICK LOSKI
dialog: Hey, those are valuable.
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK - A SECOND LATER
text: Rick deposits Juli out of the truck and onto the ground.
speaker_heading: RICK LOSKI
dialog: Your mom’s probably wondering where
dialog: you are.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: She knows where I am.
dialog: flippedldmay21 4.
text: She picks up her soccer ball, kicks it elaborately in the
text: air, drops it on the back of her foot, flips it back up into
text: the air and catches it.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (to Bryce)
dialog: I have two older brothers, Matt and
text: Mike, who look like twins. They
dialog: have no interest in kids our age.
dialog: If they seem like they’re
dialog: interested in you, they’re not,
dialog: they just want to torture you.
dialog: Some day you'll be grateful to me
dialog: for this tip.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: How was I going to get rid of this
dialog: girl?
speaker_heading: RICK LOSKI
dialog: (to Bryce)
dialog: Bryce, isn’t it time for you to
dialog: help your mother?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Sure thing.
text: Bryce jumps off the truck.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: I couldn’t believe it. Dad to the
dialog: rescue. He didn’t like her either.
dialog: I mean, what a show-off. And my
dialog: own dad was putting the ditch play
text: in motion.
text: Bryce starts toward the front door of his house. But Juli
text: follows.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: It was weird. I started to follow
dialog: him --
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: I heard her coming after me but I
dialog: couldn't believe it --
text: Bryce looks over his shoulder, sees Juli just behind him.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: I guess you’d have to say I was
text: chasing him up the walkway --
dialog: flippedldmay21 5.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe it just sounded like she was
dialog: chasing me, I mean, she couldn’t be
dialog: chasing me, could she? Why would
dialog: she be chasing me?
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: I was just trying to stop him so
dialog: maybe we could play a little before
dialog: he got trapped inside --
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: -- and she blasted right past me
dialog: grabbing my arm --
text: Juli passes Bryce, grabs his arm and stops him.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: -- and the next thing I know he’s
text: holding my hand, looking right into
dialog: my eyes --
dialog: Hold on them.
text: On Bryce, looking at Juli.
text: On Juli, looking at Bryce.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: My heart stopped. It just stopped
dialog: beating. I mean, his eyes.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: I tried to shake her off, but she
text: just clamped on tight.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: They were gorgeous. And they were
text: staring straight at me.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: She looked so sappy I couldn’t
dialog: believe it.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: I almost got my first kiss that
dialog: day, I was sure of it.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: If my mother hadn’t come out of the
dialog: door at that moment --
dialog: flippedldmay21 6.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: If his mother hadn’t come out
dialog: there’s just no telling what might
dialog: have happened --
text: Bryce’s mother comes out the front door and looks at the two
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Well, I see you’ve met my son.
text: Bryce untangles himself and shoots straight into the house.
speaker_heading: ROLL CREDITS
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
scene_heading: EXT. SAME STREET
scene_heading: FOUR YEARS LATER
text: Bryce is now 12 years old. He’s mowing the lawn, sitting on
text: the very latest version of an electric lawn mower.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: It’s four years later, and guess
dialog: what? Nothing’s changed. The only
dialog: real difference is that Grandma
dialog: died, mom’s mom, so Grandpa moved
dialog: in.
text: We see the front porch of the Loski house. Sitting on it is
text: CHET DUNCAN, Patsy Loski’s father, a man in his early
text: seventies. On the table next to him is a Tom Clancy book and
text: a copy of the newspaper, but Chet isn’t reading, he’s just
text: sitting there.
text: We see the Baker house. It’s slightly shabbier than it was,
text: and there are more Christmas decorations. The grass is
dialog: longer than ever.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: And meanwhile I’ve still got my own
dialog: personal stalker --
text: Up in the Baker window we see Juli, who’s now 12 too. She
text: looks out the window at Bryce, who’s mowing the lawn.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Hey, Bryce! Good work!
text: Bryce goes on mowing.
dialog: flippedldmay21 7.
text: Juli’s father ROBERT BAKER pulls his battered pick-up truck
text: into the driveway. A painted sign on the side of the truck
text: says Robert Baker, general contractor. MATT and MIKE, Juli’s
text: older brothers, who are both 16 but not twins, get out of the
text: truck with their father and start into the house.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: My dad had this idea that if we did
dialog: a really great job on our front
dialog: lawn it might inspire the Bakers to
dialog: clean up their yard, but guess
dialog: what, it didn’t.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Dinner everybody!
text: Bryce turns off the mower and starts into the house, past his
dialog: grandfather.
scene_heading: INT. LOSKI HOUSE - DUSK
text: The Loski family is at the dinner table. Food is being
text: passed. Lynetta, now 16, lots of eye makeup, takes a tiny
text: portion. Bryce helps himself. Rick is eating spaghetti. No
dialog: Grandpa.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Is that all you’re eating, Lynetta?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Could be.
text: She breaks up a tiny piece of a pasta strand and puts it into
text: her mouth, chews it slowly.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: (calling to her
dialog: grandfather who’s still
dialog: outside)
dialog: Dad? Dinner?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: I think he heard you.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
text: Maybe he’s not hungry.
text: Rick and Patsy exchange a look.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Don’t say it, Rick.
dialog: flippedldmay21 8.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Don’t say what?
text: Patsy goes to the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Dad? Come on. You gotta eat.
text: Her father shakes his head no.
scene_heading: EXT. LOSKI HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Bryce in bed. Lights are out.
text: On Bryce, listening through the wall to a barely-audible
text: fight between his parents.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Look, he’s heartbroken.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He should be living with people in
dialog: the same situation --
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: I am not sending him to a home --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He hates me.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: He doesn’t hate you.
text: Hold on Bryce, listening.
scene_heading: EXT. LOSKI HOUSE - MORNING
text: As Bryce comes out the door.
text: His grandfather is sitting in the chair, rocking.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Morning, grandpa.
text: His grandfather doesn’t answer.
text: Bryce starts down the block.
dialog: flippedldmay21 9.
scene_heading: EXT. SYCAMORE TREE - DAY
text: The huge sycamore tree at the top of the hill.
text: About EIGHT KIDS are standing under it, waiting for the
text: school bus. Bryce joins them. A beat. Four of the kids are
text: girls, including SHELLY STALLS, another seventh grader who is
text: hanging around with her friends. They’re all in tank tops
text: and jeans, and lots of accessories. Most of them are wearing
dialog: I-Pods.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Hi Bryce.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Hi Shelly.
scene_heading: ALL THE OTHER GIRLS
dialog: Hi Bryce.
speaker_heading: JULI (SHOUTING)
text: The bus is three blocks away!
text: Everyone looks up. Juli is sitting about halfway up the
text: sycamore tree. She can see the road.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Two and a half!
text: Everyone stares at each other and shrugs. Typical Juli.
text: Juli starts to shimmy down the tree. There’s a spiral slide
text: halfway down and Juli puts her arms out into the air as if
text: she’s flying. She lands on the ground just as the bus is a
text: block away.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: Here’s the thing about sycamore
dialog: trees, you almost never find them
text: all bunched up together. They are
dialog: individual. They do not need
dialog: company.
text: The bus stops and everyone starts to get into it.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: Bryce sits down in the bus with his friend GARRETT.
text: Juli sits right in front of him, with her friend DARLA.
dialog: On Bryce,
dialog: She hands
dialog: flippedidmay21 10.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Hey, Jules --
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Hey, Darla. Bryce, do you realize
dialog: that tree could be a hundred years
dialog: old easily? Which means it could
dialog: practically be the oldest thing in
dialog: this entire town.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: Here’s the deal. I always tried to
dialog: ignore Juli, but she always ended
dialog: up sucking me in.
speaker_heading: JULI
text: It could be two hundred years old.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: I seriously doubt that.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Well it could.
text: determined to ignore Juli.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (continued)
dialog: It could.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
text: That tree is an ugly mutant tangle
text: of gnarly branches.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Bryce Loski, how can you say that
dialog: about a tree?
speaker_heading: JULI
text: He can’t help it. He’s visually
dialog: challenged.
text: (she pulls a sycamore leaf
dialog: out of her notebook)
dialog: A lot of people confuse the
text: sycamore leaf with a maple but it’s
dialog: not.
dialog: the leaf to Bryce.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Keep it.
dialog: flippedidmay21 11.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: In front of the class is the teacher, MISS BRUBECK.
speaker_heading: MISS BRUBECK
dialog: The science fair is in six weeks --
text: Juli is sitting behind Bryce.
text: Every so often Juli leans forward and takes a sniff of
text: Bryce’s hair.
speaker_heading: MISS BRUBECK
dialog: -- and good science projects take
dialog: time.
text: Shelly Smalls looks over at Juli leaning forward to sniff
dialog: Bryce.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: Here’s something I forgot to
dialog: mention. On top of everything
dialog: else, she liked to sniff me --
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: His hair smelled like watermelon --
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: And she thought I didn’t know she
dialog: was doing it --
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: So I would just lean over very
dialog: subtly, and I swear to God he never
dialog: even knew I was taking a whiff --
text: Juli notices at Shelly Stalls is staring at her. She stops
text: sniffing Bryce’s hair. Shelly smirks at her and rolls her
text: eyes at her friend MIRANDA.
speaker_heading: MISS BRUBECK
dialog: Shelly, do you have some problem
dialog: with the science project?
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: No, Miss Brubeck.
speaker_heading: MISS BRUBECK
dialog: So please have your projects in
dialog: mind by next Monday.
text: The bells rings.
dialog: flippedidmay21 12.
text: Shelly looks back at Juli.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: You know what you should do your
dialog: project on? Obsession.
text: She stands up to leave.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - AFTER CLASS
text: Everyone is filing out of the room. Juli is gathering up her
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: MISS BRUBECK
dialog: Do you have a science project,
dialog: Juli?
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: No. But I will.
speaker_heading: MISS BRUBECK
dialog: Of course you will.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Although I wish I knew what it was.
speaker_heading: MISS BRUBECK
dialog: I have a friend who has chickens.
dialog: I could get you fertilized eggs,
dialog: and you could hatch them --
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: What if they die?
speaker_heading: MISS BRUBECK
dialog: Well if you document it, you’1l
dialog: still get an A, if that’s what you
dialog: care about.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I don’t care about getting an A.
text: Miss Brubeck looks at her.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Okay I do.
text: Miss Brubeck smiles at her.
dialog: flippedidmay21 13.
scene_heading: INT. BAKER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
text: Juli’s mother TRINA is cooking dinner. She’s tall and
text: pretty, wearing jeans and a pullover sweater. Juli is making
text: a salad, which she puts on the table.
text: As Mike, Matt and Robert come into the kitchen:
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I might hatch chickens for the
dialog: science project. Miss Brubeck can
dialog: get me eggs --
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Why don’t you just grow beans?
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: That's like a third-grade thing.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Make a volcano.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Volcano, dude.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Volcanos are so lame. They are so
dialog: “poy” .
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I could help you make an incubator.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: You could?
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Something smells funny in here. Do
dialog: you smell something funny?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Nope.
scene_heading: INT. LOSKI HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Dinner. Rick, Patsy, Lynetta, Bryce and Patsy’s father Chet.
text: Chet is not saying anything.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Whatever I do I am not doing the
dialog: volcano thing.
dialog: flippedidmay21 14.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Why don’t you do plants?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Plants?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: You plant two sets of plants and
dialog: one of them you talk to and the
dialog: other one you don’t talk to and
dialog: then you see which one grows more.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Oh sure. Me talking to plants.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What’s wrong with the volcano
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: It is so lame.
scene_heading: INT. BAKER BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: There are six eggs in a hygrometer, labeled Abby, Bonnie,
text: Clyde, Dexter, Eunice and Florence.
text: Juli is watching her father paint a landscape. The basement
text: is filled with painter’s supplies.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: A painting is all about light. of
dialog: course, it’s also about
dialog: composition, and about whatever
dialog: you’re painting, but it’s the light
dialog: that makes a painting more than the
dialog: sum of its parts --
text: On Robert, painting. His brush dips into the oil paints and
text: onto the canvas, dappling light into the landscape.
scene_heading: INT. LOSKI KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Lynetta is getting ready to go to school, Rick is pouring
text: coffee, Patsy reading the paper, Bryce eating breakfast.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Okay. Here’s another idea. You
text: put celery in red ink.
dialog: flippedidmay21 15.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Which proves what?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: (as to an idiot)
text: The ink turns the celery red,
dialog: proving that a plant sucks up
dialog: moisture. It’s like putting a
dialog: flower in water.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: So why not just put a flower in
dialog: water?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Why I bother helping you I will
dialog: never know. I know, build a
dialog: computer.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: What’s the Baker girl doing?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
text: She is hatching eggs.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That girl loves to grandstand.
scene_heading: INT. BAKER BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Juli’s father holds one of Juli’s eggs up to a cardboard tube
text: and aims a flashlight at it.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: People used to use candles to do
dialog: this. Look. You can see the
text: embryo.
text: Juli looks. We can see the embryo.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: See the dark spot in the middle?
dialog: With all the veins leading to it?
text: We see it. It’s pulsing.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Oh my God!

scene_heading: INT. BAKER BASEMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: All the Bakers are looking at the eggs.
speaker_heading: JULI
text: Bonnie’s heart is beating.
speaker_heading: TRINA

text: Trina starts up the stairs, followed by Matt and Mike.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: I still smell that smell.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: As Trina, Matt and Mike come into the living room. Their
text: dog, CHAMP, is peeing on the end table leg.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Champ, what are you doing? I knew
dialog: it. I just knew it. The Mystery
dialog: Smell comes from the Mystery
dialog: Pisser. Did you see that?
text: Robert and Juli come up the stairs. Robert goes over to
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
text: It’s barely a drop.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Exactly. Which is why I’ve never
dialog: been able to find anything. That

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Mystery Pisser.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Cool name.
text: They high-five each other.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY
text: A beautiful blue kite is flying in the sky.
dialog: flippedidmay21 17.
text: Juli and Darla walk home from school. They’re kicking a

text: Darla peels off, with the soccer ball.
text: Julie continues on, and looks up to see the kite.
text: It crashes into the top of the sycamore tree.
text: On Juli, looking up at the tree.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: I always knew the sycamore tree was
dialog: the greatest tree ever. It hada
text: built-in slide, almost a complete
dialog: spiral, and it was great to ride it
dialog: down. But I’d never been to the
dialog: top until the day the kite got
text: caught up there.
text: Juli starts to climb the tree.
text: Inside the tree, as she gets higher and higher.
text: She looks up and there’s the kite, flashing through the
dialog: branches.
text: She looks down and realizes she’s way up in the tree.
text: Now she looks out and sees Bryce. He’s looking up at the
dialog: tree.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: And then it turned out to be
text: Bryce’s kite.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Hey, you don’t have to get that --
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: I can get it --
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: It's too high, you'll fall --
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I can get it --
text: She shinnies up higher. She looks around. Higher than she’s
dialog: ever been.
dialog: flippedidmay21 18.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Hey, it’s okay, I can get another
dialog: kite. Juli, you're making me
dialog: nervous.
text: Juli gulps.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: No problem.
text: She reaches out for the kite. But the string is tangled.
text: She untangles it. For a moment she almost loses her balance.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Break the string!
text: Juli reaches out to break the string and grabs the kite.
text: And suddenly she’s on top of the tree, looking out.
text: Juli’S POV: The view is heart-stopping. A gorgeous sky in
text: blues and violets, fluffy clouds she could float away on,
text: sunlight dappling the tree-tops and roofs.
text: ON JULIANA, on top of the tree turning her head to see the
text: world from every angle. The light changes every which way

speaker_heading: BRYCE

scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: As her father paints and Juli works on her egg chart.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I totally understood what you meant

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I think my tree-climbing days are

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Yow! Look at this! Can you

speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)

text: cardboard tray with a mound of sand piled onto it. This is a
dialog: volcano.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: But not Juli. It’s a miracle she
dialog: didn’t turn up at the science fair
text: in a chicken suit.
text: At least six other boys have also made volcanos. One of the
text: boys lights a match. The top of his volcano starts to
text: sputter. Imitation lava flows down the side.
text: No one is looking at that volcano or at Bryce.
text: Nor are they looking at Shelly Stalls’ science project, which
dialog: is a study of how long lipstick stays on your mouth, in
text: comparison to lip gloss. There are fifteen large photographs
text: of Shelly's lips. Shelly stands there.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Hi, Bryce.
text: She puckers her lips at him.
text: But Bryce is looking over at a crowd of people.
text: They’re looking at Juli and her incubator. Tiny fuzzy chicks
text: and two little eggs cracking open ...
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: Listen to this, she actually
dialog: Managed to time it so the last two
text: eggs hatched during the fair.
text: A baby chick emerges from the shell.
text: THE ENTIRE GROUP OF SPECTATORS: AWWWWWWWW.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: How does a person do that?
scene_heading: INT. SAME SCENE - LATER
text: Juli stands on stage in front of a row of judges. She has
text: her incubator and a huge bulletin board with photos and
text: diagrams. She has a laser pointer.
dialog: flippedidmay21 21.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: (with disdain)
dialog: And yes that is a laser pointer.
dialog: To light this diagram or that part
dialog: of the incubator or this section of
dialog: the chart and talk about how
dialog: unbelievably exciting --
text: Bryce, eyes narrowed, watches...
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (to the judges)
dialog: It was unbelievably exciting --
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: -- it was to watch eggs grow for
dialog: twenty-one days.
text: ON THE AUDIENCE, watching. Juli’s parents and Matt and Mike,
text: so proud. Juli’s friend Darla watching too.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: And guess what?
text: The audience bursts into applause.
scene_heading: INT. SCIENCE FAIR - AN HOUR LATER
text: As Mrs. Brubeck pins a blue ribbon on Juli.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: That's right. She won first prize.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: And I want to thank mom who is such
dialog: a great supporter, my amazing Dad,
dialog: who helped me build the incubator,
dialog: and my brothers who did nothing --
text: The audience laughs.
text: On Bryce, not laughing.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT
text: Bryce is carrying his volcano out of the school.
text: comes up to him.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Your lava was great, Bryce --
dialog: Shelly
dialog: flippedidmay21 22.
text: Bryce tosses the volcano into a dumpster.
scene_heading: EXT. SAME SCENE - CONTINUOUS
text: Juli comes outside. Darla is helping her carry the
text: incubator. Everyone congratulates Juli. Her parents and
text: brothers are waiting.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: But those go back to Mrs. Brubeck,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: They’re coming home?
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Where else would they go?
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Darla could take them.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: My mom would kill me.
text: DARLA’S MOM appears.
speaker_heading: DARLA’S MOM
dialog: I would. I would kill her.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER HOUSE - NIGHT
text: As they get out of the van and walk into the house.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: But where are we going to raise
dialog: chickens?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
text: In the yard. They’re very low
text: maintenance. They eat bugs.
text: The family goes into the house.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: So that’s how we wound up with
dialog: chickens.
dialog: (continued)
dialog: flippedidmay21 23.
text: HOLD ON THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER YARD - DAY - A MONTH LATER
text: Six chickens in the front yard.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O., CONT.)
dialog: But what none of us thought of was
dialog: that six chickens scratching for
dialog: bugs not only gets rid of bugs, it
dialog: also tears up grass. So pretty
dialog: soon there was nothing whatsoever
dialog: left of our yard.
dialog: (continued)
text: We see there’s almost no grass left in the yard.
text: Across the street, we see Bryce, mowing the perfect Loski
dialog: lawn.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O., CONTINUED)
dialog: And I’m sorry to say this, but
dialog: chicken feed attracts mice.
dialog: (continued)
text: We see Matt and Mike, setting out some very simple
dialog: mousetraps.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O., CONTINUED)
dialog: So my brothers decided, as long as
dialog: we've got mice, might as well get a
dialog: snake. Snakes love mice.
scene_heading: INT. BAKER HOUSE - DAY
text: As Trina Baker goes up the stairs. Hold on the stairs as we
text: hear her open the door to Matt and Mike’s room. She screams.
speaker_heading: TRINA (0.C.)
dialog: What is a snake doing in this
dialog: house? Were you planning to tell
dialog: me about this?
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER GARAGE - DAY
text: The snake is now living in a large aquarium in the garage.
text: Matt, Mike and Robert are showing it to Trina.
dialog: flippedidmay21 24.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Trina, it will be fine. Boa
dialog: constrictors are really no trouble
dialog: at all.
scene_heading: INT. BAKER DEN - DAY
text: Trina is working at her computer as Juli comes into the room.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Mom, guess what?
text: She holds out her palms. Eggs.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: No. Honey, no. No more chickens,
dialog: please I can’t take this.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Not chickens, eggs. Just eggs.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Eggs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: AN EGG, CRACKING INTO A BOWL.
text: Cracking into a bowl.
text: A PLATE OF SCRAMBLED EGGS ...
text: It's passed around the table, everyone oohing and ahhing
dialog: about how great they taste.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: There is nothing in the world like
text: a fresh egg.
text: A PLATE OF DEVILLED EGGS
text: Robert pops one into his mouth.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: These are as good as my mother’s
text: devilled eggs.
dialog: flippedldmay21 25.
text: A BOWL OF EGG SALAD
text: As Robert heaps egg salad onto his plate.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Love egg salad. Love it.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Good thing you do.
scene_heading: AN EGG IN SOMEONE’S HAND ...
scene_heading: INT. SKYLER BROWN’S GARAGE - ANOTHER DAY
dialog: There’s a lot of rock and roll stuff -- guitars, drums,
text: amplifiers and an upright piano.
text: Lynetta stands in the garage with an egg in her hand. Ona
text: table is the boa constrictor. Next to her is her boyfriend
text: SKYLER BROWNE. A group of friends, including Juli’s
text: brothers Matt and Mike watch.
text: Skyler steps up next to Lynetta.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: To the riddle of which comes first,
dialog: we have an answer. The egg comes
dialog: first.
text: Lynetta waves the egg theatrically in the air.
text: Bryce comes into the garage, looking for Lynetta. Matt spots
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Bryce, my man, just in time for the
text: Skyler and Lynetta Show.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: (to Lynetta)
dialog: Mom wants you.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Give the baby bro a front row seat.
dialog: Come on, don’t be shy, step right
dialog: up ...
text: ON BRYCE, shoved into the front. Bryce’s mouth gapes open
text: when he sees the snake.
dialog: flippedidmay21 26.
speaker_heading: SKYLER
dialog: Lynetta, the egg please.
text: Lynetta holds up the egg as if she’s the magician’s helper,
text: displays it this way and that, locks lips with Skyler and
text: then hands the egg over to him. Skyler hands the egg to
dialog: Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Here’s where I come in.
dialog: (to the snake)
dialog: Ready?
text: ON BRYCE WATCHING as ...
text: Mike gives the egg to the snake, which opens its mouth wide
text: and ingests the egg whole. WE CAN SEE THE EGG IN THE BOA’S
speaker_heading: NECK.
text: ON BRYCE, FREAKED.
text: AND THEN THE BOA SWALLOWS A SECOND EGG.
text: AND THEN A THIRD EGG.
text: On Bryce, completely disgusted.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So Brycie boy, how is he going to
dialog: digest this? He needs a tree or a
dialog: leg.
dialog: (leaning in close)
dialog: Want to volunteer yours?
text: Everyone laughs.
text: Mike releases the snake to the floor.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Aww, too bad. He’s got another
dialog: idea. He’s going to use the piano
dialog: instead.
text: The snake slithers over and wraps itself around the piano
dialog: leg.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shhh, everyone, here goes.
text: Everyone watches.
text: The snake stops moving, then flexes. THE SOUND of the egg
text: crunching inside.
dialog: flippedidmay21 27.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (theatrically)
text: Dinner is served.
scene_heading: CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER
text: Bryce and Lynetta walking home.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: So sick.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: So cool --
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: I’m never eating an egg again.
text: THE SOUND OF A DOORBELL RINGING.
scene_heading: EXT. LOSKI HOUSE - A WEEK LATER - DAY
text: As Bryce opens the door. Juli is standing there with a half-
text: carton of eggs.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: You know my chickens? From the
dialog: science fair?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: (how could I forget them)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: So these are for you and your
dialog: family.
text: She hands him the eggs.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Oh. Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. LOSKI HOUSE - KITCHEN
text: The half-carton of eggs is on the table. Everyone is having
text: a kind of informal breakfast -- Bryce, Lynetta (whose makeup
text: from the night before is sort of running from her eyes),
text: Patsy, Rick and Chet. Chet is reading the newspaper.
dialog: flippedidmay21 28.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Scrambled? Fried?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: I’m having cereal.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: More coffee dad?
text: Chet barely responds. Patsy pours more coffee in his cup.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: (back to Bryce and the
dialog: eggs )
dialog: What about soft-boiled?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
text: Bryce is never eating another egg.
dialog: Because of the snake --
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: What snake?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: (as if it’s common
dialog: knowledge)
dialog: There's a snake living across the
text: street at the Bakers’, a boa
dialog: constrictor --
speaker_heading: PATSY
text: Across the street? Living across
dialog: the street?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: -- he’s kind of the mascot for the
dialog: guys’ band. Mystery Pisser.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: That’s the name of the snake?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: That’s the name of the band.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: What kind of parents would let
dialog: their children name a band
dialog: something like that? It’s vile.
dialog: flippedidmay21 29.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Their house is worth more because
dialog: they’re across the street from us
dialog: and our house is worth less because
text: we're across the street from them.
text: They all look at the carton of eggs. Patsy picks one up,
text: turns it around.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: What if you cracked it open and
dialog: there was a chick in it?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Ewwww.
text: She puts it back into the carton.
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: I’m having cereal.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: To be perfectly honest, I’ve never
dialog: been entirely sure how an egg gets
text: fertilized.
dialog: (he laughs)
dialog: I know I should know. I know
dialog: roosters have to be involved.
dialog: Birds do it, bees do it, but how do
dialog: they do it?
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Do they have sex with the hens?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well they must.
text: A pause at the table.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: They must.
text: Chet looks up from his newspaper.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: As with all birds, there has to be
dialog: mating for fertilization to occur.
dialog: (continued)
dialog: flippedidmay21 30.
text: Chet is speaking. Everyone is riveted.
speaker_heading: CHET (CONT’D)
dialog: Although it’s not particularly
text: romantic. The rooster picks a hen,
dialog: usually on the basis of proximity,
text: grabs her by the back of the head,
dialog: climbs on her back, and you can
dialog: pretty much figure out the rest.
dialog: The whole thing takes about 15
dialog: seconds give or take, and as far as
dialog: anyone can tell, the only
dialog: satisfying thing about the
dialog: encounter as far as the hen is
dialog: concerned is that afterwards she
text: fluffs up her feathers.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In any case, there are no roosters
dialog: at the Bakers, I will swear to it.
dialog: If there were roosters, we would
dialog: know. You can hear roosters.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Cock a doodle doo.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: (so pleased that he’s
dialog: finally said something)
dialog: Grandpa!
text: Chet goes back to his newspaper.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: I’m having seconds on cereal.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Well it’s easy to find out if there
dialog: are roosters. Just ask Lynetta to
dialog: ask Juli’s brothers.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: What are their names again?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Matt and Mike. Or get Lynetta to
dialog: get Skyler to ask them.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Shut up, Bryce.
dialog: flippedidmay21 31.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: What did I do now?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Haven't you noticed I haven't been
dialog: going down there, jerk?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Since yesterday.
text: Lynetta burst into tears.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Did something happen with you and
dialog: Skyler?
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Like you care.
text: She leaves the room.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh boy.
scene_heading: EXT. LOSKI BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: Rick and Bryce are putting golf balls. Chet is on the back
dialog: porch.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Why don’t you just ask Juli Baker?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: I’m not asking her anything.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (from the porch)
dialog: They have no rooster.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Just ask her.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAKER HOUSE - DAY
text: As Bryce and his friend GARRETT come down the back alley to
text: the fence behind the Baker house.
text: They look over it.
dialog: flippedidmay21 32.
text: A mess. Much worse than the front yard. There’s a makeshift
text: chicken coop and a few old pieces of lawn furniture. Champ
text: the dog is asleep.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Juli opens the back door and comes out of the house. She’s
text: carrying a basket to gather eggs.
text: Garrett and Bryce duck down behind the fence.
text: As Juli gets down on her hands and knees and dives into the
dialog: chicken coop.
text: The hens fly out of it.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: No rooster.
speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: Correctomundo.
scene_heading: INT. LOSKI HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Back at the dinner table.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Anyway, you guys can eat the eggs,
dialog: but there’s no way I’m going to
dialog: touch them, so don’t even ask.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Why’s that?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
text: There’s poop all over the place.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Gross.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
text: Chicken turds everywhere.
text: Lynetta stands up and leaves the table.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: You expect me to eat after this?
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Lynetta. You have to eat
dialog: something.
dialog: flippedidmay21 33.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: No I don’t!
text: She leaves the room and sticks her head back in.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Does the word salmonella mean
dialog: anything to you?
text: She splits again.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Do you think the eggs could have
dialog: salmonella?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
text: They're probably packed with it.
dialog: One bite --
text: (he grabs his neck and
dialog: pretends to gag to death)
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I can’t believe you didn’t just ask
dialog: her. You are afraid of that girl.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: She just bugs me. She bugs you
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Just take back the eggs and tell
dialog: them we don’t eat eggs. Tell her
dialog: we're allergic to them, or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Well that would be a lie. You want
dialog: him to lie?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That’s not the point. The point
text: is, he spies on someone’s yard
dialog: instead of asking a simple
dialog: question.
text: On Chet, looking at Rick. Clearly he thinks Rick is bullying
dialog: Bryce.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to Chet)
dialog: What is it?
dialog: flippedidmay21 34.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Nothing.
text: Chet looks back down at his plate.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (back to Bryce)
dialog: Just tell her, no eggs. I expect
dialog: you to look that girl square in the
dialog: eye.
scene_heading: DOORBELL RINGS.
scene_heading: INT. LOSKI HOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: So this is me, looking her square
text: in the eye.
text: Bryce opens the door for Juli.
text: She hands him some eggs. He can hardly look at her.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: And this is me, telling her “No
dialog: Eggs.”
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Thanks, Juli.
text: He closes the door.
text: On Bryce. Mortified. He turns around and we hold on him
text: with his back to the door, holding the eggs. Now what?
text: We hear his parents’ door open upstairs.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (0.C.)
dialog: I’1l be back about six.
text: As his father starts downstairs, Bryce quickly goes into:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: He opens the door to the trash below the sink, stuffs the
dialog: eggs into it.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: See there were so many eggs that I
dialog: had to give them away.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: flippedldmay21 35.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.0O.) (cont'd)
dialog: To the Loskis, and to our our next
dialog: door neighbor Mrs. Stueby --
scene_heading: EXT. STUEBY HOUSE - DAY
text: As Juli brings her some eggs.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O., CONT.)
dialog: Who started paying me for them.
dialog: Two dollars a dozen.
scene_heading: MRS. STUEBY
dialog: Nothing like free-range eggs.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.0.)
dialog: And then Mrs. Stueby told Mrs.
dialog: Helms --
scene_heading: EXT. HELMS HOUSE - DAY
text: As Juli drops eggs off to MRS. HELMS, who also pays her.
scene_heading: EXT. LOSKI HOUSE - DAY
text: As Juli crosses the street.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O., CONTINUED)
dialog: And when I brought the eggs to the
dialog: Loskis, it was so great --
text: As Bryce throws open the door again.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: Because it was like Bryce was
dialog: looking forward to me coming.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: I dreaded it --
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: And he always said, “Thanks, Juli” -
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Thanks, Juli.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: -- Like he really really meant it --
dialog: flippedidmay21 36.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: I sounded so fake I couldn’t
dialog: believe it --
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: The best, shiniest eggs went
dialog: straight to the Loskis, and in
dialog: return I got a few moments alone
dialog: with the world’s most dazzling
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: I could hardly even look at her.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN WASTEBASKET - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. BAKER HOUSE - MORNING
text: Juli, wearing her school backpack, comes out of her house

dialog: nothing to do with eggs.
dialog: (continued)
scene_heading: EXT. STREET —- DAY
text: A gorgeous day. Juli walks toward the sycamore tree and the

speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: And it happened on the most
dialog: beautiful day, which just goes to
dialog: show you that terrible things can

text: She drops her backpack, jumps onto the lowest branch and
text: climbs up.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF THE TREE - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: JULI’S VIEW - GLORIOUS.

scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TREE - CONTINUOUS
text: Darla’s at the base of the tree, as well as Shelly Stalls.
text: There’s a slightly dorky boy, JON TRULOCK.
speaker_heading: JULI (UP IN THE TREE)
dialog: What a morning!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - A LITTLE LATER
text: Bryce and Garrett and a couple of other kids walk down the

speaker_heading: JULI
text: The sun is sending streaks of fire
dialog: from one end of the world to

text: Bryce and the other kids look at each other. Typical Juli.

speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1
dialog: Sure we can.
scene_heading: JULI (FROM UP IN THE TREE)

speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1

speaker_heading: JON TRULOCK
dialog: Juli Baker.
speaker_heading: JULI

speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1
dialog: Is she crazy?
speaker_heading: JON TRULOCK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Yes, actually she is.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN #2
dialog: Well, this tree’s coming down, so
dialog: she’s got to get out of it.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: The tree’s coming down? What do
dialog: you mean the tree’s coming down?
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: I mean the tree’s coming down.
dialog: (calling up to Juli)
dialog: Hey, girl. You gotta come down
dialog: from there.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1
dialog: How did she get up there?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: She climbed.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Juli, they’re tearing down the

speaker_heading: JON TRULOCK

speaker_heading: JULI

dialog: This tree? The sycamore tree?
speaker_heading: WORKMAN #2
dialog: Yeah, whatever, it’s going. Come

speaker_heading: BRYCE
text: They have chain saws.
speaker_heading: DARLA

speaker_heading: JULI

speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: (shouting back)
dialog: The owner, that’s who.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: (also shouting up)
dialog: The owner.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (shouting down)
dialog: He has no right!
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: (shouting up)
dialog: He’s building himself a house and
dialog: he can’t very well do it with this

dialog: from there, we got work to do.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: (shouting up)

speaker_heading: SHELLY

speaker_heading: DARLA

speaker_heading: JULI

text: On the workmen, looking at each other, what is going on?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: She loves the tree.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1
dialog: Spare me.
speaker_heading: SHELLY

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: (to the workman)
dialog: Can I speak to you privately?
speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: If you cut down the tree, it’1l be
dialog: like cutting out her heart. That

speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: Your girlfriend’s a nut.
speaker_heading: BRYCE

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Well unfortunately it’s not. It’s

dialog: like Rumpelstilskin --
text: Looking down at the crowd looking up into the tree, we see

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: And judging from my recent

speaker_heading: JULI

speaker_heading: CHET

speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Most people are mixtures of things.

scene_heading: INT. BUS - STREET

speaker_heading: ROBERT

scene_heading: EXT. LOSKI HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. LOSKI HOUSE - DAY
text: As Bryce comes out the door carrying the trash.

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Why are you throwing the eggs away?
dialog: Did you break them?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Yeah and I’m really sorry about

text: The truck pulls away.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: So that’s basically it.

speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: They do?
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Why didn’t you just give them back
dialog: to me? Why didn’t you just come
dialog: up with a polite excuse like, we
dialog: don’t want your stupid eggs. I was
dialog: just being ... neighborly.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Yeah, well if you really want to be
dialog: neighborly look at your yard. It’s
dialog: a freak. People on this block have
dialog: lawns. Every single house. And
dialog: you know what? It’s May. Who has
dialog: Christmas lights all year long?
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: You don’t like our twinkle lights?
dialog: Are you nuts? Twinkle lights make

dialog: And Santa Clauses, everybody’s got
dialog: Santa Clauses all year long.
text: (throwing her line back at

speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: I couldn’t believe it. I wasted

scene_heading: EXT. BAKER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: As Juli walks into it and the door closes. Hold on the front

speaker_heading: JULI (V.O., CONTINUED)
dialog: What made me the craziest was that

speaker_heading: JULI

speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: I don’t think that’s a kind way to

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I wasn’t talking about Uncle David.
speaker_heading: TRINA

speaker_heading: JULI

speaker_heading: ROBERT

speaker_heading: JULI

scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

speaker_heading: JULI

dialog: flippedidmay21 58.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: That’s a huge undertaking. Once I

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: The Loskis have been throwing my

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: That is ridiculous --
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Did Patsy say that?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: They are such snobs.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Do you realize we’re the only
dialog: people on this entire block who

dialog: flippedidmay21 59.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Well, we used to have grass --
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: But then we had chickens --
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: So it’s my fault we don’t have
dialog: grass?
text: She bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Of course it’s not your fault,
dialog: honey. Even when we had grass our

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Eccentric. We are eccentric.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I know, I know.

speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Oh, honey --
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: That silly woman with her DKNY

speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: She’s not so bad. She helped me

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Since when do you know about DKNY
dialog: purses?
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I keep up.
speaker_heading: TRINA

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You really want to clean up the

speaker_heading: JULI

speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O., CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: BRYCE

speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: Oh, unilateral --
speaker_heading: JULI

speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: It was a big relief not to be

speaker_heading: MISS SIMMONS
dialog: All right, everyone, clear your

speaker_heading: GARRETT

speaker_heading: GARRETT
dialog: I do not want to be one of them --
speaker_heading: MISS SIMMONS
dialog: Well, you should. Basket boys are
dialog: a tradition that has helped support
dialog: this school since it was founded,
dialog: in 1983. It’s why we have flower
dialog: beds. It’s why we have shade trees
dialog: and apple trees. Visit another

speaker_heading: BRYCE

text: He looks at the ballot.
text: He looks over at Juli.

speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: I read down the list. There were
dialog: 158 names, and twenty of them were
dialog: going to be basket boys and
text: auctioned off like sides of beef to
dialog: pay for some flowers. But I
dialog: realized that to me, there had only
dialog: ever been Bryce. But I certainly
dialog: wasn’t going to vote for him. I
dialog: just couldn’t. What if I didn’t
dialog: choose anybody? What if I just
dialog: turned it in blank?
speaker_heading: MISS SIMMONS
dialog: And don’t even think about not
dialog: voting or you will get detention.
speaker_heading: JULI (V.O.)
dialog: So I voted for the boys who weren’t

speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Take it easy, Dad.
speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well that certainly explains

speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: Rick --
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That’s the reason they never kept

speaker_heading: BRYCE

speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: The day they took the tree down.
dialog: It scared me she was up so high.
dialog: But after I read the article I
dialog: understood why she did it. The
dialog: tree’s gone, but she’s still got

scene_heading: EXT. LONG SHOT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: I was engaged to be married to
dialog: someone named Geraldine McCarthy,
dialog: oh yes, they’d sent out the
dialog: invitations and they even had one
dialog: of those bridal showers deals, I
dialog: remember someone gave us a big
dialog: plate from Marshall Field with
dialog: asparagus painted on it, that was
dialog: the idea, you used the plate just
dialog: for asparagus. God forbid you
dialog: should put a string bean on it.
dialog: Geraldine got so angry at me when I
dialog: broke off the engagement and she
dialog: had to return all the presents
dialog: including the asparagus plate, but
dialog: I couldn’t help myself because I’d
dialog: met Renee and I couldn’t very well
dialog: get married to anyone else once I
dialog: did. Of course then I had to
dialog: prove to Renee I was worthy of her
dialog: because I'd wasted all that time
dialog: with Miss Asparagus Plate.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: How did you do that?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: A grand gesture. I made a grand
dialog: gesture.
text: They come to a stop.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Renee would have sat up in that

speaker_heading: BRYCE

speaker_heading: CHET

scene_heading: INT. BRYCE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

text: He opens the bottom desk drawer and takes out the creased and
text: scrunched newspaper.
text: He turns on his desk lamp, illuminating the article and
text: picture of Juli. The rest of his room stays in semi-darkness.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
dialog: So finally I read the article.
dialog: They called her “a strong voice in
text: the urban wilderness,” “a radiant

dialog: to curtail overdevelopment.” I
dialog: couldn’t help thinking about my

dialog: this?
text: Bryce looks at the photo of Juli in the newspaper.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
text: I kept looking at the photo of
dialog: Juli.
text: On the photo of Juli in the newspaper: It’s a close up of
text: her at the top of the tree, taken with a telephoto lens.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)
text: She’s looking off in the distance
text: and the wind is blowing her hair
text: back like she’s at the helm of a
text: ship or something, sailing into the
dialog: sun.
text: ON BRYCE, staring at the photo.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: BRYCE

speaker_heading: PATSY

speaker_heading: PATSY

speaker_heading: ROBERT

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Bryce Loski is my mortal enemy.
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I’m not kidding. He’s disgusting,
dialog: shallow, immature, revolting --
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: I couldn’t really say no. She once
dialog: helped me jump-start my car. And
dialog: after all that help Chet’s been to
dialog: you --
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: They’re just asking us over so
dialog: we'll take down the twinkle lights.
dialog: That’s probably the whole purpose.
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: It sounded more like a let’s-be-

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Let’s not be friends.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Oh, Daddy, thank you. Thank you,

dialog: the tree.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - ANOTHER DAY
text: Bryce leans on his elbow and pretends to read but manages to

text: she moves around the library.
text: FROM THE STACKS ...
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Psst. Juli.
text: Juli doesn’t hear. Darla tosses a lipstick at her.
text: Juli goes over and huddles in the stacks with Darla.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Bryce is bonkers over you.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Bryce Loski?

speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: Like there’s another Bryce --
text: The boy is positively lost in

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Look at him? Shoot me first.
text: Darla literally turns her that direction.
text: Bryce has his hands over his eyes with his fingers slightly

text: Darla cracks up.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I have to go dinner there tonight.
speaker_heading: DARLA
dialog: I bet you’re the dessert, girl.

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: (laughing but horrified)

scene_heading: INT. BAKER HOUSE - LATER

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER

speaker_heading: ROBERT

scene_heading: INT. LOSKI LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That yard of yours has come along.

speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: probably the best time of my life.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Seriously, Dude. It’s so bad.
text: Trina shoots Mike and Matt a look.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well it is, Mom. It’s that whole
dialog: robotron attitude of education --
dialog: confine, confute, conform.
dialog: (xe the food: lets the
dialog: word roll off his tongue)
dialog: So this is risotto. No wonder it’s
dialog: famous.
dialog: flippedidmay21 93.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to Matt and Mike)
dialog: So you're not thinking of college?
text: ON BRYCE, his father is really embarrassing him. He looks

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m applying early admission to

speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But we’ll probably give the music

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh, the music thing.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Dad, your sarcasm is not

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (to Robert)
dialog: How do you feel about that, Robert?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I learned a long time ago that I
dialog: have very little power over my

dialog: thing --
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: The band’s really good, Dad.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I’m sure they are.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: No they are. Sometimes they remind
dialog: me of Husker Du, sort of indie rock
dialog: but you can’t really put them ina

text: On Mike and Matt, pleased.
text: On Juli. She can’t help liking Bryce a little.

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It’s okay if you don’t like it but
dialog: it’s what we do.
speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: I could listen to it again and

speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: You must write down the lyrics for

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Just one song?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We've written a ton of songs,

speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: expensive. I know ...
speaker_heading: PATSY
dialog: When Rick and I met, he was playing

speaker_heading: LYNETTA
dialog: Dad? You were in a band? What'd
dialog: you play? Clarinet?

dialog: Country.
scene_heading: MATT AND MIKE
dialog: Dude! Total respect, man.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And when our band tried to get a

dialog: expensive. So how’d you afford it?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We found this guy on the Internet --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He was blowing out his old analog

speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Digital is weak, don’t you think?
dialog: You lose too much of the waveform.

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: TRINA

speaker_heading: BRYCE & JULI
dialog: (at the same time)
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: They’re embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: I shouldn’t have said that about

speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: I shouldn't have said anything
dialog: about your house, I mean, it’s your

text: Juli looks at him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, your Uncle.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: My Uncle?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Because you know, it costs so much

dialog: afford to keep the yard up.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Because of Greenhaven and

speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Oh man, oh man, that is so

dialog: flippedidmay21 97.
speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: What did I do now?
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: That's not the reason we didn’t

speaker_heading: BRYCE
dialog: Hey, I didn’t mean anything. I

speaker_heading: JULI

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Maybe Chet got confused.
speaker_heading: JULI
dialog: Not possible. Chet would never
