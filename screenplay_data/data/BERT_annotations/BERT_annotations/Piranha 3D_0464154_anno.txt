scene_heading: EXT. LAKE HAVASU - DAY
text: A garish Jose Cuervo ad flashes by on the side of a bright
text: yellow HUMMER as it drives through frame, pulling CAMERA into
text: the mid-summer crush of semi-clad, youthful bodies on main
dialog: street Lake Havasu, Arizona.
text: Havasu is an overcrowded blue collar summer paradise at the
dialog: peak of its three-month-a-year run of prosperity. You can
text: almost smell the sunscreen as heat waves make the crowd on
text: the pavement appear to waver like a mirage in the desert.
text: Main street is a row of tourist trap t-shirt shops, bars
text: coffee shops and cafes. Beyond lies the shimmering expanse
dialog: of the lake itself.
text: CRANE SHOT ENDS as a four wheel drive pick-up pulls into
text: foreground. A sign on the side of the truck reads “Patterson
text: Bait and Dive Shop.” A beautiful golden retriever, BAXTER
text: bounds out of the open truck bed, barking merrily.
text: TED PATTERSON and JULIE TUPPER step out of the cab. They’re
dialog: one of those golden couples who have the ease and confidence
text: of two people who are perfect for each other. They are
text: bronzed, athletic, early thirties.
scene_heading: INT. PET STORE - DAY
text: A bell mounted on the front door JINGLES merrily as Julie
text: enters with Baxter bounding close at her heels. The
text: Proprietor, NATE HASKEL, is a pleasant, if forgettable,
text: middle-aged man, idly surfing the web on his laptop. He
text: rises as they enter.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Hi, Ted. Hi, Miss Tupper. Can you
dialog: believe this heat?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Pretty miserable, but it’s good for
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Not mine. Tourists usually don’t
dialog: bring pets... and they don’t think
dialog: much about taking one home. what
dialog: can I do for you today?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We need a bag of dry food and a
text: couple of those rawhide chews.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You’re a lucky dog, Baxter.
text: Baxter barks in agreement.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (gathers goods)
dialog: So, the big day’s coming right up,
dialog: isn’t it?
text: Julie and Ted share a warm glance.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Only three weeks.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You trying to get me nervous, Nate?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Well, some of us wouldn’t mind if
dialog: you got cold feet. You got the
dialog: prettiest girl in Havasu.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That’s sweet, Nate.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: That’1l be twenty-two thirty-five.
dialog: (as Ted pays)
dialog: You know, those Balinese fighting
dialog: fish should be in next week.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Balinese fighting fish?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: They’re beautiful, hon. wait ‘til
dialog: you see ‘em.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Sounds like they’1l eat everything
text: else in the tank.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Don’t worry, they come with their
dialog: own environment.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I heard the Sumatras are more
dialog: aggressive than the Balinese.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Maybe so, but I wouldn’t recommend
dialog: them. They’re much more sensitive
dialog: to the PH balance. There’s a
dialog: website here somewhere...
text: Nate punches up the website on laptop.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (takes Baxter)
dialog: You two chat, I’ve got to get back
dialog: to the dock. Your brother’s the
text: only one minding the store.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That’s trouble.
text: She gives him a quick kiss.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: And don’t forget, you’ve got a dive
dialog: at one o’clock with that dot com
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: The great white hunter. How could
dialog: I forget?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Just don’t let him spear you in
dialog: that cute tush.
text: Julie pinches Ted’s jeans-clad butt.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hey, easy...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (waves as she exits)
dialog: Thanks, Nate!
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Oh, anytime, Miss Tupper.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Julie.
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: Or Mrs. Patterson.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Okay, Mrs. Patterson.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE HAVASU - AFTERNOON
text: An isolated inlet. This is the remote end of Havasu...
text: breathtaking red rock terrain sculpted by time itself. Not
dialog: much has changed here in ten thousand years...
text: CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to reveal Ted standing waist-deep in the
text: water, wearing a full wet suit and diving gear. MR. CROUSE,
text: a slightly pudgy yuppie with a tourist’s sunburn waits beside
text: Ted as he checks his spear gun.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The grouper like to feed in these
dialog: inlets this time of day. Remember
dialog: it’s all about your approach.
speaker_heading: MR. CROUSE
dialog: Cool. I’m a human shadow. Lead
dialog: the way.
text: Ted slips on his dive mask, sucks in his mouth piece, and
text: submerges with barely a ripple. Crouse follows with an
text: awkward SPLASH.
text: As they disappear beneath the surface, CAMERA pushes past
text: them to the nearby shore... where an old TIRE SWING is tied
text: off to an oak tree. All is silent and still.
dialog: Beat.
text: Then the tire slowly begins to swing. At first, almost
text: imperceptibly. Then in a widening arc, as if it hada
text: ghostly rider. The barren branches of the entire tree begin
text: to TREMBLE.
scene_heading: ROCK FORMATIONS - VARIOUS
text: The ground begins to SHAKE. Several fist-sized rocks tumble
text: down the slopes as we hear the growing RUMBLE of an
dialog: earthquake.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TOWN OF HAVASU - VARIOUS CUTS
text: People in the streets react as the tremor hits Havasu. A
text: pitcher of beer SMASHES to the sidewalk at an outdoor cafe.
scene_heading: INT. PET STORE
text: Dogs HOWL and parrakeets FLAP in their cages. Nate manages
text: to catch a fish bowl just as it tips off a counter top.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE HAVASU - UNDERWATER - SAME TIME
text: Patterson and Crouse are tossed about beneath the surface in
text: a churning backwash of water.
text: The rocky slope at the bottom of the lake SHAKES violently.
text: Then a jagged crack travels up the slope like an inverse
text: lightning bolt... and a_twenty foot rift in the floor of the
text: lake cracks open.
text: There is a deafening ROAR of water and both men are violently
text: sucked into the rift... followed by tons of sand and rock.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - SPEED BOAT - SAME TIME
text: Julie rises to her feet, screw driver in one greasy hand,
text: spark plug in the other. JACOB WYATT is assisting her. He’s
text: a tough-as-nails ex-longshoreman in his sixties.
text: The boat they’re working on begins BANGING against the dock’s
text: pylons. Julie grips the gunnels to steady herself.
text: Then it’s over as suddenly as it started.
scene_heading: INT. PET STORE - SAME TIME
text: Nate waits a beat, then sets the fish bowl safely back down.
text: The parrakeets PEEP angrily, but settle back in their cages.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME TIME
speaker_heading: C.U. TED
text: He struggles to orientate himself in pitch darkness. He’s
dialog: alive... but where?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Ted CLICKS on a flashlight and the beam reveals a dark moving
text: SHADOW whirling straight towards him.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - SAME TIME
text: Julie rises as the boat steadies itself. ZACK PATTERSON,
text: Ted’s younger brother, bursts out of the dive shop and
text: crosses to Julie. Zack’s a tattooed twenty-year-old with a
text: curious charm about him.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: You okay, Julie?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah. Was that an earthquake?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (gets back to work)
dialog: Hell, that was nothing but a
dialog: hiccup. I’ve been in an
dialog: earthquake.
text: MARCUS (20s), Zack’s co-worker, joins them.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Let me guess, that one with Moses,
dialog: right? When he parted the red sea.
dialog: Wasn’t Pharaoh after you guys?
text: Jacob is clearly used to Marcus’ dry humor.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: As a matter of fact, it was the San
text: Fran quake in ‘89. Little puss
dialog: like you would have shit his heart
text: straight into his tighty whities.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Zack, is your brother still out on
dialog: that dive?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Yeah. Wonder if he felt
dialog: anything...
text: CAMERA PUSHES into a CLOSE UP of Julie as a hint of concern
text: crosses her features.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Try him on the radio, will you?
text: SMASH CUT TO BLACK
text: Images briefly FLASH against the darkness, like the flicker
text: of lightning. A RUMBLE of thunder accompanies each image;
scene_heading: FLASH #1 - EXT. LAKE - TED’S BOAT - SUNSET
text: Julie frantically inspects Ted’s empty boat, which floats
text: adrift. Zack and Jacob tie their boat off to Ted’s.
text: BACK TO BLACK
scene_heading: FLASH #2 - EXT. LAKE - SEARCH BOATS - NIGHT
text: Two state owned Fish and Game boats ROAR along the shoreline.
text: A grim-faced SEARCH TEAM scans the darkness with powerful
text: spot lights.
text: Julie and Zack ride in the back of the lead boat.
text: BACK TO BLACK
scene_heading: FLASH #3 - INT. TED’S CABIN - NIGHT
text: Julie, surrounded by Ted’s family and friends, breaks down in
text: tears. Zack reacts with anger and frustration, SMASHING his
text: glass in the fire place.
text: BACK TO BLACK
scene_heading: TITLES FADE UP - “THREE DAYS LATER”
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF DOBBS’ OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A cluttered Fish and Game Department office. SHERIFF JIM
text: DOBBS, late fifties, is a seasoned enforcement veteran; a
dialog: good man whose simply been at this job too long to believe
dialog: he’s going to save anybody but himself and his pension.
text: He sits across the desk from Julie Tupper, who has learned to
dialog: believe the same about him.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: We’ve had our resources maxed out
dialog: for days now. I can’t justify it
dialog: any longer.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You’re calling the search off.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I have no choice. Fourth of July
dialog: is the busiest weekend of the year.
dialog: Maybe after the holiday...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Maybe what?! He could still be
text: alive out there.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: He certainly could. In fact, I’d
dialog: bet money on it. But not in
dialog: Havasu, maybe not even in Arizona.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Look, I don’t want to upset you
dialog: anymore than I have to...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s a little late for sensitivity.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Ted Patterson was a better diver
dialog: than any man on my search team.
dialog: There’s no way he drowned in Lake
dialog: Havasu.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The truth is, there’s no evidence
dialog: that there was any kind of accident
dialog: at all.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: We found his boat adrift!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Which makes it seem pretty damn
dialog: strange that we haven’t found a
text: body by now.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: Your wedding was supposed to be in
dialog: two weeks, correct?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What are you getting at?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: We have to consider all the
dialog: possibilities. One of them is that
dialog: Ted simply left town.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That’s ridiculous!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You want to tell me what’s more
dialog: likely? Alien abduction?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: How do you explain the businessman
dialog: Ted was diving with...?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: We still have no record of this
dialog: “Mr. Crouse.” None of the hotels
dialog: had him registered. No one’s
text: turned up to inquire about him.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: So, what... you don’t believe me?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I know this is difficult for you.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You’re difficult for me.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (ice cold)
dialog: We’re done for today, Miss Tupper.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You were done before you even
dialog: started, weren’t you Sheriff?
dialog: (rises)
dialog: I guess I can’t blame you, this is
dialog: such a busy time of year for you.
dialog: Must be hard to keep up with all
dialog: those fishing licenses.
text: Julie storms out and slams the door.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jacob is waiting for her, standing beside the dive shop pick-
text: He knows the story from the look on her face.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (enters passenger’s side)
dialog: Don’t ask.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: They’re just glorified park
dialog: rangers, Julie. Even if Dobbs
dialog: wanted to help, he couldn’t find
text: his own ass with two hands and a
dialog: flashlight.
text: Julie slides into the passenger seat, the entire weight of
text: the tragedy on her shoulders.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What do you think happened to him,
dialog: Jacob?
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Anything can happen in the water.
dialog: Anything. I don’t care if it’s six
dialog: feet or sixty.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (searches for the words)
dialog: But Ted was... he was the best.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: I know. I taught him.
text: Jacob cranks the engine, reaches under the seat and hands
text: Julie a coffee thermos.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Coffee’s the last thing I need.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: It ain’t coffee.
text: As Jacob pulls out, Julie unscrews the cap and sniffs. The
text: vapors alone makes her eyes water.
speaker_heading: JACOB
dialog: Go ahead, it won’t make you feel
dialog: any worse.
text: Julie thinks it over... then she takes a deep swig.
speaker_heading: WIDER - HAVASU
text: The pick-up swings out and passes by a traffic jam of
text: incoming tourists. A large red, white and blue banner is
text: strung across main street. It reads “Happy Independence Day
dialog: From Lake Havasu City Council.”
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DIVE SHOP - NEXT DAY
text: Posters for “Havasu’s Fourth of July Fireworks Extravaganza”
text: adorn the building. The dock is busy with a variety of
text: college kids and vacationing families.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE SHOP - DAY
text: TAYLOR BILLINGS enters the shop like he owns the place. He’s
text: a trust fund kid with a rocker ponytail, streaked with beauty
dialog: salon highlights.
text: He’s accompanied by REGGIE TRIPP, a frat type with a gym rat
text: physique, Reggie’s girlfriend, SYDNEY (hot and knows it) and
text: her college roomies CAMILLE and J.C. Camille talks on her
text: cell phone as she aimlessly wanders about the shop.
dialog: The girls are pretty, but there’s something special about the
text: quiet one, J.C. Zack notices her right away.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Hi. Can I help you guys?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We want to rent tanks, regulators,
dialog: the works.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Light gear. Just for a little
dialog: sport diving.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Great. Are you certified?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I’m a Navy Seal, man.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes, really.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Still gotta know if you’re
dialog: certified.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (getting irritated)
dialog: I’m certified, alright?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Then you’ve got a card...?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I got this.
text: Reggie pulls up his sleeve and flexes. There is an
text: impressive Navy Seals tattoo on his bicep.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (in Zack’s face)
dialog: You can read, right?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: C’mon Reggie. Please don’t start.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (to girls)
dialog: What about you guys? Ever dive
dialog: before?
dialog: J.C.
dialog: Just some snorkeling. But I’d like
dialog: to learn.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I can take care of them. I’m an
dialog: instructor too.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Right. Look, if they want to dive,
dialog: they need to get certified. Takes
dialog: about a week. Maybe you should do
dialog: it too, y’know. Just to brush up.
text: Taylor intercedes, pulling out a Gucci money clip loaded with
dialog: fifties.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We’re only in town for a couple of
dialog: days. I’1ll pay double. Like a
dialog: rush fee.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Can’t do that.
text: Julie enters from the back of the shop, senses trouble right
dialog: away .
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What’s going on, Zack?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Gear rentals. I got it. It’s
dialog: okay.
text: Zack sets down a clipboard with a rental form on it.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: If you really want to dive, I can
dialog: take you guys out myself. As long
dialog: as I accompany you, one quick
dialog: lesson and you’re good to go.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It’s a scam.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s the law. If you don’t like
dialog: it, that’s okay. There’s lots of
dialog: other things to do in Havasu.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (eyes Julie)
dialog: Why don’t you take us out?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Zack’s the best. If you like, we
dialog: also do tours on our glass bottom
dialog: boat. Stay dry and see some
text: spectacular underwater life.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: That shit’s for tourists.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Come on, Reggie. Don’t be a dick.
dialog: Let’s go on the dive.
text: Camille finally finishes her phone call.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Screw this, you guys. We can just
text: hangout on the houseboat.
text: J.C. smiles at Zack. Something’s going on between the two of
dialog: them.
dialog: J.C.
dialog: No. Let’s try it. It’d be cool.
text: Sydney squeezes Reggie’s arm.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: C’mon, baby.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: What the hell...
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Best time’s early. Like seven a.m.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Gawd. Are you serious? This is
dialog: supposed to be a vacation.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: He’s right. The lake’1l be calm.
dialog: Good visibility. Good dive will
dialog: take you ‘til lunch. We supply
text: sandwiches and sodas.
text: Taylor lays down his platinum card.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Can you stock some Coronas?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Only for after the dive.
dialog: (aside, to Zack)
dialog: You sure you want to take these
dialog: guys out? They seem like a
dialog: handful.
text: Zack glances up at J.C. and catches her looking at him.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: It’1l be okay.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: If they don’t shape up during the
dialog: lesson, promise me you’1l1 pull the
dialog: plug.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: You got my word.
scene_heading: EXT. DIVE SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: The girls and guys walk to their cars.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: I can’t believe it. You liked that

dialog: J.C.
dialog: No way.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Bullshit. I know you, J.C.
dialog: J.C.
dialog: Alright, he was cute. So what?
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: He’s a loser townie, J.C. And if
dialog: you start hanging out with one of
dialog: the locals it makes us all look
text: like sluts.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Two more weeks and we’re back at
dialog: school. You can wait ‘til then to
dialog: get revenge on Chad.
dialog: J.C.
dialog: I don’t want revenge on Chad.
speaker_heading: SYDNEY
dialog: Of course you do. He dumped you in
text: front of the entire school.
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: Besides, nothing’s better than
dialog: revenge sex. That’1ll get Chad
dialog: jealous and he’1ll want you back.
dialog: Then you get to have great make-up
dialog: sex. And after that, you’1l
dialog: finally be over Chad, so you can be
dialog: the one to dump him. Perfect,
dialog: right?
dialog: J.C.
dialog: Camille... are you still seeing
dialog: that therapist?
speaker_heading: CAMILLE
dialog: No. My mom started dating him, so
dialog: it kinda seemed like I was talking
dialog: to my dad.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE SHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Zack watches J.C. through the dive shop window. MARCUS,

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: See something you like?
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: I dunno.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: They’re Arizona State girls, Zack.

dialog: a trust fund. That ain’t us.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: True.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Any word on your brother?
text: Zack hangs his head.
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: He’s gonna turn up, Zack. You did
dialog: everything you could, so...
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (cuts him off)
dialog: Let’s drop it, okay?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Okay, okay...
text: Marcus reaches into his back pocket, pulls out a flyer...
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Here. Concentrate on this.
dialog: It’s for a Fourth of July party.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Club Zanzabar?
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I made a deal with Rodriguez to use
dialog: the Sand Bar. If I turn a profit,
dialog: I’1l get to do it every Wednesday
dialog: night. I’m a club promoter now,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: You can call it what you want.
dialog: It’s still the Sand Bar. The

speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: I got a D.J. out of Vegas. Guy’s

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MARCUS(cont'd)
dialog: The place will be packed and not
dialog: with those stuck up college
dialog: bitches, either.
text: Zack takes a last glance out the window at the girls. They

dialog: fun and money.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LAKE - SUNSET
text: The orange rim of the sun dips beneath the horizon line.
text: The exact moment it’s snuffed out like a candle... nightfall.
text: The water is calm.
dialog: Beat.
text: A TURBULENCE begins just beneath the dark surface... dozens
text: and dozens of source points swirl about.
text: One split second of activity, then the strange phenomenon is
text: over as if it never happened.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIL - NIGHT
text: Two tourists, a teenage boy and girl, ride along on
text: horseback, passing a joint back and forth.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Let’s stop for awhile. There’s
dialog: supposed to be an old boathouse a
dialog: little ways up this trail.
text: The girl giggles and passes the joint back.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Okay, but you have to catch me
dialog: first!
text: The girl kicks her horse in the flanks and it takes off like
text: a bolt of lightning. The boy wheels around and pursues at a
text: full gallop.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Amy!
scene_heading: EXT. SHORELINE - NIGHT
text: The girl is a hell of a rider. She rides at a full gallop
text: straight toward the lake, laughing wildly. Youth plus dope
dialog: and horse power. Always trouble.
dialog: 18.
text: The horse plunges straight into the lake. KER-SPLASH!
dialog: Probably feels good on this hot night.
text: The boy reigns his horse in at the shoreline.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Amy, get back here!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Come and get me! wWhat’s wrong,
dialog: scared of the water?
text: She and the horse are now chugging along in deeper water,
text: following the shoreline. The boy kicks his horse’s flanks
text: but it spooks at the water line, refuses to go in.
scene_heading: EXT. BOATHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Amy has reached the abandoned boathouse. The dilapidated
text: pier is half-submerged in the inlet. An old tire swing hangs
text: from a dead tree. The same tire swing where Ted was sucked
dialog: under. Now we know exactly where we are... and it’s nota
dialog: good place to be.
text: Amy can hear the boy calling.
speaker_heading: BOY (0.S.)
speaker_heading: AAAMMMMYYYY !
text: She reigns her horse in and pats him on the neck. He stands
text: in the water, up to his shoulders.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What do you think? Should we go
dialog: back...?
text: The horse WHINNIES deep in its throat. Something is spooking
dialog: him.
text: Amy follows the horse’s fearful gaze.
scene_heading: AMY’S P.O.V. - THE WATER
text: The strange DISTURBANCE appears on the moonlit surface.
text: Dozens, maybe hundreds of churning points of contact. But
text: this time they move with purpose, traveling directly at Amy.
text: The entire formation submerges as it races straight at her.
text: The horse rears up in panic. Amy tries desperately to reign
dialog: him in.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, Stormy!
text: ANGLE ON THE BOY
text: He hears the horses frantic WHINNY and realizes something’s
text: deeply wrong. He kicks his horse into a gallop along the
text: rocky shoreline.
dialog: BACK TO AMY
text: Her horse is clambering for a foothold, still up to its
text: shoulders in the water. Amy is fighting to control him with
dialog: all her might.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, Stormy, no!
scene_heading: MYSTERY P.O.V.
text: Eerie SONAR VISION scans the horse beneath the surface as it
text: struggles to get it’s footing.
text: The P.O.V. picks up speed, rocketing straight at its intended
dialog: target.
scene_heading: ON SHORE - THE BOY
text: At a full gallop, somehow knowing, fearing just how bad this
text: could be. He hears Amy SCREAM.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: The water all around her suddenly ERUPTS with blood and
text: bubbles. The horse BRAYS in agony, thrashing violently
text: against an unseen enemy.
text: It collapses into the churning water, taking Amy with it.

text: Finally gallops up to Amy’s location. He dismounts and

text: But there’s no sign of the horse or Amy.
speaker_heading: SHOCK CUT
text: The horse breaks the surface, it’s a LIVING NIGHTMARE of raw
text: flesh stripped down to the bone, yet it’s somehow still
text: alive; it’s eyes rolled back in agony. Amy is coughing
text: water, clutching in blind fear to the saddle horn.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CLOSER - AMY
text: She SCREAMS hysterically as her horse is literally torn to
text: pieces beneath her... she tumbles with it, straight back down
text: into the deadly broiling water.
text: The boy flies out of the darkness on the tire swing... He
text: grabs Amy around the waist and swings to safety as the horse
text: finally collapses beneath the surface.
text: All this has happened without ever revealing a glimpse of the
text: ungodly force that pulled the horse under.
speaker_heading: SHORELINE
text: The boy and Amy hit the ground hard as they land on the rocky
text: shoreline. He scrambles to his feet, holding her tightly.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Amy, are you okay?
text: She does not reply. By the vacant look on her blood-
text: splattered face we realize she may never be okay again.
speaker_heading: BOY

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE

scene_heading: MRS. TUNNIE

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: MRS. TUNNIE(cont'd)

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You know what, Mrs. Tunnie?
dialog: There’s only one thing I miss.
scene_heading: MRS. TUNNIE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Dancing in Vegas. I miss shaking

speaker_heading: ZACK

speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Bad knee?

dialog: Just gotta take care of it. I tore

dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: What kind of swimming?
dialog: J.C.
dialog: I compete for Arizona State. I’1ll
dialog: be fine as long as I don’t push it.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: As far as I’m concerned, the whole
dialog: point of diving is not pushing it.
dialog: It’s about going with the flow. I
dialog: think you’re gonna love it.
dialog: J.C.
dialog: Why do you?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: What?
dialog: J.C.
dialog: Love it so much. I can see it in
dialog: your face when you talk about it.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (adjusts her harness)
dialog: I dunno. It’s kind of like flying.
dialog: No, it’s more like... a dream of
dialog: flying. You’re weightless, gliding
dialog: through this secret world where all
dialog: you can hear is your own breathing.
dialog: And no one else can see what you
dialog: see.
dialog: J.C.
dialog: You must dive alone a lot.

text: Zack turns the valve in the opposite direction Reggie’s been
text: turning it. We instantly hear the HISS of air coming through

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: This is different than the gear we

speaker_heading: ZACK

dialog: Look at that...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SHORELINE
text: J.C. hops up into the old tire swing. Now we know they’ve

speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Hey! Don’t do that!
dialog: J.C.
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: That thing’s like twenty, thirty

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
dialog: Havasu doesn’t have the crystal clear waters of the
dialog: Caribbean, but it does have its own unique beauty. The

text: light that ripple across the perfect bodies of J.C. and her
text: girlfriends as they gracefully descend.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE :
text: Zack puts the college kids through some of the basics;
text: Flooding their face masks, then learning how to blow them
text: clear without surfacing.
text: “Buddy Breathing,” in which two divers alternate off of one
text: tank. Reggie breaks rank to play grabass with Sydney.
text: Zack and J.C. glide weightlessly along the incline of the
text: rocky slope. J.C. spreads her arms like wings to “fly” for
dialog: Zack.
text: Taylor gets Zack’s attention, showing him that his regulator
text: is reading in the red (low air time). Zack scribbles ona
text: hand-sized MARKER BOARD. It reads: “Relax. You're
dialog: Hyperventilating.”
speaker_heading: ANGLE J.C.
text: She’s noticed something peculiar a short distance ahead. We
text: immediately recognize the RIFT, the deep crevice that
dialog: swallowed Ted Patterson alive.
speaker_heading: CLOSER - RIFT
text: The sand along the rim is slowly, but constantly trickling
text: inward, disappearing into the dark void within. It’sa
dialog: subtle but weird phenomenon.
text: J.C. glides over for a closer look
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ZACK
text: As he turns, realizing he’s lost sight of J.C... then he
text: spots her.
speaker_heading: THE RIFT
text: J.C. swims down towards the rift, gracefully passing through
text: a shaft of rippling light. The second she’s over the open
text: crevice, she’s violently sucked down into it.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: ZACK REACTS
text: He drops his hand board and swims with all his might, blazing
dialog: straight to J.C.
speaker_heading: THE RIFT
text: J.C. desperately clutches a rocky outcropping as the undertow
text: drags her inside. Nothing but a slippery hand hold keeps her
text: from being swallowed up by the darkness.
scene_heading: INT. RIFT - SONAR P.O.V.
text: An eerie SONAR image of J.C., as she’s seen by something from
text: inside the rift. She appears as a softly strobing
text: silhouette, constantly scanned and rescanned by radiating
text: sonar waves. A small figure in a vast black limbo.
text: The P.O.V. rushes straight up at the struggling J.C.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE RIFT
text: J.C.’s hand slips and she’s jerked inside. But she snags a
text: second hand hold.
text: Frantic, she looks back over her shoulder, into the darkness.
text: Her dive mask is RIPPED from her face by the relentless
text: current. She slips a few more inches, now blinded.
speaker_heading: SONAR P.O.V.
text: Rushing straight at J.C.’s feet
scene_heading: C.U. - J.C.’S HAND
text: White knuckled grip. She hangs on... but the rock gives way.
scene_heading: CA-RUNCH!
text: J.C. disappears into the darkness. But Zack’s hand thrusts
text: into the rift and grabs her forearm.
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: He straddles the rift, fighting tons of water pressure. He
text: pulls all his might... and J.C. slowly begins to appear, inch
dialog: by inch.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Zack manages to get J.C. past the outer edge of the crevice.
text: The grip of the relentless undertow is suddenly broken and

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: What?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I’m not sure. Circle around...
text: The Deputy swings the boat in a tight 360. This time he cuts
text: the engines and they drift along in silence. Nate scans the
dialog: lake bed.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Right there...
text: He leans out over the side of the boat to get a better look.
speaker_heading: SONAR P.O.V.
text: From below... scanning Nate as he leans out. The sun behind

scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - NATE
text: Half hidden in the shallows, a piece of metal GLINTS in the
text: sunlight... a stirrup.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Right there.
text: Nate slips over the side into waist-deep water. The terrain
text: beneath the water is rough. The rotted wood of the old
text: boathouse’s dilapidated pier makes it tricky.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (to Deputy)
dialog: For Christ’s sake, Jerry. Give him
text: a hand.
text: The Deputy slips off his t-shirt and tosses it in the boat...
text: submerges in the shallow water.
scene_heading: UNDERWATER - SIMULTANEOUS
text: The Deputy grabs the stirrup and pulls. Whatever the strap
text: is attached to, it’s firmly hooked up under wooden debris.
speaker_heading: SURFACE
text: The Deputy comes up for air, gasping.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
text: It’s hung up on something.

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - SONAR P.O.V.

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The Deputy and Nate strain against the stubborn stirrup...
text: suddenly, with the CRUNCH of wood, a large SHADOWY MASS
text: breaks free.
speaker_heading: SURFACE
text: Nate tumbles backwards into a section of rotted wood. It
text: crumbles on impact. CRUNCH-SPLASH!
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: The HORSE’S GRISLY BONES burst to the surface in a cluster
text: around Nate... he scrambles to free himself, tangled up in an
text: old net that has snagged the remains.
text: The Deputy helps Nate out of the tangle of rancid bones and
text: netting. The Sheriff observes from the side of the boat.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Fine! I’m fine.
text: The Deputy heaves the saddle up into the boat and the men
text: climb back on board. The Sheriff grabs a small camera from

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: How long ago did you say this
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Last night.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Looks more like last week. Those

text: The shredded SADDLE looks as if it’s been through a wood
dialog: chipper.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: What the hell could have done this?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I have no idea...
text: The Sheriff gets a shot of the saddle as the Deputy inspects
text: the straps, ripped into ribbons of leather. Water pours out
dialog: of the torn saddle bag...
speaker_heading: SHOCK CUT
text: A DARK SHAPE explodes out of the saddle bag... right at
text: Dale’s throat. Jaws SNAP! Dale SCREAMS as arterial blood
text: sprays out in a gruesome arc.
text: The Deputy grabs the dark, glistening CREATURE and yanks it
text: off Dale’s blood-splattered neck. It’s tail whiplashes as it
text: flies overboard and disappears beneath the surface.
text: Dale scrambles away, gripping his throat, but the blood still
text: squirts out with each heartbeat
text: The Sheriff grabs a towel and presses it to the open hole.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Sit back! You’ve got to lie still.
text: The Sheriff applies direct pressure to the shocking wound.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (to Deputy)
dialog: Get us out of here.

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (to Nate)
dialog: You want to tell me what the hell

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I didn’t get a very good look, I...
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You said you were a fish expert.
dialog: Find out. And find out soon.
text: Nate sits... and notices the Sheriff’s digital camera lying
text: beside him.
dialog: 42.
text: The image of the waterlogged saddle is frozen on the view
text: screen. A dark BLUR has been captured on the lower right
text: edge of the shot... the creature leaping from the saddle bag.
text: Nate takes the camera and punches the screen controls
text: ZOOMING IN on the image.
text: Although it’s dark and distorted, the creature’s gruesome

scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE RIFT
text: Zack and Jacob glide down and settle beside the rift. Jacob

text: Julie nods, she understands.
text: Jacob checks the rock formation for a solid spot, then

text: As Julie checks her line, the light from her flare falls ona
text: a beautiful little SEAHORSE, unlike anything she’s seen
dialog: before.
text: It GLOWS with a soft phosphorescence and its entire body is
text: translucent. Its fluttering heart and organs all look as if
text: they’re made of glass.
text: It circles around them, its delicate fins whirring like
text: humming bird wings. It’s followed by another half-dozen of
text: its kind, all glowing like something out of a fairy tale.
text: As Julie watches, the seahorses skim across the sandy floor
text: passing over something metallic in the sand... something man
dialog: made.
text: Julie starts towards it, but is pulled up short as her nylon

text: Baxter BARKS.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I can’t! I told them, I can’t go

scene_heading: INT. CAVERN
text: Zack’s flickering torch reveals a blocked passage. Dead end.
text: He turns back to Jacob and Julie... now what?
text: At that moment, Zack’s torch begins to SPUTTER.
text: Zack fumbles for the flashlight clipped to his belt, just as
text: a_swarm of PIRANHA rises up from the hollows behind him.
text: Dozens of sightless eyes reflect the dying light as they rise
text: up out of the darkness. Zack’s flare finally goes out.
text: Julie grabs Zack’s arm, pulling him back. The swarm surges
dialog: forward in a swirling mass!
text: Julie holds her flare higher, briefly driving them back, but
text: then her flare begins to sputter
text: Icy fear grips Julie as she realizes their situation. She
text: turns back, looking for any other escape route.
speaker_heading: JULIE’S P.O.V.
text: By the last cold-blue flicker of Julie’s light, the cavern
text: walls appear to move. Hundreds of piranha line the walls.
text: They rustle like leaves in the wind, their metallic scales
text: GLISTENING. Julie, Zack and Jacob are completely surrounded.
dialog: 58.
text: Then Julie’s flare sputters out. The entire cavern is
text: plunged into PITCH BLACK.
text: Zack’s FLASHLIGHT BEAM finally flashes ON, stabbing through
text: the darkness... It’s too damn narrow and too dim, but it
dialog: reveals our worst fears;
speaker_heading: SHOCK CUT
text: A cloud of piranhas, swirl around them, closing in for the
text: kill. They tear into the closest target... Jacob.
text: Zack watches in horror as Jacob is ripped to pieces before
text: his eyes... still alive and SCREAMING as the gleaming white
text: bones of his rib cage are stripped bare.
text: The fish go berserk, tails lashing and fangs snapping.
text: Jacob’s blood billows out in a dark cloud as his limbs are
text: ripped from his torso. The power and speed of their attack
dialog: is absolutely terrifying.
speaker_heading: CAVERN
text: Zack discovers his light beam has the effect of a Star Wars
text: “light saber.” It repels the fish as it strikes them.
text: But Zack is fighting a losing battle as the swarm grows
text: around them... becoming more aggressive with every heartbeat.
text: Julie’s light beam FLASHES on, as Jacob spins about in panic,
text: caught up in a living twister of piranhas. His blood stirs
text: the piranhas into a greater frenzy.
text: Julie tries to help, but is quickly forced to fend off her
text: own attackers. She flashes her light in their eyes to turn
dialog: them away.
text: Zack turns and the beam reveals a huge SWELL of piranha
text: surging straight towards him.
text: Zack backpedals in the darkness and collides with a cavern
text: wall. His flashlight is knocked from his grasp and tumbles
text: into the darkness below. Zack immediately swims straight
dialog: down... trying to catch it
text: Julie swims for her life in a blind panic, deeper into the
text: cavern. The swarm splits; half whirls about to pursue Julie,
text: half dive bombs after Zack.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INT. DROP SHAFT - SAME TIME
text: Zack swims straight down into this natural well of icy
text: water... and the swarm swoops down right after him.
text: Zack’s flashlight tumbles down through the darkness, its beam
text: bouncing off the craggy walls.
text: Zack is in a deadly race... straight to the bottom of this
text: natural well, with the swarm right behind him.
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN - BOTTLE NECK
text: Julie swims for her life. The pitch black cavern has now
text: narrowed into a winding tunnel. Julie’s legs are scraped by
text: the razor sharp walls, leaving a trail of blood behind her
text: Piranha swarm into the tunnel from both directions. Teeth
text: and eyes FLASH up out of pitch blackness, cutting off her
dialog: escape.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: At the last second, Julie ducks into a narrow hollow in the
text: cavern wall.
text: The two swarms COLLIDE into one another, just missing Julie.
text: The fish attack each other in their killing frenzy, quickly
text: filling the tunnel with dark blood and bits of flesh.
scene_heading: INT. NARROW PASSAGE - JULIE
text: Julie swims for all she’s worth, heading straight up a narrow
text: “stove pipe” passage. It grows narrower as it twists and
text: turns... growing more and more claustrophobic.
text: Julie now hears the eerie SOUND of the swarm approaching, the
text: leathery SNAP of tails accompanied by an almost subliminal
dialog: banshee WAIL.
text: Julie twists about, scraping the narrow walls as she checks
text: behind her with her flashlight.
speaker_heading: JULIE’S P.O.V.
text: Hundreds of piranha streak straight up, completely filling
text: the narrow “stove pipe” passage.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: Turns back... and bumps straight into a GRISLY CORPSE. Half
text: a body blocks her path, a grinning skull beneath a dive mask.
text: She instinctively flinches backwards, but the sound of the
text: piranha grows LOUDER and LOUDER.
text: Julie grabs the corpse. Could this be Ted? There’s no time
text: to think. The corpse pulls free, falling to pieces and Julie
dialog: swims straight through it!
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: The piranha race straight up through the narrow funnel of
dialog: rock.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: Pure adrenaline empowers her. She desperately swims/scrambles
text: up the jagged walls.
speaker_heading: JULIE’S TANK
text: SLAMS into solid rock. She’s caught! The passage is simply
text: too tight to make it through.
text: She SLAMS into the ring of solid rock again and again, but
text: she’s stuck like a cork in a bottle.
speaker_heading: THE SWARM
text: A living wall of teeth rockets up the rocky chute and tears
dialog: into the flesh of Julie’s legs!
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: She SCREAMS, losing her mouthpiece. The pain is

dialog: to live.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS
text: Julie releases her harness. She pulls free of her tank...
text: swims straight up with no oxygen.
speaker_heading: THE PIRANHA
text: In their frenzy, they attack the oxygen tank. We hear the
text: metallic SCREECH as teeth scrape on metal.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: No choices left, swims up... up... going on thin hope. Long
text: odds. Trailing blood. Lungs about to burst.
speaker_heading: JULIE’S P.O.V.
text: Rising up over jagged rocks... the beam of her flashlight
text: catches something strange in the darkness dead ahead.
text: Her own reflection swims straight at her. Julie breaks the
dialog: surface!
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN - AIR SPACE
text: Julie sucks in a lungfull of centuries-dank air... and
text: immediately begins coughing.
text: She has surfaced in an AIR POCKET somewhere within the

dialog: truth:
text: She has surfaced in a dead end... a_rocky cove the size of a

scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE STAGE

scene_heading: INT. CAVERN - AIR SPACE

speaker_heading: JULIE’S P.O.V.
text: A Single piranha is squirming through the narrow space
text: between her tank and the passageway.
text: Julie desperately tries to climb higher, but it’s impossible
text: on the slippery moss covered rocks. Trapped.
text: The piranha shoots straight up and breaks the surface like a
text: leaping trout. Julie throws herself to one side.
text: It’s teeth SNAP as it just misses her. The piranha impacts
text: the side of the cavern and careens back into the water.
text: Julie begins to hyperventilate, trying desperately to locate
text: the piranha with her flashlight. It could be coming at her
dialog: from any direction.
text: Her flashlight beam reveals two more wriggling through. The
text: tank SCREECHES against the rocks as it becomes dislodged.
text: The tank drops away into the darkness, and the entire swarm
text: surges straight up at Julie.
text: We now hear the most surprising thing of all... a voice.
text: Barely a WHISPER.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: This way...

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Your hands...
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Can you move?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don’t know. I busted some ribs.
dialog: Can’t feel my legs.

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: (pauses)
dialog: We’ve got to think. Did you see

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: TAYLOR

speaker_heading: TAYLOR

scene_heading: EXT. CAR
text: As they struggle, the big Mercedes slowly rolls down a brief

scene_heading: ANGLE ON COLLEGE JOCKS
text: They see the car rolling straight towards the edge of the
dialog: pier.
speaker_heading: JOCKS
dialog: Hey!... Hey! Look out!
speaker_heading: THE MERCEDES
text: The car is slowly losing momentum... the front wheels go off
dialog: the edge.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: J.C. and Taylor both react to the double BUMP as the front

scene_heading: EXT. PIER
text: The Mercedes seesaws, then plunges off the edge of the pier
text: with a huge SPLASH!
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Shit... my Dad’s gonna kill me.
text: J.C. tries the door, but it’s held shut by the external

dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hey, chill out, okay? The water’s
dialog: not that deep. The pressure will
text: equalize in a couple of minutes.
text: J.C. notices that rushing water is quickly filling up the car
text: through the air vents.
text: The two Jocks appear, up to their chests in the water. J.C.
text: can see them above the split waterline as the car continues
dialog: to sink.
speaker_heading: JOCK #1
dialog: Hey! You okay in there?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Fuck off! We’re fine.
text: As J.C. watches, a strange SURFACE TURBULENCE rushes at the

text: The foremost Jock is struck by an invisible force so hard
text: he’s spun around... but he’s still standing, a surprised look
text: on his face.
text: The Jock raises his arms above the waterline... revealing

text: The water now EXPLODES into churning hell and both Jocks are
dialog: pulled under.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: (gasps) .
dialog: What the hell’s happening?
text: The waterline continues to rise as the Mercedes sinks... only

text: The interior water is three feet deep and rising.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON WINDOWS
text: The murky water surrounding the car is now washed by a DEEP
text: RED... reducing visibility from bad to zero.
text: J.C. can no longer see anything through the bloody red water
text: It is deathly quiet until...
text: CLACK! CLACK! CLACK!
text: Multiple piranha hit the glass, their deadly teeth mashed
text: against the window, SNAPPING inches from J.C.’s face. She
speaker_heading: SCREAMS.
dialog: 79.
text: CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! Dozens more swim into the

text: REVOLVES around J.C., a terrifying 360 degree view of the
text: nightmarish attack.
text: At the same moment, the interior is rapidly flooding,
text: reaching the dash. Hundreds of SNAPPING mouths fight for
text: position at the windows. J.C. screams.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Shut up!!! I’m trying to think
text: Taylor stabs at a button on the dash... the sun roof! It’s
text: still just above the surface of the water, but it doesn’t
dialog: open.
text: Taylor cranks the keys in the ignition. The interior lights

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Shit!!!!
text: He stabs the button again... And the sun roof smoothly WHIRRS
text: open, revealing fireworks in the starlit sky.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: (smiles)

text: Taylor scrambles up out of the sun roof. J.C. hurries after
dialog: him.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - SAME TIME
text: Taylor and J.C. pull themselves up onto the roof of the

text: as the grisly bones of Jocks #1 and #2 bob up to the surface.
text: The shadow of the swarm is immense, swirling around the car
dialog: on all sides.
dialog: J.C.
dialog: What are they?!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Seriously pissed off fish...
text: They balance on the roof as the slippery blood-darkened water
text: inches up on them.
text: Taylor pulls open the blade of a pearl-handled penknife.
text: Looks crazy, but it’s his only defense.
dialog: 80.
text: J.C. gazes at the churning water, scared out of her senses.
text: A light appears out on the darkness of the lake. It’s the
dialog: Looking Glass!
dialog: J.C.
dialog: A boat!
dialog: (calls to boat)
dialog: Hey, over here!
text: ANGLE ON THE LOOKING GLASS
text: Zack is at the helm. He’s still far away, but he spots them.
text: ANGLE ON TAYLOR AND J.C.
text: The water washes over their feet... floods down through the
dialog: sun roof.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Shit!!! They’re not going to get
dialog: here in time.
text: The car slowly starts to tilt, rolling over in the water.
text: J.C. and Taylor balance as best they can.
dialog: J.C.
dialog: You think we can swim fast enough?
text: Taylor gets a crazy look in his eyes. He suddenly grabs
text: J.C.’s wrist and cuts deeply across her forearm with the
text: penknife. Blood wells up.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Now I only have to swim faster than
dialog: you.
text: He shoves J.C. into the water
text: ANGLE ON THE LOOKING GLASS
text: Zack reacts as he sees the young girl thrown into the water.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: My god.
text: Zack turns to Julie, who sits in the back of the boat with a

speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Hang on!
text: Zack slams the throttle forward. Nate is thrown off his feet
text: and lands hard on the deck.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE ROOF OF THE MERCEDES
text: Taylor dives out as far as he can from the car. The Mercedes
text: sinks from sight with an eruption of bubbles.
scene_heading: UNDERWATER - J.C.
text: The circle of piranha surges inward, striking at J.C... but
text: J.C. swims under the sinking car.
scene_heading: PIRANHA P.O.V. - SONAR VISION
text: J.C.’s SILHOUETTE merges with the shape of the car, causing
text: her to disappear as she swims beneath it’s chassis.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER - CAR
text: The piranhas’ attack dissolves into confusion as J.C. swims
text: the length of the chassis and comes up the other side.
scene_heading: CLOSER - ALPHA FISH
text: He wheels about, scanning for her. But the formation of fish
text: behind him has broken up into a feeding frenzy.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON TAYLOR
text: Taylor swims for his life. He only slows down to make sure
text: the boat sees him.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: (waves)
dialog: Please, help!!!
text: J.C. surfaces a short distance behind him, swimming like an
dialog: Qlympic athlete!
text: Taylor can’t believe his eyes. He gets back into the race,

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - ALPHA FISH P.O.V.
text: The piranha’s sonar focuses up on two nice loud targets

scene_heading: ANGLE ON ZACK

dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (to Julie)
dialog: Take the wheel!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON J.C. - UNDERWATER
text: She’s swimming all out... then we hear her knee POP as she

text: THE LOOKING GLASS
text: Nate takes hold of Ted as Julie springs forward and grabs the
dialog: wheel.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Cut it as close to her as you can.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What are you...?
text: Zack races to the back of the boat.
speaker_heading: CLOSER - J.C.
text: She digs into the water fighting the pain, powered by fear of
text: what’s behind her... and outrage at the bastard ahead of her
text: She slowly gains on Taylor.
text: Taylor and J.C. are neck and neck. The TURBULENCE is right
text: on top of them, no more than a few feet and closing fast.
text: J.C. grabs Taylor’s ponytail and jerks back with all her
text: might. Taylor SCREAMS like a little girl. J.C. swims right
text: over him.
dialog: 
text: She’s gained a few yards, but the piranha close in for the
text: kill. The TURBULENCE steam rolls over Taylor, who’s pulled
text: down, SHRIEKING in agony.
text: BACK ON THE BOAT
dialog: 
text: Zack hooks a foot in a wide SLALOM SKI in the aft of the
text: boat, grabs a coil of tow rope and leaps out into the boat’s
dialog: wake.
text: Zack hits hard, shooting up a wall of spray... but he hangs
text: on and rises up out of the water.
text: Julie bears down on the throttle, heading straight for J.C.
text: Zack quickly shoots up over the wake, sails through mid air
text: and lands wide of the boat.
dialog: 83.
dialog: J.C.
text: She’s swimming for all she’s worth, BUT THE CHURNING WATER
text: ROLLS RIGHT OVER HER!
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: Leans into the water in a full horizontal. He plows straight
text: into the swarm at full speed.
text: A wall of water explodes up. Looks like a wipe out!
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Then Zack pulls free, surfacing with one arm wrapped around
text: J.C., the other still hanging onto the tow rope!
text: He cheated the swarm a split second before it would have
text: stripped J.C. to the bone.
text: THE LOOKING GLASS
text: Julie pulls them to safety, then loops the boat around in a
text: u-turn to pick them up. She cuts the boat’s engines. Nate
text: scrambles to the rear of the boat as Zack scrambles up the
dialog: short ladder with J.C.
text: Nate pulls J.C. in. She collapses to the floor, still wide-
text: eyed and panting hard. She grasps her knee in pain.
text: Zack kneels down beside J.C. on the floor of the glass bottom
dialog: boat.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Take it easy, you’re safe now.
scene_heading: SHOCK CUT - GLASS BOTTOM
text: Taylor’s bloody face appears inches from J.C. pressed up
dialog: against the glass... still alive!
text: He pounds his fists on the glass as the piranha rip his flesh
text: from his bones.
text: Zack pulls J.C. to the gunnel. When they look back, Taylor’s

dialog: swarm... gone for good.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: ANGLE ON BAR DOORWAY

speaker_heading: SYDNEY

scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE WATER
text: Reggie tumbles downward and SPLASHES into the water with
text: dozens of other partiers.
scene_heading: SYDNEY - AT THE TABLE
text: She SCREAMS as a HUGE CRACK appears, traveling along the deck
text: beneath her feet. The floor under their table is breaking
dialog: away .
text: Wood GROANS as the split grows wider... then with a deafening
text: ROAR, the section of deck breaks away!
speaker_heading: MASTER
text: We see it all as half of the party breaks away. The wood
text: SQUEALS like a huge sequoia going down. Pylons crumble. The
text: deck collapses into trash, taking dozens of victims with it
text: Multiple SPLASHES of people and debris send explosions of
text: spray into the air.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
text: Surfaces, sputtering for air just as a half ton of shattered

dialog: 86.
scene_heading: EXT. WATER - THE LOOKING GLASS
text: Julie, at the helm, reacts to the sight of the collapsing
text: deck... the SCREAMS of the partygoers.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh my god...
text: Julie watches in stunned disbelief. Then she sees the

scene_heading: UNDERWATER - PIRANHA P.O.V.
text: Sonar defines dozens of swimmers thrashing in the water as

speaker_heading: SYDNEY’S TABLE

scene_heading: MOVING CAMERA - HORROR MASTER SHOT

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: No, no! Don’t do that...!

dialog: 89.
text: Lil’ John’s gun finger is still twitching, CLICKING on empty

speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Nate?!
text: Nate grabs one of the last waterproof flares in his hand.
speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Julie!

speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: It’s Lil’ John’s spotlights! Marcus and Carrie man the two

speaker_heading: MARCUS

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: ...-help me.
text: Julie pulls him closer.
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE’S P.O.V.
text: A large TRAILER is the source of the humming, a heavy-duty
