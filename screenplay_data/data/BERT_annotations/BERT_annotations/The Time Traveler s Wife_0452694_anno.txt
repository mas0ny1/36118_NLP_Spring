scene_heading: EXT. TURNPIKE - NIGHT 5
text: The little sedan drives on the slick highway, the asphalt

text: dividing rail.
scene_heading: INT. CAR — SAME 6
text: Annette and Henry sing “Jingle Bells,” picking up the tempo
text: as the car speeds along. Mom and son exchange a warm smile,
text: as something strange and off-kilter appears...LIGHTS, in
text: front of them...A BUS coming at them head-on.
text: ON ANNETTE, her eyes widening as she brakes. Henry’s forehead

text: HIS P.O.V. In front of him, at some distance, his mother is

text: HIS P.O.V. A MAN is standing over him. He is wearing a dark
text: overcoat, dark pants that seem too big, sloppy work boots,
text: untied. He has a blanket in his hands, which he drapes over
text: Henry and then pulls him close.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Let me go. Mommy. Mommy!!!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: There’s nothing you can do, Henry.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Let me go!

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I know what just happened to you.
dialog: You were in the car with Mommy, and
text: it was spinning, and then all of a
dialog: sudden you were back at home, last

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: How do you...?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You traveled back in time, Henry.
dialog: Just like I did to come here and

text: HENRY 28 IS GONE...only his clothes and boots are there, his
text: footprints ending abruptly in the snow.
scene_heading: INT. NEWBERRY LIBRARY RARE STACKS - DAY (WINTER) 11
text: A similarly vacated pile of clothes is on the stone floor of
text: a dimly-lit, temperature-controlled basement room. We PAN
text: away from it to reveal we are in a chamber full of well-
text: stacked BOOKSHELVES, and then...a groan causes the camera to
text: PAN BACK...
text: THE 28-YEAR-OLD HENRY WE JUST SAW WALKING AWAY FROM HENRY6 IS
text: NOW STANDING THERE, naked, next to the clothes.
text: He shivers; sore, cold. Haunted by where he has just been.
text: Seeing himself as a boy, on that night, has shaken him. He
text: runs his hands through his hair.
text: Henry starts to dress himself. Finds a large book on the
text: floor, which he picks up.
scene_heading: INT. NEWBERRY LIBRARY - DAY 12
text: The reading rooms at the library are the welcoming hub of the
text: old stone building; a cathedral of knowledge. Serious
text: researchers work at tables stacked high with books.
text: Henry appears from the back. He approaches the counter and
text: presents the book to a RESEARCHER, a man in his forties.
speaker_heading: RESEARCHER
dialog: That took you long enough.

speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: If you’re going to come here every

text: The Bartender picks it up, examines it.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (CONT'D)
dialog: (drily)
dialog: Thanks.
text: He puts it in his pocket, as INGRID CARMICHAEL, 26, a high-

dialog: been drinking too.
speaker_heading: INGRID

text: tree with its string of unlit lights.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Henry. You’re supposed to do the
dialog: lights! The guy does the lights.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Can we...do this without lights?
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: You're such a creep.
text: She walks over to the tree and plugs in the lights. They
text: brighten until they begin to flash. We can see they are
dialog: bothering him...
speaker_heading: INGRID (CONT'D)
dialog: Now. Isn’t this nice? Henry...?
text: He stands, woozy, a pasty look on his face. Ingrid knows this
dialog: look.

text: ANGLE ON AN EXIT SIGN, the universal symbol of the lit-up
text: running man. The door opens and Henry steps out of the
text: stairwell and into a corridor lined with stripped hospital
dialog: beds: the Housekeeping Services area located in the
text: Hospital’s bowels.
text: He ducks into the deserted LINEN’S ROOM. A MERRY CHRISTMAS
text: banner and a garland of tinsel hangs over the folding
text: station. Henry spots a paper pad.
text: HIS P.O.V. AN INVENTORY FORM FOR THE ST. JOSEPH’S HOSPITAL,
text: dated the 24th OF DECEMBER 1970.
text: Henry’s face clouds.
text: ANGLE CORRIDOR, as a FEMALE CANDY STRIPER arrives with
text: another bed. She strips the mattress and the pillow and is
text: about to carry the laundry into the linen’s room when Henry
text: emerges, now dressed as a candy striper himself. She barely
text: acknowledges him.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/HOUSEKEEPING SERVICES 17
text: Henry passes Service Workers spraying rows of bed frames with
text: chemical disinfectant. He slows in front of a fire exit
text: diagram, orients himself and moves on. He takes a shortcut,
dialog: only to find himself in:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE 18
text: Henry stops dead in his tracks as he comes upon a COVERED
text: BODY lying on a slab. It is the only body in the morgue.
text: Henry stares at the wrapped form, clearly distressed, as he’s
text: making the connection. He seems about to touch the body but
text: instead glances at a wall mounted clock. He realizes that
text: he’s running late and pulls himself away.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST FLOOR RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT 19
text: Henry appears out of an elevator. It is busy and surreally
text: bright inside against the snowy black outside the large
text: windows. He is looking for someone. We see his eyes land; he
dialog: has found what he seeks:
text: A MAN standing at the main desk. We saw him before, by the
text: couch with Henry. He is RICHARD DETAMBLE, 30, Henry’s father.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, I know they’re here. I got a

text: Henry does not follow. Richard looks out at him.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What about my wife? Why isn’t she
dialog: with him?
text: Henry doesn’t answer. The doors start to close, wiping Henry
dialog: from view...
speaker_heading: RICHARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait!

scene_heading: INT. NEWBERRY LIBRARY - DAY 22

text: GIRL at one of the tables. She doesn’t look up.
text: Henry goes to the check-out desk and lays down his books,

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Henry?

text: She looks up. HENRY IS THERE, his face covered in

speaker_heading: CLARE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Could we back up? Could we pretend

dialog: first date between two normal

speaker_heading: CLARE
dialog: Sure. Of course. I’m so sorry
dialog: Henry. I keep forgetting. It’s
dialog: just, you know, it’s like you're my
dialog: best friend. I’ve...I’ve been in
dialog: love with you...all my life.
text: On Henry, taking this in. Clare can see how hard it is for
text: him. She dips a napkin in a glass of ice water. She reaches
text: over and touches his bruises with the napkin. He cannot

text: She takes off the blindfold...
text: HER P.O.V. Henry has put a cloth over a lamp to mute the
text: light. It makes the apartment seem romantic, a reader’s
text: garret, piled with books, a couch covered with an Indian
dialog: print blanket.
text: He stands there, smiling sort of dumbly at this beautiful
text: girl, standing in his flat, clearly smitten with it, with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: If you want a drink...
speaker_heading: CLARE
dialog: I don’t want a drink.
text: She steps up to him, looks into his eyes, and starts
text: unbuttoning his shirt. He just stares at her. It’s amazing to
dialog: him that she’s so sure, that they don’t have to play any
dialog: games. He could fall in love with this girl.
text: She parts the fabric of his shirt and runs her hands along
text: his chest, his belly.
speaker_heading: CLARE (CONT'D)
dialog: God. You're so...young...
text: She kisses his neck, his mouth; a passionate, familiar kiss.
text: It blows him away, her confidence, the way their mouths fit.
text: He pulls her in to him, roughly now, he wants her, his hands
text: running up to her breasts. He is young and eager, discovering
text: a new body. She pushes him back. Makes him sit on the couch.
text: Climbs on top of him, straddling him, but he flips her onto
text: her back and in so doing, KICKS HER PURSE over...everything
text: dumps onto the floor. It’s more than a little awkward.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Sorry...
text: He quickly picks up the stuff...he has the DIARY. She grabs

text: Clare sort of laughs.
speaker_heading: CLARE
