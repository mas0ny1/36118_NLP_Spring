scene_heading: NEON SIGN - THE PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
text: The N and the E are not working. So it reads the PR IC motel.
text: ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince
text: Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked
text: outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed,
text: but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH
text: in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking
text: lot. Then the curtain closes.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man
text: moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender,
text: sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in
text: his late thirties. Slightly nervous.
text: Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is
text: forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Says here they got slips in Honolulu.
dialog: 325 a month. Utilities included.
dialog: That's not bad.
text: Rodriguez sits down.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: But I gotta get at least a forty
dialog: footer. It'll handle rough water
dialog: better and I'll need the room if I'm
dialog: gonna live on it.
text: Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: I don't know how you do it.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: How you can think about Hawaii now?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: My heart's in Hawaii.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: You never been there. How can your
dialog: heart be there.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: You're tellin' me there's no place
dialog: you'd rather be other than here?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: No, I'm saying I just don't know how
dialog: you can think about Hawaii right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: If I was in Hawaii right now, I
dialog: wouldn't be thinking about here. See
dialog: the difference?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here.
dialog: But I don't want to be here, I want
dialog: to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii,
dialog: therefore I think about it so as to
dialog: not get depressed about being here.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: But I'm here, I know I'm here, I
dialog: don't like being here, but I can't
dialog: be anyplace else because I look around
dialog: and I see all this shit. How do you
dialog: get around that?! That's what I'm
dialog: asking.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Focus.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Focus.
text: Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: It's time. No more Hawaii, okay?
dialog: Focus on this.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Aloha.
text: Rodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Aloha my ass.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT
text: Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some
text: buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past.
text: We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
text: LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The
text: MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN
text: sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB.
text: Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt,
text: tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life.
text: She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her
text: skirt hiked up on her leg.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
text: Left at the corner.
text: Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns
text: his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy
dialog: bass.
scene_heading: EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
text: The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of
text: room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out,
text: leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.
text: The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia.
text: She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.
text: Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT
text: Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as
text: Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one
text: has followed, then shuts the door.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Hope you don't mind me checkin' you
dialog: for weapons.
speaker_heading: HUDD
dialog: Hell yes I mind.
text: Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.
speaker_heading: HUDD
dialog: I just don't want no man handlin'
dialog: me.
text: Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Okay. Check him.
text: Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would rather
dialog: not have the job, but there's no choice.
speaker_heading: HUDD
dialog: Lotta good hidin' places on this
dialog: body. Check good.
text: Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants,
text: sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.
speaker_heading: HUDD
dialog: Careful. It's loaded.
text: Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in the
text: least and she gives him a good going over.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: He's got nothin'.
text: She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch
text: and seductively crosses her legs.
text: Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with
text: COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd.
text: Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in
text: and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.
speaker_heading: HUDD
dialog: Not bad, not bad. Any more where
dialog: this came from?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: HUDD
dialog: Then maybe we talk again.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Maybe.
text: Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock,
text: but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.
speaker_heading: HUDD
dialog: Told you there was a lotta good hidin'
dialog: places on this body.
text: Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag.
text: Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.
speaker_heading: HUDD
dialog: Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin'
dialog: places, too.
text: Then Hudd smiles and exits.
scene_heading: EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel parking
dialog: lot.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of the
text: buildings are boarded up.
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
text: Hudd drives. No music this time. His attitude has changed.
text: More serious. LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Coming up fast.
text: Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass.
text: He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we SEE
text: is the FLASH OF A BLAST FROM A GUN. Front WINDOW EXPLODING.
speaker_heading: THE CADILLAC
text: swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR -- a BUICK REGAL --
text: screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out. Moving
text: quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see. He
text: carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's wearing
scene_heading: PLASTIC GLOVES.
text: Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door. The man
text: reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag of
dialog: cocaine. And now we see it's Divinci.
scene_heading: INT. BUICK REGAL - NIGHT
text: Rodriguez is the driver. Anxious. Engine running.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Come on! Hurry up!
text: Divinci dashes back to the Buick, hops in. Rodriguez floors
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: THE BUICK
text: tears off down the dark street.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line both
text: sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the
text: buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a
text: MAN passed out in the street.
text: Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at
text: the man passed out in the street.
text: His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in
text: beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is.
text: Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a
text: bottle in a bag.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street
dialog: before you get run over. Joe, wake
dialog: up!
text: She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back.
dialog: Dead drunk.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: You're in the street, Joe. Get outa
dialog: the street.
text: The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl --
text: toward the middle of the street.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Other way, Joe.
text: Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for
text: a moment. He is truly pathetic.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better
dialog: off right there. I don't think you'd
dialog: even feel it.
text: Cynthia enters the building next to the alley.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CYNTHIA - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: asleep. The room is dark. We HEAR a door open and close.
text: Cynthia wakes.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Who is it?
text: Divinci crosses to the bed.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Got your money.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
text: Put it on the table.
text: She closes her eyes, trying to go back to sleep.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Tired?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Take a sleeping pill. There's some
dialog: in my purse.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: You want your money?
text: Cynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci. He's smiling,
text: holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I already worked for that.
text: Divinci unzips his pants.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: This is a bonus.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: For who?
text: Divinci smiles. Cynthia snatches the money. Divinci starts
text: to undress.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: This ain't my fault. This is a failure
dialog: of our educational system. If you
text: hadn't fallen through the cracks and
dialog: dropped outa school, you wouldn't be
dialog: here now.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: So what's your excuse?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: I'm in love.
text: Cynthia just stares at him for a long beat. Then she unbuckles
text: Divinci's pants.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: KEY - INSERTED INTO DOOR LOCK - NIGHT
text: A door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom
text: apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from
text: the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is
text: VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name
text: is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Keepin' some late hours.
text: Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: What the hell you doin'? What're my
dialog: neighbors gonna think?
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: I apologize. I understand your
dialog: concerns. But you must understand
dialog: that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely
dialog: on a late fee as sufficient
dialog: encouragement to repay one's debts.
dialog: I am forced to employ the likes of
dialog: Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might
dialog: add, contributes significantly to my
dialog: overhead. I am the real loser here.
dialog: And I am concerned about your
dialog: sincerity in repaying the twenty-
dialog: seven thousand, nine hundred forty-
dialog: two dollar gambling debt that is one
dialog: week past due. What can you do to
dialog: reassure me of your good intentions?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: I can make your life fuckin' miserable
dialog: that's what I can do.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Look at me. Do I have a wife and
dialog: three kids? Do I have a good job at
dialog: IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and
dialog: no. I loan money at excessively high
dialog: interest rates to pricks like you
dialog: who can't control their urges to
dialog: lose big money playing cards and
dialog: then I am forced to stay up all night
dialog: trying to convince them that I have
dialog: needs, too. The point of which is, I
dialog: already have a fuckin' miserable
dialog: life. So don't threaten me you lousy
dialog: bag of cat shit.
text: Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in
text: between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: All I'm askin' is that you be
dialog: responsible. Is that unreasonable?
text: Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options.
text: There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some
dialog: of his night's earnings.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Four thousand is all I got.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: I am proportionally reassured. You
dialog: purchased yourself an extension.
text: Vic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez watches
text: Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin'
dialog: idiot name is that?
speaker_heading: CUTLESS SUPREME
dialog: It was the car my daddy stole to
dialog: take my momma to the hospital, but
text: the cops stopped him and shot him
text: dead in an alley before he could
dialog: explain. I was born in the back seat.
text: Rodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK AND WHITE MONTAGE
scene_heading: CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS -- Dead drug dealers lying where
text: they were shot. Overlapping CLOSE-UPS of EVIDENCE TAGS and

text: And CLOSE-SHOTS of CRIME SCENES -- chalk outlines -- bullet
text: shells - bloody foot prints. And finally CRIME SCENE TAPE.
text: The BLACK AND WHITE fades back into COLOR --
scene_heading: YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE
text: surrounding the CADILLAC. We PULL BACK, revealing COPS
text: controlling the area. It's early morning. A FEW PEOPLE have
text: stopped to watch. But this is not a high traffic area.
text: ANOTHER CAR pulls up. Unmarked. Two men get out. We FOLLOW
text: BEHIND THEM as they approach the Cadillac and PATROLMAN
text: MAHONEY, who knows them.
scene_heading: PATROLMAN MAHONEY
dialog: Another day, another body. Where you
dialog: wanna start?
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: A hit?
scene_heading: PATROLMAN MAHONEY
dialog: Looks like. Could be gang related.
text: And now we SEE THE TWO MEN from the unmarked car. It's DIVINCI
text: and RODRIGUEZ. Suit and ties. They act like they own the
dialog: area. And they do.
scene_heading: PATROLMAN MAHONEY
dialog: Happened sometime last night, early
dialog: morning, two, three o'clock. African-
dialog: American male, looks like in his
dialog: thirties. But even that's a guess.
text: Half his head is on the upholstery.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Any witnesses?
scene_heading: PATROLMAN MAHONEY
dialog: Oh, sure, hundreds.
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - DAY
text: The bloody scene is untouched. Hudd's body is where it fell,
text: on the seat. Dried blood everywhere. Divinci looks in.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Fuckin' Animals.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: EVIDENCE ROOM. Behind a locked fenced in area. A DESK OFFICER
text: checks in and out all evidence. He is twenty-eight, wears
text: glasses, very clean cut. TWO DETECTIVES are checking in
text: evidence as Divinci walks in.
speaker_heading: FIRST DETECTIVE
text: ...three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.
text: The Desk Officer checks in the evidence.
speaker_heading: DESK OFFICER
text: Three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.
text: The two detectives wave hellos to Divinci as he approaches.
speaker_heading: SECOND DETECTIVE (SGT. GARDNER)
dialog: Heard you got a gang related. Lucky
dialog: guy, Divinci. You get all the pretty
dialog: ones.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
text: One less drug store on the street.
speaker_heading: DESK OFFICER
dialog: And the world is a safer place.
text: The Desk Officer buzzes Divinci through the door. Divinci
dialog: crosses to the --
scene_heading: EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM
text: -- filled with shelves. Stacked with evidence from on-going
text: investigations. And the shelves are full of guns, knives,
text: bloody gloves, masks, shoes, etc.
text: Divinci looks around, then removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE
text: and the .44 from his pockets and places them back on one of
scene_heading: the shelves. CASE NUMBER C-549087. One thing about the .44
text: which we can see now -- a BLACK STAIN on the metal of the
dialog: handle.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY
text: Desks, phones, computers, typewriters and HOMICIDE DETECTIVES.
text: Some witnesses being interviewed. Rodriguez is on the phone
text: at his desk. He's in the middle of an interview as he fills
text: out one of the many forms that complicate his life.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: -- a green car... you know what
dialog: make... Maybe a Ford, uh-huh. You
dialog: didn't see the license, did you?
text: Divinci comes back to his desk, next to Rodriguez. Rodriguez
text: looks up. Divinci gives him a confident smile and brushes
text: his hands together -- clean hands.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah, no, I understand, it was dark...
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Divinci sits at his desk. He pulls an ADVERTISEMENT for a 42
text: FOOT SPORT FISHING BOAT out of his desk. He holds it up to
text: Rodriguez, points to the boat.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Wanna go for a ride?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: You think you could describe the
dialog: driver?
dialog: (covers phone; to
dialog: Divinci)
dialog: You bought it?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: As of last night, I've got the down.
dialog: Just picture me under swayin' palms
dialog: with a Mai Tai.
text: We can HEAR someone describing a felon over the phone, but
text: Rodriguez isn't listening. He's looking at the boat.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: (covers phone)
dialog: You're gonna buy it, no shit. When?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
text: Just a phone call away.
text: Divinci picks up the phone, starts to dial.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: That's really great, man.
text: Divinci smiles. Rodriguez suddenly realizes the person on
text: the other end of the phone has stopped talking.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: (back to phone)
dialog: Uh-huh, okay... how tall was he?
text: A heavy set man in his fifties approaches -- CAPTAIN
speaker_heading: HENDERSON.
scene_heading: CAPT. HENDERSON
dialog: You got primary on the drug related
dialog: this morning on 27th.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: I'm workin' it up now.
scene_heading: CAPT. HENDERSON
dialog: Who's your second?
dialog: (Divinci points at
dialog: Rodriguez)
dialog: In my office. Both of you.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Why?
scene_heading: CAPT. HENDERSON
dialog: Now.
text: Captain Henderson doesn't wait for a response. He heads for
text: the office -- an inner office of glass and wood.
text: Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous.
text: We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking to,
text: but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: What the hell --
text: Divinci motions "keep calm."
scene_heading: INT. CAPTAIN HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Henderson is hanging up his coat as Divinci and Rodriguez
text: enter. They aren't the only ones in the office. RICHARD SIMMS,

scene_heading: CAPT. HENDERSON
dialog: Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez,
dialog: this is Richard Simms. He's with the
dialog: D.E.A. He wants to ask you some
dialog: questions about your case.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: What's the occasion?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: You get an i.d. on the victim?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: We're waitin' for prints.
text: Divinci pulls out his note pad.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Car was registered to --
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: -- Anchor Imports. 81 El Dorado.
dialog: Black.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: If you got all this, what d'you want
dialog: from us?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
text: ...The man in the car is Lionel Hudd.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: (a little incensed)
dialog: How d'you know that?
dialog: (to Henderson)
dialog: What's goin' on here?
speaker_heading: SIMMS
text: Hudd was DEA, undercover.
text: Rodriguez and Divinci take the news like a sledgehammer. On
dialog: their frozen expressions we HEAR --
speaker_heading: SIMMS (O.S.)
dialog: He was workin' a case on syndicate
dialog: distribution of drugs on the south
dialog: side. But every dealer we tagged
dialog: kept getting killed. He finally got
text: a lead on a girl -- Hudd was a friend
dialog: of mine... I'm gonna nail the
dialog: sonuvabitch who killed him.
text: A long beat on Rodriguez and Divinci, then --
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: We'll do everything we can to help.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE UNMARKED POLICE CAR - EXT. STREET - DAY
text: screeching around a corner and up a drive into a VACANT LOT.
text: The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the driver's
text: side, slamming the door and storming off. He's out of his
dialog: mind.
text: Divinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so fired
text: up and scared he can't stop moving.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
text: SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST!
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Calm down!
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD!
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: SHUT UP!
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
text: FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!
text: Divinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from flailing
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW,
dialog: STOP IT!
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
text: GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT
dialog: OF CONTROL!
text: Rodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on.
dialog: They struggle --
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: LET GO OF ME!
text: -- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt. Divinci jumps on
text: top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into Rodriguez
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Shut up and listen to me!
text: Rodriguez glares up at Divinci.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: They could be watchin' us right now
dialog: you asshole. So fuckin' shape up!
dialog: You got it?!
dialog: (nothing from Rodriguez)
dialog: I want you to nod!
text: It takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods. Divinci pulls his
text: gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters his
text: pistol. Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci, of the
text: mess they're in. He just lies in the dirt.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Get the fuck up!
text: Rodriguez starts to get to his feet. Divinci grabs him, yanks
text: him up. Pushes him to the car.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Get in the car!
text: They move back to the car. Rodriguez gets back into the
text: driver's seat. Divinci moves around to the passenger side.
text: Gets in, slams the door shut.
scene_heading: INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY
text: They sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle of
text: the vacant lot. Breathing hard. Dirty. After a beat --
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: There's no fuckin' reason to panic.
text: Rodriguez turns slowly and looks at Divinci incredulously.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: No fuckin' reason to panic? Did you
dialog: say no fuckin' reason to panic!
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Stop being an idiot! We're the cops
dialog: on the case. It's our case. We are
dialog: going to find the fuckin' killers.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
text: WE'RE THE FUCKIN' KILLERS!
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Since when does that matter?!
text: Rodriguez stares at Divinci for a beat, then we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED - DAY
text: Rodriguez and Divinci are sitting on the car, each with a
text: beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: All they want is someone to go down
dialog: for the crime, right? Do we care who
dialog: goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As
dialog: long as someone goes down for the
dialog: crime. It's a slot that's gotta be
dialog: filled.
text: Rodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him --
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: We killed a cop, doesn't that bother
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Of course it bothers me. What d'you
dialog: want me to do, turn myself in? Well
dialog: I'm not. That's the risk we take
dialog: everyday, somebody might pop us,
dialog: especially undercover like that. So
dialog: he got popped. It happens.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Not by other cops!
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: I patted him down! He wasn't wearin'
dialog: a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how
dialog: was I supposed to know?!
text: A moment of silence, then --
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Look, I feel just as bad as you do,
dialog: but we gotta start thinkin' about us
dialog: here. The important thing is we don't
dialog: lose control of the case. We can
dialog: never lose control of the case.
dialog: Whatever evidence there is goes
text: through us. We lay down the trail.
dialog: Make it nice and logical. We're the
dialog: teachers and two and two can add up
dialog: to five if it's our classroom.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: What're you talkin' about, are you
dialog: sayin' we stick somebody with this?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Evidence points wherever we want it
dialog: to point. Shit, we can provide so
dialog: much evidence, even the asshole we
dialog: pick will think he fuckin' killed
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: You got some asshole in mind?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Just don't worry. We'll find a killer.

speaker_heading: SIMMS

text: Joe nods.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: And you remember that you told me

speaker_heading: WILLIAM

text: Divinci looks at Rodriguez. Rodriguez nods.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: How'd it happen, Joe, tell me how it

scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT - LIONEL HUDD

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: A MAN standing in the street ahead of him.
scene_heading: HUDD - INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: smiles and turns toward the man in the street.
dialog: A .44
text: is pulled from a jacket pocket, lifted toward the APPROACHING
text: CAR. The gun is in the hands of Joe. He is scared. The
text: HEADLIGHTS COMING RIGHT AT HIM. He aims and FIRES the gun.
scene_heading: THE FRONT WINDOW
text: SHATTERS. And the car swerves to the curb.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Joe watches from the street, then looks at the .44 in his
dialog: hand.
scene_heading: BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rodriguez leans into Joe who is now sitting on the edge of
text: the bed, looking down at the .44 in his hand.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Then what did you do?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Joe is in the street again. He doesn't know what he did.
text: BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM
text: Divinci leans close to Joe from behind now.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: You ran.
text: And now Joe can imagine it. We PUSH INTO JOE'S EYES.
text: BACK TO THE STREET
text: as Joe turns and runs. As fast as he can away from the death.
text: He looks back over his shoulder, scared.
speaker_heading: JOE'S VOICE
dialog: I didn't mean to...
text: BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM
text: Joe is staring at the gun. Divinci and Rodriguez watch him.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: He was going to hit me... I was
dialog: scared... he was going to hit me.

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: That's why you shot him.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: That's why I...
scene_heading: JOE - BACK ON THE STREET - NIGHT

scene_heading: THE SMOKING .44 - INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

text: Divinci has held Joe's finger on the trigger and pulled it.
text: The gunshot is deadened in the old building. Joe is lying in
text: the back seat of a car, passed out, with Divinci holding the

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Helluva nice shot, Joe.
text: Divinci pulls the 44. out of Joe's hand, then shuts the door,

speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
text: It's the middle of the day.

dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI

speaker_heading: CYNTHIA

scene_heading: INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: I need you to do something.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Good, I need the money.
text: She shuts the door. Divinci deposits the bag on the table.
text: Cynthia picks it up, moves into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: This isn't a deal. Where you goin'?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I got perishables, okay?
text: Cynthia enters the kitchen and Divinci follows. Cynthia starts
text: unloading the groceries, putting the milk, eggs, etc. into
dialog: the refrigerator.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: The guy we did the last deal with is
dialog: dead.
text: Cynthia turns suddenly.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Somebody popped him that night,
dialog: probably when he tried to unload the
dialog: stuff. I don't know.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Jesus, does anybody --
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: -- Don't worry, there's no connection.
dialog: We got the guy who did it.
text: Cynthia breathes a sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: He'll be third from the left. Don't
dialog: fuck up. Third from the left.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: What'm I supposed to say?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Just look at 'em and then look at
dialog: the man the third from the left and
dialog: say, It's him.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: And I'll say, Are you sure?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: And you say, Absolutely. No question.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: This is all I need to do right?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: We have a signed confession. You
dialog: i.d. him, he's goin' straight into

speaker_heading: CYNTHIA

text: SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters.
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: Stop and face front.
text: The six men obey. A couple keep their heads down. The others

speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: Lift your heads, look straight.
text: Heads are lifted. Eyes front. But we only recognize one of
text: them, standing third from the left. It's Joe.
text: Divinci, Rodriguez and Cynthia are in the gallery.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Take your time. Try and remember his
dialog: face.
text: Cynthia counts three from the left and... wait a minute. She
text: looks more closely. Just to be sure. Rodriguez and Divinci
text: watch her. She's obviously putting on a good show. Then she
text: turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers --
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I know him.
text: Divinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect a
dialog: private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it
text: looking like he's coaching her.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: If you can identify the man --
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: I know him.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Just tell us which one.
text: Cynthia, frustrated, gives Divinci a look.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: No. I fucking know him.
text: Divinci still isn't sure what's gotten into her. Rodriguez
text: looks over, a little annoyed.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: There's no problem!
dialog: (to Cynthia; pointedly)
dialog: Do you see him up there?!
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: (aside)
dialog: You don't understand.
text: Divinci is losing his patience. He doesn't want to blow the
text: whole thing now, not in front of guards and police personnel.
text: The Guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's going on.
dialog: So are the MEN in the line.
speaker_heading: ONE OF THE MEN
dialog: Hey, come on, do it or don't!
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: No talking.
text: Divinci leans in close to her. We can HEAR GRUMBLING from
text: the men on the platform.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Pick the asshole out!
text: Cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels
text: Divinci's hand grip her arm. He's had enough. Cynthia gets
text: the message. And while keeping her eyes locked on Divinci
dialog: she says --
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
text: Third man from the left.
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: You mind telling me what that was
dialog: all about?!
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I know him. He hangs around my
text: building. He lives in the alley or
dialog: something.
text: Rodriguez looks at Divinci. Is this a problem?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: You don't think people that hang
dialog: around your neighborhood can kill
dialog: somebody. Well let me tell you
dialog: something. You don't live in a great
dialog: fuckin' neighborhood.
text: Divinci pulls a paper from his pocket.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Just sign the goddamn paper.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: What paper?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: You picked a man out of a lineup,
dialog: you have to sign that you did that
dialog: so they don't think we made it up.
text: Cynthia just stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then --
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Now why the hell would they think
dialog: something like that?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Sign it.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: You said all I had to do was pick
dialog: him out.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: This is part of it. Just sign it and
dialog: you're done.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: How come you're so sure it was him?
text: Rodriguez rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: He confessed.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: We got it in writing.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: He didn't do it.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: How the hell d'you know that? Were
dialog: you with him at the time?! You have
dialog: a good goddamn alibi for him?!
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Maybe she was blowing him!
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Better him than you.
text: Rodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall.
text: Divinci looks around quickly to see who's watching.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Take it easy.
text: Rodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at Divinci.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Fine, I got nothin' at stake here.
text: Divinci gives him a look, then leans right up next to Cynthia.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: This is what they call an open and
dialog: shut case. He did the kill and he's
dialog: going down. Don't make the mistake
dialog: of thinking you know the right thing
dialog: to do.

speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Goddammit!

speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Some goddamn piece a shit blows him

speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I'm sorry. Hudd was too good for

dialog: he'd go down this way.
text: Simms crosses the room to Divinci and Rodriguez.
speaker_heading: SIMMS

text: thirty-nine. She wears a business suit. RICHARD STEIN is her
text: second in command. Richard is thirty-three.
text: The DEFENSE ATTORNEY is fifty and a little on the portly
text: side. His name is JOHN OBLINGER.
text: But it's the DEFENDANT that really attracts our attention.
text: His name is CLYDE D. DUNNER. He's done his best to look like
dialog: a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of clothes he
text: wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his
text: mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a nickel.
text: He's on trial for murder. In the first. What a surprise.
text: We are in the midst of opening statements. And Helen is
text: keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a WOMAN,
scene_heading: JUDGE WEINBERG.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: -- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner,
dialog: entered the house of George and Carol
text: Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber
text: pistol in his hand. He entered the
dialog: house with one thing in mind. To
dialog: kill George and Carol, the people he
dialog: blamed for the break up of his
dialog: marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.
text: The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on TWO
text: MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns to
text: glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ and
speaker_heading: DIVINCI.
text: Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now,
text: walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually, that's
text: what he's thinking. He mouths "You die."
text: Divinci mouths back. "Fuck you, prick, asshole, dickhead."
text: Then he smiles. Clyde boils.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: George and Carol were watching a
dialog: movie when he entered the living
text: room and opened fire. George was
text: killed instantly, hit in the face.
dialog: Carol died later of three bullet
text: wounds to her chest.
text: John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous look
text: and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay attention
text: to Helen. Clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from Divinci.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Then the defendant, in his effort to
dialog: cover up the crime, doused them with
text: lighter fluid and set the house on
text: fire... Carol was still alive.
text: A YOUNG MAN, looking very upset, enters the courtroom, shows
text: i.d. to a GUARD, then makes his way down the aisle. He tries
text: his best to be quiet, not to interrupt Helen's statement.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we
dialog: will prove to you, beyond any
dialog: reasonable doubt, that the defendant,
dialog: Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two
dialog: counts of murder in the first degree.
text: Helen looks at the jury for a beat, then returns to her table.
speaker_heading: JUDGE WEINBERG
dialog: The defense may now proceed.
text: John Oblinger stands to present his side of the case. But

speaker_heading: RICHARD STEIN

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: RICHARD STEIN
text: Dunner's .44. They can't find the
dialog: goddamn gun!
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: They lost it or something. Misplaced
dialog: it, I don't know. They can't find it
dialog: anywhere.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (no whisper this time)

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: This is not my fuck up! Our shooting

dialog: the fucking .44 for evidence!
dialog: Otherwise, we never woulda needed
dialog: it. So don't point your finger at
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Alright, alright... But how are we
dialog: supposed to explain how the same gun
dialog: was used in two murder cases by two
dialog: different killers when it was supposed
dialog: to be in police custody?!
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: We don't explain it. It's not our

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Maybe I should.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Go to prison. I killed him. I didn't

speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Yes, I know, I read your confession.
dialog: Joe, if you really felt your life
dialog: was in danger, we might be able to

speaker_heading: WILLIAM

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
text: He started shooting through the door.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The Defendant fired six times, until

text: Helen crosses to the prosecution table, picks up the .44.
text: She holds it up for the jury to see.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: And we would like to enter it into

speaker_heading: CLYDE

speaker_heading: HELEN

dialog: handle.
scene_heading: STEVEN J. ALLEN
dialog: I tested the defendant's revolver
dialog: and matched the bullets fired to the
text: bullets removed from the deceased.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: That ain't my gun.
text: All attention turns to Clyde. His attorney, the judge, the

speaker_heading: JUDGE WEINBERG
dialog: I must remind the defendant that he
dialog: is not to speak out when --
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: That ain't my gun!
text: The Judge taps her gavel. John Oblinger puts a hand on Clyde's
text: arm. Clyde pulls it away. And now things happen very fast.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: THAT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!
text: And Clyde is moving toward the gun. And the Bailiff and GUARDS

text: And the Judge is standing, banging her gavel. And the jury
text: is scared.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FUCKIN' FRAME ME!

speaker_heading: ELLIOT

dialog: lead you to suspect Mr. McCall?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: You ask questions. Work the
dialog: neighborhood. Find out who was on
text: the street that night.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He
dialog: had no previous criminal record.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: We found someone who'd seen him in
dialog: the area. So we picked him up for
dialog: questioning. We didn't expect it to
dialog: be him. But if someone saw him in
dialog: the area that night we would want to
dialog: talk to him. If he wasn't the killer,
dialog: he might've seen the killer. Just
dialog: routine really.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Where did you find the defendant?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
text: On the street. Corner of Third and
dialog: Madison.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: What was he doing?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
text: He was passed out.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: But you knew it was the man you were

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Based on what?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: His description.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Who provided you with the description?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: (hesitates a beat)
dialog: Cynthia something, I think.
text: Elliot moves to the defense table, glances at Arthur as he
text: picks up a paper. Arthur nods approvingly. Elliot looks at
dialog: the paper.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: I believe her name is Cynthia Webb.
dialog: According to the statement filed the
dialog: night she picked him out of the line-
dialog: up. The name familiar?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Yes... that's her.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Where did you find Ms Webb?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
text: On the street. Same area.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: And she agreed to pick the defendant
text: out of a line up.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Where you aware that Ms Webb
dialog: disappeared after she was served
dialog: with a subpoena?
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Yes, my partner and I tried to contact

speaker_heading: ELLIOT

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: That's the thing about life. You
dialog: control it or it controls you. Most
dialog: people don't understand that. They
dialog: try'n blame their fuck-ups on
dialog: something or somebody else. But it's
dialog: not like that. I don't wanna hear
dialog: why your life's a mess. It's a mess
dialog: cause you're a mess. That simple.
dialog: They're waitin' to live happily ever
dialog: after. But after what? After all the
dialog: shit happens? Well, I got a clue for
dialog: everybody, the shit never stops
dialog: happening. So you deal with it or

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Life don't work in mysterious ways.
dialog: There ain't no mystery to it. You

dialog: too serious. You can't take it too
dialog: serious otherwise you get fragile.
dialog: And you can't be fragile and have

speaker_heading: BAILIFF

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Miss Webb, had you ever seen the

dialog: night you described to us?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Do you know what perjury is?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: When you lie.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: When you lie under oath in a court
dialog: of law. Do you know what the penalty
dialog: for that is?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: You go to jail.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yes... Cynthia, have you ever seen
dialog: the defendant before that night?
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: Objection. The witness has already
dialog: answered that question.
scene_heading: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
dialog: Sustained.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I just want to give the witness the
dialog: opportunity to remember if she could
dialog: have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else
text: before the night in question.
text: Divinci stares at Cynthia. As if willing her to give the
dialog: answer he wants her to give.
scene_heading: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
dialog: Ms. Webb, do you understand the
dialog: consequences of perjury?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
dialog: Let's get on with it then.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What did you buy the night you went
dialog: into the mini-mart?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: What did I buy?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You remembered seeing Mr. McCall
dialog: that night and hearing the gunshot
dialog: and a car crash. I just wondered if
dialog: you remembered what you bought in
dialog: the mini-mart.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: ...shampoo I think.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: That's all?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Where do you live?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
text: 4356 17th Street. Number 37.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Is that close to where this mini-
dialog: mart is?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Close? Sort of.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: How far would you say?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I don't really know.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Within walking distance?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: No... I don't think so.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Did you walk there that night or
dialog: drive?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I ahh... drove.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You drove. But when you left the
dialog: mini-mart you stated that you walked
text: down the street.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: How far?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: ...to the corner.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Objection. Your honor, I don't see a
dialog: point to this line of questioning.
scene_heading: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
dialog: Is there a point?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yes, your honor. Since this is the
dialog: only witness, I'm trying to establish
dialog: what the scene was like that night.
scene_heading: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
dialog: Try to get there as quickly as
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (to Cynthia)
dialog: And how far away from the corner was
dialog: the Mini-mart? For example was it in
text: the middle of the block, close to
dialog: the corner, where?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: In the middle I think.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: So you walked all the way to the
dialog: corner. I assume then you were walking
dialog: back to your car, yes?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: ...yeah.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Was there a reason you parked so far
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: (getting nervous)
dialog: Um... there were lots of cars parked
text: on the street.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Was there anyone else on the street
dialog: besides you?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Lots of cars, but no people. Any
dialog: traffic?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I don't remember.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: So you were the only person to see
dialog: Joe on the street that night?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I didn't see anybody else.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: So you heard a gunshot, a car crash
text: and a man running with a gun in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What did you do then? Did you call
dialog: the police, 911?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I went home.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You went home. Straight home?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And you're sure it was Joe you saw
dialog: that night?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: When you went home.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: Yes.
text: Arthur pauses.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: When you went home you saw Joe?
text: Cynthia realizes what she's said.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Objection. Defense is trying to
text: confuse the witness.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'm not trying to confuse the witness,
text: it's the witness that's trying to
dialog: confuse the court. I have witnesses
text: who will refute her testimony.
dialog: Witnesses who were on that corner
dialog: the night of the shooting, who never
dialog: saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the
text: gunshot, who never saw Joe run past.
dialog: Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment
dialog: building that night because he lived
dialog: in the alley next to it. Isn't that
dialog: right, Ms Webb?
text: Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Objection!
text: Everyone's attention is on Cynthia.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: When I referred to him as Joe, you
dialog: knew who I was talking about, didn't
dialog: you. This case is the People versus
dialog: Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has
dialog: never been mentioned in this trial.
dialog: How did you know who I was talking
dialog: about, Ms. Webb?
text: Cynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci. Divinci is frozen.
text: Rodriguez is sweating.
text: Then Cynthia turns and looks at Joe.
text: Joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. Not hating her.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe
dialog: was the defendant?
text: Cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: He lived in the alley next to my
dialog: apartment building.
text: Helen and Richard Stein are stunned yet again.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Oh shit.
text: Divinci and Rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool,
text: calm and collected.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Why did you lie to this court?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Are you afraid of somebody?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Are you protecting somebody?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: JUDGE HAROLD PINE
dialog: Answer the questions, Ms. Webb or
dialog: I'll be forced to cite you for
dialog: contempt.

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Right.
text: Divinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his elbow
text: into Rodriguez' face. And Divinci is all over him like a
text: tornado. Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly. He grabs
text: his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER
text: strapped to his body, recording their every word.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: YOU FUCKIN' RAT!
text: Divinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head. Rodriguez,

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin'
dialog: rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin'
dialog: traded you... Simms knows everything.

text: Divinci is ready to pull the trigger.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: You're fuckin' right.
text: Divinci rips the wires off the recorder. Rodriguez closes
text: his eyes, waiting for the end. A tense moment, then --
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: ...Get out.
text: Rodriguez opens his eyes, looking at Divinci, who is still
text: holding the gun to his head. Another moment, then --
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Frank --
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: (calm)
dialog: Get outa the car NOW!
text: A beat, then Rodriguez gets out. Divinci looks up at his

text: Shuts the door. Stands alone in the room for a moment, then
text: suddenly erupts in rage. Ripping off his coat, ripping off
text: his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest.
text: He throws the recorder on the ground. Stomps on it until
text: it's shattered into pieces. He stares at the broken recorder.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (VIC)
dialog: I guess we caught you at a bad time.
text: Rodriguez spins around. Vic steps into the moonlight streaming
text: in through the window. Behind him is Cutless Supreme.
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: But we all have problems.
text: Rodriguez suddenly YELLS and CHARGES THEM. He tackles Vic.
text: But in the darkness we can't see anything. Until the explosion
text: of a GUN and the FLASH of flames lights up the room. A moment
dialog: of silence then --
speaker_heading: VIC
dialog: Oh shit. You shot him, you fuckin'
dialog: shot him!

speaker_heading: SIMMS

speaker_heading: AGENT HOOPER

dialog: we SEE are GUNS in hands.
text: Cynthia and Manny wake up with a start. Manny is scared.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Shit! Who the fuck're you?!

speaker_heading: CYNTHIA

speaker_heading: CYNTHIA

text: Agent Simms looks right into Cynthia's eyes.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
text: Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was
text: shot in the head last night.
text: This gets Cynthia's attention.
speaker_heading: SIMMS
text: Rodriguez was wearing a recorder.
dialog: Divinci found it. You can do addition,
dialog: can't you.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: You're full of shit.
speaker_heading: AGENT SARKASIAN
dialog: Just tell us what you know.

dialog: Right... I don't know a fuckin' thing.
text: Simms stares at her for a moment, then turns to Hooper and

dialog: What attorney?
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - COUNTY JAIL - DAY

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Hi, Cynthia. Please sit down.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I got nothin' to say.

speaker_heading: DIVINCI'S VOICE

dialog: Then we're off the hook.
text: Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead." But
text: Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything.
text: And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to reveal

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI'S VOICE
dialog: YOU FUCKIN' RAT!
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I think you know my client is
dialog: innocent. That's all I care about,
dialog: my client. But I understand why you're
dialog: scared. You're already facing perjury
dialog: charges. My guess is, your involvement
dialog: is deeper than that. But I don't
dialog: really care, I'm not after you... I
dialog: get nothing if you go to jail. But I
dialog: think if I help you, I can help my

speaker_heading: CYNTHIA

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: William -- Joe -- didn't do it, did

text: Arthur, who was sitting across from him, stands.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Before I leave, let me remind you
dialog: that you have shit for a case. If
dialog: you really care about seeing justice
dialog: for your dead agent, don't blow this
dialog: deal. Immunity for her testimony is
dialog: a small price for a bad cop. It's
dialog: the only way she's going to talk.
text: Simms glares at Arthur.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And William McCall walks, right now,
dialog: all charges dropped.

speaker_heading: ELLIOT

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: -- to tell the truth, I had no other

speaker_heading: A MAN

scene_heading: INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (DIVINCI)
dialog: I guess you had no choice.
text: Cynthia tries to move, but a hand grabs her arm. And now we

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: You had to do the right thing.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: What d'you want?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI

speaker_heading: DIVINCI

dialog: would be nice... love would be
dialog: better... but a little loyalty...
dialog: you can never get enough of that.
dialog: (moves up to her)
dialog: ...But we'll start with... money.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)
text: Cynthia goes to her closet, pulls out a box, opens it. It's
dialog: got her savings.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: This is all I've got.

speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: They'll catch you.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: You wanna bet?
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: They don't have a clue, baby. And

speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: And they don't know where that is.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: So tell me about your plans. I think
dialog: I'd like to hear 'em now.
text: Divinci looks at Cynthia for a moment, almost with remorse.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Loyalty is what it all comes down

dialog: gone. And once it's gone, you don't
dialog: ever get it back... You shouldn't've
dialog: told 'em.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I shouldn't've done a lotta things
dialog: in my life. But that's not one of
dialog: 'em.
speaker_heading: DIVINCI
dialog: Let me tell you something... the

dialog: witness is that just one of 'em knows
dialog: what he's doing.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)
text: It is dark and quiet. No clue as to what's going on inside.
text: And we hold on this for a long moment. Just wondering what's

text: exits the bedroom quickly. He is upset. We HEAR the DOOR
dialog: close.
text: AND WHITE FEATHERS
text: fall like snow flakes on Cynthia's body draped across the
