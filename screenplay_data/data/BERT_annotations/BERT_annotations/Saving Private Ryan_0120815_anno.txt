speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: CREDITS: White lettering over a back background. The
text: THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard. The
text: power is astonishing. It roars through the body, blows back
text: the hair and rattles the ears.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. OMAHA BEACH - NORMANDY - DAWN
text: The ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING.
text: Huge fifteen inch guns.
scene_heading: SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT
text: Heads directly into a nightmare. MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from
text: German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the
text: beach. Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers,
text: pour out a red snowstorm of bullets.
speaker_heading: OFFSHORE
speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSITION:
speaker_heading: OMAHA BEACH, NORMANDY
dialog: June 6, 1944
speaker_heading: 0600 HOURS
text: HUNDREDS OF LANDING CRAFT Each holding
text: thirty men, near the beaches.
speaker_heading: THE CLIFFS
text: At the far end of the beach, a ninety-
text: foot cliff. Topped by bunkers.
text: Ringed by fortified machine gun nests.
text: A clear line-of-fire down the entire
dialog: beach.
speaker_heading: TEN LANDING CRAFT
dialog: Make their way toward the base of
text: the cliffs. Running a gauntlet of
dialog: explosions.
speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSITION:
text: THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE
text: STORY THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT Plows
dialog: through the waves.
text: THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN
dialog: Boys. Most are eighteen or nineteen years old. Tough.
text: Well-trained. Trying to block out the fury around them.
text: A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT
text: A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.
text: THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT
text: The Motorman holds his course. Shells EXPLODE around them.
text: FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water. CANNON FIRE SMASHES into
dialog: the bow.
text: THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS
text: BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him. The mate takes
dialog: the controls.
speaker_heading: A YOUNG SOLDIER
text: His face covered with the remains of
text: the motorman. Starts to lose it.
text: Begins to shudder and weep. His
dialog: name is DeLancey.
dialog: THE BOYS AROUND HIM
dialog: Do their best to stare straight ahead. But the fear infects
text: them. It starts to spread.
speaker_heading: A FIGURE
text: Pushes through the men. Puts himself
text: in front of DeLancey.
text: The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER. Early thirties. By far
text: the oldest man on the craft. Relaxed, battle-hardened,
text: powerful, ignoring the hell around them. He smiles, puts a
text: cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's
text: helmet and lights the cigar.
text: DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
text: and forces him to lock eyes. Miller smiles. DeLancey is
dialog: terrified.
dialog: Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?
dialog: Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.
dialog: Delancey Oh, Jesus...
dialog: Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your
dialog: left. Now look at the man on your right. Feel sorry for
dialog: those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're
dialog: not going to get a scratch. A few, including DeLancey, manage
text: thin smiles. Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
text: his jaw as if to see if it's broken. Miller pats him on the
text: cheek and moves on to the bow.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL
text: IN FRONT OF THEM.
text: PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND
text: It quivers in fear. Miller glances around, sees that none
text: of the men have noticed. He stares at his hand as if it
text: belongs to someone else. It stops shaking. He turns his
text: eyes back to the objective.
text: THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH
text: The six surviving boats alongside.
text: EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE
text: From the landing crafts. Arc toward the top of the cliffs.
dialog: THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN
text: A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft. A dozen
text: men are INSTANTLY KILLED. Among them, DeLancey.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Somehow survives. Jumps into the
dialog: breakers.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: MOVE, GODDAMN IT! GO! GO! GO!
speaker_heading: EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE
text: THE GERMANS On the edge of the cliff.
dialog: Rain down MACHINE GUN FIRE and
speaker_heading: GRENADES.
speaker_heading: THE AMERICANS
text: Struggle through the surf. FIRING
dialog: up as best they can. Making for the
dialog: base of the cliffs.
text: INCENDIARY GRENADES, HURLED FROM ABOVE,
speaker_heading: EXPLODE, SPREADING FIRE
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Ignores the EXPLOSIONS and BULLETS.
text: Uses hand signals and curt orders.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: THERE! THERE! HOOKS THERE! FIRE
speaker_heading: SQUAD, THOSE ROCKS!
speaker_heading: THE MEN
text: Obey instantly. Set the grappling
dialog: hooks. Take position. Return fire.
text: THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE
text: Drown out most voices. Except the SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED
dialog: AND DYING.
speaker_heading: THE MEN
dialog: Know what they have to do. Start up
dialog: the ropes. Into the teeth of the
dialog: German defenders.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Back-straps his Thompson sub-machine
text: gun. Starts climbing with the first
dialog: group.
speaker_heading: THE CLIFF FACE
text: The Americans swarm up the ropes.
text: Taking turns firing up at the Germans.
scene_heading: MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER
text: A soft-faced boy. Grabs him by the back of his collar.
text: Roughly yanks him up. Nearly choking him. They boy climbs
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: HALF-WAY
dialog: An American private is HIT. FALLS,
text: taking two others with him. All
text: three land on the rocks below.
dialog: Another way to die.
speaker_heading: NEAR THE TOP
text: Less steep. They leave the ropes.
text: Free climb, scrambling up the rocks.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men.
text: Others bottleneck behind them. Miller
text: scans the route and the defenders.
text: Sees an open gap. Deadly. Beyond is a protective overhang.
text: With a clear line to the top.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's the route.
text: Miller motions to six men huddled near him.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Go!
speaker_heading: THE SIX MEN
dialog: Take an instant to get ready. Then
text: SCRAMBLE into the gap.
speaker_heading: MILLER AND THE OTHERS
dialog: Do their best to cover them. POUR FIRE up at the Germans.
text: Bad angle. No Germans are hit.
speaker_heading: THE SIX MEN
dialog: Are CUT TO RIBBONS by MACHINE GUN
text: FIRE. All KILLED. They fall to the
dialog: rocks below.
text: SARGE, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller's right arm and
text: best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller.
dialog: Sarge That's a goddamned shooting gallery, Captain.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It's the only way.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Turns to the next half-dozen men.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: YOU'RE NEXT!
speaker_heading: THE SECOND SIX
text: Move to the head of the gap. Miller
dialog: moves for a better angle against the
text: machine guns. Calls to JACKSON, a
dialog: tall, gangly Southern country boy,
dialog: sharp-shooter.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: JACKSON, PICK OFF A FEW OF THEM,
dialog: WILL YOU?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (heavy Southern accent)
dialog: You betcha, Captain.
text: Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire.
text: Turns to the second six.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: GO!
speaker_heading: THE SECOND SIX
dialog: Take deep breaths. Head into the
dialog: gap.
text: MILLER AND OTHERS BLAST SURPRISING FIRE
text: JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans. MILLER CUTS DOWN two more.
dialog: SARGE gets one. Not enough.
speaker_heading: THE SECOND SIX
dialog: Are RAKED BY MACHINE GUNS. All are
speaker_heading: KILLED.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Turns, looking for the next six.
text: His eyes fall on Sarge and REIBEN
text: who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker.
text: Reiben smiles.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (heavy Brooklyn accent)
dialog: Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start
dialog: the paperwork.
speaker_heading: THE THIRD SIX
text: Moves into place. Sarge and Miller
text: exchange a look. They both see the
dialog: madness of what they're doing.
speaker_heading: MILLER AND THE OTHERS
text: OPEN UP on the Germans.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: GO!
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Rolls his eyes, takes a breath.
text: Scrambles into the gap. The other
text: five right behind.
speaker_heading: IN THE GAP
scene_heading: BULLETS EVERYWHERE.
text: Three are HIT. Then another. POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce
text: down. EXPLODE below.
text: THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben. Miller
text: sees them about to get it... MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN.
text: A perfect target. Captain's bars glinting. FIRING. TRYING
text: TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.
scene_heading: THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER
text: SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN. Too much to pass up. He
text: swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward
dialog: Miller.
text: A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant
dialog: from death.
speaker_heading: SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE
text: Under the overhang to safety.
text: MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL
speaker_heading: IS BLOWN OFF.
text: UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I'll be Goddamned! I'm not dead!
text: Sarge hollers back to Miller.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO
dialog: THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
text: Quick smiles. MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.
dialog: HIT more Germans.
text: SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang. Stop
text: near the top. Pull pins on grenades. Count. Both throw
text: long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.
scene_heading: THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.
text: Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Crosses the gap. His men follow.
speaker_heading: AT THE CREST
text: The Americans swarm over the top.
speaker_heading: FIRING.
text: TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat.
text: Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers. The Germans
speaker_heading: are CUT DOWN.
text: MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man
text: who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel
dialog: charges.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Okay, Wade, your turn.
dialog: Wade Captain, I love it when you say that.
text: Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to
text: the first of three bunkers. Dodging bullets from inside.
text: Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port. A HUGE, MUFFLED
text: EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.
speaker_heading: MILLER AND SARGE
dialog: Survey the field.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: What the hell were you doing? Drawing
dialog: fire!
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Worked, didn't it?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You tryin' to get yourself killed?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Don't need to, the Krauts go that
dialog: covered.
text: Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff
text: at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering
text: the rocks and the beach below. He's clearly affected.
text: Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded. Then he moves
text: on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German
text: bunkers. The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE
dialog: surround him. DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: The SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of
text: CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS. A huge government building stands
dialog: in the heart of Washington, D.C.
speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSITION:
scene_heading: WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON, D.C.
speaker_heading: JUNE 8, 1944
scene_heading: INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY
text: Very busy. A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,
text: quickly and efficiently. No small talk.
speaker_heading: A CLERK
text: Older than the others, sad-eyed,
text: adds a sheet of paper to a large
text: pile in his out-box.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: An outgoing telegram. It reads:
dialog: "We regret to inform you...killed in
dialog: action...heroic service..." This is
dialog: the paperwork of death.
speaker_heading: THE CLERK
text: Pulls out a file. Reads. Finds
text: something troubling. Quickly shuffles
dialog: through some other papers. Finds
dialog: what he's looking for. Rises from
text: his desk and hurries out of the
dialog: office.
scene_heading: INT. LIEUTENANT'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY
text: Seen through the glass wall. The clerk speaks to a YOUNG
text: LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.
text: He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the
text: office with the clerk on his heels.
scene_heading: INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY
text: Again, seen through a glass wall. The Young Lieutenant speaks
dialog: to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly
text: bothered by what he's being told. The Captain takes the
text: papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.
scene_heading: INT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY
text: A busy office. Aides and secretaries scurry about. The
text: walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex
text: deployment charts. A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of
text: ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee. He clearly
dialog: hasn't slept in a long time. The Young Captain, his staff
text: officer, walks in.
dialog: Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know
dialog: about.
dialog: One-armed colonel Yes?
dialog: Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy. One at Omaha
dialog: Beach, the other at Utah. Last week in Guam a third brother
text: was killed in action. All three telegrams went out this
text: morning. Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams
dialog: this afternoon.
text: The life drains from the Colonel. Others in the room hear
dialog: and freeze.
dialog: One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.
dialog: Young captain There's more. There's a fourth brother. The
dialog: youngest. He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First
text: Airborne the night before the invasion. He's on the front.
dialog: One-armed colonel Is he alive?
dialog: Young captain We don't know.
text: The Colonel regains his bearings. Stands and motions curtly
dialog: to the Captain. One-armed colonel Come with me.
text: The Colonel regains his bearings. Stands and motions curtly
dialog: to the Captain.
dialog: One-armed colonel Come with me.
text: The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his
text: heels. The aides and secretaries watch them go.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY
text: A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising
text: behind. Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.
scene_heading: EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY
text: A whit farmhouse. A barn. A stand of trees. Cornfields as
text: far as the eye can see.
speaker_heading: IN THE YARD
text: A tire swing. A bushel basket nailed
text: to the barn over a dirt basketball
dialog: court.
speaker_heading: A PORCH SWING
text: Sits empty. Moves slightly.
text: ON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR
text: Four American flag decals. Each one, a man in service.
speaker_heading: MARGARET RYAN
text: Steps out. Around sixty. Her face
dialog: shows the lines of a life of hard
dialog: work and mother hood. A good woman.
text: She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the
text: fields. Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind
dialog: the black car.
text: She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her
text: house. She starts to grow uneasy.
text: As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard. She
text: reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.
text: The car pulls up to the house. She sees three men get out,
text: one wearing a clerical collar. The first of her tears come.
scene_heading: INT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY
text: Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.
text: GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to
text: his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files. Half-
text: a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and
text: the Young Captain, wait. General Marshall puts down the
dialog: file.
speaker_heading: GENERAL MARSHALL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Goddamn it.
dialog: One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company
dialog: in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan
dialog: brothers died on the Juneau.
speaker_heading: GENERAL MARSHALL
dialog: Any contact with the fourth brother,
dialog: James?
dialog: One-armed colonel No, sir. He was dropped about thirty miles
text: inland, near Ramelle. That's still deep behind German lines.
text: General Marshall hardens.
speaker_heading: GENERAL MARSHALL
dialog: Well, if he's alive, we're going to
dialog: send someone to get him the hell out
dialog: of there. That's just what the
dialog: General's staff wanted to hear.
scene_heading: EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY
scene_heading: NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS. HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE.
text: Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force
text: of German troops. The Americans hug the bottoms of the
text: craters, FIRING BACK as best they can. BIG GUNS THUNDER in
dialog: the distance.
speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSITION:
dialog: Normandy 1300 hours June 9
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Trailed by a RADIOMAN, dashes through
text: the fire and dives into a sludge-
text: filled crater. He surfaces, sees
dialog: Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a
dialog: horrific smell. Their conversation
dialog: is repeatedly broken by FIRING And
scene_heading: DUCKING GERMAN FIRE.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Jesus Christ! What the hell are we
dialog: swimming in?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Shit, sir.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're
text: in a cranberry bog.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
text: Out of the frying pan, into the
dialog: fucking latrine.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Look at the bright side, the Krauts
dialog: sure as hell don't want to advance
dialog: and hold this cesspool.
text: Miller barks to his RADIOMAN.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Get Fire Control, we need some
dialog: artillery...
dialog: Radioman Trying, sir.
text: MORE EXPLOSIONS. They all duck. Reiben's worried.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Sir, what if they send some other
dialog: company into Caen ahead of us while
dialog: we're pinned down here?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Don't worry, we're the only Rangers
dialog: this side of the continent, we've
dialog: got to be first into Caen.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Who cares?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I care. Don't you know what Caen's
dialog: famous for, Sarge?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Frogs?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Lingerie.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yeah? So?
text: THE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant. Miller, Sarge
text: and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German
text: positions. GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck
dialog: down again.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: So, you ever heard of employee
dialog: discounts? My uncle sells shoes,
dialog: gets twenty-five percent off
dialog: everything in the line, got a closet
dialog: filled with the best looking shoes
dialog: you ever seen.
scene_heading: MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Just picture some French number been
dialog: spending all day, every day, making
dialog: cream-colored, shear-body negligees
dialog: with gentle-lift silk cups and
dialog: gathered empire waists, what the
dialog: hell you think she wears at night?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Reiben, how the hell do you know so
dialog: much about lingerie?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Lingerie is my life, sir. My mother's
dialog: got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in
dialog: it, from the time I could crawl, we
dialog: carry Caen lingerie, it's the best
dialog: there is, it's all I been thinking
dialog: about since the invasion.
text: Another pause in the German shelling. Reiben rises and BLASTS
text: HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: There's a war on, good chance they're
text: not still making lingerie in Caen.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Oh, Captain, they'll always make
dialog: lingerie, it's one of the three basic
dialog: needs of man -- food, shelter, silk
dialog: teddies. Miller Dream on, private.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Happy to, sir.
dialog: Radioman Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at
dialog: H.Q., right away.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Maybe the war's over.
text: A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE. After the debris stops
text: falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge. Reiben
text: looks dubiously at Miller.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I don't think so, Captain.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (to Radioman)
dialog: Stay at it until you get fire control.
dialog: (to Sarge)
dialog: Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Miller waits for a pause in the MORTAR BARRAGE, then scrambles
text: out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run.
scene_heading: EXT. NORMANDY - FIELD H.Q. - 19TH INFANTRY - DAY
scene_heading: Chaos. Under fire. INTERMITTENT MORTARS, SOME BIG GERMAN
text: SHELLS and fairly close SMALL ARMS FIRE.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Runs over the broken ground and makes
text: it to the sandbagged H.Q. He stumbles
text: down the make-shift stairs.
scene_heading: INT. H.Q. SANDBAGGED BUNKER - DAY
text: Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which
text: continue through the scene. Miller salutes a Major.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Miller, Company B, Second Rangers.
dialog: Major Go on in.
text: Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a
text: dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen.
text: Very busy. A field map dominates the center of the small
dialog: space.
text: The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him
text: respectfully. He's clearly someone special.
text: COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone.
text: He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of
text: the storm. He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: (into field-phone)
dialog: ...I understand your problem, but if
dialog: we don't get those tanks off-loaded
dialog: by 0600, we're going to have an entire
dialog: division up at Caen with its ass
dialog: hanging out of its pants...
text: A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of
dialog: paper.
dialog: Lieutenant Captain, here's your company address list.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: My what?
dialog: Lieutenant For letters to the families of your killed-in-
dialog: action.
text: Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Find a chaplain.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: (into field-phone)
dialog: ...alright, let me know when.
text: Anderson hangs up, speaks to an AIDE.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: Have the Second and Third Regiments
dialog: hold at St. Michel until we get those
dialog: tanks. Aide Yes, sir.
text: Colonel Anderson turns to Miller.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: Report.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sector four is secured, we put out
dialog: the last three German one-fifty-fives,
dialog: found them about two miles in from
dialog: Ponte du Hoc.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: Resistance?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery,
dialog: we took twenty-three prisoners, turned
dialog: them over to intelligence.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: Casualties?
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
text: An instant of SILENCE, all hear, none look.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: They didn't want to give up those
dialog: one-fifty-fives, sir.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: It was a hard assignment, that's why
dialog: you got it.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: Where are your men now?
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Pinned down, a mile east of here,
dialog: waiting for some help from the navy
dialog: guns.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: I'm sending Simpson to take over for
dialog: you, the division is going to Caen,
dialog: you're not coming with us, I have
dialog: something else for you.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: There's a Private James Ryan who
dialog: parachuted in with the Hundred-and-
dialog: First near Ramelle. I want you to
dialog: take a squad up there. If he's alive,
dialog: bring him back to the beach for
dialog: debarkation. Take whoever you need,
dialog: you've got your pick of the company.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: A private, sir?
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: He's the last of four brothers, the
dialog: other three were killed in action.
dialog: This is straight from the Chief of
dialog: Staff.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: But, sir...I...I...
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: Spit it out, Captain.
speaker_heading: MILLER HESITATES, THEN:
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Respectfully, sir, sending men all
dialog: the way up to Ramelle to save one
dialog: private doesn't make a fucking,
dialog: goddamned bit of sense.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sir.
text: The other officers freeze, listening without turning. Colonel
text: Anderson glares at Miller.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: You think just because you hold the
dialog: Congressional Medal of Honor, you
dialog: can say any damn thing you please to
dialog: your superior officers?
text: Miller considers the question, then smiles.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yes, sir, more or less.
text: Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head
text: off, then he smiles, too.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: Alright, I'll give you that.
dialog: Continue.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: The numbers don't make sense, sir.
dialog: His brothers are dead, that's too
dialog: bad, but they're out of the equation.
dialog: Sending men up there is bleeding
dialog: heart crapola from three thousand
text: miles away. One private is simply
dialog: not worth a squad. Colonel anderson
dialog: This one is. He's worth a lot more
dialog: than that. Which is why I'm sending
dialog: you, you're the best field officer
dialog: there is.
dialog: Miller Shrugs.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan?
dialog: Fine officer, regular church goer,
dialog: writes poetry, he might like a mission
dialog: like this.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And he's taller than me.
text: Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's

speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: That's enough, Captain, you have
dialog: your orders. Major Thomas will fill
dialog: you in.
text: Miller knows when to back off. He salutes.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.
speaker_heading: COLONEL ANDERSON
dialog: Good luck, John.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.
text: Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices
text: the other officers in the tent watching. A glare and they
dialog: go back to work.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY
text: A MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the
text: deck of the enormous ship.
scene_heading: EXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY
text: HUGE EXPLOSIONS. The big naval shells SLAM into the German
text: position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field.
speaker_heading: IN THE CRATERS
dialog: Miller's Ranger company ducks and
text: covers. The BARRAGE SUBSIDES. The
text: Rangers rise, FIRING, leap-frogging
dialog: from crater to crater, advancing
dialog: against the remaining Germans who
text: return SMALL ARMS FIRE.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Crouch-runs and dives into a crater
dialog: with Sarge.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Put on your traveling shoes, Sarge,
dialog: we're heading out.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Caen?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I wish. You and I are taking a squad
dialog: up to Ramelle on a public relations
dialog: mission.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You? Leading a squad?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Some private up there lost three
dialog: brothers, got a ticket home.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: What about the company?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Simpson.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Simpson? Jesus Christ on a fucking
dialog: pogo stick!
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with
text: his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Beasley's dead.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Okay, Wade. Translators?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Fresh out.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What about Talbot?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Twenty minutes ago. Miller Damn,
dialog: I'll go see if I can find another
dialog: one. You get Reiben, Jackson and
dialog: Wade, meet me at transport.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the
text: crater and crouch-run in opposite directions.
scene_heading: EXT. TRANSPORT H.Q. - NINETEENTH INFANTRY - DAY
text: Just in from the beaches. DISTANT ARTILLERY AND EXPLOSIONS.
dialog: Nothing close. Dust. Confusion. Vehicles of every sort
text: moving out. Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks. In the middle
text: of the mess, a cigar-chewing SUPPLY SERGEANT works at a make-
text: shift desk made out of crate. He yells at a PRIVATE.
speaker_heading: SUPPLY SERGEANT
scene_heading: GET THOSE GODDAMNED HALF-TRACKS OUT
dialog: OF THERE!
dialog: Private They're blocked in!
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
speaker_heading: THEN UNBLOCK 'EM!
scene_heading: SARGE&lt; REIBEN, JACKSON AND WADE
text: Wait nearby. Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering.
text: The others are relaxed.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Strides through the chaos, avoiding
text: the passing vehicles. He sees his
text: men and walks toward them. Reiben
text: hurries up to Miller, pleading.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Please, sir, you can't take me to
dialog: Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir,
dialog: please, I told you, they make Caen
dialog: lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's
dialog: the best there is, it's...oh, please,
dialog: sir...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're
dialog: the best.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest. Or
dialog: what about Faulkner? Or that little
dialog: guy with the glasses?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Trust me, you're the best.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (whimpering)
dialog: But, sir...
text: Miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides
text: off toward the Supply Sergeant's table. Sarge falls in next
dialog: to Miller.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You get a translator, Captain?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I've got a line on one.
scene_heading: TRANSPORT OPERATIONS TABLE
text: Chaos. Vehicles THUNDERING by. The
text: Supply Sergeant juggles runners and
text: paperwork. Miller steps up to him.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sergeant, I need a truck.
speaker_heading: SUPPLY SERGEANT
dialog: Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how
dialog: 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top,
text: red with black interior.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: White-walls?
speaker_heading: SUPPLY SERGEANT
dialog: No white-walls, sir, there's a war
dialog: on.
dialog: (to the Private)
dialog: NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER
dialog: THERE!
dialog: (to Miller)
dialog: I can't help you, sir.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: A half-track, anything.
speaker_heading: SUPPLY SERGEANT
dialog: Sorry, sir. Division is using
dialog: everything on wheels to get up to
dialog: Caen.
dialog: (notices Miller's
dialog: shoulder patch)
dialog: How come you guys aren't going?
text: Miller ignores the question. He spies a jeep.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: How about that jeep?
speaker_heading: SUPPLY SERGEANT
dialog: That's General Gavin's. His lap dog
dialog: told me if anyone breathes on it,
dialog: I'll get busted and if anyone so
dialog: much as touches it with their little
dialog: finger, I'll get court marshaled.
dialog: If you were to take it, they'd shoot
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Cap'n, does that mean we got to walk
dialog: all the way up to Ramelle?
speaker_heading: SUPPLY SERGEANT
dialog: What's at Ramelle beside a lot of
dialog: Germans.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: A paratrooper named Ryan. He's going
dialog: home, if he's alive.
speaker_heading: SUPPLY SERGEANT
dialog: Senator's son?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: No, three brothers of his were killed
dialog: in action. Command wants him out of
dialog: there.
text: The Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly.
speaker_heading: SUPPLY SERGEANT
dialog: Damn...I got a couple brothers...
text: Miller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly. The Supply
text: Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM TRANSPORT - DAY
text: Miller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep.
text: Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam
text: of men and vehicles. Miller rides shotgun. Reiben, Jackson
text: and Wade are crammed in the back.
text: The SUPPLY SERGEANT Watches them go. Behind him, GENERAL
text: GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his
text: huge staff. He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty.
speaker_heading: GENERAL GAVIN
dialog: SERGEANT, WHERE THE HELL IS MY
speaker_heading: GODDAMNED JEEP!?
text: The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns
dialog: to take his lumps.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
text: Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American
dialog: staging area.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We've got to make one stop.
text: Miller points the way for Sarge.
scene_heading: EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY
text: Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly
text: white, taut-lined tent. A steady stream of ROARING vehicles
text: and CHATTERING men move out around them. DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.
scene_heading: SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM. Miller hops out.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Wait here.
text: He strides into the tent.
scene_heading: INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY
text: Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious
text: nerds the day before finals. They're breaking down and
text: gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine. Tedious,
dialog: detailed work.
text: One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,
text: patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick
text: glasses. He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
text: EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.
dialog: Miller strides in. Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.
text: Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.
dialog: Upham Sir, I'm Upham.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I understand you speak French and
dialog: German.
dialog: Upham Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Do you have an accent?
dialog: Upham A slight one in French. My German is clean. It has a
dialog: touch of the Bavarian.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Good, you've been re-assigned to me,
dialog: we're going to Ramelle.
dialog: Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.
dialog: Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's my understanding.
dialog: Upham Lots of them.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Do you have a problem with that,
dialog: Corporal?
dialog: Upham Sir, I've never been in combat. I make maps. I
dialog: translate.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I need a translator, all mine have
dialog: been killed.
dialog: Upham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It'll come back to you. Get your
dialog: gear.
text: Upham hesitates.
dialog: Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter?
text: Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.
dialog: Upham I'm writing a book and I...
text: Miller's expression gives him his answer.
dialog: Upham Uh, how about a pencil?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: A small one.
text: Miller shoos him off.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Go, go...
text: Upham scurries away. Miller sighs.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY
text: Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the
text: others in the back of the jeep. As they drive off, the CAMERA
text: CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion
dialog: in military history.
text: The scope of the operation is stunning. The beach is covered
text: with mountains of supplies. A steady stream of vehicles
text: winds up the dunes. Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored
text: by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene. Off-
text: shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers
text: swarming over it like ants. Beyond that, thousands of ships
dialog: and boats of every type and description. The smoke of
text: hundreds of fires rises on the horizon. EXPLOSIONS, some
text: distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.
dialog: It's an awesome, breathtaking sight. Miller and his tiny
text: band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,
text: speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the
text: bulk of the American Army behind. Ext. french road - day
text: Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and
text: infantrymen moving forward. The sides of the road are
text: littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned
dialog: equipment, bodies.
text: Sarge drives. Miller reads a map. Upham, cradling a pristine
text: M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears. Jackson and Wade calmly
text: take in the view. Reiben checks out the close quarters in
text: the back of the jeep.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Captain, can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sure, Reiben.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Where are you planning on putting
dialog: Private Ryan, sir?
text: Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's just that it's kind of crowded
dialog: back here, I was wondering if you're
dialog: expecting to have more room on the
dialog: way back?
text: Miller points out a turn to Sarge.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Left.
text: Sarge makes the turn. Miller folds up the map and pockets
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Now we've got a straight shot, due
dialog: north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles,
dialog: two villages between here and there,
dialog: St. Mere, then Bernay. We'll take
dialog: the jeep as far as we can, then go
dialog: on on foot.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: We in radio contact with anybody up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Somebody put the wrong crystals in
dialog: every one of the Hundred-and-First's
dialog: radios the night before the drop,
dialog: not one of them works. We're going
dialog: in blind.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I usually like surprises.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: What are we likely to run into?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut
dialog: divisions, no fronts, no lines, the
dialog: drops were completely fouled up,
dialog: we've got little pockets of
text: paratroopers all over the place,
dialog: trying to hang on. Command says we
dialog: hold St. Mere, but north of that,
dialog: it's all Krauts. Even if Ryan's
dialog: where he's supposed to be, he's more
dialog: than likely dead.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Hell of a mission.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yep, hell of a mission.
text: IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP
text: Upham avidly takes in everything. He notices Reiben staring
text: at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful
dialog: smile.
dialog: Upham Hi. So, uh, you're all Rangers?
text: Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an
dialog: insect.
dialog: Upham I'm Upham.
dialog: (pointing at his corporal's stripes)
dialog: Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.
text: Their jaws drop.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (to Wade)
dialog: You want to shoot him, or should I?
dialog: Wade It's not my turn.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (politely)
dialog: Jackson?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal,
dialog: Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
text: Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.
dialog: Upham Miller?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I don't want anybody to shoot him,
dialog: that's an order. He speaks French
dialog: and his German has a touch of the
dialog: Bavarian.
dialog: Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?
text: Miller sighs, he knows what's coming.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...who won the Congressional Medal
dialog: of Hon...?
text: Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances
text: of Miller's men. Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-
dialog: faced.
text: No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as
dialog: if it had never happened.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony
dialog: of this mission is fucking killing
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yeah, how so?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I should be on my way to Caen, sir.
dialog: It's like Beethoven, the guy's one
dialog: of the greatest composers ever lived
dialog: and he goes deaf. Go figure, I mean,
dialog: who'd he piss off? And here I am,
dialog: the Beethoven of ladies foundation
dialog: garments, one step away from Caen,
dialog: the center of the known lingerie
dialog: universe and instead, I'm going to
dialog: Ramelle to save some fucking private
dialog: who's probably already dead.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: There's to be a bright side, look
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous
dialog: for? Cheese. The rest of the company
dialog: is going to Caen and we're going to
dialog: the goddamned cheese capital of
dialog: France. There is no bright side.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: There's always a bright side.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I'm listening, sir.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Well, I, for one, like cheese.
text: Wade pipes up cheerfully.
dialog: Wade Hell, I don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's
dialog: something up there for me to blow up.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Well, you're a happy idiot.
speaker_heading: THEY ROUND A TURN
dialog: SKID TO A STOP AT A:
scene_heading: BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES
text: A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster. Miller calls to him.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: How's the road up to St. Mere?
dialog: Lieutenant Bad, sir. There're some eighty-eights hiding
dialog: somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Anybody getting through?
dialog: Lieutenant The lucky ones.
text: Miller nods to Sarge who floors it. They take off, spraying
text: gravel behind them. Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels
text: down the road, fast. The road is pock-marked with craters.
text: They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps. Direct
text: hits. Sarge swerves around them without slowing.
scene_heading: AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS
text: On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of
text: a dozen American troops. It's a nightmare vision. Upham
text: grows weak at the sight. Miller takes note of Upham's
dialog: reaction.
speaker_heading: IN THE BACK
text: The men bounce up and down like
text: stuffed animals, doing their best to
dialog: not be thrown out.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Hell, this is better than Coney
dialog: Island!
speaker_heading: A HUGE BUMP
text: Bounces Reiben up and slams his back
text: down on his shovel. He HOLLERS IN
speaker_heading: PAIN.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Just trying to make room for Ryan.
text: Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his
text: shovel from under his bruised ass.
scene_heading: THEY ROUND A BEND
text: See a long, straight stretch of road. Half-a-dozen burning,
text: obliterated American vehicles. A gauntlet to run.
scene_heading: AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN
text: Lands right behind them. BLOWS A NEW CRATER
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Sarge?
text: SARGE FLOORS IT. Everyone hangs on.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER SHELL EXPLODES
text: Thirty yards ahead of them.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Directs Sarge off the road.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: They've got the road zeroed.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep
dialog: off the road.
speaker_heading: THE JEEP BOUNCES
text: Off the shoulder. Nearly throwing
text: everyone out. Somehow they hang on.
text: The jeep tears along the rutted field.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER EXPLOSION
text: Just behind them.
speaker_heading: SARGE DRIVES MADLY
text: Not slowing down. Trying to avoid
text: the biggest ruts and bumps.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER EXPLOSION
text: Close on their side. Showers them
dialog: with debris.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN
text: Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: They've got a hell of a spotter
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER EXPLOSION
text: Even closer. The jeep's PEPPERED
text: WITH SHRAPNEL. They BARREL THROUGH
dialog: the smoke.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: S-curves, Sarge.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Turns shallow curves without slowing
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER
text: Tries to avoid it. Too late. Brakes. PLOWS into overturned
text: earth. STOPS SHORT.
scene_heading: REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON
text: THROWN from the jeep. TUMBLE into the dirt. Not hurt.
speaker_heading: SARGE AND MILLER
dialog: Hang on. Stay in the jeep but are
dialog: battered. All stunned. MILLER Is
text: first to regain his bearings. Jumps
text: up. Checks out the jeep. Undamaged.
text: Deep in the soft dirt.
scene_heading: AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sarge! Reverse!
text: Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.
text: The wheels spin. Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.
text: Yells to the others.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: COME ON! YOU WANNA WALK?
speaker_heading: STILL DAZED
dialog: Reiben, Wade, Jackson, Upham screw
text: their heads back on. Shoulder into
dialog: the jeep. Push for all they're worth.
text: The WHEELS STILL SPIN.
scene_heading: ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT
speaker_heading: MILLER IGNORES IT
dialog: He's the only one who does.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Captain, they got us zeroed.
dialog: Upham is very nervous.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: That's bracketing, right?
text: They all ignore him.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I know about bracketing. I read
dialog: about it. The next one is going to
dialog: land right on us.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: FORWARD! FORWARD!
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: NOW REVERSE!
dialog: Sarge SLAMS THE JEEP INTO REVERSE. Rocks it. SLAMS IT BACK
text: INTO FORWARD. Makes progress.
text: ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP. WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Uh, Captain...
speaker_heading: MILLER
speaker_heading: PUSH!
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Uh, Captain...
speaker_heading: THE TIRES SCREAM
dialog: A bit more progress. It's almost
dialog: out.
dialog: THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS
text: Knowing the shell is coming any second. Upham is beside
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Oh, Captain...
speaker_heading: ONE MORE PUSH
text: The jeep rocks back in, deeper.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: SHIT!
text: THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: GO!
speaker_heading: THE MEN
text: Instantly take off. Away from the
text: jeep. As fast as they can.
text: THE SHELL SCREAMS IN
dialog: The men hit the dirt.
speaker_heading: DIRECT HIT
speaker_heading: OBLITERATING THE JEEP
speaker_heading: THE MEN
text: Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER.
text: STUNNED by the concussion. SHOWERED
text: with dirt, rock and debris.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Is first up. Sarge and the men
dialog: struggle to their feet. Hear MORE
text: INCOMING. Miller grabs Upham by the
text: collar and pulls him up.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: HERE COME THE MORTARS!
dialog: THEY ALL TAKE OFF
dialog: Running as fast as they can.
text: THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN
text: The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between. But
text: there must be a dozen mortars firing. The shells are almost
dialog: constant.
speaker_heading: THE FIELD
text: The six Americans run madly, in zig-
text: zag patterns through the gauntlet of
scene_heading: MORTAR EXPLOSIONS. BOOM
speaker_heading: RUNNING, STUMBLING
speaker_heading: BOOM, BOOM, BOOM
text: UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND
text: Miller yanks him up. Half-drags him to the edge of the field.
dialog: THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES
text: Keep running. Through the bushes and brambles. Thirty yards
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: THE EXPLOSIONS STOP
text: THE MEN ALL STOP Panting. Struggling
dialog: to catch their breath. Check their
dialog: body parts. Everything's there.
dialog: They have their weapons, most of
dialog: their gear.
text: Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is
text: nothing more than a burning carcass. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: General Gavin is going to be very
dialog: irritated at you, Captain.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Stands on the edge of the woods,
text: almost in a trance.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Captain, I...
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Sssssh!
text: Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from
dialog: position to position.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sarge, maps.
text: Sarge quickly opens up the map case. The men are dead silent,
dialog: frozen in place.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Two eighty-eights, just under two-
dialog: and-a-half miles, that way, vector
dialog: from the jeep, through those two
text: trees at the base of the hill. The
dialog: mortars came from behind that rise,
dialog: there, four of them.
text: Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map. Miller snaps out
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Wade, the radio.
text: Wade instantly starts cranking it up. Upham is amazed.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: You can tell all that, just by the
dialog: sound, sire?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's not all. There were nine
dialog: gunners on the eighty-eights, one
text: had a broken heel on his boot, two
dialog: had bratwurst for supper last night,
dialog: one of them is named Fritz, the other,
dialog: Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard
dialog: to tell.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Corporal, you have just seen one of
dialog: Captain Miller's many God-given
dialog: talents. If, by some miracle, you
dialog: survive, you will witness many more
dialog: of them.
dialog: Sarge finished vectoring.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Got it, sir. We gonna go take care
dialog: of those eighty-eights?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's not what we're here for.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (re. radio)
dialog: I've got command, Captain.
text: Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: This is Baker Charley One, fire mark,
dialog: sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four-
dialog: three by baker-three. Two eighty-
dialog: eights. Tell our boys to come in
dialog: low from the east in case the Krauts
dialog: have ack-ack. Good hunting. Over.
text: A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static. Wade
text: packs up the radio. Miller folds up the map. Jackson Sir,
dialog: wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: He's right, Captain, it might be
dialog: kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Tell that to Private James Ryan.
dialog: We've got our orders. Let's go.
text: Miller heads off without pausing or looking back. The rest
text: of the men don't like it, but they follow. Upham trails,
dialog: amazed at Miller.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Miller walks point. His men follow warily. Upham falls in
dialog: alongside Reiben.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: So, where are you from?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Get lost.
text: Upham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: So, where are you from?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: You writin' a book or somethin'?
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: As a matter of fact, I am.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Figured.
text: Wade overhears and smiles at Upham.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I'm Wade, that's spelled, W-A-D-E,
dialog: I'm small but wiry, with piercing,
text: steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn
dialog: but handsome face, I'm from Colorado,
dialog: my father's a mining engineer, don't

speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Demolition, right?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Since I was nine years old. They
dialog: got a lot of explosives around mines.
dialog: Me and my little brother could get
dialog: into any warehouse you ever saw.
dialog: Damn, we had fun!
dialog: Jackson shrugs.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I'm Jackson. I'm from West Fork,
dialog: Tennessee. My pappy's a preacher.
dialog: Him and his two brothers got a
dialog: ministry, The Blessed Church of the
dialog: Wandering Gospel.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: In West Fork?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: In the back of a nineteen and thirty-
dialog: one stretch Hudson with a big ole'
dialog: trailer.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: No kidding.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I don't make jokes about things of,
dialog: or related to, the preaching of the
dialog: Holy Gospel, including the ministerial
dialog: calling of my family.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: So they travel around from place to
dialog: place and preach?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: We got us a tent, forty-two feet
text: across, eighteen feet at center,
dialog: hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs.
dialog: Circuit's eleven towns, covers all
dialog: 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller
dialog: County. I expect that upon completion
dialog: of my military service I will be
dialog: joinin' said ministry.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: What about the Captain? Where's he
dialog: from?
text: They all shake their heads. Miller's out of earshot.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: You figure that out, you got yourself
dialog: one nice prize.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Over three hundred bucks, last I
dialog: heard. Wade Company's got a pool,
dialog: five bucks gets you in, whoever
dialog: guesses where the Captain's from and
dialog: what he did as a civilian gets it
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
text: The whole kit and caboodle.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: But everybody's heard of him, he won
dialog: the Congressional Medal of Honor, he
dialog: saved a dozen men.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: We know.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Somebody must know where he's from,
dialog: what he did for a living.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Somebody probably does.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Why don't you just ask him?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: The Captain prefers not to discuss
dialog: certain aspects of his life, in
dialog: particular, everything up to and
dialog: including his enlistment in the United
dialog: States Army.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: I've been with him since Anzio. I'm
dialog: closer to him that I am to my own
dialog: brother but I don't even know what
dialog: state he's from. Somewhere in the
dialog: Northeast as near as I can figure.
dialog: I don't even have a clue what he did
dialog: for a living as civilian.
text: Reiben shakes his head.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: No one's gonna win the money for the
dialog: simple reason that the Captain never
dialog: was a civilian. They assembled him
dialog: at O.C.S. out of spare body parts
dialog: from dead G.I.'s. I know this for a
dialog: fact.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Hell, no. I think he's the best
dialog: officer in the whole goddamned army,
dialog: bar none.
text: They all nod in assent, no argument there.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: You got that right.
text: Miller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation. Upham
text: watches Miller, with even more curiosity.
scene_heading: EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY
text: Miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a
dialog: country cow path. They're staying close to the cover of the
text: brush. Miller walks tall now.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Captain, my feet are most
dialog: uncomfortable. If I'd 'a known we
dialog: was gonna have to walk all the way
dialog: to Ramelle, I never would 'a
dialog: volunteered for this here mission.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I most likely would have, sir, had I
dialog: been given the opportunity.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: If we find Ryan and he's still alive,
dialog: that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry
dialog: this goddamned B.A.R. back to the
dialog: beach for me.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Army life is too dang easy, my feet
dialog: have gone soft. Back home, we go
dialog: out squirrel huntin', I walk forever
dialog: and a day and then some, don't even
dialog: raise a blister.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: You know what a B.A.R. weighs?
dialog: Nineteen and a half pounds, not
dialog: counting ammo.
dialog: (re. ammo bandoleers)
dialog: And you think these things are
dialog: comfortable? They may look good but
dialog: they weigh twelve pounds each, that's
dialog: thirty-six pounds, right there.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: So what? I've got three satchel
dialog: charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen-
dialog: and-a-half pineapples, and all my
dialog: regular gear. You don't hear me
dialog: complaining.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: That's because, as I have pointed
dialog: out on numerous occasions, you are a
dialog: happy idiot.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: No, I just happen to take the
dialog: Captain's advice and look at the
dialog: bright side of things.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: How do you do it?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: It's easy, it runs in my family,
dialog: take my grandfather, for example...
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to
dialog: that grandfather thing again.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: As I was saying, before I was so
dialog: rudely interrupted, my grandfather
dialog: got old, as grandfathers tend to do.
dialog: He needed someone to take care of
dialog: him. We move around all the time,
dialog: going from one mine to another, so
dialog: we had to put him in a home. Nice
dialog: enough place but kind of depressing.
dialog: But not for Granddad. He just
dialog: convinced himself he was on a cruise
dialog: ship, going to Tahiti, he had his
dialog: own cabin, first class, with room
dialog: service. It just so happened that
dialog: the weather was always lousy, so he
dialog: never bothered to go up on deck.
dialog: Happiest guy you ever saw until the
dialog: day he died.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: You think he really believed it?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Who knows? It worked.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Fine, you convince yourself you got
dialog: a pack full of feathers and goddamned
dialog: Private James Ryan can carry my
dialog: fucking gear.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Reiben, you can be very unpleasant
dialog: to be around sometimes.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: You want unpleasant? Just wait, I
dialog: can do much better than this.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Look at Upham, you don't hear him
dialog: complaining.
text: Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Well, as a matter of fact, I was
dialog: just thinking...
text: The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: That I'm so fucking tired of this
dialog: goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand
dialog: dollars to see that bastard Ryan
text: crawl on his belly over an acre of
dialog: broken glass to hear my great-aunt
text: Martha fart through a field-phone.
text: The men are stunned.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Upham, are you sure you've never
dialog: been in combat?
dialog: Upham wiggles with pride. Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain
dialog: I'd remember.
text: Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: He's good.
dialog: They walk on.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable.
text: Miller smiles, situation normal.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active
scene_heading: battlefield. HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE. GRENADE AND MORTAR
scene_heading: EXPLOSIONS. MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND. American soldiers
text: crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans.
text: Some French civilians dash across a street. A man and a
text: couple of women, one carrying a child. They make it across
text: and disappear into the remains of a building.
text: Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a
text: corner. Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread
text: out down the block behind him.
text: Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental
text: picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of
text: an alley across the street and down the block. They are
text: CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN.
text: As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET
text: SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.
text: Miller motions Jackson across first.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Stay low.
text: Jackson gathers himself, takes off. GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,
text: kicking up the cobblestone behind him. Jackson zig-zags and
text: makes it to the cover of the far side.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Dang! That was close!
text: Miller nods to Upham.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Your turn.
text: Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move. Miller speaks to him
dialog: very gently.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Zig-zag, change your pace a couple
dialog: times, you'll be alright.
text: Upham's frozen. He can barely breathe. Miller sighs.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Okay, I'm going to draw fire for
dialog: you.
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: But if I do, you goddamned well better
dialog: go.
text: Upham nods. Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.
text: CLOSE SHOT: MILLER'S HAND quivers.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Looks to Upham
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Ready?
text: Upham nods, still terrified.
text: MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN
text: Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Go.
dialog: Upham runs.
text: A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.
text: He doesn't budge.
text: UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.
text: REIBEN watches Upham run.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Hey, that guy can move.
text: A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear. UPHAM gets to
dialog: the far side.
text: MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner. Reiben and Wade don't
text: even react to what Miller has just done. Sarge is pissed.
text: He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: (under his breath so
dialog: only Miller can hear)
dialog: Damn fool.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Captain, he's fast!
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (glances at Sarge,
dialog: speaks to Reiben)
dialog: Glad of it.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
text: On the other side of the street,
text: crouches in a doorway with Jackson.
text: Upham is a bit in shock, less from
dialog: the nearness of the bullets than
dialog: from what Miller just did for him.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: DASHES across the street.
text: GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches
dialog: behind him.
text: HE MAKES IT across. Calls back to Sarge.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Bring 'em over.
text: UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Captain, I...
text: Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: One at a time.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-
text: runs down the block. He passes a:
speaker_heading: BOMBED OUT BUILDING
text: Out of the line of fire. A dozen
dialog: dead American soldiers lined up on
text: the ground. The battered, bloody
dialog: bodies, only partially covered by
dialog: ponchos.
text: Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.
text: Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sees the dead and wounded, shows no
dialog: reaction. Runs to:
speaker_heading: AN ALLEY
text: Captain Hamill and his men are bunched
text: there, out of the line of fire.
dialog: He's sending off a squad to continue
dialog: their door-to-door.
text: Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the
dialog: corners, one man close, one man wide. Be careful. Go.
text: The squad takes off. Captain Hamill sees Miller. The two
text: captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak
dialog: familiarly.
dialog: Captain hamill How was the road in?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We had a jeep until a few hours ago,
dialog: a nice one, it had a cute little
text: flag with a couple of stars on it.
dialog: Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.
text: One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We called in a strike on the eighty-
dialog: eights that took it out, but it's
dialog: the Kraut spotter that counts,
dialog: wherever the hell that bastard is.
text: Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant
text: chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.
dialog: Captain hamill That's where your boy is. We've been trying
dialog: to get him since this morning. He killed two of my men trying
text: to get close enough for a shot. Miller eyes the distant
dialog: steeple.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Jackson.
text: Jackson steps up. Miller points to the steeple. Jackson
dialog: knows what he's supposed to do. He puts down his M-1 and
text: takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to
dialog: his back.
text: He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and
text: methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very
dialog: unusual, long-barrel, rifle.
text: Miller and his men give him some room. Hamill and his men,
text: along with Upham, watch curiously.
text: Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,
text: sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it. Then he
text: takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it. He
text: adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action. Upham
dialog: is fascinated.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: What is that?
text: Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized
dialog: shell.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel
dialog: with dual-groove, parallel rifling,
text: elevated three-glass scope and a
dialog: single-throw hammer.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: The Army gave you that?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: You must be a hell a shot.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Not where I come from.
text: Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and
text: FIRES. Evaluates. Calibrates the scope. He re-loads.
text: Jackson FIRES AGAIN. Evaluates. Perfect. He wipes the
text: dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight
text: and waits, absolutely motionless.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: That must be four thousand yards.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (without taking his
dialog: eye from the scope)
dialog: Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: You take account of the wind?
text: Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks
dialog: back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you,
dialog: some kind of fucking idiot?" Reiben puts himself between
dialog: Upham and Jackson.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (put-on Southern accent)
dialog: Dang right, he take 'count of the
dialog: wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a
dialog: Kentucky windage?
text: Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the
dialog: trigger.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Reiben, how many time I got to tell
dialog: you, I'm from Tennessee.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: They got squirrels there, too, right?
text: Jackson FIRES. Waits. A tiny smile. He starts taking apart
text: the rifle. A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his
dialog: radioman. Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them
text: the St. Mere road is open.
text: The Radioman cranks up his radio. Captain Hamill turns to
dialog: Miller.
dialog: Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Very far, they're not coming this
dialog: way, they're going to take Caen first.
dialog: Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that. We're in a
dialog: lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it
dialog: gets better. How many men did you bring?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Five, but we not staying, we're on
dialog: our way to Ramelle.
dialog: Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private
dialog: Ryan?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yeah, you know about that?
dialog: Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in
dialog: with the early wounded or dead.
text: Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED
text: PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.
dialog: Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted
dialog: a German transmission after you left. The Krauts have two
dialog: companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,
dialog: they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Wonderful.
dialog: Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the
dialog: hell out of there before those Krauts show up.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: How do we get out of here?
dialog: Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in
dialog: real tight. After dark you try to slip out to the east. If
dialog: you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,
dialog: you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by
dialog: tomorrow night.
text: Miller processes the information. Captain Hamill shakes his
dialog: head.
dialog: Captain hamill Tough, huh? Three brothers?
dialog: Miller shrugs.
dialog: Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but
dialog: I understand what you're doing?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: Captain hamill Good luck.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: Captain hamill I mean it. Find him. Get him home.
text: Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful
text: sincerity. Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Let's find someplace to hole up.
text: Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head
text: of the alley, Miller passes Upham.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Sir, I'm sorry about what happened,
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: It was nothing.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: But you could have gotten killed and
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Like I said, it was nothing.
dialog: (to the men)
dialog: Don't bunch up.
text: He takes off, crouch-running back down the block. Upham
text: watches him go.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Did you see what he did, back there?
dialog: He stepped right into the open, so I
dialog: could get across.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Shit, that was no big deal.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: They can't kill him.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Like hell they can't.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Wade's right, it's some kind of
dialog: scientific, magnetic thing, I can't
dialog: explain it, but I've seen it.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: We all have, he's got nine lives, or
dialog: he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
text: The men are equal parts joking and admiring. Sarge is
dialog: neither.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: No one's bulletproof. No one.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: C'mon, stay low.
text: Sarge takes off after Miller.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - DUSK
text: Miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins
text: of a medieval church. Miller, settled into a comfortable
text: spot in the debris, eating his K-rations, looks very relaxed.
dialog: Reiben paces.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Captain, could you please explain
dialog: the math of this mission to me?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sure, what do you want to know?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms,
dialog: since when does six equal one? What's
dialog: the sense in risking six guys to
dialog: save one?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Ours is not to reason why.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick
dialog: up this kid, high-tail it back to
dialog: division, everything'll work out
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I'd much rather die in Caen than
dialog: Ramelle, sir. It's a personal thing.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Reiben, there's a fairly good chance
dialog: you're not going to die at all.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Easy for you to say, sir.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring
dialog: his fucking neck.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor
dialog: bastard's mother.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Hey, I got a mother. Jackson, you
dialog: got a mother?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Last I knew.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of
dialog: us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain
dialog: has a mother.
text: Miller smiles. Reiben eyes him and reconsiders.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Well, maybe not the Captain, but the
dialog: rest of us have mothers.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You have orders, too.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'd love to hear it.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is
dialog: a serious misallocation of valuable
dialog: military resources. Miller Go on.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Well, sir, by my way a thinkin' I am
text: a finely made instrument of warfare.
dialog: What I mean by that is, if you was
dialog: to put me with this here sniper rifle
dialog: anywhere up to and includin' one
dialog: mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear
text: line of sight, war's over.
dialog: Miller nods.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Reiben, I want you to listen closely
dialog: to Jackson. This is the way to gripe.
dialog: Jackson, continue.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Yes, sir. It seems to me, sir, that
dialog: the entire resources of the United
dialog: States Army oughta be dedicated to
dialog: one thing and one thing only, and
dialog: that is to put me and this here weapon
text: on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle
dialog: of Berlin, Germany. Now I ain't one
dialog: to question decisions made up on
dialog: high, sir, but it seems to me that
dialog: saving one private, no matter how
dialog: grievous the losses of his family,
dialog: is a waste of my God-given talent.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Wade?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Hell, I don't mind this mission,
dialog: sir, as long as there's something up
dialog: at Ramelle for...
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (finishing Wade's
dialog: sentence)
dialog: ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah,
dialog: we heard that.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Upham?
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Pass.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sarge?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: I'm just here to keep a bunch of
dialog: numb-nuts, including one certain,
dialog: frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate,
dialog: from getting themselves killed.
dialog: Reiben eyes Miller.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: And what about you, Captain?
text: Miller looks at Reiben, shocked.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Reiben, what's the matter with you?
dialog: I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain.
text: There's a chain of command. Griping
dialog: goes one way, up, only up, never
dialog: down. You gripe to me, I gripe to
dialog: my superior officers. Up, get it?
dialog: I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe
dialog: in front of you. How long you been
dialog: in the army?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But if you weren't a captain, or if
dialog: I were a major, what would you say?
dialog: Miller considers his response.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: In that case, I would say this is an
dialog: excellent mission, with an extremely
dialog: valuable objective, worthy of my
dialog: best efforts.
text: Reiben rolls his eyes. Miller plays it straight, with no
dialog: obvious sarcasm.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: In addition, as I pointed out earlier,
dialog: I have a fondness for cheese and I
dialog: hope to have the opportunity to sample
dialog: some of the Ramelle products, when
dialog: we arrive there, to see if they live
dialog: up to their excellent reputation.
dialog: Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
dialog: for the mother of Private James Ryan
dialog: and I'm more than willing to lay
dialog: down my life, and the lives of my
dialog: men, especially you, Reiben, to help
dialog: relieve her suffering. The men
dialog: thoroughly enjoy the performance.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Sir, if you were not a captain, I
dialog: would compliment you, now, for being
dialog: an excellent liar.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: But I am a captain. If I were not a
dialog: captain, I would thank you for the
dialog: compliment and tell you that the
dialog: ability to lie comes from being a
dialog: top-notch poker player, which I am,
dialog: having learned at the side of my
dialog: mother who is, by popular acclaim,
dialog: the best poker player in...
text: The men all learn forward expectantly, believing they're
text: about to find out Miller's home town. Miller smiles.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...my home town, which shall remain
dialog: un-named.
text: The men ease back, disappointed.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Any further thoughts on the subject?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like
dialog: to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle,
dialog: fuck the cheese capital of France
dialog: and while we're at it, fuck Private
dialog: James Ryan.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'll make a note of your suggestions
dialog: but I'll leave that last one to you,
dialog: especially if he's already dead.
text: The men wince and laugh. Miller checks his watch and gets
dialog: serious.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We move out in two hours, try and
dialog: get some sleep.
dialog: The men know when to can it. Without another word, they all
text: settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to
text: follow Miller's order. Upham looks around at these strange
text: men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow
dialog: suit.
text: Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his
text: flashlight. He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,

text: Dark. ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE. Reiben, Jackson,
text: Wade and Upham sleep. Miller still sits in the glow of his
text: flashlight, studying his maps. Sarge lies near him, awake,
text: watching him. Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in
text: Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You ever going to open those letters?
text: Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: It's not normal, not reading letters
dialog: from home.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Since when have things been normal?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You got me. Afraid of bad news?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Good news?
text: Miller looks at Sarge. A moment passes between the two of
text: them, then miller takes refuge in the maps. Sarge looks at
dialog: the men.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You think they'll be alright?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: They're fine. As long as they can
dialog: gripe, they'll be alright.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: And what about you?
text: Miller considers the question, doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: They guys here aren't going to be
dialog: able to hold out until battalion
dialog: shows up.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Command isn't going to let them
dialog: withdraw and the Germans sure as
dialog: hell aren't going to let them
dialog: surrender.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Three for three.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: If we stayed, we could make a
dialog: difference.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You're kidding yourself.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You never know.
text: They sit in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Now you're the one kidding yourself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hell of a mission.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yup, hell of a mission.
text: Miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Rise and shine, boys. Let's go.
text: Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their
dialog: gear.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. MERE STREET - NIGHT
text: SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village. DISTANT ARTILLERY
text: BOOMS. Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral
text: toward the outskirts of town. They're just a small squad,
text: but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are
dialog: very formidable-looking.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
text: Miller's men are getting ready to move out. Captain Hamill
text: and a few of his men are there to see them off. Suddenly:
text: A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON
text: Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT. The sky is on fire. The
text: AIR TREMBLES. A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the
text: countryside like a tidal wave.
text: Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.
text: IT'S A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE. The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY
dialog: is incredible, strange, other-worldly.
text: EVERY MAN THERE IS TRANSFIXED.
text: Frozen in place. The lights play on their faces.
text: MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.
text: SARGE notices, says nothing.
text: MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop. Their eyes
dialog: go back to the BLAZING SKY.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: (awe-struck)
dialog: Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It doesn't take this.
text: Upham's face shows more fear than awe.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I wasn't made for this.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: You think the rest of us were?
text: Upham recoils. Miller instantly regrets his words. He turns
text: to Upham and sees that he's really scared. Miller get a
text: hold of himself and speaks gently.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Don't worry, Upham, God'll protect
dialog: you, this shit's gonna keep him up
dialog: all night, anyway.
text: Upham manages a slight smile. Miller watches the lights for
text: a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Let's go, this ain't what they pay
dialog: us for.
text: Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it. He points
dialog: the way.
text: Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a
text: gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until
dialog: you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods.
text: As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to
text: move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private
dialog: who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up
text: with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo. He offers them to
dialog: Reiben.
dialog: Gentle-faced private Here.
text: Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-
text: ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's
text: vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.
dialog: Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at
dialog: Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.
text: Reiben takes the ammo.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Just what I need.
text: Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands
text: them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Thanks, but you may need these more
dialog: than us, or Ryan.
text: Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes
dialog: the ammo back.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Let's move out.
text: Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,
text: lit intermittently by the distant flashes. Captain Hamill
text: and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a
dialog: strange bit of hope.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT
text: The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away. The
text: night is dark. The band of six Americans makes their way
text: warily along a French cart path. Sarge eases up alongside
text: Miller and speaks quietly to him. The others don't overhear.
dialog: Sarge How long's your hand been shaking?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: A couple of weeks. It started in
dialog: Portsmouth when they brought us down
dialog: for loading.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Is it getting worse?
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: No. It comes and goes. It stops
dialog: when I look at it.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You may have to find yourself a new
dialog: line of work, this one doesn't seem
dialog: to agree with you anymore.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'll be alright.
text: Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk
dialog: on.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)
text: Farther along. The men are tired but alert. Jackson is at
text: point. Miller behind him. The others at intervals. Sarge
text: brings up the rear.
text: A SOUND. Jackson stops. No one speaks, they communicate
dialog: only with hand signals.
text: JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.
text: MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path. They ease
text: into the brush. An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY
speaker_heading: MEN appear.
text: REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission
text: to open up. Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them
text: go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the
text: bend. Fifty men. Heavily armed. REIBEN breathes a sigh of
dialog: relief and lowers hi B.A.R.
text: THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet
text: from the faces of the hidden Americans. Upham is wide-eyed
text: with fear. The others are stone-faced.
text: THE GERMANS PASS.
text: MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.
text: UPHAM doesn't see the signal. He stands, breathing a sigh
text: of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing
text: the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.
text: UPHAM FREEZES. He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly
text: exposed. Shitting bricks.
text: Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire. The Whip-tail squad
dialog: approaches.
text: Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in
text: the shadows. They walk on and disappear. Upham is weak-
text: kneed, amazed that he's still alive.
text: MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the
text: rest of the men to follow him into the woods. Upham scurries
text: after Miller, staying close on his heels.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
text: The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,
text: parallel to a cart path. Wary.
text: Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each
text: other. He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and
text: motions curtly for them to open it up a bit. They do so.
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT
text: Dark. FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY. Miller checks the map as
text: Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional
text: signs. One of them reads: "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts
text: away the map. Checks the horizon. The first glow of dawn
text: is visible.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It'll be light, soon. Let's pick it
dialog: up.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN
text: First light. The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by
text: the CHIRPING OF BIRDS. The Americans are taking five.
text: Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at
text: the view. It's lovely. Dew shimmers on the long grass.
text: The war is far away.
text: Upham walks next to him. They look out at the view together
text: without speaking for a moment.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: It looks like a Renoir.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth
dialog: Symphony, The Normandy?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I've been humming it.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I heard.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It seemed appropriate.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: You know classical music?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Some.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Where are you from, Captain?
dialog: Miller smiles.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What's the pool up to?
text: Upham smiles, caught.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Over three-hundred.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'll tell you what, if I'm still
dialog: alive when it hits five-hundred,
dialog: I'll let you know and we'll split
dialog: the money.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: If that's the way you feel, why don't
dialog: we wait until it's up to a thousand.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I don't expect to live that long.
text: Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Five hundred, then.
text: Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to
text: feel an overwhelming wave of sadness. Then he turns himself
text: back into a commander and barks at Upham.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Let's go, private.
text: Miller strides away. Upham watches him, trying to figure
text: him out, then he simply follows him.
scene_heading: EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN
text: The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by
text: war. Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is
text: lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,
dialog: hundred of years old.
text: Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD. He motions to the men. They
text: advance. Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.
text: An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to
text: this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and
text: a boy, no more than ten. His animals, a pair of cows and a
text: draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.
text: A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with
text: empty shell casings around his body.
text: Miller and his men approach carefully. Miller motions to
text: Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks
text: gently to him in French.
text: The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance. Upham stands
dialog: and translates.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Five nights ago, he found this
text: paratrooper caught in a tree with a
text: broken leg. The leg got infected.
dialog: Last night he went to Ville Cholet
dialog: to get a doctor. The doctor refused
dialog: to come and when he got back, this
dialog: is what he found. The Krauts must
dialog: have shown up while he was gone.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Did he see any sign of them?
text: Upham gently asks. The FARMER ANSWERS.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: No, but he heard firing, just east,
dialog: less that a kilometer.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Thank him and tell him we're sorry
dialog: about his loss.
text: Miller heads off without glancing back. The men hesitate.
text: Sarge jerks his head for them to move out. They do so.
text: Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his
text: hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.
scene_heading: EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY
text: A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass. The last
text: of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.
text: The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the
dialog: edge of the field.
text: Miller notices something. He silently signals stop, crouches
text: and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.
text: Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him. Jackson points to
text: some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with
dialog: bullets.
text: Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Captain.
dialog: Staying low, they join Wade who has found:
speaker_heading: TWO DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPERS
text: A trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field.
scene_heading: MILLER, SARGE AND JACKSON
text: Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow. The
text: others crawl up behind them.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
text: In the shadow by those two trees.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: My guess, too.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: A machine gun.
text: Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover
text: of the brush. He stands and takes off his pack.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Sir, I've got an idea, let's go
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We can't leave it here.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: We left them eighty-eights.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: They don't send planes to put out
dialog: machine guns.
dialog: (beat)
text: Two flank runners with surpressing
dialog: fire. I'm going right, whoever goes
dialog: left has to be fast.
text: Upham steels himself and steps forward.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
text: Miller takes Upham's measure. Wade laughs with a sneer.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: How fast?
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Twenty-four-five.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty-
dialog: two flat.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Wade goes left.
text: Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear. Upham is
dialog: impressed.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Twenty-two flat?
text: Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I would have won the states if some
dialog: bastard hadn't tripped me in the
dialog: finals.
text: Miller points the others to their firing positions.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sarge, Upham, here. Jackson, Reiben,
text: ten yards, either side.
text: As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly,
text: out of earshot of the men.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Rule of thumb, Captain, says you
dialog: ought to detail this one, instead of
dialog: going yourself.
text: Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yeah? What rule of thumb is that?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: How about I go right, sir?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: How about you take your position?
text: Sarge hesitates.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: How about...?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: How about you shut up and take your
dialog: position?
dialog: Sarge nods.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Sarge finds a spot. Miller joins Wade. Miller waits near
text: Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Good luck, Captain.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got
dialog: five lives.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: The men said, nine.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What do they know?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I had nine, but I feel through the
dialog: ice when I was seven, my brother
dialog: pulled me out. Then I used one when
dialog: a grenade landed in my foxhole in
dialog: Sicily, it was a dud. I figure one
text: on the beaches, one on the cliffs
dialog: and two getting here.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: That only leaves three.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Plenty.
text: Miller sees that the men are in position. He nods to Wade.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Miller and Wade take deep breaths. Miller Now.
text: MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS.
text: Onto opposite sides of the field. Nothing happens for a
dialog: moment. Then:
text: A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP. MURDEROUSLY LOUD.
text: SHATTERING THE QUIET.
speaker_heading: IN THE NEST
text: A squad of Germans, dug deep, BLASTING
text: THE MACHINE GUN, a BIG SCHWARZLOSE
text: 8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon.
dialog: Four Germans in the nest, four more
text: outlying riflemen.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Takes the FIRST FIRE. He HITS THE
text: DIRT. The BULLETS SCREAM just over
dialog: him.
text: THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS TOWARD WADE MILLER JUMPS UP AND SPRINTS
dialog: WADE HITS THE DIRT
text: The BULLETS GRAZE the back of his helmet.
speaker_heading: SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON, UPHAM
text: Zero the machine gun. FIRE fast as they can. Their BULLETS
text: THUD INEFFECTUALLY into the hedgerow.
text: THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS BACK TOWARD MILLER WADE JUMPS UP AND
text: SPRINTS MILLER HITS THE DIRT
text: Bullets SMASH into the ground all around Miller.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: FIRES A LONG BURST from his Thompson.
dialog: No effect. Pissed. POPS THE CLIP.
text: SLAMS in another. FIRES.
text: THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS FROM MILLER
text: He rises and runs. Fast. Almost to the far hedgerow.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: Ten more yards. Too slow. A deadly
text: row of BULLETS KICK UP DIRT toward
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Makes it to the far side. Scrambles
text: up the roots. Dives through the
dialog: brush.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: On a slight rise. Can't hit the
text: dirt. A line of bullets. Desperately
dialog: sprints.
text: WADE IS HIT. HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY. He spins.
dialog: Goes down.
text: SARGE, UPHAM AND THE OTHERS are horrified. FIRE at the nest.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: STRUGGLES through the hedgerow.
text: Stumbles onto the path. Rolls to
text: his feet, running. Swings his
text: Thompson into firing position. Racing
dialog: toward the nest.
text: SARGE AND THE OTHERS POUR FIRE at the nest.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Tearing along the path. Sees a German
scene_heading: rifleman. FIRES A BURST. CUTS HIM
text: DOWN. Runs over the body without
dialog: breaking stride.
text: SARGE STEPS INTO THE OPEN, INTENTIONALLY DRAWING THE GERMAN
dialog: FIRE from Miller.
text: The GERMANS ZERO SARGE. BULLETS THUD all around him. Somehow
dialog: he's not hit.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: TEARS THROUGH THE TREES. BLASTS his
dialog: Thompson. CUTS DOWN two more German
text: riflemen. Grabs a grenade. Pulls
dialog: the pin.
speaker_heading: THE NEST
text: The Germans see Miller coming. Wheel
dialog: from Sarge. Too late.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: THROWS the grenade, VEERS and DIVES.
text: THE GRENADE EXPLODES. The four Germans in the nest are
speaker_heading: KILLED.
text: SARGE hollers to the others.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: HOLD YOUR FIRE!
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Rolls to his feet. FIRE another
text: BURST. KILLS the last of the German
text: riflemen. Doesn't pause. RUNS onto
dialog: the field.
speaker_heading: SARGE AND THE OTHERS
text: See Miller running toward Wade. They instantly RACE onto
dialog: the field.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: Lies in the grass. Holding his belly.
text: Astonished by the pain.
speaker_heading: ALL THE AMERICANS RUN
text: Converging on Wade. Miller points, and yells, without slowing
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: MILLER
scene_heading: REIBEN, UPHAM, PERIMETER! COVER!
speaker_heading: REIBEN AND UPHAM
dialog: Stop instantly. Turn toward the
dialog: perimeter of the field.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Roots through his medical kit as he
text: runs. Dropping and scattering
text: inessentials behind him.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: Wide-eyed. Not even writhing. Too
dialog: much pain.
dialog: MILLER AND SARGE GET TO WADE
text: Throw themselves onto the ground next to him. They both
text: tear out sulfa-packs. Sarge frantically fumbles. Ripping
text: one open. Powder spills.
text: REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Pulls Wade's hands from the wound.
dialog: Pours sulfa powder.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: About to pour his sulfa. Sees the
text: wound. Stops. Knows it's fatal.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Damn it!
text: Throws the sulfa aside. Quickly pulls out a morphine pack.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Fumbles with a second sulfa bag.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Sulfa, more sulfa...
speaker_heading: WADE
text: Frozen in agony. Looks at Miller.
text: Sees him preparing the morphine shot.
dialog: They both know.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah...morphine...make it a
dialog: double...huh...Captain...?
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck.
text: Thick vein. Pumps the morphine
text: straight to Wade's brain. Motions
dialog: impatiently to Sarge.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: More morphine, hurry up, come on,
dialog: come on...
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa.
text: Fumbles in his pack. Finds the
dialog: morphine.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Snatches the morphine from Sarge.
text: Quickly and efficiently prepares a
dialog: second shot. He's done this before.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
text: On guard, glancing back. Pissed
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Freaked out. Trying to keep his
text: eyes on the perimeter. Can't.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Watching.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Gives Wade the second shot.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: Feels the effects of the first shot.
text: He sees Upham and manages a pained
dialog: smile.
text: WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER. Looking at him without blame,
text: without forgiveness. Drifts with the morphine. Then: WADE
speaker_heading: DIES
dialog: ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE
text: UPHAM begins to weep.
scene_heading: REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS:
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Is silent. Motionless. He gently
text: closes Wade's eyes. His hand quivers
text: slightly as he unclips one of Wades
text: dogtags. He fumbles and drops it.
text: Sarge notices.
text: Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men
text: see. He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.
text: Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,
text: rises and picks up his Thompson.
text: Upham shakes his head.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: That was no twenty-two flat.
text: Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: He lied. Let's move out.
text: Miller turns and walks away without looking back. The men
text: hesitate, then slowly follow him.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY
text: A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel.
text: The five G.I.'s walk, spread out.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him,
dialog: just fuck the goddamned son-of-a-
dialog: bitch.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Shut up, will you?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: You shut up, this is the most fucked
dialog: up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned
dialog: Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: The hell he didn't.
text: Miller motions to them curtly.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Keep it down.
text: They shut up. Miller falls in step to Sarge. Speaks quietly,
dialog: the men don't hear.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We've got to find someplace to hole
dialog: up for a bit.
text: Sarge looks at Miller closely.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Let's just find someplace.
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW GULLY - DAY
text: Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully. A good
dialog: hiding place.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Rest. One hour. Jackson, Reiben,
dialog: perimeter. Keep your eyes open.
dialog: I'm going to re-con.
text: Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but
text: there's something missing. It's subtle. Only Sarge notices.
text: He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY
text: Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops. The
text: life drains from him. He stands there, looking at the dirt,
text: tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for
text: faint, distant voices. His face shows a battle raging within,
text: as he fights to keep from losing it entirely. Behind him,
text: Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches. Miller
text: senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a
text: thousand miles away. Sarge sits down on a log and waits.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What was the name of that kid at
dialog: Anzio, the one who got his face burned
dialog: off?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Vecchio.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember
dialog: his name, he was a good kid, remember
dialog: how he used to walk on his hands and
dialog: sing that song about the man on flying
dialog: trapeze?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You know why I'm such a good officer?
dialog: Because of my mother. Have I ever
dialog: told you about her?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Bits and pieces.

dialog: She's the best poker player you ever
dialog: saw. My father used to go to these
dialog: Saturday night games and lose his
dialog: shirt. Finally, my mother gave him
dialog: an ultimatum, either she gets a
dialog: regular seat at the table or she
dialog: locks him in every Saturday night.
dialog: He squawked and so did his buddies
dialog: but after a while they gave in and
dialog: from the first night she sat down,
dialog: she never lost. She could read those
dialog: cocky bastards like they were playing
dialog: open hands. And he bluffs? He had
dialog: sixteen levels of bullshit. Her
dialog: eyes, the tone of her voice, her
dialog: bets, her jokes, the way she sipped
dialog: her coffee, she was a master. She
dialog: won more money on shit hands than
dialog: anyone in the history of the game.
dialog: Every Saturday night, my father would
dialog: lose two, three hundred bucks and
dialog: she'd win it all back and then some.
dialog: And I'd stand there, glued to her
dialog: shoulder, from the time I was five
dialog: years old, watching every hand, every
dialog: move, studying how she did it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's why I'm such a good officer,
dialog: I can look at a man's face and tell
dialog: you exactly what he's holding, and
dialog: if it's a shit hand, I know just
dialog: what cards to deal him.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: And what about your own hand?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: No problem. A pair of deuces? Less?
dialog: So what? I bluff. It used to tear
dialog: me apart when I'd get one of my men
dialog: killed, but what was I supposed to
dialog: do? Break down in front of the ones
dialog: who were standing there waiting for
dialog: me to tell them what to do? Of course
dialog: not, so I bluffed, and after a while,
dialog: I started to fall for my own bluff.
dialog: It was great, it made everything so
dialog: much easier. Sarge Is that why your
dialog: hand's been shaking?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It could be worse. You know the
dialog: first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?
dialog: Lie to your men.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Not in so many words, but they tell
dialog: you you can have all the firepower
dialog: in the world and if your men don't
dialog: have good morale, it's not worth a
dialog: damn. So if you're scared or empty
dialog: or half-a-step from a Section Eight,
dialog: do you tell your men? Of course
dialog: not. You bluff, you lie.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: And how do you bluff yourself?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Simple, numbers. Every time you
dialog: kill one of your men, you tell
dialog: yourself you just saved the lives of
dialog: two, three, ten, a hundred others.
dialog: We lost, what, thirty-one on the
dialog: cliffs? I'll bet we saved ten times
dialog: that number by putting out those
dialog: guns. That's over three hundred
text: men. Maybe five hundred. A thousand.
dialog: Then thousand. Any number you want.
dialog: See? It's simple. It lets you always
dialog: choose mission over men.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Except this time, the mission IS a
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's the rub. I liked Wade. Who's
dialog: Ryan? If they're both standing in
dialog: front of me and I have to shoot one
dialog: or the other, how do I choose? Look
dialog: at my hand, there it goes again.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: John, I've got to tell you, I think
dialog: you're about used up.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I think you're right, Keith.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You want me to take over?
text: The question helps Miller pull himself back together. He
text: looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: No, but if I get any worse, you'll
dialog: have to relieve me.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Just what I want to do.
text: They share a smile.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You know Wade was the eleventh of
dialog: the twelve, you're the last one still
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Don't let yourself get killed, if
dialog: you do, they might make me give back
dialog: the medal and then I won't be able
dialog: to lip off to colonels anymore.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: I'll do my best.
text: They shake their heads at the madness of it all. Miller
dialog: Hell of a...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Ah, forget it.
text: Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting
dialog: himself. He's about ninety-five percent there.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Thanks for drawing that machine gun
dialog: off me.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You're welcome, John.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: But, that's my personal brand of
dialog: stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary
dialog: about it, if you do it again, you're
dialog: busted.
text: Sarge allows himself a slight smile.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow. They head back
dialog: to the men.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING - DAY
text: The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.
text: No talk. Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing.
text: Miller barks at the men.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Up. We're moving out.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I thought you said we had an hour,
dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Well now I'm saying we're moving
dialog: out. Get off your ass.
text: The men get up. Jackson is a bit slow.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What the hell's the matter with you,
dialog: Jackson?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on
dialog: account of Wade.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Who's Wade?
dialog: No one responds.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I said, who the hell is Wade?
text: The men exchange looks. Jackson speaks for them.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Sir, I understand what you're doin',
dialog: but I respectfully request permission
dialog: to grieve in my own manner.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You'll grieve the way I tell you to
dialog: goddamned grieve. There is no Wade,
dialog: there was one, but he died a long
dialog: time ago, he's been dead for so long
dialog: you can hardly remember his name,
dialog: you understand?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Sir, I understand. I don't like it,
dialog: but I understand.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Good, now get your goddamned gear.
text: The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out.
text: Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look. Miller shakes his
dialog: head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit
dialog: to work. He knows they have no choice.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY
text: Miller and his men walk along the road. The men are silent,
dialog: grim.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY
text: Miller checks his map. figures out where they are. Folds
text: up the map, points the way and they move out.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY
text: More progress. The men are still grim.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: You know what the best possible thing
dialog: that could happen is?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get
dialog: lockjaw, never say another word as
dialog: long as you live.
dialog: Miller laughs. Miller I'll bite, Reiben.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I've given this a lot of thought,
dialog: sir. The best thing that could happen
dialog: is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Well, sir, consider the possibilities.
dialog: A: Ryan is alive. We have to take
dialog: him back to the beach. Knowing you,
dialog: you don't let him carry my gear,
dialog: even though he really should, and we
dialog: all get killed, trying to keep him
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Except for the last part, that one's
dialog: not bad.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: B: Ryan is dead. He's been blown
dialog: up by the German equivalent of Wade,
dialog: whose name I know you don't want me
dialog: to mention. There's nothing to find.
text: The biggest piece is the size of a
text: pea. We wander around, looking for
dialog: him until the Germans pick us off,
dialog: one after another.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I don't like that one.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Neither do I, sir. C: And this is
dialog: the worst one, we find Ryan and he's
dialog: wounded. Not only does he not carry
dialog: my gear, we have to carry his gear.
dialog: And him.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: But we accomplish the mission.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Maybe. But what if he dies on the
dialog: way back? you see what I'm saying,
dialog: sir? The best possible situation
dialog: is, he's dead, we find his body,
dialog: more or less intact, we grab one of
text: his dog-tags and high-tail it back
dialog: to the beach, or better yet, we head
dialog: over to Caen and catch up with
dialog: division.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Has anyone ever told you, you're
dialog: officer material?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's a mystery to me.
text: No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY
text: The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING. Miller checks a map in the brush
text: near the crossroads. A sign reads: "Ramelle 3 Km." Miller
text: folds up the map.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Looks like we're going to beat those
dialog: Kraut companies to Ramelle.
text: Suddenly Miller stops dead. He listens, hearing something
text: the others don't hear. He motions for them to freeze, they
text: do. The SOUND grows louder. It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I don't think so.
scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY
text: THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY. Troop
text: trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack
text: Wehrmacht troops. Heavily armed. Imposing. Crossing a
dialog: bridge.
text: CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL
text: Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.
text: Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.
speaker_heading: GERMAN FLANK SQUADS
dialog: Hurry along the fields on either
text: side of the road, trying to keep up
text: with the vehicles. MILLER AND HIS
text: MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching
dialog: German Flank Squad. They flatten
text: themselves into the mucky water.
dialog: Ready their weapons. Prepare to
dialog: fire.
speaker_heading: THE GERMAN SQUAD
text: Approaches the bridge.
speaker_heading: PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES
text: See the culvert obscured by brush. Move to check it out.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Is just about to open up on them.
speaker_heading: THE GERMAN SERGEANT
text: Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind
dialog: and CALLS to them.
speaker_heading: THE GERMAN PRIVATES
dialog: Obey. Hurry after the rest of the
dialog: convoy.
speaker_heading: IN THE CULVERT
dialog: The Americans breathe again.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I wonder where they're going.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Same place we are.
text: Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast
text: is clear. They head out.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY
text: A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,
text: cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone
text: walls. The twos is visible beyond.
text: Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the
text: stone walls. Miller pulls out his binoculars.
text: ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD
text: There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Looks like tea time, maybe they're
dialog: Brits.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I sure hope so.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: What do you think they're waiting
dialog: for, Captain?
text: Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more
text: threatening that that of the convoy. The sound gets LOUDER
text: and LOUDER. Miller and his men exchange looks. They know
dialog: that sound, they don't like it.
scene_heading: FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS
text: Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who
text: greet them enthusiastically. The tanks are tigers, huge,
dialog: far bigger than an American Sherman. Each one, sixty-two
text: tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and
text: impregnable armor. Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.
dialog: There are four of them.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Puts away the binoculars and jerks
text: his head for his men to follow, low,
text: along the wall. The men are happy
text: to do so, looking back nervously at
dialog: the German tanks.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY
text: The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE. The town square is
text: a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell
text: casings and bodies, German and American and a few French
text: civilians. Miller and his men enter the square, weapons
text: ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.
text: Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging
text: debris. They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of
dialog: the firing.
text: Sarge motions his guess. Miller nods in agreement. He
dialog: signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the
dialog: firing.
text: They move on, dashing from cover to cover.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY
text: A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC
text: FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near
text: the bridgehead. The bridge has clearly been the scene of
text: heavy fighting. Craters, burning debris and shell casings
text: are everywhere. The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.
text: There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on
text: both sides of the bridge.
speaker_heading: MILLER AND HIS MEN
text: Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the
dialog: bridge.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Looks like they've been having a
dialog: hell of a party, here, Captain.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: ON THE BRIDGE! WE'RE COMING IN.
text: A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back.
speaker_heading: VOICE FROM BRIDGE
speaker_heading: KISS MY ASS, FRITZ.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: YOU FIRE AT US AND I'LL DO A HELL OF
text: A LOT MORE THAN THAT.
speaker_heading: VOICE FROM BRIDGE
dialog: WHO WON THE '38 ARMY-NAVY GAME?
text: Miller turns to his men. They all come up empty.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA. HERE WE
speaker_heading: COME.
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: Cover me.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: What if our guys open up, sir?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You're only allowed to shoot at
dialog: Germans, that's one of the rules.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Have it your way, Captain.
text: Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward
dialog: the bridge.
scene_heading: THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP
text: Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller.
speaker_heading: MILLER'S MEN
text: POUR FIRE at the German positions,
text: SURPRESSING THE GERMAN FIRE.
speaker_heading: ON THE BRIDGE
text: The Paratroopers pour a HEAVY STREAM
text: OF BULLETS at the German positions.
text: Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive
text: jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.
text: He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the
text: young but grizzled voice that called out. With Forrest are
text: some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS. Miller
dialog: catches his breath. Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to
text: nineteen. They won on a field goal in overtime.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'll keep it in mind.
dialog: (calls to Sarge)
text: OKAY, SARGE, ONE AT A TIME.
text: Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as
text: they come in. Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.
dialog: Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to
dialog: hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Things are tough all over. We're
dialog: looking for a Private James Ryan.
dialog: Forrest Ryan?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Is he here?
text: Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.
dialog: Forrest Go get Ryan.
speaker_heading: (TO MILLER)
dialog: What do you want him for, sir?
text: Miller doesn't answer. Jackson leaps over the barricade and
text: scrambles to them.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Jackson, get a hold of command.
text: Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five. Miller turns to
dialog: Forrest.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: How many men do you have?
text: They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men
text: to leap over the barricade.
dialog: Forrest Eleven, sir. We started with thirty-six. The bridge
dialog: was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us
dialog: ever since. They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.
text: Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's
text: hailing I.D. No response.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Keep trying.
dialog: Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?
text: Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:
speaker_heading: PRIVATE JAMES RYAN
text: Dashing from cover to cover, making
text: his way toward them. Ryan is an
dialog: American classic, nineteen years
text: old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky.
text: Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and
text: smeared with dirt and blood, he's
text: very alive. His eyes shine, his
dialog: face has a spark. You can't help
dialog: but love this kid.
speaker_heading: MILLER'S MEN
text: All watch Ryan run toward them.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: So, that's Ryan.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
text: Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the
text: barricade. He salutes Miller.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I'm Ryan, sir. You wanted to see
dialog: me?
text: Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally
text: face-to-face with him. Ryan waits. Miller hesitates,
text: searching for words. Then he speaks gently but clearly.
dialog: Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you. Your brothers
dialog: have been killed in action.
text: The life instantly drains from Ryan. His breath comes hard.
text: Somehow he remains upright.
dialog: Ryan All three?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yes.
text: Ryan sways. Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning
text: him against some sandbags.
speaker_heading: THE PARATROOPERS
text: Are stunned at the news. They look
dialog: at Ryan, there's nothing else they
dialog: can do.
speaker_heading: MILLER'S MEN
dialog: Also look at Ryan, but then, one
text: after another, they turn away,
text: adverting their eyes, looking a their
text: own boots, the debris on the bridge,
dialog: the sky, anything other than Ryan.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We've been sent to get you out of
dialog: here. You're going home.
text: Ryan weakly waves Miller off. Miller motions to his men and
text: the paratroopers to move away. They do so, giving Ryan a
dialog: little room.
dialog: Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sergeant, we're moving out and I'm
dialog: taking you and your men with me.
dialog: Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this
dialog: bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-
dialog: ninth Division.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'm giving you new orders, Sergeant.
dialog: Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'm not going to leave you and your
dialog: men here to get killed. Get them
dialog: together, we're moving out.
text: A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.
speaker_heading: RYAN (O.S.)
dialog: No, sir.
text: They all turn and see Ryan standing there. Miller is about
dialog: to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting
text: him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on
text: the arm and speaks softly to him.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Come on, Private, you're going home.
text: Ryan jerks away from Miller.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No, sir.
text: All eyes are on Miller and Ryan. Miller remains patient.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Private. I'm sorry about your
dialog: brothers but staying here and getting
dialog: yourself killed isn't going to help.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sir, if the Krauts are holding this
dialog: bridge when division shows up, our
dialog: guys are going to be sitting ducks.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: This bridge cannot be held. The
dialog: Germans have two companies less than
dialog: three miles from here. They have
dialog: tanks.
text: That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,
dialog: but Ryan holds his ground. Ryan Sir, I'm still not going.
text: Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Private, if you want to commit
dialog: suicide, that's your choice, but
dialog: you're going to have to wait until
dialog: after I get you back to the beach.
dialog: And you're not going to take these
dialog: men with you.
text: Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm not leaving, sir.
text: Miller starts to boil over.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: The hell you aren't, you're comin'
dialog: with me if I have to drag you every
dialog: inch of the way. You hear me,
dialog: Private?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
text: Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him. Ryan doesn't
dialog: resist.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Listen you little son-of-a-bitch
dialog: you're coming with me or
dialog: I'll...I'll...
text: Ryan speaks softly.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What are you going to do, sir, shoot
dialog: me?
text: Miller considers it. Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind
dialog: Miller.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (politely)
dialog: Uh, excuse me, Captain.
text: Miller slowly turns and glares.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So, what are a few tanks, sir?
text: Miller's more amazed than pissed off. Reiben smiles.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: He's right, we can't shoot him...well,
dialog: we could but we'd get in an enormous
dialog: amount of trouble. And he's right
dialog: about the bridge, it's a hell of a
dialog: lot more important than he is.
text: JACKSON STEPS FORWARD.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Cap'n...?
text: Miller turns his glare on Jackson.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Seems to me, we got us a opportunity,
dialog: here, to kill two birds with one
dialog: stone. Command seems to think keepin'
dialog: this boy alive is worth somethin'.
dialog: If we was to do that and hold this
dialog: bridge, good chance we'd get us a
dialog: bucket full of medals. I might even
dialog: get me one 'a them big, fancy ones
dialog: like you got, so's I could sass any
dialog: officer in the whole dang army, you
dialog: included.
text: Miller does a slow burn.
speaker_heading: UPHAM STEPS FORWARD
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You don't count.
speaker_heading: SARGE STEPS UP
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: I do and personally, I'd rather get
dialog: the hell out of here, but somebody's
dialog: got to stay and take care of you and
dialog: these pin-head privates of yours.
text: Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS.
dialog: Forrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir.
text: Reiben smiles.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: See, Captain? The vote's unanimous.
text: Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head. Miller The vote?
dialog: What the hell are you talking about? We don't vote. This
dialog: isn't a democracy. This is the army, I give orders, you
dialog: follow them. We don't vote!
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely
dialog: speaking hypothetically. IF this
dialog: was a voting situation, then the
dialog: vote would have been unanimous. But
dialog: of course, it's not a voting
dialog: situation, you're the captain, and
dialog: you give the orders, sir.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You're goddamned right, I give the
dialog: order. Vote! Jesus Christ! Listen
dialog: to me, you little pissant pieces of
dialog: shit, I am the ranking officer here
dialog: and what I say goes, is that clear?
text: They all quickly nod.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Of course, sir.
dialog: All the others Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
text: Miller looks from face to face.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: In that case...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I vote we stay.
dialog: That's what they wanted to hear. Miller doesn't give them
text: time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Reiben, the B.A.R., there. Jackson,
dialog: get up on the bridgekeepers hut with
dialog: your sniper rifle. Sarge, you and
dialog: Upham move that machine gun so it
dialog: can cover the left flank, it's
dialog: worthless where it is. Forrest, I
dialog: want a full inventory of all your
text: weapons, ammo and ordnance. Go.
text: They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller
dialog: for a moment.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (gruffly gentle)
dialog: Yeah, yeah. I want you right next
dialog: to me, no matter where I go, you
dialog: understand?
text: Ryan salutes.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Alright, come with me.
text: Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check
text: the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
text: Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other
text: paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory.
text: Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon
dialog: grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy
dialog: guns and about sixty rounds per man.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's it?
text: Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Sir, can I change my vote?
text: Miller sighs, worried.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT - DAY
text: Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a
text: crescent of sandbags. His eye is at his scope. He FIRES.
speaker_heading: A GERMAN SNIPER
text: Falls from a window on the edge of
dialog: town, dead.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
text: Sits beside Jackson with a pair of
text: binoculars, searching for another
text: target. The German sniper fire has
dialog: subsided for now. Ext. bridge - day
text: Miller watches as Ryan and several
text: other paratroopers dig a series of
text: trenches across the street, leading
dialog: to the bridge.
text: Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan.
text: Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head. He speaks
text: to Sarge who holds several satchel charges.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sarge, see what you can do to make
dialog: those buildings inhospitable.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Just then they hear the sound of A BIG GUN FIRING IN THE
text: DISTANCE. They all turn at the sound.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Eighty-eights, right?
dialog: Miller nods.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I can tell what the gunners had for
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Those guns are close.
text: Forrest Just south of town. The Krauts have a two gun
dialog: emplacement, we saw it on the way in. That's how we knew
dialog: they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out
dialog: of us.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Let's hope they don't change their
dialog: mind.
text: Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING - DAY
text: Within sight of the bridge. Sarge carefully plants a wire-
text: triggered satchel charge at the door of the building. He
text: sets the wire, then carefully backs away.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING
text: Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine
text: gun nest. Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham
dialog: at his side.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Well, if we had ten times the men
dialog: and a lot more ammo, we might stand
dialog: a chance, but not against those tanks.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: We're going to hope like hell the
dialog: tanks were on their way somewhere
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Maybe Caen.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Let's hope, because we're sure as
dialog: hell not going to do any damage to
dialog: them with what we have here.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: What about our grenades?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Those are Tigers, they have six-inch
dialog: armor, they don't even notice
dialog: grenades.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Would they notice and eighty-eight?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sure, you got one?
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: The Germans do.
text: Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Upham, go find Jackson, he and I are
dialog: going hunting.
text: Upham runs off. Sarge shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Uh, oh.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Out of the mouth of babes.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGEHEAD - NIGHT
text: Dark. Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with
text: blackening soot. The rest of Miller's men and several
text: paratroopers, including Ryan, look on. Upham is distressed.
dialog: Upham It was my idea, sir, you've got to let me go.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Upham, you've got to learn the
dialog: difference between whining and
dialog: griping. You can't just rely on
dialog: natural ability, you've got to study
dialog: and practice.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: But, sir...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: There you go again, that's whining,
dialog: that's not okay.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Goddamn it, sir...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: That's better, but you've still got
dialog: a long way to go. Talk to Reiben,
dialog: he's a natural and works at it, he'll
dialog: give you some pointers.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have
text: him pissing and moaning with the
dialog: best of us.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: See to it.
text: RYAN Steps up to Miller.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'd like to go, sir.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: No, private, I want you to stay here,
dialog: keep your head down, don't do anything
dialog: brave or stupid.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Aren't they the same thing, sir?
dialog: Miller smiles.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Reiben, I don't know what I'd do
dialog: without you. Sarge, keep Ryan close
dialog: to you and alive.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: Miller checks Jackson and Forrest.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You ready?
dialog: Forrest Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: You betcha, sir.
text: Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (southern accent)
dialog: Y'all come back.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the
dialog: way I talk?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: (heavy southern accent)
dialog: Hell, no!
text: Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest
text: into the darkness. Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go.
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT
text: A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the
text: night. It's eight-man crew re-loads.
speaker_heading: IN THE DARKNESS
text: A slight movement. It's Miller. He
text: crawls to the edge of the emplacement
text: and freezes in the shadows.
text: A moment later he's joined by Forrest. A moment after that,
text: Jackson silently crawls up to them.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Eyes the emplacement. Looks for a
dialog: weakness. There is none. He motions
dialog: to Forrest and Jackson to wait. The
dialog: three of them settle into the
dialog: darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness. Ryan
text: is lost in thought, far away. One after another, Miller's
dialog: men eye him.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Private, I'm sorry about your
dialog: brothers.
text: Ryan nods. Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip
text: from Iowa back to France. He turns to Sarge. Ryan What was
dialog: the name of the guy who got killed coming up here?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Wade.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Wade. Huh, he died coming up here
dialog: to keep me alive...I never met
dialog: him...he didn't know me from Adam,
dialog: strange. What was he like?
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: A good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben,
dialog: here, used to call him a happy idiot.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Like hell, I did.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: My brothers would be mighty pissed
dialog: off at me, if they knew I let some
dialog: guy get killed trying to keep me
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: You didn't let anybody get killed,
dialog: you didn't even know we were coming
dialog: up here.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sure, I know, but...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Goddamn it all...
text: The others nod in agreement. They look closely at Ryan.
scene_heading: EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT
text: Dark. No firing. Two German soldiers on watch.
speaker_heading: A SHADOW
dialog: It's Miller. Easing through the
text: darkness. Closer to one of the
dialog: sentries.
text: Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry. Miller
text: nods to Jackson. They move at the same moment. Behind the
text: sentries. SLIT THEIR THROATS.
scene_heading: BEHIND THE EIGHTY-EIGHT
text: Forrest removes the wheel-blocks.
speaker_heading: A GERMAN SENTRY
text: Approaches. He sees Forrest. Just
text: as he's about to open up with his
text: sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him
text: from behind, STABS him, eases the
text: body silently to the ground.
speaker_heading: MILLER AND JACKSON
dialog: Join Forrest at the eighty-eight.
text: Together they attach the eighty-eight's carriage to the
dialog: German's truck.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER GERMAN SENTRY
text: Rounds a corner. Sees them. OPENS
text: UP WITH HIS SUB-MACHINE GUN.
text: Forrest DIVES, FIRES BACK.
speaker_heading: OTHER GERMANS
dialog: Race over, FIRING.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
text: Covering them, OPENS UP. Kills the
dialog: advancing Germans.
text: MILLER frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck.
text: FORREST CUTS DOWN, several more Germans.
text: JACKSON TAKES A GRAZING SHOT IN THE SHOULDER.
dialog: Spins.
dialog: Still FIRING.
dialog: Giving Miller cover.
text: MILLER LEAPS into the cab of the truck.
text: JACKSON AND FORREST LEAP into the back.
text: JACKSON FIRES into the approaching Germans.
speaker_heading: THE WINDSHIELD
text: Is shattered by bullets.
text: Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands.
speaker_heading: FORREST
text: In the back of the truck.
text: Spraying the Germans with his Thompson.
text: MILLER FLOORS IT.
text: The truck DRIVES through the Germans.
text: The Germans FIRE at the truck and trailing eighty-eight.
text: MILLER, JACKSON AND FORREST Drive into the night.
text: The Germans FIRING after them.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD LEADING TO THE BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a
text: gauntlet of Germans. As they approach the bridge, the other
text: American's FIRE COVER for them.
text: Miller drives the truck onto the bridge.
text: SMASHES INTO THE SANDBAGS
text: THE OTHER AMERICANS, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the
text: barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: RYAN! GET BACK THERE!
text: Ryan ignores him. They get the eighty-eight safely behind
text: the barricade. Miller grabs Ryan.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sorry, sir.
text: Miller fumes. he sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging,
text: clearly not pissed at Ryan.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Don't do that again.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I won't need to sir, it's already
text: here, behind the barricade so...
speaker_heading: Miller GROWLS.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
text: Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine. Very
text: gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD LEADING TO BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt. They cover it and
dialog: step back carefully.
text: Then they proceed with the next. Upham is covering their
dialog: tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll
dialog: place the rest of the mines.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
dialog: Quiet. Dark. Everything is ready. There's nothing to do
dialog: now but wait.
text: ON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT
text: Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags. They can see
text: Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning
text: the rear machine gun nest with Sarge.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I mean, Ryan, what do you think of
dialog: him?
dialog: Jackson shrugs.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: He ain't half-bad, I guess.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I guess.
text: They're quiet for a moment.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: He ain't Wade.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Nope, he ain't Wade.
text: Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Crouch-runs through the shadows and
text: stops at the bridgekeepers hut.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Reiben...
text: Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun
dialog: nest.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.
text: MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in
text: the rear machine gun nest.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You set? Sarge nods.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Miller and Sarge exchange a look. Then Miller slips off to
dialog: check the others.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN
text: First light. The Americans are ready for battle. WE SEE
dialog: them in their positions:
speaker_heading: REIBEN AND UPHAM

dialog: Then another. And another.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Cocks his Thompson. Settles down

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: HERE THEY COME!
text: A RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE.
speaker_heading: THE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE
speaker_heading: REIBEN
text: OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
speaker_heading: THE GERMANS
text: At least fifty of them, advancing on
text: the bridge. Running from cover to
text: cover. A squad pushing a French
text: truck, using it as a shield.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
text: Calmly picking off the attacking
dialog: Germans.
speaker_heading: THE GERMAN INFANTRYMEN
dialog: Make their way down the streets.
text: Along the riverbank. Through the
text: houses. There are GERMANS FIRING
dialog: from all directions.
speaker_heading: REIBEN FIRES IN ARCS.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off.
text: Grabs the B.A.R., stands and fires.
speaker_heading: REIBEN AND UPHAM
dialog: Running out of ammo. See that there's
dialog: nothing else they can do.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Time to go.
text: Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber.
text: Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes. They run as fast as
dialog: they can.
scene_heading: THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER
text: REIBEN takes a glancing slug. Falls. Rolls and gets up.
text: Bleeding from the side, but not mortal. Upham helps him.
text: They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.
text: DIVE OVER. The Germans are almost on them.
speaker_heading: RYAN IS FIRING
text: With the rear MACHINE GUN. Drops
dialog: several Germans.

speaker_heading: HAND-TO-HAND.
scene_heading: FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS

speaker_heading: RYAN

text: Miller. That German raises his rifle
dialog: on Ryan.
scene_heading: UPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON
text: All see it. SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German.
speaker_heading: THE STUNNED GERMAN
text: About to kill Ryan. Torn apart by
text: bullets from three directions.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I got him.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Like hell you did, I got him.
speaker_heading: JACKSON SMILES
dialog: He got him.
text: MILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip. FIRES an arc. DROPS four
text: Germans. Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS. BARKS to Reiben
dialog: and Upham:
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: BACK! LET'S GO!
text: They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make
text: it to the barricade.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Sees them in deep trouble. Leaves
text: Ryan firing the rear machine gun.
dialog: Grabs the B.A.R. ADVANCES, FIRING
text: COVER. Exposed.
speaker_heading: BULLETS EVERYWHERE
dialog: MILLER, REIBEN, UPHAM make it to the

speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Sees they've made it. FIRES A FINAL
text: BURST. Races for cover. A trail of
text: bullets right behind him.
dialog: THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they're worth. Trying to
dialog: cover Sarge. Too many Germans.
text: SARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK. FALLS. MILLER AND THE OTHERS
text: continue to fire, horrified.
text: SARGE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET
text: Cradling the B.A.R. Stumbling toward cover. Slowing.
text: Bleeding.
speaker_heading: THE AMERICANS
text: Desperately trying to cover him.
speaker_heading: THE GERMANS
text: Open up with a volley.
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Is almost there.
scene_heading: ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE
dialog: As best they can. Right past Sarge. It's not enough.
speaker_heading: SARGE
text: Five feet from the sandbags, his
text: back is TORN APART by Germans fire.
text: He looks down, stunned at his chest.
text: Amazed to see GAPING HOLES. An
text: instant of surprise, more than fear.
text: He looks to Miller. Takes two more stumbling steps. Falls
text: onto the sandbags. Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge. Dies.
scene_heading: THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY
speaker_heading: THE GERMANS
dialog: Who killed Sarge are killed. The
dialog: others back off for now.
text: REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans.
speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: THE OTHERS
dialog: Watch, start to gather.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Get back to your positions!
dialog: They hesitate.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Go!
text: They follow the order. All except Ryan, who doesn't move.
text: He can't take his eyes off Sarge.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Doesn't move. He just stares at
text: Sarge's body.
speaker_heading: RYAN
text: Looks at Miller, sees him growing
text: weak, starting to sway. He gently
text: tries to move Miller aside.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'll take care of Sarge...
text: Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body. Miller
text: grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made
text: as he kneeled over Wade's body.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sarge? Who's Sarge?
dialog: But this time it doesn't work. He can't make it stick. The
text: hard expression, disappears. He drifts, utterly lost. He's
dialog: called his own bluff.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Dark. Quiet. The distant guns are silent for once.
text: Waiting. Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have
dialog: tightened their perimeter.
text: Miller is in a trance. The others glance at him nervously.
text: They eat in silence. K-rations. Some bread. A last supper.
text: Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania.
text: Slowly, Miller's men turn to him.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: What'd you say, Captain?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I teach English at Addley High School
dialog: in Addley, Pennsylvania.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Like hell, you did.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Captain, what about our deal?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I changed my mind.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: What deal?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I coach the baseball team, too.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: No kiddin'?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: What deal?
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: Forget it.
text: They all sit in silence.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You know that cruise ship Wade's
dialog: grandfather was on?
text: They all nod, except Ryan who doesn't know what Miller's
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I wonder if his cabin is still
dialog: available?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: That's not where I am. Miller No?
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: I'm in a dressing room with Mrs.
dialog: Rachel Troubowitz, our super's wife.
dialog: She's an easy forty-four, double E,
dialog: but I've convinced her she's a thirty-
dialog: eight D and I'm watching her try and
dialog: squeeze herself into a side-stay,
text: silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle
dialog: with s Helf-lift brassiere.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: She's having a devil of a time,
dialog: getting into that thing.
text: They all share Reiben's dream for a moment. Then Jackson
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Me? I'm walking with my hound, Lucy,
dialog: it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and
dialog: we're out huntin' coon. I got me a
dialog: flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Jackson, how many times I got to
dialog: tell you, you're from Tennessee.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: I am, but I like imported whiskey.
dialog: So there I am and I hear the biggest
dialog: ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a
dialog: rustlin' right there in front of me.
dialog: That ole' boy comes right out of the
dialog: brush, I got a clear shot and he
dialog: knows he's 'bout to meet his maker.
dialog: I aim, I got my finger tight on the
dialog: trigger and then I just smile and
dialog: say to that ole' coon, go on, now,
dialog: you get out 'a here. Then I sit
dialog: down on a hollow log and take me a
dialog: right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
text: Upham smiles.
speaker_heading: UPHAM
dialog: I don't know, I kind of like Wade's
dialog: idea about the cruise ship. I've
dialog: never been to Tahiti.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: What about you, Captain?
text: Miller smiles. He knows exactly where he is.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'm in my backyard, lying in my
dialog: hammock, with my arm around my wife,
dialog: listening for the sound of breaking
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Say what, Cap'n?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You see, I've got the best house in
dialog: all of Addley. It's not the biggest
dialog: house, but it's got the best location,
text: right next to the junior high baseball
text: field. The garage windows face left
dialog: field. The guy who owned the house
dialog: before me had these heavy screen S
dialog: put over them. The first thing I
dialog: did when I bought the place was take
dialog: off those screens. Two-hundred-twenty-
dialog: two yards from home plate to my garage
dialog: windows. It takes a hell of a junior
dialog: high kid to hit a ball that far. I
dialog: look at my garage windows as a
dialog: Motivator and a way to scout the
dialog: kids coming up, the ones who are
dialog: going to give us a shot at the state
dialog: championship. I lay there in my
dialog: hammock and every time I hear the
dialog: sound of breaking glass, I know we're
dialog: one step closer to winning it all.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Don't that get kind of expensive,
dialog: Cap'n?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It's worth it.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: To each, his own.
text: They're all silent for a moment. Then Miller turns to Ryan.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: How about you, James?
text: Ryan sighs.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm home, playing basketball with my
dialog: brothers, it's evenin' time, we're
dialog: trying' to get in a few more points
text: before it's too dark to see the ball.
dialog: That's where I am.
text: They all nod. Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes
text: it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on. They all
dialog: eat in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN
text: First light. Lovely. Dew shimmers. A ground fog drifts.
text: A SOUND. Louder. And louder. A GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLES
dialog: toward the village.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAWN
text: All are awake. At their positions. Waiting.
speaker_heading: MILLER

speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Manning the forward machine gun.
text: Way out front. Sees that he's going

text: He ignores the pain and RUNS BACK
text: toward the bridge.
text: HE DIVES over the sandbags. barely makes it. TRAILED BY
speaker_heading: BULLETS.
speaker_heading: THE GERMANS
text: Take positions near the bridge.
text: Moving in. FIRING. Overwhelming.

speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Sees Ryan. Races over. SHOOTS one
dialog: German. STABS the other.
text: RYAN FALLS BACK. Stunned, unhurt.
text: REIBEN only gives him a quick look. Gets to the MACHINE
dialog: GUN.
text: OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming. FIRES A
text: LONG BURST. Germans drop.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: FIRES again. More Germans drop.
speaker_heading: THE GERMANS
dialog: Take positions in the building near
dialog: the bridge.
text: They start working their way to the tops of the nearby

speaker_heading: REIBEN AND RYAN
dialog: Forward. Reiben FIRING. Ryan feeding
dialog: the ammo belt.
speaker_heading: REIBEN
speaker_heading: MORE AMMO!
speaker_heading: UPHAM

speaker_heading: UPHAM

dialog: position, continuing to pick off
dialog: German soldiers.
speaker_heading: THE TANK BLASTS
text: THE BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT AND JACKSON
text: ARE OBLITERATED IN THE EXPLOSION.
speaker_heading: MILLER AND RYAN

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: HOLD IT! HOLD IT!
text: Ryan and Reiben cease firing. Now they hear it, too.
dialog: A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Goddamn it!
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: More tanks... Ryan Lot's of them
text: The fear on their faces turns to
dialog: resignation. They know that they
text: are dead men. They settle into their
dialog: positions, and prepare to fire and
dialog: die.
text: They wait. The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.
text: THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a
dialog: smile...then a real smile...
text: AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise. Then
text: ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...
speaker_heading: MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN
text: Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along
text: with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.
text: They keep coming and coming. American tanks, with wave after
text: wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets. They find a
text: few among the departing Germans.
speaker_heading: THE ADVANCING TROOPS
dialog: Run onto the bridge and start to
dialog: secure the position. A SERGEANT and
text: a few of HIS MEN look around,
text: curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and
text: Ryan, battered and bloody, standing
dialog: among the bodies.
text: A MAJOR strides up.
dialog: Major Report, Captain.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Miller, Company B, Second Rangers,
dialog: that's Private Richard Reiben and
dialog: that's Private James Ryan, Hundred-
dialog: and-First Airborne.

speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Ryan?
text: One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.
dialog: Soldier That's him, that's Ryan.
text: The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.
dialog: Major Command is looking for you, son. You're going home.

scene_heading: EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY
text: American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the
text: road and over the bridge.
speaker_heading: MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN
text: Watch. In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies
text: of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers
text: are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.
text: Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if
dialog: they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by
text: any of the advancing troops or vehicles.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Walks to the bodies. He kneels down
text: next to Sarge and looks at him for a
text: long moment. Then, with a steady
text: hand, he takes one of Sarge's two
text: dog-tags. Then he does the same to
dialog: Jackson and Upham.
text: REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.
speaker_heading: MILLER
text: Stands and walks back to Reiben and
text: Ryan. He hands the dog-tags to Ryan
text: who grips them tightly and nods in
dialog: thanks.
text: Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then
dialog: he shoulders his gear. Miller Let's move out.
text: Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear. They walk with Miller
text: down the road, away from the bridge.
speaker_heading: CAMERA CRANES UP
text: The three dirty, bloodied, tired men
text: walk down the road, ignored by the
text: fresh troops marching in the opposite
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Captain?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yes, Private.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Upham and Jackson, what were they
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Upham? Good kid, smart, he was
dialog: writing a book.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: REIBEN
dialog: Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the
dialog: 220 in twenty-four-five.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No kidding.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee,
dialog: he was going to be a preacher, his
dialog: father and uncles have a traveling
text: ministry out of the back of a stretch
dialog: Hudson.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: And Sarge?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Sarge?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He was the best friend I ever had.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Lemme tell you about Sarge...
text: They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds
text: and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the
text: road and over the bridge.
