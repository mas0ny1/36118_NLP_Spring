scene_heading: EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: AN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs
dialog: (pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains
dialog: of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler
text: turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking
dialog: area.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler
text: at LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold
dialog: and watchful.
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets
text: out, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE
text: RIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA
text: FOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.
speaker_heading: SPLIT SCREEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCENE TWO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business
dialog: section. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self
text: indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,
text: picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around
dialog: to open the trunk.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the
dialog: salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals
text: and product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,
text: shuts the trunk, walks away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he
text: approaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes
text: contracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from
dialog: the right.
dialog: 
text: SCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.
dialog: 
text: SCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCENE THREE:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - DAY
dialog: 
text: A baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful
text: in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small
text: jewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks
dialog: rather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,
dialog: and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMULTANEOUSLY:
dialog: 
text: SCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.
dialog: 
text: SCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.
dialog: 
text: SCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.
dialog: 
text: WIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a
text: NOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the
text: bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's
dialog: attention.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the
text: bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he
text: SHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down.
dialog: 
text: BARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar
dialog: bill.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as
text: the bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes
text: a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto
text: the bar, holding it there with one finger.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer,
text: nodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting
text: the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it,
text: hurrying away.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change
text: down, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out.
dialog: 
text: CU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes
dialog: over it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting
dialog: odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.
dialog: 
dialog: CLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a
text: large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as
dialog: though it were a file drawer.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track
text: beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.
dialog: Lilly moves.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly
text: approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
dialog: 
text: A change of numbers sweeps across the board.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting
dialog: tickets into her bag.
dialog: 
text: ECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small
text: envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly
text: carefully files the betting slips.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: CU, number 3. Odds 32-1.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly, not satisfied. She turns and goes back.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes
dialog: more bets.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
dialog: 
scene_heading: CU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers
dialog: shift: odds 26-1.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (O.S.)
dialog: And they're off!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow
text: ticking clock.
text: Myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the
text: JEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a
text: jeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,
text: shakes his head regretfully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Why? What's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: (personal emotion mixed
dialog: in)
dialog: You are a valued customer, as you
dialog: know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: But what's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: I can't understand a thing like
dialog: this. It's something you almost
dialog: never see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: What is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: (holding up bracelet)
dialog: This is some of the finest
dialog: filigreed platinum I've ever seen.
dialog: But the stones, no. They're not
dialog: diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: But they must be! They cut glass!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: (wry)
dialog: Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.
dialog: Do you know where it was purchased?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: An expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the
text: windows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged
text: on the bed and laughs at COLE "FARMER" LANGLEY, 55, stringy
text: bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,
text: presenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden
text: by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on
text: something at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,
text: looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward
text: again toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: It was a gift. It isn't worth
dialog: anything at all?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: (warm, encouraging)
dialog: Why, of course it is. I can offer
dialog: you -- well, five hundred dollars.
dialog: 
dialog: Myra expected -- and needed -- a lot more. She's worried,
text: tense, but stuck. She nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: All right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: (rising)
dialog: I'll get you a check.
dialog: 
text: He leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SECOND BAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Another crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves
text: quickly, carrying a draft beer.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as
text: the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the
text: bill, stops, stares at the bill.
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a
dialog: very cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries
text: an innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.
dialog: 
text: CU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender
text: simultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away
text: and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching
text: under the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off
text: baseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to
text: protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of
text: the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard
text: into Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and
text: propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The
text: nearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something
dialog: happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in
text: conversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the
text: bat away under the bar.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in
text: shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already
text: been closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles
dialog: toward the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,
text: switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away
text: from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly
text: passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves
text: on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Myra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which
text: he hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: I hope you're not too badly
dialog: disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: It's not your fault.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: You'll give us an opportunity to
dialog: serve you again, I hope. If there's
dialog: anything you think we might be
dialog: interested in...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I have only one thing now. Are you
dialog: interested?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: Well, I'd have to see it, of
dialog: course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You are seeing it. You're looking
dialog: right at it.
dialog: 
text: The jeweler is puzzled, then startled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: I see.
dialog: 
text: He turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at
dialog: Myra.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A
dialog: bracelet like that very rarely
dialog: happens. A fine setting and
dialog: workmanship usually mean precious
dialog: stones. It always hurts me when I
dialog: find they're not. I always hope --
dialog: (faint sad friendly smile)
dialog: -- I'm mistaken.
dialog: 
text: Myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her
dialog: problem. She rises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Thank you. For everything you felt
dialog: you could do.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Roy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled
text: like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still
text: clutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP
text: gets out. He's suspicious at first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Sir? Everything all right?
dialog: 
text: The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He
text: straightens, smiling through his pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Getting better. A bad shrimp, I
dialog: think.
dialog: 
text: The con's suspicion changes to concern.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Want us to take you to a doctor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: No no, I'm fine now, thanks,
dialog: anyway. Still got a lot of clients
dialog: to see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Take it easy, now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh, I will.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Late afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost
text: all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely
text: separated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to
dialog: it from the track entrance.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her
dialog: bag inside.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from
text: her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different
text: compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these
text: separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She
text: takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag
text: with the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she
text: lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor
text: panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds
text: today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her
text: shoulder, closes the trunk.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY
dialog: 
text: A shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall
text: balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front
text: apartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the
dialog: basement garage.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Modest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old
text: bore, talks with a potential RENTER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Put it this way, now. Say I rent to
dialog: a woman, well, she has to have a
dialog: room with a bath. I insist on it,
dialog: because otherwise she's got the
dialog: hall bath tied up all the time,
dialog: washing her goddamn hair and her
dialog: clothes and everything she can
dialog: think of.
dialog: 
text: In b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves
text: to Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,
text: and crosses to the mailboxes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Now, your minimum for a room with
dialog: bath is three hundred a month, just
dialog: for a place to sleep and no cooking
dialog: allowed.
dialog: And just how many of these tootsies
dialog: make that kind of money and have to
dialog: eat in restaurants and buy clothes
dialog: and --
dialog: 
text: Roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,
dialog: crosses to Simms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Mr. Simms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (fawning)
dialog: Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a
dialog: potential new neighbor, looking at--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (uninterested)
dialog: Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
dialog: 
dialog: Simms doesn't like Mrs. Langtry, but can't say so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I'll send her right up.
dialog: 
text: Roy goes back to the elevator. Simms continues his monologue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: I had my first hotel thirty-seven
dialog: years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,
dialog: and that's where I began to learn
dialog: about women. They just don't make
dialog: the money, you see, not regular
dialog: they don't, and there's only one
dialog: way they can get it.
dialog: 
text: Roy enters the elevator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's
dialog: the fine type of person I have in
dialog: mind for here. Like yourself, I
dialog: have no doubt. He's a salesman,
dialog: regular as clockwork, has a suite
dialog: here. Fine man. Now, about these
dialog: women. At first, you know, they
dialog: just go out and do it now and then,
dialog: just enough to make ends meet. But
dialog: pretty soon they got that bank open
dialog: twenty-four hours a day, and then
dialog: you've got trouble. Hookers and
dialog: hotellin' just don't mix.
dialog: You'd think the cops'd be too busy
dialog: catching real criminals, not
dialog: snooping around after working
dialog: girls, but that's the way the gravy
dialog: stains, as the saying is, and I
dialog: don't fight it. An ounce of
dialog: prevention is my motto.
dialog: 
text: Myra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points
text: upward. Simms calls to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up
dialog: there, he's expecting you.
dialog: 
text: Myra crosses to the elevator. Simms speaks more softly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: If you keep out the women in the
dialog: first place, see, you keep out the
dialog: hookers, and then you keep out the
dialog: cops, and that's how you have a
dialog: clean place.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.
text: and Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it
text: with her key, enters.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: A small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and
text: trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the
text: mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He
text: touches his stomach, winces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (O.S.)
dialog: Roy?
dialog: 
text: He looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Your medicine is here.
dialog: 
text: He leaves the bathroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls,
dialog: contrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown
text: pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. Myra
text: stands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and
text: trousers still disarranged.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (amused by clothing)
dialog: Well, well. In a real hurry, are
dialog: we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Always, for you, baby.
dialog: 
text: He reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You aren't taking me for granted,
dialog: are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Taking you for granite?
dialog: 
text: He grins, as his fingertip prods her breast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That isn't granite. If that fell on
dialog: me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (playing along)
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (pulling her close)
dialog: Let's find out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY PHONE BOOTH - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lilly's white Chrysler is parked next to an open-air phone.
text: Traffic whizzes by. Lilly talks on the phone, with pen and
text: notebook at the ready. The racetrack is visible in the b.g.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I'm done here. Do I come back to
dialog: Baltimore?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: It could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office.
text: Baltimore harbor is visible past the windows. IRV, the
text: accountant, sits at a desk covered -- but neatly covered --
text: with ledgers, computer printouts, etc. He speaks on the
dialog: phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INTERCUT PHONE BOOTH AND OFFICE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Delmar? I never go out to
dialog: California. That's a thousand miles
dialog: from here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody
dialog: to handle playback this time. Come
dialog: on, Lilly, you don't argue with
dialog: Bobo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (fatalistic)
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Take two, three days. Call when you
dialog: get there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang
text: gleez on the way.
dialog: 
text: This is Lilly making the best of the situation. She listens a
text: bit more, GRUNTS a farewell, hangs up, moves to her car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Again, anonymous hotel furniture. Roy and Myra naked in bed,
text: he on his back, she straddling him, both moving gently. He's
text: half feeling pleasure, half unconscious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Roy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Mm?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Look at me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Roy? It this all we have?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: All? It ain't bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: No more than this?
dialog: 
text: He tries to concentrate on her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What are you talking abut, Myra?
dialog: Marriage?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I didn't say that. You aren't
dialog: marriage material.
dialog: 
text: He keeps watching her, ironic, hips moving. Looking for a
text: distraction, she notices the bruise on his stomach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
text: She touches it; he flinches back, in real pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do,
dialog: throw me off my game?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No, baby. Come to Mama.
dialog: 
text: She folds forward onto him. He puts his arms around her. They
dialog: rock together slowly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - DAY
dialog: 
text: The same mountains in b.g. as at the track. Lilly carries two
text: small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of
text: the Cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself
text: critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Roy lies supine on the bed, semi-conscious, half-covered by a
text: sheet. Myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her
text: head in through the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Wore you out, did I? It's a good
dialog: woman you can't keep down, baby.
dialog: 
text: He moves fitfully, CROAKS an attempt at speech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Have a good sleep, baby. Call you
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: He sits up, trying to grin and be easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Wait'll next year.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond
text: him. Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen.
text: Myra crosses the living room, opens the door. Bright sunlight
text: pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. She closes the
text: door, and he gives up trying to smile. Gingerly, he touches
text: his bruised stomach, winces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Damn that guy.
dialog: 
text: He's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. He
text: sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches
text: painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from
dialog: it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it
text: on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of
text: his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and
text: repeats. Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips
text: it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, SPEAKS
text: simultaneously with the hands coming together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Smack.
dialog: 
text: He looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Heads.
dialog: 
text: He lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again,
text: looks away, moves the right hand slightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Heads.
dialog: 
text: Again he's right. Again he repeats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Tails.
dialog: 
text: He's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him.
text: He sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem.
text: He forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds
text: it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of
text: the other hand, looks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Tails.
dialog: 
text: Right again. He prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand
text: sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: How much can I bet?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: The train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light
text: and-dark pattern. Roy, four or five years younger, sits with
text: a three-core-monte gang, consisting of a DEALER, a spectacled
text: SHILL beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a ROPER next to Roy.
text: On a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up:
text: An ace and two deuces. Across the aisle, alone in the seats,
text: sits MINTZ, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch,
text: but watching with amusement.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHILL
dialog: What if we both guess wrong? You
dialog: aren't gonna take...
dialog: 
text: The dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. He
text: and the shill ARGUE nonsensically. The roper nudges Roy, then
text: reaches out and crimps the ace. Roy's doing a wide-eyed
text: bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking

speaker_heading: ROPER

dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, the dealer and the shill, fake-squabbling, Roy and
text: the roper seen in b.g. between their faces, Roy finally
text: bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. Relieved, the
dialog: dealer and the shill cut the crap.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the group as Roy puts his hundred dollar bill on
dialog: the briefcase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Is that okay?
dialog: 
text: The shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket,
dialog: uses most of it to cover the bet.

speaker_heading: SHILL

speaker_heading: DEALER

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Dark in here.

scene_heading: INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the group. Roy squints at the cards, light and
text: dark playing on his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Too dark. I just can't see.
dialog: 
text: Casually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across
text: and plucks the shill's glasses off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Let me borrow these, will you?
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE across Mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in
text: b.g., in consternation as Roy puts on the glasses and looks
dialog: down at the cards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Now, that's better.
dialog: 
text: ROY'S POV: The glasses are 'readers.' Through them, a large
text: gray 'A' can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped
text: cards. Roy's hand reaches out and flips it over. It's the ace
dialog: of spades.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE across Roy toward the doorway. Roy, eyes closed,
text: smiles in triumph, then winces in pain. Mintz partially
text: appears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at Roy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINTZ
dialog: I didn't teach you that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: You taught me a lot. Then I

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT DEPARTURE LOUNGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Weary bored people sit around waiting. Roy, 17, lugging a big

dialog: closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Let me see how you did that one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINTZ
dialog: Scram. Go home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: MINTZ
dialog: You're too young. You should be in

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I am in school.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINTZ
dialog: Where's the five?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: In your other hand.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on a large sign indicating "Los Angeles" straight
text: ahead. CAMERA PANS DOWN and around 180 degrees to face the
text: several lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic. LONG BEAT.
text: Hundreds of cars rush by. CAMERA PANS with Lilly's white
text: Chrysler as it comes along in the stream.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly,
text: driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. She
text: becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in
dialog: irritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit.
text: Ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the
text: fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye
dialog: on it.
dialog: 
text: HIGH ANGLE on the westbound lanes. The Chrysler passes. Soon
text: it's out of sight among all the other cars. LONG BEAT.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE across the unmoving unconscious Roy toward the
text: doorway. The apartment door beyond the living room opens,
text: throwing light on Roy, who doesn't react. Lilly enters, in
text: silhouette, closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom.
dialog: (Until she speaks, we can't be quite sure who this is. With
dialog: the similarity between herself and Myra, this could be Myra.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY

dialog: Roy?
dialog: 
text: No reaction. Lilly, getting worried, moves closer, through
dialog: the bedroom doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Roy? You asleep?
dialog: 
text: His head moves slightly. He barely has strength to speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Myra?
dialog: 
text: She moves forward to the side of the bed, only her torso IN
text: FRAME. She touches a hand to his forehead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (startled)
dialog: My God!
dialog: 
text: She turns, hurries back to the living room, looks around for

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE down toward Roy, from above, he's weak but troubled.
text: Eyes closed, frowning, whispering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Go away, Lilly. Go away.
dialog: 
text: Roy's eyes close. He looks dead. SLOW FADE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: The DOCTOR, a nervous heavyset man in his fifties, a drinker
text: from the look of him, is on the phone in b.g., while Lilly
text: prowls the room, looking at everything with distaste, then
text: stopping to frown at the box-framed clown pictures. She
text: doesn't get it. She touches one of the pictures, trying to
text: understand. The doctor hangs up, turns to Lilly.

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (lugubrious)

speaker_heading: LILLY

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some

speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Well, make it stop!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: His blood pressure is under a

dialog: to get to the hospital.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (icy, stern)
dialog: You know who I work for.
dialog: 
dialog: He's uncomfortable, wants to dismiss that part of his life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yes, yes, but that's --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: My son will be all right. If he
dialog: isn't, I'll have you killed.
dialog: 
text: The doctor stares at her in astonishment, then in belief.
text: SOUND of ambulance siren. To break the moment, he crosses to
text: the door, opens it. Light bathes Lilly. The doctor steps back
text: across the threshold, waiting for the ambulance. He looks
text: back at Lilly, who stares at him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
dialog: 
text: A clumsy slum hotel fifteen years ago, with a tiny lobby, the
text: DESK CLERK at a half-door in one wall. Lilly, at 24, enters
dialog: from the street. This is a definite hooker, with bright
text: maroon hair and a black-and-white miniskirt. She stops
text: wordlessly at the desk for her key.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (handing key)
dialog: Your kid's in the back here. He's
dialog: crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Roy? He's always crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (sympathetic to Roy)
dialog: The kids beat him up, because his
dialog: home life is, uh, different.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: I like you, too.
dialog: 
text: The clerk shrugs. He doesn't like this tough broad. He turns
text: and calls back into his office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Roy, your mother's here.
dialog: 
text: Roy, 10, comes reluctantly out to Lilly, sniffling and
dialog: rubbing his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: So what's your story today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: They twisted my arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (laughing lightly)
dialog: Only one arm?
dialog: 
text: He tries not to cry, and shows her a space between his teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: They knocked out my tooth!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Only one tooth?
dialog: 
text: Roy's frustrated, unhappy, having nowhere else to turn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You always say that!
dialog: 
text: Lilly won't take him seriously, but she relents enough to
text: stop teasing him, and to pat his head, ignoring how he
text: flinches away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Come on, kid, let's see if there's
dialog: any food in the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (there's no food)
dialog: Hah.
dialog: 
text: Lilly gives him a jaundiced look, walks Roy to the stairs and
text: up. The clerk, scornful but sexually interested, watches her
dialog: go.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: ECU, Roy in a hospital bed, with more color in his face,
text: breathing more normally. He begins to react to the sound of
dialog: people speaking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (O.S.)
dialog: No, really, you're Roy's mother?
dialog: That's impossible!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY (O.S.)
dialog: Not quite. But I'm not sure who you
dialog: are, Mrs... Langtry, was it?
dialog: 
text: Roy's eyes open, he looks toward the voices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (O.S.)
dialog: I'm Roy's friend.
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT, Lilly and Myra facing one another across the foot
text: of Roy's bed, in a two-bed hospital room. (The OLD MAN in the
text: other bed sleeps through the scene.) Neither woman is yet
text: aware that Roy's awake. Lilly looks Myra up and down, with
dialog: obvious contempt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Yes. I imagine you're lots of
dialog: people's friend.
dialog: 
text: Myra moves one pace to the side, studying Lilly's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Oh, of course, now that I see you
dialog: in the light, you're plenty old
dialog: enough to be Roy's mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (sweet smile)
dialog: Aren't we all?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (very weak, but amused)
dialog: Play nice. Don't fight.
dialog: 
text: The women, startled, both move toward Roy, one on each side
dialog: of the bed.
dialog: 
text: THREE SHOT, Myra and Lilly both leaning over to look down at
text: Roy's sleepy face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Darling!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Roy. You're going to be all right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Sure I am. What made you turn up,
dialog: after all these years?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I'm working down in San Diego. Just
dialog: for a few weeks.
dialog: (awkward laugh)
dialog: Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost
dialog: son.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (cold)
dialog: Nice to see you.
dialog: (turns to Myra)
dialog: What am I doing in here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You were bleeding inside, honey.
dialog: Remember that bruise you had?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You called the doctor, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (reluctant)
dialog: Well, no, Roy. Your mother found
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (tossing It away)
dialog: Oh, yeah?
dialog: (very casual, to Lilly)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (back to Myra)
dialog: How long do they say I'm in here?
dialog: 
text: Myra's willing to fight with Lilly, but Roy's attitude toward
text: his mother makes her uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Roy... Your mom saved your life.
dialog: 
text: Roy turns his head, gives Lilly an ironic smile. Lilly waits,
dialog: holding herself in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Yeah? Only one life?
dialog: 
text: She nods, accepting that, but then responds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Second time I gave it to you.
dialog: 
text: Roy gives her a cold smile, then turns to Myra for the ironic
dialog: explanation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I was kind of... inconvenient...
dialog: for Lilly.
dialog: 
dialog: Lilly has nothing but contempt for Myra. To be humiliated in
dialog: front of Myra -- and by her son -- is the worst thing that
text: could happen to her. She makes as dignified an exit as she
dialog: can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Well... You're all right now, I
dialog: guess. I have to get down to the
dialog: track.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (reluctant, but it's
dialog: necessary)
dialog: Thanks, uh, Lilly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (awkward laugh)
dialog: Don't mention it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I guess I owe you my life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (faint smile)
dialog: You always did.
dialog: 
text: Lilly exits. Myra looks after her, curious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: "Down to the track?"
dialog: 
dialog: Roy will not talk about this, with anyone. His response is
dialog: cold, closing the subject.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Her job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (bright smile)
dialog: I want to know everything about
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (easy grin)
dialog: You do. And once I'm out of here,
dialog: I'll remind you of the best parts.
dialog: 
text: They smile flirtatiously at one another, both with their
dialog: minds on other things.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Very messy, small. Myra showers. She finishes, emerges, wraps
text: herself in a towel, opens the crowded messy medicine cabinet,
text: removes cosmetics and other items, starts to tweeze her

text: Long doorbell RING. Exasperated, she slaps the tweezers down,
dialog: exits.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Another furnished apartment, this one with Myra's clothing
text: and dishes and glasses and other junk all over it.

text: enters; a sullen, nervous, heavyset man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (angry, but defensive)
dialog: You heard the shower, didn't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: I don't care about that. This time,

dialog: 
text: Myra forces herself to be more pleasant.

speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Joe, I thought I was gonna be all
dialog: right by now, I just need a little
dialog: more --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my
dialog: wife. She knows what's going on.
dialog: This time, I gotta have the money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Joe, you know you'll --
dialog: 
text: In gesturing, Myra "accidentally" loses the towel, then wraps
text: it around herself again as the manager stares nervously away.
text: She smiles, knowing she's got him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Joe, could we talk it over? Do you
dialog: want a drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: My wife sent me here, Myra. For the
text: money. She's waiting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock?
dialog: Ten?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (trying to be determined)
dialog: This time...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: We'll work something out, Joe.
dialog: 
text: She strokes his arm, smiling. He flees. She smiles till he's
text: gone, then looks worried, leans her head against the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Roy, very comfortable in pajamas and robe, sits in a
text: wheelchair beside the bed, with magazines lying handy on the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I don't see why you're still here.
dialog: You look healthy to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I just do what the doctor says,
dialog: babe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You're just comfortable, that's
dialog: all. You don't even ask to go home.
dialog: You just lie around, let your mama
dialog: take care of you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (truly astonished)
dialog: Mama!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Who else is paying for all this?
dialog: You badmouth the woman all the

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (insulted)
dialog: I'll pay Lilly back, don't you
dialog: worry about that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I don't like to come here, Roy.
dialog: Every time I do, your mother comes
dialog: in and makes remarks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That's just Lilly's way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: And you never defend me. You're
dialog: afraid of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh, don't be stupid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You're a mama's boy, if you want
dialog: the truth.
dialog: 
dialog: This is so absurd, Roy doesn't know how to respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Are you kid --? I hadn't even seen
dialog: her in seven years!
dialog: 
text: Lilly enters, smiling in self-confidence. A large ugly burn
text: is on the back of her right hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Should my ears be burning?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (surly)
dialog: They might as well.
dialog: 
text: Lilly gives her a mock-admiring look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I heard those skirts were coming
dialog: back.

speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Get well soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (easy)
dialog: Every day in every way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I'll see you when you get home.
dialog: 
text: Myra stalks out. Acting as though Myra hadn't existed, Lilly
text: puts her bag on the bed, takes mail from it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What happened to your hand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (casually dismissive)
dialog: Just a little accident. I went by
dialog: your place, picked up your mall.
dialog: Just bills, I'll take care of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I can take care of my own bills,
dialog: Lilly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (indifferent shrug)
dialog: Whatever you say. The manager says
dialog: your boss called.
dialog: (crooked grin)
dialog: Really pulled the wool over
dialog: everybody's eyes, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What are you talking about? So I've
dialog: got a job. So what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Stop kidding me! Four years in a
dialog: town like Los Ang-gleez, and a
dialog: peanut selling job is the best you
dialog: can do? You expect me to believe
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (spreads hands; it's
dialog: obvious)
dialog: It's there. The boss called, you
dialog: said so yourself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: And that dump you live in! Those

dialog: 
text: This reference alerts and worries Roy, which he tries to

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I like those.

speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball
dialog: clown pictures? Commission
dialog: salesman? It's all a front, isn't
dialog: it? You're on the grift, I know you
dialog: are. You're working some angle, and
dialog: don't tell me you're not because I
dialog: wrote the book!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: You're one to talk. Still running
dialog: playback money for the mob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: That's me. That's who I am. You
dialog: were never cut out for the rackets,
dialog: Roy, and if you --

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: How come?
dialog: 
text: She considers him. His expression is jaunty, daring her. She
text: gives him a somber answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You aren't tough enough.
dialog: 
text: He's afraid she's right. He covers the doubt with a display
dialog: of self-assurance.

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Not as tough as you, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: No. And you have to be.
dialog: 
text: She holds up her burned hand, showing it to him.

speaker_heading: LILLY

dialog: He isn't sure he does; but what choice does he have?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Up to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus,
dialog: back in Baltimore. When a long shot
dialog: gets too much action, I have to put

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: The first day of the Delmar meet,
dialog: there was a nag called Bluebell. I
dialog: should have been on it. But that

dialog: were gonna be.
dialog: 
text: He would speak protest, deny, explain, but she cuts him off.

dialog: didn't work out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Bluebell came in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY

speaker_heading: BOBO

dialog: may flush you down the toilet.
dialog: Drive me to the Durando.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Driving along the highway. Lilly concentrates on traffic.
text: Bobo heavily watches her profile, finally speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Bluebell.
dialog: 
text: Lilly's eyes briefly close, her shoulders sag. Then she goes

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: How'd you figure you were gonna get
dialog: away with that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I'm not getting away with anything,
dialog: Bobo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: You're fuckin right you're not. How
dialog: much did your pals cut you in for
dialog: on that nag, huh? Or did they give
dialog: you the same kind of screwing you
dialog: gave me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not
dialog: as much as I should have been, but
dialog: there was a lot of action on those--
dialog: 
text: Bobo taps a fingertip against the side of her head to shut
text: her up. She shuts up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: One question. Do you want to stick
dialog: to that story, or do you want to
dialog: keep your teeth?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I want to keep my teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Now I'll ask you another. You think
dialog: I got no contacts out here? That
dialog: nag paid off at just the opening
dialog: price. There wasn't hardly a
text: flutter on the tote board from the
dialog: time the odds were posted. There
dialog: ain't enough action to tickle the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Living room of a high-floor suite. CAMERA FACES across the

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: (to the thugs)
dialog: Take a walk.
dialog: 
text: The thugs leave the room as Lilly crosses to stand between US

text: turns to Bobo, who abruptly punches her hard in the stomach.
text: She falls to the floor.
dialog: 
text: ANOTHER ANGLE as Bobo steps across her and goes over to close
text: the drapes over the view. Lilly sits up, watching him,
text: waiting obediently. Bobo looks at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO (CONT'D)
dialog: Get me a bath towel.
dialog: 
text: She gets up, hurting, and hurries to the bathroom. Bobo sits
text: on the sofa, crosses his ankles on the coffee table next to

text: comes back with a large white bath towel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever hear about the oranges?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You mean, the insurance frammis?

speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
dialog: 
text: He kicks over the supermarket bag. Oranges roll on the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO (CONT'D)
dialog: While you put those in the towel.
dialog: 
text: Lilly's very scared. She drops to her knees, spreads the
text: towel, crawls around gathering oranges while she talks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You hit a person with the oranges
dialog: in the towel, they get big, awful
dialog: looking bruises, but they don't
dialog: really get hurt, not if you do it
dialog: right. It's for working scams
dialog: against insurance companies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY

dialog: 
text: Lilly pauses, bent over, tightly holding an orange.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Permanent damage.

speaker_heading: BOBO

dialog: 
text: He gets to his feet, leaving his cigar in an ashtray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO (CONT'D)
dialog: (hard, impatient)
dialog: Bring me the towel.
dialog: 
text: Fumbling slightly, she folds the towel edges together to make
text: a bag, then stands, brings the towel to Bobo. He makes a
text: production out of getting his grip on the edges just right.
text: She stands as limp as she can, just wanting to get through
text: this. He looks at her without expression, rears back with the
text: towel, swings it forward, lets it drop open. Oranges roll on
text: the floor. Lilly stares, wide-eyed, recognizing reprieve.
text: Bobo tosses the towel behind him onto the sofa, then gestures
text: contemptuously for her to pick up the oranges again.
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, closer, as Lilly turns, bending toward the oranges,
text: and Bobo picks up his cigar, then lifts a foot and kicks her
text: flatfooted, hard, in the back. She sprawls on the floor. He
text: follows and drops to his knees on her back.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE close on Lilly on the floor, Bobo's knees grinding
text: back and forth into her back.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Bobo, grimacing as he bears down, pressing his
text: weight onto her back. He leans forward, left hand bracing
text: himself on the floor beside her head as he reaches down with
text: the cigar held in his right hand and presses the ember
text: against the back of her splayed-out right hand.
dialog: 
text: ECU, Lilly, clenching her teeth, tears squeezing from her
text: eyes, simply bearing it.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Bobo, catching a bad smell, looking back down
text: behind himself at Lilly's body. This is the result he wanted,
text: but it disgusts him. He straightens up, still kneeling on
text: her, puts the cigar in his mouth, doesn't like its taste,
text: removes it, braces his left hand against her back while he
text: lifts off her, getting back up onto his feet.
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT, Bobo stepping over her, expression repulsed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO (CONT'D)
dialog: Go clean yourself up.
dialog: 
text: He puts the cigar back in the ashtray as she rises, cradling

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO (CONT'D)
text: The raincoat's on the bed.
dialog: 
text: She leaves. He opens the drapes, then picks up an orange from
text: the floor and steps out onto the balcony.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Bobo stands looking out at the ocean. He enjoys breathing the
text: sea air. He slowly peels the orange, dropping pieces of peel
dialog: over the side.
dialog:

text: raincoat. Bobo doesn't seem to notice her at first, then nods
dialog: to her.

speaker_heading: BOBO

speaker_heading: LILLY

speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
dialog:

speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: (honest approval)
dialog: That's right. Take a little, leave
dialog: a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: A person that don't look out for

speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: (this is his creed)
dialog: You're a thousand percent right!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Or else he's working an angle. If

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: You know it, Lilly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I

dialog: Yeah? You really think so? A lot of

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Now she's hurt. She shrugs, speaks indifferently to his back.

speaker_heading: LILLY

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (his back turned)

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: CLERK

speaker_heading: ROY

dialog: like a disease.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 2ND CLERK
dialog: It is.

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Troubleshooter from the main

speaker_heading: ROY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS (CONT'D)
dialog: What's up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That was a pretty backhanded

speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: Take a seat.
dialog: 
text: They both sit, Roy amused and observant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: When I said you being the best
dialog: salesman here didn't say much, I
dialog: meant for us. I know your record
dialog: with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say
dialog: you're a top-flight man, but you've
dialog: had no incentive. No one walking on
dialog: your heels. Just a lot of half
dialog: asses, so the tendency's been not
dialog: to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing
dialog: the slobs, incidentally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (dry)
dialog: So I heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: Makes no difference to me if
dialog: they're only on commission. If they
dialog: don't make good money, they're not
dialog: giving us good representation, and
dialog: we can't afford to have them
dialog: around. Ever supervise salesmen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Just myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: That's right, you've had to
dialog: supervise yourself. This place
dialog: needs a sales manager. Somebody
dialog: who's proved he's a salesman and
dialog: can handle other salesmen. He'd
dialog: have a lot of deadwood to clear
dialog: out, new men to hire. What do you
dialog: think?
dialog: 
text: Roy doesn't yet know he's being offered the job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Sounds like a good Idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: I don't know offhand what your best
dialog: year's been, we can look it up. The
dialog: idea is, we'll top it by fifteen
dialog: percent.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What? Me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Well, uh... No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: No?

speaker_heading: ROY

dialog: dropped in to say hello, see
dialog: everybody --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: But you need a man right now. It

speaker_heading: KAGGS

dialog: 
text: Roy's place. Roy enters from the bedroom, carrying a
text: suitcase, which he drops on the sofa. He goes to one of the
text: box-framed clown pictures, takes it off the wall, puts it
text: face down on the coffee table, removes two wing nuts holding
text: the back, lifts off the back, and reveals stacks of money
text: hidden inside. He takes two wads of money out, counting them,
text: putting them on the coffee table, then fits the back in
text: place, reattaches the wing nuts, and hangs the picture on the
text: wall. Stuffing the wads of money into the suitcase, he

scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
dialog: 
text: A cab pulls up to discharge passengers. Roy and the DRIVER
text: get out. Roy pays the driver, who opens the trunk to take out
text: several pieces of luggage. Myra leans hesitantly out, as
text: though afraid it's raining out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: This really is it. Union Station.
dialog: 
text: Myra comes out of the cab. She's feeling testy. Roy's in a
text: good mood and ignores her bad temper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I don't see why we have to take the
dialog: train.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Because it's comfortable.
dialog: 
text: Myra and Roy burden themselves with the luggage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: What if we want to drive somewhere
dialog: while we're there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: We'll rent a car.

scene_heading: INT. TRAIN DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE from outside the passenger car through the window at
text: Myra, mulish, watching the scenery go by. Beyond her Roy's
text: easy, content. He moves to get up.
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, within the train. Myra looks questioningly at Roy
dialog: as he stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Stretch my legs. Come along?
dialog: 
text: She's not ready to relent and enjoy herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (unruffled)
dialog: See you soon.
dialog: 
text: He walks down the aisle behind Myra, who sighs and looks out
dialog: the window again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Four young SOLDIERS sit at a table in a rudimentary bar car.
text: They're drinking bloody Marys out of plastic glasses and
text: having a good time together. In b.g., several customers are
text: clustered at the small service bar, waiting for drinks.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Roy, at the service bar, looking back past other
text: people at the soldiers. He gets his mixed drink, in a plastic
text: glass, and turns away.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the soldiers as Roy starts by. The train lurches,
text: and Roy falls heavily against their table, slopping their
text: drinks and spilling some of his own on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh! Ow, I'm sorry! Oh, look, I
dialog: spilled your drinks!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: That's okay, don't worry about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: You okay, pal?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Let me buy you a new round.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Hey, no, no problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 3
dialog: You didn't like spill much at all.
dialog: 
text: Roy firmly places his own glass on their table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What are those, bloody Marys? Watch
dialog: this, I'll be back.
dialog: 
text: He leaves, while the soldiers are still PROTESTING.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Myra applies makeup, watching herself in her compact mirror.
text: She becomes aware of eyes, and looks around.
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, Myra and a BUSINESSMAN, sitting across the way,
text: grinning at her. Myra registers him.
dialog: 
text: CU, Myra, considering the possibilities. Then she shrugs,
text: shakes her head at the businessman almost reluctantly, and
text: goes back to applying makeup.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Roy now sits with the soldiers, eagerly listening to them
text: talk. There are plastic glasses enough on the table for three
dialog: rounds of drinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 3
dialog: (to Soldier 2)
dialog: Yeah, but it was you like told the
dialog: sergeant your grandmother was dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Again!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: (to Soldier 3)
dialog: And you jumped right in.
dialog: (broad imitation)
dialog: I'll drive him, Sarge, he's too
dialog: distraught.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 4
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: Distraught? You said distraught?
dialog: 
text: They all laugh, Roy laughing with them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Boy! You guys could've got in a lot
dialog: of trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 3
dialog: Nah. Old Sarge, he's slowing down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I don't know. I wouldn't take a
dialog: chance like that.
dialog: (looks at floor)
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
text: They watch as he bends, picks up one die from the floor,
text: holds it where they can all see it, his manner open,
dialog: guileless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY (CONT'D)
dialog: One of you fellows drop this?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Myra walks down the aisle, demurely looking at no one.

scene_heading: INT. BAR CAR - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: You can't buy every round!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 3
dialog: Like our turn!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Tell you what. We'll roll for it.
dialog: Low number buys.
dialog: 
text: He hands the die to Soldier 2.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Go ahead. You roll for the four of
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: The soldiers are confused but agreeable, seeing this as some
dialog: kind of fun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 2
dialog: Here goes.
dialog: 
text: He tosses the die on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 3
dialog: That's a four!
dialog: 
text: Roy picks up the die.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE close on Roy, his eyes glittering, his fist with the
text: die shaking beside his head.
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT. Roy throws. They all look at the die. Roy spreads
dialog: his hands; the good sport.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Told you I'd buy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: It just doesn't seem fair, Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Myra reaches the end of one car, starts through.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Myra about to enter. She stops, looking through
text: the glass in the door.
dialog: 
text: Myra's POV: Roy and the soldiers rolling the die for money.
dialog: 
text: ECU, Myra, absorbed, watching.
dialog: 
text: Myra's POV: MOS through the glass. ECU, Roy's hand with the

dialog: 
text: ECU, Myra, smiling, pleased.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A brightly lit Hopperish place. Lilly sits alone in a booth
text: eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside
text: the bowl. A DRUNK with a great deal of faith in his own charm
text: sits with a male FRIEND at the counter, drinking coffee. The
text: drunk keeps looking toward Lilly, grinning, COMMENTING
text: playfully to his friend, who's bored by it all. Lilly doesn't
dialog: seem to be aware of him.
dialog: 
text: The drunk rises from his stool, turning toward Lilly,
text: staggering slightly. His friend makes a small move to stop
text: him, then shrugs and lets him go. The drunk makes his way to
text: Lilly's table, leans on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat
dialog: alone. Whadaya wanna eat alone for?
dialog: 
text: Lilly gives him a flat look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Go away.
dialog:

speaker_heading: LILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Could I have some coffee, please?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Right away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: We could have coffee together. My
dialog: name's Kenny.
dialog: 
text: Lilly looks over at the drunk's friend, who pointedly ignores
dialog: the situation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Your pal wants you.
dialog: 
dialog: The drunk could turn mean; his gesture brushing away the idea
dialog: of his friend is stronger than necessary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: Let him find his own pretty woman.
dialog: 
text: The waitress arrives, with the coffee pot and a mug. She puts
text: the mug on the table, pours coffee.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: This fellow bothering you, Ma'am?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (to the drunk)
dialog: Why don't you go sit down?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: I'll sit here. Move over.
dialog: 
text: The drunk wants to sit beside Lilly, who looks to the
text: waitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there
text: with the coffee pot, looking helpless. The drunk bends to
text: slide onto the seat. Lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him
dialog: in the throat.
dialog: 
text: The drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing),
text: staggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that
text: she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls
text: heavily onto the floor.
dialog: 
text: Lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Oh! Are you all right?
dialog: 
text: She goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own
text: throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale. Lilly
text: looks up at the astonished waitress.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I shouldn't have hit him that hard.
dialog: I guess I don't know my own
dialog: strength.
dialog: 
text: The drunk's friend arrives and helps Lilly get the drunk to
text: his feet. The drunk is breathing now, but shaken. He looks at
text: Lilly with reproachful eyes. His friend transfers his
dialog: annoyance at the drunk to Lilly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: You didn't have to do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: I thought I did. You should take
dialog: better care of your friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: (mumbled)
dialog: Outta here.
dialog: 
text: The drunk and his friend head for the exit, as Lilly turns to
dialog: the waitress.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
dialog: without being bothered.
dialog: 
text: The waitress is apologetic, and also in awe of Lilly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: It won't happen again, Ma'am, I
text: promise. Dinner's on the house.
dialog: More chili? Dessert? We have lovely
dialog: pecan pie, my husband makes it
dialog: himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Lilly sits down as the waitress goes back behind the counter.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on the waitress, as she puts down the coffee pot,
text: brings out the pecan pie, prepares to slice it, pauses, looks
dialog: with wonder toward Lilly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The setting is a wide porch or lanai pretending to be a 19th
dialog: century locale; a mix of western and antebellum south; the
dialog: usual tourist confusion of histories. The effect is both
text: romantic and false. Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the
text: end of their meal. Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive. Myra's
text: pleased but watchful, the bird watching the worm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You were right, I had to get out of
dialog: that hospital. Nothing wrong with
dialog: me any more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (purring)
dialog: I'll sign that affidavit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Great to get away, take it easy.
dialog: Next week, I'll get back to work.

speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You already went back to work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (indulgent smile)
dialog: I watched you. Working the tap on
dialog: those soldier boys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (elaborate innocence)
dialog: Working the what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Oh, come on, Roy.
dialog: 
text: She mimes rolling the die, slowly, showing how it will roll
text: out of her hand just so, then speaks to him as though to a
dialog: bright child.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: The tap. What you do for a living.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I'm a salesman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You're on the grift. Same as me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (demonstrating patience)
dialog: Myra, I'm not following this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (demonstrating
dialog: exasperation)
dialog: Roy, you're a short-con operator.
dialog: And a good one, I think. Don't talk
dialog: to me like I'm another square.
dialog: 
text: Roy leans back, studying her, thinking it over, makes up his
dialog: mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You talk the lingo. What's your
dialog: pitch?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: The long end. Big con.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Nobody does that single-o.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I was teamed ten years with the
dialog: best in the business. Cole Langley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I've heard the name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: It was beautiful. And getting
dialog: better all the time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: Is that right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (enthusiasm building)
dialog: It is, Roy! And now, right now,
dialog: it's the perfect time, the best
dialog: time since I've been in the game.

scene_heading: EXT. DESERTED DOWNTOWN - DAY
dialog: 
text: New skyscrapers are separated by blank fields or small older
text: buildings. Almost no traffic. A white limo drives alone down
dialog: the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: All over the southwest, you've got
dialog: these businessmen, they were making
dialog: money when everybody was making
dialog: money, they think that means
dialog: they're smart.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - DAY
dialog: 
text: Myra, dressed expensively and fashionably, sits with
text: GLOUCESTER HEBBING, a stocky businessman, sixtyish. Their
dialog: manner suggests intimacy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: And now they're hurting. Everything
dialog: they had was because of oil.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
dialog: 
text: Glossy, but no people around. The limo stops, the mustached
text: CHAUFFEUR hops out and holds the door as Myra and Hebbing
text: emerge and cross to enter the building, Myra carrying an
dialog: attache case.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: They still got money, but they need
dialog: more money, and that's just the
dialog: kind of guy Cole and me like.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - DAY
dialog: 
text: The chauffeur gets back behind the wheel, adjusts the
text: interior mirror so he can see himself, peels off his
text: moustache, scratches his upper lip, refits the moustache more
dialog: to his liking.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATRIUM - DAY
dialog: 
text: This building has a central atrium with corridors circling
text: it, waist-high walls on the atrium side, glass-walled
text: elevators rising up through the atrium. Myra and Hebbing are
text: visible in an elevator coming up to a high floor. It stops
text: and they exit, moving down the corridor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: When the oil money was good, they
dialog: put up all these office buildings,
dialog: and now they're half empty.

dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE showing the well-furnished outer office, the

text: someone she knows, gesturing her through, Myra graciously
text: accepting, moving on. Hebbing's impressed by everything,
dialog: trying not to show it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: They'll give you anything to move
dialog: in; first two months free,
dialog: redecoration, whatever you want.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE in a clerical office, four CLERKS at well-equipped
text: desks with computer terminals, hard at work.
text: Maps and clocks on the walls indicate the world. Myra and
text: Hebbing pass through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: They help you set up the store!
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE in the PRIVATE SECRETARY'S office, she on the phone,

text: leads the way, opening a door marked HENRY FELLOWES, Partner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Myra and Hebbing enter an office decorated with sleekly

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever.
dialog: 
text: He lifts a dubious eyebrow toward Hebbing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (gentle disapproval)
dialog: I see you brought a friend.
dialog: 
text: As Mary Beth, Myra has a faint southern-belle accent and a
text: clinging flirtatiousness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my
dialog: strong right arm. Gloucester
dialog: Hebbing, may I present my fine
dialog: stockbroker, Henry Fellowes.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (gaily innocent)

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: Mary Beth, I hope you aren't
dialog: spreading this good news too
dialog: widely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Well, of course not! I know how
dialog: dangerous this is. But I would
dialog: trust Mister Hebbing with anything.
dialog: (to Hebbing; suggestive)
dialog: Wouldn't I, darling?
dialog: 
text: While Hebbing looks manly and flustered and pleased, Cole
text: brings from under his desk a partially full gray canvas sack
dialog: marked Federal Reserve Bank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Well, I'll have to take your word
dialog: for it, Mary Beth. Here's your
dialog: money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (innocent avarice)
dialog: Goody!
dialog: 
text: Myra opens her attache case on the desk. Cole takes banded
text: stacks of bills from the sack, packs them neatly in the case.
text: Hebbing tries not to look envious and impressed.
dialog: 
text: HEBBING'S POV: The top bill in each stack is a hundred.
dialog: 
text: PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra takes a stack, riffles it for Hebbing's
dialog: benefit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Isn't that just beautiful?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: Yes, it is.

speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Oh, I know, I know, and you've been
dialog: wonderful since I was widowed. But
dialog: Mister Hebbing has--
dialog: (to Hebbing)
dialog: -- you don't mind my telling him,

speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: Top up the tanks, as It were. Until

dialog: economy comes to an end.
dialog: (man to man laugh)
dialog: Not that I understand exactly what

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: MYRA

dialog: So here we are!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (solemn)
dialog: Mister Hebbing, we are talking
dialog: about breaking the law here, I want
dialog: to be sure you understand that. No
dialog: one gets hurt, but the law does get
dialog: broken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: (a real sport; laughing)
dialog: Well, that's what the law's for,
dialog: isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (still serious)
dialog: And I don't just mean the SEC. We
dialog: could have the FBI breathing down
dialog: our necks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: (suddenly serious)
dialog: I certainly hope not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Loose talk is the one thing I worry

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours
dialog: ahead of us, New York one hour
dialog: behind. There isn't one hour of the

dialog: have a young fellow working here --
dialog: Do you know what a hacker is,
dialog: Mister Hebbing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: One of those computer geniuses,
dialog: isn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You're right! And this boy tapped
dialog: into that main link between Tokyo
dialog: and the New York Stock Exchange. He
dialog: can give us, when it's really
dialog: useful, a seven second delay in
dialog: that movement of information. Do
dialog: you know what that means?
dialog: 
dialog: Hebbing doesn't want to admit ignorance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: Well, you've got your information
dialog: ahead of New York, I see that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Every once in a while, a major

dialog: We have seven seconds to take
dialog: advantage, put our buy order, our
dialog: sell order, into the computer in
dialog: New York before the Tokyo data
dialog: comes in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: Not much time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: We have to be ready. We have to

dialog: what the information means, and we
dialog: have to move immediately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Seven seconds. I don't see how you
dialog: do it.

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's quite a sight. You sure?
dialog: 
text: Cole's pushing this too far. Hebbing's thinking politeness
text: requires him to look. Myra's nervous, her smile with an edge
dialog: to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's
dialog: patience. He knows what machines

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY (V.O.)
dialog: Cole liked to take risks, huh?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Roy and Myra at the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: He didn't think they were risks. He
dialog: was so good, Roy, he could just
dialog: play with the mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: And when he got serious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: He'd explain he had to have cash,
dialog: so there wouldn't be any paper
dialog: trail for the SEC. And a lot of
dialog: cash, or it wasn't worth while. The
dialog: least we ever took was forty
dialog: thousand, and the most was one
dialog: hundred eighty-five thousand
dialog: dollars! From one sucker!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I thought these people were broke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They
dialog: had savings accounts, stocks to
dialog: sell, houses to mortgage. Sell
dialog: their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had
dialog: a lot of money, when they put their
dialog: minds to it.
dialog: Or when I put their minds to it. I
dialog: stayed with them, that's the
dialog: roper's job, made them get up every
dialog: penny they could raise, turn it all
dialog: over to Cole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: And a month later, the sucker calls
dialog: the cops and you're on the run.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: No no! He never calls the cops, not
dialog: after we give him the blow-off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Yeah? How?

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Myra puts a blood-filled four-inch-square plastic package

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: Three or four days after Cole got
dialog: the money, he'd phone the sucker,

scene_heading: EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY

speaker_heading: HEBBING
dialog: I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I
dialog: had moments I was worried.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You brought a case? Good.
dialog: 
text: Cole brings out the canvas sack from under the desk, reaches
text: in, brings out a stack of bills. The door opens and two men

dialog: badge. (These are, altered, two of the clerks from before.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hold it right there!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (cool outrage)
dialog: What? This is a private office!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with

dialog: 
text: Cole suddenly loses all control, becomes a gibbering wreck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Oh, my God! No! The scandal!
dialog: 
text: The second man approaches Hebbing, pencil and notebook at the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: Your name?

speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Mister Fellowes, that isn't going

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: You ruined me! You destroyed me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Henry, no!
dialog: 
text: Cole shoots her, the SOUND very loud, the men flinching away.
text: Myra slaps her hand to her breast; blood spurts between her
text: fingers. In terror, she turns toward Hebbing, who stares at
text: the blood seeping down her white blouse. She tries to speak,
text: can't. She reaches out, her bloody hand sliding down
text: Hebbing's front without getting any purchase, leaving a swath
text: of blood diagonally across his jacket, shirt and tie. She
text: topples forward. Hebbing tries to hold her, but she slips to
dialog: the floor.
dialog: 
text: Cole runs around the desk toward the door, waving the gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Get back! Get back!
dialog: 
text: The men warily move away from the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: I'll kill the first one that
dialog: follows me!
dialog: 
text: Cole runs from the room. The two men pull guns from hip
text: holsters under their coat-tails. Hebbing, kneeling beside
text: Myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through.
text: Hebbing rises, looks around, runs to the inner door, finds it
text: locked. He crosses to the main door, looks out, cautiously
text: creeps from the room.
dialog: 
text: Myra sits up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Hebbing hurries through the empty secretary's office and out
text: the other door. The two men enter from a different door and
text: cross to re-enter Cole's office.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATRIUM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cole stands behind a pillar, watching. Across the way,
text: Hebbing comes out of the office, staring around, trying to
text: wipe the blood from his clothes. In obvious panic, he runs to
text: the elevator, presses the button.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE through the glass wall into the elevator as it
text: stops. The doors open, Hebbing hurries in, frantically jabs
text: the button. The elevator descends. CAMERA PANS to Cole coming
text: around the corridor, entering the office.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: General hilarity. The secretary, two men, other two clerks,
text: chauffeur and receptionist are all present, opening
text: champagne, Hebbing's money now out of the sack and spread on
text: the desk. Myra, stripped to the waist (unconcerned about the
text: others present) cleans blood from her breasts with damp
text: towels. He and Myra look at one another across the room,
dialog: broadly smile.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: Myra's very up, from reliving this story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Oh, Roy, it was great! We were
dialog: rolling in dough, lived wherever we
dialog: wanted, only pulled two or three
dialog: scams a year.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What happened to Cole?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (suddenly evasive)
dialog: He retired.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Upstate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Upstate where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Atascadero.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That's where they keep the

dialog: 
text: Myra turns her face away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Expensive room. Cole, naked, expression haunted and crazed,
text: sits cross-legged on the bed. Myra enters, happy, carrying
text: dress shop boxes. She stops, shocked, when she sees Cole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: No, baby. Not again.
dialog: 
text: He stares at the floor over the edge of the bed, like a
text: shipwreck victim in a raft looking at the sea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: It's hollow. You'll fall through.
dialog: 
text: Myra drops the packages on a chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (frightened but
dialog: determined)
dialog: Can't move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: It's just the strain again, the
dialog: stress. We'll take a vacation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
text: It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
dialog: 
text: She approaches him, scared but needing him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Cole, you scare me when this
dialog: happens. One of these times...
dialog: 
text: She touches him. He suddenly lashes out, knocking her
text: backward, glaring at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Demon! Demon! That's why you can
dialog: walk on it! Demon!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (heartbroken)
dialog: Oh, Cole, please. Please come out
dialog: of it. What would I do without you?
dialog: 
text: Distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around,
text: hugs himself, sits staring at demons. She watches him,
text: mournful, knowing he's gone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Myra looks back at Roy. Her expression makes it clear she
dialog: isn't going to tell him any more than she already has.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: He retired, and that's it. But I
dialog: didn't. I'm still the best long-con
dialog: roper you'll ever see.
dialog: 
text: Roy laughs, genuinely pleased by her and also tacitly letting
dialog: his questions drop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I just bet you are, too. And now
dialog: you're trying to rope me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (pushing enthusiasm)
dialog: Join up with you! I watched you,
dialog: Roy, I've been watching you,
dialog: wondering if I should talk about
dialog: this at all, or maybe just...
dialog: (shrug)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Take a hike, you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I need a partner, Roy. I need an
dialog: inside man, and you're it. You
dialog: could be as wonderful as Cole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (dubious)
dialog: I don't know, Myra, I never had
dialog: partners. I never needed them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Not to take soldiers for a hundred
dialog: bucks. But how about taking a bank
dialog: president for a hundred grand?
dialog: 
text: Roy doesn't like this; he's feeling pressured. Myra sees it,
dialog: but believes she's got him anyway, so she can let up. She
text: pats his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Think about it. Okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (easy to promise)
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A little drunk and happy, Roy and Myra come down the corridor
dialog: together, then make it obvious they're going into separate
text: rooms, across the corridor from one another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (coy, sexy)
dialog: See you later.
dialog: 
text: Roy complains, but half-heartedly, half humorously; this
dialog: argument has already taken place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I still don't see why we have to
dialog: have separate rooms. You expect
dialog: your father to come through?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Separate bathrooms, darling. I will
dialog: not lay out all my cosmetics for
dialog: you to knock over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (nevertheless grumpy)
dialog: Things a man isn't supposed to
dialog: know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (soothing)
dialog: You don't mind, really, do you,
dialog: Roy? It's been such a wonderful
dialog: evening, I guess I just wore myself
dialog: out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
dialog: 
text: They unlock the opposing doors, look back at one another.
text: Myra's smile and good-night wave are consciously cute. Roy's
text: response is a little forced. They go into their rooms.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Once he's alone, Roy stops trying to look like a good sport.
text: Disgusted, he tosses the room key onto the dresser, then
text: crosses to sliding glass doors closed in front of a balcony.
text: He's about to close the drapes when he looks out, changes his
text: mind, unlocks and opens the door. He steps outside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A high floor, with a wide view of ocean and starry sky. Roy
text: leans on the rail, looking out, thinking. He mutters to
dialog: himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Long con. I'm the one's been
dialog: conned. Who needs this?
dialog: 
text: He continues to stand there, taking some solace from the
text: night. BEAT. Phone RINGS. Confused, irritated, he turns to
text: look into the room. Phone RINGS. At last, he goes back into
dialog: the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Roy crosses to pick up the phone, grumpy and suspicious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Yeah?

speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Open your door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY

dialog: What for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (V.O.)
dialog: (filtered)
dialog: Open it and find out.
dialog: 
text: Roy hangs up and crosses to the door.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE directly at the door as Roy opens it, showing Myra's
text: door open across the way, Myra standing in her doorway naked.
text: She waves at him to move over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Gangway!
dialog: 
text: Roy steps back, holding his door open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE down the hall as Myra skips across from her room to
text: Roy's, her door slamming behind her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Myra runs in, giggling. Roy shuts the door, laughing at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (coquettish)
dialog: I hope you don't mind, sir. I just
dialog: washed my clothes, and I couldn't
dialog: do a thing with them.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You -- I don't know.

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

text: A clean anonymous Holiday Inn. Lilly, dressed for the track,
text: sits at the round table under the swag light, sorting through
text: her business purse. There's a folded newspaper on the table.
text: KNOCK on the door. She's startled. For just a second, she's
text: like a trapped animal. Then she's calm again. She turns the
text: purse around, opens another zipper section, removes a pistol
text: and a silencer, quickly screws the silencer onto the pistol,
text: lays the pistol on the table and covers it with the
text: newspaper. Then she crosses to open the door.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE to include Roy in the doorway, grinning, easy.

speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: LILLY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: We won't hit the track. The beach.
dialog: Couple a nice restaurants.
dialog: 
text: He takes from his pockets the wads of money held removed from
text: the clown pictures, extends them toward her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Four grand. For the hospital. Is
dialog: that enough?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (distressed)
dialog: Roy, I don't want money from you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I pay my debts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (level skeptical look)
dialog: You do?
dialog: 
text: Since she won't take the money, he turns to put it on the
text: table beside her purse, pushing the newspaper out of the way,
text: revealing the gun. He gives it a surprised smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Expecting visitors?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: No. That was the point.
dialog: 
text: She crosses to unscrew the silencer and put both pieces back
text: in her purse. Roy, watching, points at the still angry burn
dialog: on her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You ought to put a bandage on that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: No can do. Have to dip in and out
dialog: of my bag too much. Besides, it'll
dialog: heal in the air.
dialog: 
text: Disdainful and hurt, she pushes at the wads of money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Roy, take that back.
dialog: 
text: His own hostility shows through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
dialog: She's not used to being vulnerable, can neither hide it nor
dialog: really express it; can't use it as a tactic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I thought... I was hoping we could
dialog: play it straight with one another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I guess not. You'll be heading east

speaker_heading: LILLY

text: After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Well... nice to see you again,
dialog: Lilly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You, too, Roy.
dialog: 
text: Roy finds this parting unsatisfactory, but has nothing to
text: add. With a shrug, he leaves. Lilly looks after him, her

speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Prick.

scene_heading: EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY

speaker_heading: MYRA

scene_heading: EXT. DELMAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Where the surf meets the turf. Over the punters' heads, out
text: beyond the track, spreads the Pacific Ocean, unnoticed,
text: ignored. In every shot in this sequence, the ocean is visible
dialog: but not looked at.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly, with her heavy shoulderbag, moving along
text: empty tables, here and there picking up used tickets.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Myra, on a different level, watching Lilly.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly at the betting windows.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Myra, on a high vantage point in the stands. A

dialog: if she can borrow them for a minute. Men are always happy to
text: do Myra favors; the man gives her the binoculars. She looks
text: at the field briefly, then turns and looks through the
text: binoculars the other way, outside the track. The man,
dialog: surprised, looks the same way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN'S POV: The parking area.
dialog: 
text: PREVIOUS SHOT. The man looks in curiosity at Myra, who
text: concentrates, adjusting the focus.
dialog: 
text: MYRA'S POV: Foreshortened through the binoculars, Lilly opens

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: She didn't see you, in other words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I'm not trying to make trouble,
dialog: Roy. It's just, she's always so
dialog: nasty to me, I thought, who is she
dialog: to be so high and mighty. I saw her
dialog: out there, and I called a friend of
dialog: mine in Baltimore, so now I know
dialog: who she is.

speaker_heading: ROY

dialog: You must have some very

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Regret what? I didn't say I was

speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: But why not? I thought it was

speaker_heading: ROY

dialog: here. This is time out.
dialog: 
dialog: She considers him.

speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You mean, it would be too tough to

speaker_heading: KAGGS

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: (keen)
dialog: You're turning me down? Makes no

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I guess I'm just not a leader of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: Oh, come on, Roy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: Perk, remember?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I
dialog: like things the way they are now.
dialog: Pick my own hours, have time for,
dialog: uh, other activities...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: A well-rounded life. I respect
dialog: that. But it has to have a center,
dialog: Roy, something you care about,
dialog: something you can think about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Maybe I'm just not ready for that
dialog: yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: (deep sigh)
dialog: Well, Roy, if that's the way you
dialog: feel, I won't badger you.
dialog: (forced laugh)
dialog: Don't want to lose you as a
dialog: salesman, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep
dialog: everything the way it was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAGGS
dialog: That's what we'll do, then. But I
dialog: tell you what, Roy. Before I hire
dialog: anybody else, I'll ask you one last

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Fair enough.

speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Darling, guess what? I had to tell

dialog: And hello to you, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
dialog: the one who plays my chauffeur.
dialog: There's a sucker there he says is
dialog: made for us. And a boroker that
dialog: just shut down, we can use their
dialog: office, not change a thing! Now, I
dialog: can scrape up ten grand without
dialog: much trouble. That leaves fifteen
dialog: or twenty for your end. We could

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Wait a minute! When did this
dialog: happen, that we're partners?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: The last I looked, we were just
dialog: talking things over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: But the setup's there. It's there
dialog: now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I don't think I need it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: You're too good for the small-time,
dialog: Roy. Move up to where there's big
dialog: dough to be made, and you don't
dialog: have to stick your neck out every
dialog: day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Maybe I like it where I am.
dialog: 
text: Myra's need breaks through her good sense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Well, maybe I don't! I had ten good
dialog: years with Cole, and I want them
dialog: back! I gotta have a partner! I
dialog: looked and I looked and believe me,
dialog: brother, I kissed a lot of fucking
dialog: frogs, and you're my prince!
dialog: 
dialog: Roy tries to treat this lightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Don't I get any say in this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: No! Because I --

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (pointing at her)
dialog: That's what I say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: (thrown off course)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What I say is, no. We don't do
dialog: partners.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA (CONT'D)
dialog: (raging)
dialog: For Christ's sake, why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Mostly, because you scare the shit
dialog: out of me. I've seen people like
dialog: you before, baby. Double-tough and
dialog: sharp as they come, and you get
dialog: what you want or else. But you
dialog: don't make it work forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Bullshit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: No; history. Sooner or later, the
dialog: lightning hits. I don't want to be
dialog: around when it hits you.
dialog: 
text: She stares at him, trying to find a chink in the armor,
text: trying to find a reason, trying to find something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: What is it? What's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I'm happy the way I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA

dialog: Lilly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (doesn't get it) )
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Sure it is. That's why you act so

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: Don't act so goddamned innocent!
dialog: You and your own mother, gah! You
dialog: like to go back where you been,
dialog: huh?
dialog: 
text: He takes a step toward her, rising toward fury.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You watch that mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: I'm wise to you, I should have seen
dialog: it before, you rotten son of a
dialog: bitch. How is it, huh? How do you
dialog: like --
dialog: 
text: He slaps her openhanded but hard, and she staggers back. He
text: pursues her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: How do you like this?
dialog: 
text: He slaps her as hard with the other hand. Astonished,
text: frightened, befuddled, she backpedals, bringing her forearms
text: up to protect her face. He grabs her two wrists in one hand,
text: holds them out of the way, slaps her forehand and backhand,
text: forehand and backhand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: STOP!!
dialog: 
text: He suddenly gets control of himself, releases her, steps back
text: into the middle of the room. He's angry, but also remorseful,
dialog: sorry he lost control but still enraged at the enormity of
dialog: her suggestion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That's not like me. I don't do
dialog: violence.
dialog: 
text: She cowers against the wall, peering in terror at him through
text: her raised arms. He settles down, becomes heavily calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That's why we wouldn't work
dialog: together. You're disgusting. Your
dialog: mind's so filthy, it's hard even to
dialog: look at you.
dialog: 
text: He crosses to the apartment door, pulls it open. Sunlight
text: pours in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Goodbye, Myra.
dialog: 
text: She lowers her arms slowly, as though her whole body aches.
dialog: She's still scared, but angry now, too. She'd like to tell
text: him off, but discretion tells her not to. She moves across
text: the room toward the open door, but stops, not wanting to be
dialog: that close to him.
text: Understanding, he backs away from the doorway, gestures with
text: cold irony for her to proceed. She moves to the threshold,
text: looks back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MYRA
dialog: And you don't even know it.
dialog: 
text: Angry again, Roy steps forward. She hastily steps outside,
text: and he slams the door.

dialog: 
text: CU, Roy. He knows. Sharpness comes back into his expression.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIERSON (O.S.)
dialog: That's that, then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (starting to grin)
dialog: Oh, yeah. That's that.
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, Roy and Pierson. Pierson wants to leave, but Roy
text: stands over the gurney. He chuckles. Pierson looks at him,
text: surprised and appalled. Roy ignores him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY (CONT'D)
dialog: (laughing quietly)
dialog: Mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT.

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: MONTAGE. Myra's baby blue Cadillac drives, at extreme high
text: speed, alone on the highway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Myra's Cadillac drives slowly past, comes to a stop at the
text: curb half a block away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE through the windshield at the driver, a woman,
text: deeply weary. Her forearms are crossed on top of the steering
text: wheel, her brow resting on the forearms. The burn on the back
text: of her right hand is visible in illumination from a nearby
text: streetlight. Traffic goes by. BEAT. Lilly lifts her head,
text: looking out at the night. She's very tired, but determined.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE beside Lilly, inside the car. From the seat beside
text: her she picks up Myra's large dangly earrings and fixes them
text: in place. Then she puts on Myra's big-lensed dark sunglasses.
dialog: (She's wearing the clothes Myra wore when checking into the
text: motel.) Lilly checks her appearance in the rearview mirror,
text: then gets out of the car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MADERO LOBBY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Simms at the desk, talking to a TELEPHONE
text: REPAIRMAN steadily at work fixing the switchboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: The last modern thing I liked was
dialog: the miniskirt. Your technology,
dialog: now, nobody understands it, and
dialog: that's the simple fact of the
dialog: situation.
dialog: 
text: Lilly enters in b.g., crosses to the elevator, presses the
text: button. Simms waves to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: (calling) )
dialog: Evening, Mizz Langley!
dialog: 
text: The elevator door opens, Lilly boards and presses the button.
text: The elevator door closes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIMMS
dialog: New things come in here all the
dialog: time, how do they work? You can ask
dialog: your Ph.Ds, your highly educated,
dialog: intelligent, professional people,
dialog: you can say to them, how does that
dialog: work, and you know what they'll
dialog: tell you? You plug it in. And
dialog: that's the way the donut dunks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS BALCONY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The balcony leading to Roy's apartment. It's illuminated by a
text: light next to the public door from the interior hall.
text: AN ANGLE on that door as Lilly cautiously opens it, looks out
text: and around while remaining mostly behind the door, then
text: focuses on the light. She reaches out and unscrews the bulb.
dialog: GO TO BLACK.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Roy's place. Dark. SOUNDS of lock being picked. The door
text: opens, showing only blackness outside, Lilly enters and shuts
text: the door, then switches on the main light.
dialog: 
text: Ah ANGLE on Lilly, in the middle of the room, distractedly
text: biting her thumbnail as she looks around, calculating. She
text: looks directly at something.
dialog: 
text: Lilly's POV: One of the box-framed pictures hanging on the
dialog: wall.
dialog: 
text: PREVIOUS SHOT. Lilly, making up her mind, crosses to the
text: picture and takes it off the wall. She finds it surprisingly
text: heavy. She carries it to the coffee table, puts it down there
text: on its back, sits on the sofa.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the picture. She raps her knuckle
text: against the sides, looks to see if the front or sides open
text: someway, and finally turns the picture over, laying it face
text: down on the coffee table. She sees how to remove the back,
text: lifts it off, and looks at the stacks of money lying in
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: CU, Lilly, almost fainting with relief.
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT. Lilly looks at the other picture, looks again at
text: the money, comes to a conclusion. She rises and leaves the
text: room, deeper into the apartment.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Lilly switches on the light as she enters the room. She looks
text: around, crosses to the closet, goes through the stuff in
text: there, finds an old attache case on the shelf. She brings it
text: out, puts it on the bed, opens it. Inside are a few decks of
text: cards and a paperback book. She tosses them onto the bed,
text: checks the case, finds that one of the clasps works but the
text: other doesn't. One is good enough. She carries the attache
text: case out of the room, leaving the light on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Lilly enters, puts the case on the coffee table beside the
text: picture, scoops the money out of the picture and puts it in
text: the case. Then she unceremoniously dumps the picture on the
dialog: floor.
dialog: 
text: Lilly takes the second picture from the wall, puts it face
text: down on the coffee table, opens the back, transfers the money
text: to the case. She closes the case, attaches the one clasp that
text: works, picks up the case.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY (O.S.)
dialog: Hello, Lilly.
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, as Lilly whirls around, terrified and then
text: relieved. Roy stands in the open apartment doorway, blackness
dialog: behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Oh! Roy! You scared me.
dialog: 
text: Roy enters the room and shuts the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Going somewhere?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Somewhere else, that's for sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I just came back from Phoenix.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (anxious)
dialog: Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down.
dialog: Take a minute, tell me about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I've really got to --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Not for long. Not when they do a
dialog: fingerprint check.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Why should they? The cops are
dialog: satisfied.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Bobo won't be. He'll spend the
dialog: money to make sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Even so. You still got time. Relax
dialog: a minute, tell me what happened.
dialog: Sit down.
dialog: 
text: He gestures at the sofa. Lilly's holding the attache case.
text: The gutted pictures are lying around, one on the coffee table
text: and one on the floor. She looks around at everything, awkward
dialog: and embarrassed. But Roy hasn't said anything. And he's
text: between her and the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Just for a minute.
dialog: 
text: She backs up, sits on the sofa, puts the case on her lap. Roy
text: pulls a chair over so it's directly between Lilly and the
text: door. He sits, looking at her with polite interest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Myra followed you, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: She must have been the one that
dialog: blew me off with Bobo. I guess to
dialog: get me running. Did you tell her
dialog: about my stash?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (isn't worth discussing)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: No, you wouldn't. That's what she
dialog: was after, though. But why hit on
dialog: me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I wouldn't go in on a deal with
dialog: her. She blamed you for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (a shaky laugh)
dialog: As though you do what I say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (cold grin)
dialog: That's pretty funny, all right.
dialog: What happened in Phoenix?
dialog: 
dialog: Remembered emotion makes Lilly talk in little fast clusters
dialog: of words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Roy, it was terrible. You read
dialog: about people killing people and all
dialog: that, but when it happens, my God.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room
dialog: 131.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: She was in her nightgown, you know,
dialog: the old grifter's dodge, nightgown
dialog: and the Ice bucket and she just got
dialog: into the wrong room by mistake.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CU, Lilly asleep. Very dim light. The shadows shift on her
text: face as Myra OUT OF FRAME approaches. Myra's hands ENTER
text: FRAME, abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. Lilly's eyes pop
text: open wide, staring, her mouth stretches open. Myra's arms are
text: locked straight, pressing her weight down onto her hands
text: squeezing Lilly's throat. Lilly clutches at Myra's fingers,
text: tries to reach Myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly
text: lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the
text: pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun
text: upward, straight-arm, the gun moving up OUT OF FRAME. SOUND
text: of shot. Blood sprays Lilly's face. Myra's body drops down
text: onto her, at an angle, so we can still see Lilly's horrified
text: face over Myra's shoulder as Lilly gasps for breath.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Lilly stares across the room, breathing hard, reliving the
dialog: experience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I sat in there with her, I thought,
dialog: what do I do now? Run and I've got
dialog: Bobo and the law after me. Stay,
dialog: and how do I explain?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: This way's perfect.
dialog: 
text: Lilly sits back, showing that relief again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a
dialog: break for me after all.
dialog: I've been wanting out of the racket
dialog: for years, and now I'm out. I can
dialog: make a clean start, and --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You've already made a start.
dialog: Doesn't look that clean, though.
dialog: 
text: Here's the awkwardness. Lilly looks guilty and embarrassed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I'm sorry. I hated to take your
dialog: money, but --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Don't be sorry. You're not taking
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Lilly reacts as though he's slapped her. But then she gets
text: her determination back. She splays out both hands, palm down,
text: on the attache case on her lap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I need this, Roy. I can't run
dialog: without money, and if I can't run
dialog: I'm dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You must have some money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Just a few bucks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: And Myra's stuff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (scornful)
dialog: Her credit cards. How far am I
dialog: gonna get with that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Far enough. Maybe up to San
dialog: Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace
dialog: new. Start over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: At what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You're smart, Lilly, and you're
dialog: good-looking. You won't have any
dialog: trouble finding a job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: A job? I've never had a legit job
dialog: in my life!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Well, you're gonna start, if you
dialog: hope to live through this. A square
dialog: job and a quiet life. You start
dialog: showing up at the track or the hot
dialog: spots and Bobo's boys will be all
dialog: over you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Roy, I know what to do with myself!
dialog: It's a big world out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm
dialog: giving you good advice. I'm
dialog: following it myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (doesn't get it)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I thought it over, and you were
dialog: right. You wanted me out of the
dialog: rackets, and now --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (bedeviled, aggravated)
dialog: Roy, that's fine, but I don't have
dialog: time for this. Bobo --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I thought you'd be happy for me.
dialog: After all, you --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after
dialog: me, and he's goddamn good! But so
dialog: am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I
dialog: survive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I know you do, so that's why --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: And to survive, my way, I need
dialog: money.
dialog: Bobo knows about the stash in the
dialog: car, so I didn't dare touch it, not
dialog: if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that
dialog: leaves this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Lilly sits back again, brooding at Roy, trying to think how
dialog: to get to him, how to get through him or around him. She
text: sighs, licks her lips.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You want a drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I don't think so. You probably
dialog: shouldn't either.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice
dialog: water?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I'll get it.
dialog: 
text: She stands, putting the attache case on the sofa next to
text: where she was sitting. Roy, with a faint smile, watches her
dialog: leave the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Very small, little used. Dark. Lilly switches on the light
text: when she enters, then leans against the counter, fists
text: clenched and trembling on the counter in front of her. She
text: grits her teeth, hyperventilates, stares around the room in
dialog: search of escape, an answer, something.
dialog: 
text: CU, Lilly's face, desperate, grim, but not giving up.
dialog: 
text: WIDE SHOT. Lilly opens cabinets, finds two glasses, opens the
text: nearly-empty refrigerator, gets ice cubes from a tray, puts
text: them in the glasses, puts the partial tray back in the
text: freezer compartment, fills the glasses from the cold water
text: tap, puts the glasses on the counter, stares at them briefly.
text: She then shakes her head, searches the kitchen some more, and
text: finds a cookie sheet she can use as a tray. She puts the
text: glasses on the tray, carries the tray from the room, leaving
dialog: the light on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Lilly enters with the tray, crosses to Roy, presents the
text: glasses, speaks as he reaches for one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Take whichever one you want.
dialog: 
text: He hesitates. It hadn't occurred to him Lilly might try to
text: poison him or knock him out. He grins at her and takes a
dialog: glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: You wouldn't do that.
dialog: 
text: Lilly takes the other glass, puts the cookie sheet on a
text: table, looks down at Roy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You don't know what I'd do, Roy.
dialog: You have no idea. To live.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (easy)
dialog: Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
dialog: 
text: Lilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case,
text: pats it absently as though it is a pet and she's glad it
text: didn't move, waited for her. She sips water, puts the glass
text: on the end table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I know what's bugging you, of
dialog: course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Oh? I didn't know anything was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (twisted grin)
dialog: Oh, really? You've got a legitimate
dialog: complaint, Roy, I don't deny that.
dialog: I wasn't a very good mother when
dialog: you were a kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (full laugh)
dialog: Not very good!
dialog: 
text: She nods, accepting the correction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: A bad mother. By any standards.
dialog: I've thought about it, you know,
dialog: from your side, since then. I know
dialog: just how bad I was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (closed against her)
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: I wonder did you ever think about
dialog: it from my side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (not worth discussing)
dialog: Never.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: No, I guess not. It was pretty
dialog: lousy of me, I guess, to be a child
dialog: at the same time you were. Not to
dialog: stop being a child just because I
dialog: had a child. I guess I was a real
dialog: stinker not to be a grown-up when
dialog: you needed a grown-up.
dialog: 
dialog: Roy didn't expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive, and
dialog: he resents it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: What do you want me to do? Pin a
dialog: halo on you? You're doing a pretty
dialog: good job of that yourself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: And making you feel bad at the same
dialog: time, huh? But that's the way I am,
dialog: you know, the way I've always been.
dialog: Always picking on poor little Roy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: For God's sake, Lilly!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (intense)
dialog: I gave you your life twice. I'm
dialog: asking you to give me mine once. I
dialog: need the money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (not worth discussing)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Lilly subsides back onto the sofa. One hand rests on the
text: attache case. With the other, she sips water, puts the glass
text: back down. Roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless. Lilly
text: frowns, not quite looking at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You're getting off the grift?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: That's good. You don't really
dialog: belong on this side of the fence,
dialog: you know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (amused)
dialog: I don't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: If you stayed a crook, do you think
dialog: you'd live to be my ripe age?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I don't see why not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Well, I guess I got it wrong, then.
dialog: Seems to me I heard about a guy
dialog: just your age that got hit so hard
dialog: in the guts it almost killed him.
dialog: 
text: Roy's again unexpectedly uncomfortable. He shifts uneasily in
text: his chair, trying to think of a response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Well, uh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Sure, sure, that doesn't count.
dialog: That's different.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
dialog: I'm getting out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (intense)
dialog: And that's why you've got to get
dialog: rid of this money. If you keep it
dialog: around, it'll just make you think
dialog: how clever you are.
dialog: It'll be a temptation to get back
dialog: into the game.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (full laugh)
dialog: Oh, that's it! You're stealing my
dialog: money for my own good! How very
dialog: motherly of you, Lilly.
dialog: 
text: Once again, Lilly drops back against the sofa back. Another
text: round in the fight is over. Roy watches her, patient, waiting
dialog: for her to give up, seeing no other outcome.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly, frustrated, feeling the need to move, the
text: pressure of pursuit. Her head turns back and forth, her body
text: starts false gestures. Finally, abruptly, she gets to her
text: feet, looks at Roy, looks away, picks up the attache case.
dialog: 
text: CU, Roy, alert. He won't let her reach the door.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE PANNING with Lilly as she prowls the room, pacing
text: back and forth, the attache case swinging at her side.
text: Finally, she stops, standing the attache case on the coffee
text: table, her hand still on its handle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Lilly.
dialog: 
text: She looks at him, attentive without hope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: If I should get out of the racket,
dialog: that goes double for you. That's
dialog: why you've got to change your life
dialog: completely, go to some town, get a
dialog: square job, live like a john
dialog: yourself. If you try to do it your
dialog: way, what future is in it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: A future. The only future I've got.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: That money wouldn't last forever.
dialog: And then what? You'd be back in
dialog: some other part of the rackets.
dialog: Another Bobo Justus to slap you
dialog: around and burn holes in your
dialog: hands. This way, you've got to go
dialog: the square route. You could send me
dialog: a card when you're settled, I could
dialog: maybe help out sometimes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (bitter laugh) )
dialog: That's what it is, isn't it? Keep
dialog: me down. Your turn to be in charge,
dialog: have the power.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (stonewalling)
dialog: Just trying to help, Lilly.
dialog: 
text: She sits on the sofa again, this time leaving the attache
text: case to stand on the coffee table. She studies Roy,
dialog: calculating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Roy... What if I told you I wasn't
dialog: really your mother? That we weren't
dialog: related?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Lilly leans back again, but this time her manner is
text: different; languorous, sexy. She crosses her legs, the upper
text: leg swinging gently. She smiles gently, encouragingly, at
dialog: Roy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sure
dialog: you would. You don't need to tell
dialog: me. Now, why would you like it,
dialog: Roy?
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Roy, understanding and not wanting to understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: What's that all about? Of course
dialog: you're my mother. Of course you
dialog: are.
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT. Lilly leans forward toward Roy, inviting him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (very soft)
dialog: Roy... Roy
dialog: 
dialog: Roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: There's nothing more to talk about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: (very soft)
dialog: I have to have that money, Roy.
dialog: What do I have to do to get it?
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Roy, his face bruised-looking, eyes scared. He
text: will not know what's going on. He shakes his head, not
dialog: trusting himself to speak.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE on Lilly, leaning forward, tension showing through
dialog: the seductive manner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: No? Won't you give me the money,
dialog: Roy? Can't I change your mind? What
dialog: can I do to change your mind?
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, as Lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward
text: him. Roy's pressed back into his chair, trying to maintain a
dialog: cold facade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LILLY
dialog: Is there nothing I can do, Roy,
dialog: nothing at --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: NO!
dialog: 
text: They both turn away at the same instant. Roy turns to the
dialog: side to pick up the glass of water, to break the spell and
text: the tension. Lilly turns back toward the coffee table and
text: picks up the attache case. Roy, lifting the glass to drink,
text: turns forward again as Lilly spins forward, swinging the
text: attache case at his head with all her might. The case crashes
text: into the glass and into his face. Roy SCREAMS and topples off
text: the chair, as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and
text: money goes flying, filling the air.
dialog: 
text: AN ANGLE DOWN at Roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to
text: his throat. A large triangle of glass is in his throat. Blood
text: pumps thickly, fountaining up.
dialog: 
text: CU, Lilly, staring down in horror. She lurches forward, but
text: there's nothing to do. She stares around.
dialog: 
text: ECU, wads of bills on the floor, getting bloody.
dialog: 
text: CU, Lilly, in agony, but looking down, kicking.
dialog: 
text: ECU, Lilly's feet kicking the bills away from the blood.
dialog: 
text: TWO SHOT, as Lilly drops to her knees beside Roy, who's
text: already dying. Blood spurts less forcefully. His hands fall
text: to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly.
text: Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him,
text: willing it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull.
text: Lilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't
text: dare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she
