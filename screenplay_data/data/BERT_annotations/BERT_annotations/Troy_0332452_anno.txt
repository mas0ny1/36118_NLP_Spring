scene_heading: EXT. THESSALIAN VALLEY - DAY 1
text: A mangy, bone-thin DOG lopes across the broad valley
text: floor, sniffing at the ground. At first the scene
text: appears bucolic: tall grass, patches of wildflowers, blue
text: sky above.
text: But as the dog keeps running we see signs of conflict. A
text: spear, half imbedded in the earth, rises at an angle. A
text: bronze helmet, cracked and bloodied, lies on its side.
text: The dog pauses to sniff the helmet then continues his
text: search. Finally he stops, hackles on his back rising,
text: ears pricked up. He growls, and we see what the dog sees.
text: Dozens of CROWS have descended into a shallow ravine.
text: They squabble and peck, clustered around something on the
dialog: ground.
text: The dog growls louder and charges at the crows. The black
text: birds flap away to safety, shrieking in protest.
text: A DEAD SOLDIER lies facedown in the ravine. Whatever
text: armor he wore was stripped away, leaving his body to the
dialog: elements.
text: The dog walks slowly to the dead man, sniffing at the
text: corpse's hands. The dog whines and licks the man's
dialog: fingers.
text: Something in the air disturbs the dog, who looks up. And
text: now we hear it, faintly, in the distance. HOOF BEATS and
text: chariot wheels, marching men, the clank of bronze armor
dialog: and weaponry.
text: The dog runs, abandoning his dead master.
scene_heading: THE MYCENAEAN ARMY 1A
text: five thousand strong, storms into the valley from the
text: south. Armored with bronze breastplates, helmets and
text: shields, the soldiers glitter in the morning sun.
text: Riding alongside the infantry are dozens of horse-drawn
text: CHARIOTS, each holding a DRIVER, a SPEARMAN and an
speaker_heading: OFFICER.
text: On the opposite side of the valley, three thousand
text: THESSALONIAN SOLDIERS march into view. The Thessalonians
dialog: are less disciplined, their armor and weaponry less
dialog: impressive.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

text: When each army reaches the battlefield they stop and stare
text: one another down, two hundred yards distant.
scene_heading: A MYCENAEAN CHARIOT AND A THESSALONIA CHARIOT 1B
text: emerge from their respective sides and meet at the center
dialog: of the field.
text: AGAMEMNON, king of the Mycenaeans, rides in his chariot
text: with a DRIVER and a SPEARMAN. Agamemnon holds a gold
text: SCEPTER, symbol of command. His breast plate is engraved
dialog: with an Alpha.
text: His counterpart in the Thessalonian cart, TRIOPAS (60),
text: does not project equal confidence. He eyes the size of
text: the Mycenaean army with evident unease. He holds his own
speaker_heading: SCEPTER.
text: Both kings step down from their chariots and approach each
text: other. They stare at one another for several seconds.
text: Agamemnon smiles and looks into the sky.
text: The crows wheel overhead, cawing.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: It's a good day for the crows.
speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: I told you yesterday and I'll tell
dialog: you again today. Remove your army
dialog: from my land.
text: Agamemnon smiles again and turns to examine the valley.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: I like your land. I think we'll
dialog: stay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I like your soldiers, too. They
dialog: fought bravely yesterday. Not
text: well, but bravely.
speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: They'll never fight for you.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: That's what the Messenians said,
dialog: too. And the Arcadians. And the
dialog: Epeians. They're all fighting for
dialog: me, now.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 1B
speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: You can't rule the whole world,
dialog: Agamemnon. It's too big. Even for
dialog: you.
text: Agamemnon surveys Triopas's army.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: I don't want to watch another
dialog: massacre. Let's end this war in
dialog: the old manner.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your best fighter against my best.
text: For the first time, Triopas looks hopeful.
speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: And if my man wins?
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: We'll leave Thessaly for good.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm a generous man. If mine wins,
dialog: you keep your throne. But Thessaly
dialog: falls under my command, to fight
dialog: with me whenever I call.
text: Triopas considers before nodding. He shouts to his army.
speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: Boagrius!
text: The Thessalonians murmur and step aside. A giant emerges
text: from their midst, BOAGRIUS, a foot taller than the other
text: men, his face gouged with old knife scars. He marches out
dialog: to his king.
speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: Here is my champion.
text: Agamemnon raises his eyebrows as the giant comes closer.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: (shouting to his army)
dialog: Achilles!
text: The Mycenaeans murmur amongst themselves, looking for
text: Achilles. Nobody emerges. Agamemnon frowns.
speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: Boagrius has this effect on many
dialog: heroes.

speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: Be careful whom you insult, old
dialog: king.
text: An OFFICER on horseback gallops from the Mycenaean ranks
text: to the center of the field. He bows his head to
dialog: Agamemnon.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
text: Achilles is not with the army.
text: Triopas laughs and looks up at Boagrius, who chuckles.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: I sent a boy to look for him.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY 2
text: A BOY (12) on a roan HORSE gallops through the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. MYCENAEAN CAMP - DAY 3
text: The boy rides into the camp. Scores of tents stand on the
text: banks of a river. The only men around are COOKS tending
text: fires and ARMORERS, mending armor and weapons.
text: The boy dismounts at one large tent in the corner of the
text: camp. He pulls open the tent flap and steps inside.
scene_heading: INT. ACHILLES' TENT - CONTINUOUS 4
text: The boy pauses for a moment inside the tent, eyes
text: adjusting to the dim light. Evidently last night was a
text: wild party. Jugs of wine are everywhere, and the remains
text: of a large feast.
text: Sleeping on a fur rug are two NAKED WOMEN and one NAKED
text: MAN, tanned arms and legs entwined. The boy sidesteps
text: shards of a broken jug. He bends to tap the sleeping
text: man's shoulder.
text: Before his fingers make contact, a hand shoots out, grabs
text: his wrist, and pulls him to the rug. The boy finds
text: himself flat on his back with a dagger to his throat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Shh.
text: The boy stares into the eyes of ACHILLES (30), who seems
text: to have barely moved. Somehow he managed to seize the boy
text: and put a knife to his throat without waking the women.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I was having a good dream.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A very good dream.
text: The boy nods, dumb with fear. Achilles has the lean,
text: efficient physique of a boxer. His face and body are dark
text: from a summer spent in the sun.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: King Agamemnon sent me. He
dialog: needs --
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: I'll speak with your king in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: But my lord -- it is morning.
text: Achilles frowns. He stands and walks naked to the tent
text: flap, holds it open and stares at the empty encampment.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: They're waiting for you.
scene_heading: EXT. MYCENAEAN CAMP 5
text: Achilles prepares for battle, strapping on his
text: breastplate. The boy assists him, fixing the bronze
text: greaves to his legs.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Are the stories about you true?
dialog: They say your mother is an immortal
dialog: goddess.
text: Achilles lifts up his shield. He slips his left forearm
text: into the leather straps on the inside of the shield.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: They say you can't be killed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 5
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: I wouldn't be bothering with the
dialog: shield then, would I?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: The Thessalonian you're fighting
dialog: -- he's the biggest man I've ever
dialog: seen.
text: Achilles mounts the boy's horse.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I wouldn't want to fight him.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: That's why no one will remember
dialog: your name.
text: Achilles gallops away, leaving the boy standing alone.
scene_heading: EXT. THESSALIAN VALLEY 6
text: Agamemnon confers with his OFFICERS on the battlefield,
text: including KING NESTOR (65), his trusted advisor.
text: When Achilles rides into view the Mycenaean soldiers
text: CHEER. Some cry out his name. Agamemnon and his officers
text: turn to watch Achilles dismount and approach them.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: Perhaps we should have our war
dialog: tomorrow, when you're better
dialog: rested?
text: Achilles ignores the king and examines the waiting giant.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: I should have you whipped for
text: impudence.
text: Achilles wheels on the king.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Who's giving the whipping?
text: He walks toward Agamemnon, fingers curling over the hilt
text: of his sword. Nestor slides in between Achilles and the
dialog: king.
speaker_heading: NESTOR
dialog: Achilles.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: 6 CONTINUED: 6
text: Achilles, nostrils flared, eyes narrowed, stares at
text: Agamemnon. Neither man is willing to turn away.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: (to Agamemnon)
dialog: Why don't you fight him yourself?
dialog: Wouldn't that be a sight, a king
dialog: who fights his own battles?
speaker_heading: NESTOR
dialog: Achilles.
text: Achilles finally turns and looks at him.
speaker_heading: NESTOR
text: Look at the men's faces.
text: Achilles surveys the faces of the battle-weary soldiers.
speaker_heading: NESTOR
dialog: You can save hundreds of them. You
dialog: can end this war with a swing of
dialog: your sword.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Think how many songs they'll sing
dialog: in your honor.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let them go home to their wives.
text: The soldiers, awed in his presence, stare at Achilles. He
text: finally turns and walks toward Boagrius.
text: Agamemnon watches Achilles with undisguised hostility.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: (to Nestor, under
dialog: his breath)
dialog: Of all the warlords loved by the
dialog: gods, I hate him most.
speaker_heading: NESTOR
dialog: We need him, my king.
speaker_heading: AGAMEMNON
dialog: For now.
speaker_heading: 6A ACHILLES 6A
text: When Achilles is forty yards from the giant, Boagrius
text: turns to his army and shakes his spear over his head.
text: They cheer, slamming their bronze swords against their
text: bronze shields.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 6A
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 6A
text: Achilles keeps coming. He looks up at the circling crows.
text: Boagrius turns and throws his spear. The bronze spearhead
text: glitters in the sun, blazing straight for Achilles.
text: Without breaking stride, Achilles raises the shield. The
text: spearhead blasts through the bronze skin of the shield,
text: through the thick leather on the underside, stopping
text: inches from Achilles' face.
text: Achilles keeps coming.
text: Boagrius hoists a second spear and hurls it, grunting with
text: effort. Again Achilles raises his shield, again the
text: spearhead tears through the shield but does not harm
dialog: Achilles.
text: Achilles casts aside the shield and keeps coming.
text: Boagrius unsheathes his tremendous bronze sword. He opens
text: his mouth, lets loose a battle cry, and charges at
dialog: Achilles.
text: When Boagrius raises his sword, Achilles lunges forward
text: with terrifying speed. It does not seem possible that he
text: could close the gap between them so quickly, but he does,
text: thrusting his sword straight through Boagrius'
text: breastplate.
text: Achilles pulls his sword from the giant's chest and
text: continues walking toward the Thessalonian line, never
text: looking back.
text: Boagrius stares down at the hole in his breastplate.
text: Blood pumps out, pouring down the polished bronze. He
text: topples over.
text: The Mycenaean Army ERUPTS with exultant victory cries.
text: Achilles now stands in front of the massed Thessalonian
text: troops. He searches from face to face. None of the
text: soldiers are willing to make eye contact with him.
text: Finally Triopas steps out of the ranks.
speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: Who are you, soldier?
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Achilles, son of Peleus.

speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: Achilles. I won't forget the name.

speaker_heading: TRIOPAS
dialog: The ruler of Thessaly carries this
dialog: scepter. Give it to your king.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: He's not my king.
text: Achilles walks west, away from both armies. The soldiers
text: watch him go in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. IONIAN SEA - DUSK 7
text: We're high above the wine-dark sea, gliding north. Soon
text: the Peloponnesian coast comes into view. The only break
text: in the shoreline is the inlet of Laconia, and we follow it
dialog: inland.
text: The inlet ends in a natural harbor where several tall-
text: masted warships are beached, sails unfurled, oars locked
text: and rowing benches empty. Dozens of smaller fishing boats
text: are scattered about the harbor.
text: On top of the highest hill, overlooking all Sparta, stands
text: a thick-walled PALACE. Torch-bearing SENTRIES, wearing
text: plumed helmets and carrying long spears, man their posts.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS (V.0.)
dialog: Princes of Troy, on our last night
dialog: together, Queen Helen and I salute
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. PALACE OF SPARTA - RECEPTION HALL - CONTINUOUS 8
text: MENELAUS (40), king of Sparta, stands at the head of a
text: massive table that spans the length of a hall lit by
text: torches. A battle-scarred warrior, Menelaus is already
text: halfway drunk.
text: Beside Menelaus sits his wife, HELEN (25), wearing a white
text: gown, head bowed, half listening to her husband. Fresh
text: flowers are woven into her hair. Her beauty is so extreme
text: she seems to exist in a separate realm.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 8
text: The only woman in the room and the only one wearing white,
text: Helen shines amidst the unwashed WARRIORS of Sparta and
text: Troy. All sit at a table laden with platters of roasted
text: game birds, whole fish, octopi, suckling pigs and bowls of
dialog: fruit.
text: Menelaus holds his gold wine goblet in the air, toasting
text: his honored guests, HECTOR (35) and PARIS (25).
text: Hector is not the best-looking man in the room, nor the
text: largest, but the intensity of his expression, the regality
text: of his bearing, confirms that he is a born leader.
text: Paris is the best-looking man in the room, by a long shot.
text: He's not paying attention to Menelaus. He's staring at
dialog: Helen.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: We've had our conflicts before,
dialog: it's true. We've fought many
dialog: battles, Sparta and Troy. And
dialog: fought well!
text: Menelaus's soldiers cheer drunkenly. For a moment Helen
text: looks up and meets Paris's gaze.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: But I've always respected your
dialog: father. Priam is a good man, a
dialog: good king. I respected him as an
dialog: adversary, and I respect him now as
dialog: my ally.
text: More cheering, this time from the entire assembly.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: Hector, Paris, young princes, come,
dialog: stand, drink with me.
text: Hector stands. Paris does not. He's still staring at
text: Helen. Hector nudges his brother's shoulder. Paris
dialog: stands.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: Let us drink to peace.
text: Hector nods to Menelaus and raises his cup.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Peace between Troy and Sparta.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2) 8
text: The king and the princes drink deeply and slam their empty
text: cups to the table.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: May the gods keep the wolves in the
dialog: hills and the women in our beds.
text: All the men in the hall cheer and rise to their feet.
speaker_heading: GUESTS
dialog: To Sparta! To Troy!
text: A band of MUSICIANS strike up their instruments; SERVANTS
text: roam the hall filling goblets with wine.
text: POLYDORA (20), one of Helen's handmaidens, leads a dozen
text: attractive YOUNG WOMEN into the banquet hall.
text: The warriors howl at the sight of the women. Soon each of
text: the handmaidens is flanked by drunken soldiers.
text: Menelaus grabs Hector in a bear hug. Hector gamely
text: accepts the embrace. When the king releases him, both men
text: spill a few drops of wine from their cups onto the floor.
text: They drink the rest of their wine. Menelaus grips
text: Hector's upper arm. SERVANTS refill the cups.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: A strong arm. Thank the gods we
dialog: made peace -- I've seen too many of
dialog: my men struck down with this arm.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Never again, I hope.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: Only one man works a sword better
dialog: than you. The son of Peleus the
dialog: Argonaut.
speaker_heading: HECTOR

speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: You see that one over there? I
dialog: picked her just for you. She's a
dialog: little lioness.
text: Menelaus grins at the girl, who lowers her eyes and
text: smiles. Helen notices this silent exchange but ignores
text: it, conversing instead with another HANDMAIDEN who sits
text: beside her.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Thank you. My wife waits for me in
dialog: Troy.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: My wife waits for me right there.
text: He leans forward to whisper conspiratorially in Hector's
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: MENELAUS
dialog: Wives are for breeding. You
dialog: understand? For making little
dialog: princes. Come, enjoy yourself
dialog: tonight.
text: Helen stands and walks out of the reception hall.
text: Menelaus does not notice. Hector does. He raises his cup
dialog: to Menelaus.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: You make excellent wine in Sparta.
text: Menelaus laughs and drinks with Hector.
text: Paris excuses himself from the Spartan generals he's been
text: speaking with and heads outside -- in the same direction
text: as Helen. Hector watches with mounting agitation.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT 9
text: The room is lit by a dozen tall candles. Helen removes
text: the flowers from her hair and drops them into a bowl of
text: water. She hears a sound and looks up. Paris stands in
text: the doorway.
text: For several breaths they are silent, staring at each
dialog: other.

speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: And the night before?

text: cannot hide a half-smile.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I've made many mistakes this week.
text: He approaches her.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Do you want me to go?
text: His hands are on her now, sliding down her bare neck, down
text: her back, resting on her hips. His mouth is very close to
text: her ear. Helen closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Yes.
text: Paris kisses her neck, her ears, her closed eyes. The
text: tightness we saw in her face when she sat by her husband's
text: side is gone, replaced by ecstasy.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Where should I go?
text: She kisses him back now and there's a hunger in her
text: kisses, something close to violence in her desire. She
text: lifts off his tunic and pulls him nearer.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (whispering)
text: Away. Far away.
text: In a moment the white gown slips to her feet. He stares
text: at her naked body in wonder. He opens his mouth to speak

scene_heading: INT. PALACE - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT 10
text: As more and more wine gourds are emptied, the scene grows

text: soldiers drunkenly sing battle songs.
text: Polydora sits on Menelaus's lap. She whispers in his ear
text: while he laughs and drains another cup of wine. Bits of
text: roasted boar fleck his thick red beard.
text: Hector sits nearby, half engaged in conversation with
text: several Spartan generals. He's clearly not happy that his
text: brother's still missing.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT (LATER) il
text: Helen lies naked on her bed. In the candlelight her
text: flanks are mapped with copper trails of sweat. She

speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: I have something for you.
text: From his tunic he pulls a necklace of baby pearls threaded
text: with silver. He sits beside her in bed.
speaker_heading: PARIS
text: Pearls from the sea of Propontis.
text: Paris strings the pearls around her neck.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: They're beautiful.

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Don't play with me, prince of Troy.
dialog: Don't play.
text: The sounds of footsteps and laughter outside the door
text: startle them. Paris halfway unsheathes a KNIFE hanging
text: from his belt.
text: Whoever's walking by the door passes without stopping.
text: Paris sheathes his knife, kneels beside the bed and takes
text: her hand.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: If you come we'll never be safe.
dialog: Men will hunt us and the gods will

text: Hector stands by the fire, conferring with TECTON (30), a

speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Make the proper offerings to

speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Paris!
text: Paris turns, smiles and waves, acting as if he hadn't seen

speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: You should get to bed. We won't

speaker_heading: PARIS

speaker_heading: PARIS

speaker_heading: HECTOR

speaker_heading: PARIS

speaker_heading: HECTOR

scene_heading: EXT. TEMPLE OF APOLLO - CONTINUOUS 59

text: The Myrmidon captain stops. Achilles hefts a spear,

text: One hundred yards from Achilles, the spearhead finds its
text: mark: Tecton's breastplate. Tecton is knocked from his

text: Hector reins in his horse and stares at his fallen

text: throws.
text: At the very last moment, Achilles bends his head to one
text: side, an almost lackadaisical movement. The spear rips
text: through the air occupied by Achilles' head half a moment
dialog: before.
text: Achilles smiles.
text: Hector draws his sword and charges, his men right behind

scene_heading: EXT. TROJAN BEACH - DAY 62
text: An arrow sticks out of Ajax's leg but he doesn't seem to
text: notice it. He bulls forward, giant shield held in front,
text: and slams into the Trojan ranks.
text: Where Achilles is all grace and speed, Ajax is brute
text: force. Parrying his blows is useless: his battle axe
text: splits bronze shields, bronze swords, bronze helmets.
text: The sound of his axe carving through a breastplate and the
text: man beneath the breastplate is like nothing else on earth.

text: Evidence of looting is everywhere.
text: At the back of the temple, stairs lead up to the altar
text: room. Hector walks toward the stairs. Blood trickles
text: down the steps. Hector raises his eyes.
text: Achilles stands atop the staircase, both hands wrapped
text: around the hilt of his sword, the sword point resting on
text: the top step. He stares down at Hector.
text: WAR CRIES explode through the temple. The Myrmidons burst
text: from their hiding places and rush the Trojans.
text: Hector is an obvious target. Two Myrmidons charge him,
text: their spears leveled.
dialog: If Achilles is the apotheosis of martial grace, Hector is
dialog: something altogether different -- a man of ordinary gifts
text: who has become an extraordinary warrior by dint of
dialog: experience, endless training, and powerful intelligence.
text: As the Myrmidons charge he waits. At the last moment he
text: swings his sword, slicing both spearheads from their
text: shafts. The Myrmidons stare at their decapitated spears.
text: Hector doesn't give them a chance to recover. He pounces,
text: sword flashing, and both men fall to the temple floor.
text: Achilles watches from the top step. Hector begins running
text: up the stairs. Achilles disappears inside the altar room.
text: Another Myrmidon bounds up the stairs after Hector. The

dialog: wine.
text: But Achilles does not look at this plunder. Bound by the

text: in her white robes.
text: Terrified but trying to retain her composure, she returns

speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: What's your name?

text: He raises his sword to the sky. A great, violent ROAR
text: rises from the Greek army. When he runs toward the
text: Trojans the Greeks jump from their positions and follow.
text: The two armies collide. Unlike the grassy field the men
dialog: fought on yesterday, today's battle takes place on the
text: sand, and sand is everywhere.
text: Horse hooves kick up clouds of sand. Men struggle for
text: footing in the loose sand. Red blood puddles on the
text: yellow sand.
dialog: But much more is different than the terrain. Now the
text: Greeks have a leader. The Myrmidons are at the forefront,
text: battling with a ferocity most Trojans have never seen
dialog: before.
text: A Trojan OFFICER, spear raised, gallops toward the figure
text: of Achilles. Before the Trojan can throw, Eudorus hurls
text: his spear, catching the officer in the neck. The man goes
dialog: down.
text: Odysseus, immersed in combat, sees this. He hesitates for

text: axe-wielding Trojan. They fight.
text: After Odysseus dispatches the man, he looks back toward
text: the glittering figure of Achilles. Something's making him
text: uneasy.
text: A Trojan swings his sword at the shining warrior, narrowly
text: missing a clean decapitation. The Greek hero thrusts his
text: spear and guts the Trojan.
text: The Myrmidons surge forward, hacking their way through the
text: Trojans. The Greek army steadily pushes the Trojans back,

dialog: raised.
text: They fight. And though the battle continues all around

text: The shining warrior is quicker than Hector and lighter on
text: his feet, swinging again and again, a blaze of bronze.
text: Hector fights patiently, parrying the blows, waiting for
text: an opening.
text: The sword of Achilles whistles over Hector's head, swung
text: so hard that the man wielding it cannot protect himself.

text: Achilles draws his sword. Hector draws his. They charge.
dialog: We've seen extraordinary fighting before, but we've never

dialog: better swordsmen have never clashed. All their lives, all
text: their training and past battles, have led to this moment.
text: Nothing is wasted. No flourishes or balletic leaps or

text: Both men swing. Their swords lock and for a moment
text: everything is still. Achilles' face is inches from
text: Hector's. Hector is sweating and breathing heavily.
dialog: Achilles is not.
text: Achilles shoves Hector and relaunches his attack. While
text: Hector still fights ably, he's clearly tiring. As
text: Achilles' blows force Hector back, the prince steps on a
text: rock, trips, and falls. Achilles stands above him.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Get up, prince of Troy. I won't
dialog: let a stone take my glory.
text: Hector stands. He knows his energy is fading fast. So he

text: with explosive fury, putting all his might into each blow.
text: When the barrage is finished and Hector pauses for a
text: breath, he sees that Achilles, unhurt, has parried
text: everything. Now Achilles bores in, swinging. Hector
text: blocks and blocks, but doesn't have the stamina for a new
dialog: assault.
text: Achilles lunges. Hector raises his shield. The sword
text: plunges through the seven layers of oxhide, plunges
text: through the hammered bronze of the shield, the bronze of
text: the breastplate, all the way into Hector's heart.
text: Hector looks down at the blade. He looks at Achilles.

scene_heading: EXT. WALLS OF TROY - CONTINUOUS 148

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS 160

speaker_heading: PRIAM

speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Come. I'll protect you.
text: Paris pulls back the catgut string. Briseis screams:
speaker_heading: BRISEIS
dialog: No!

dialog: Paris.
text: Achilles snarls and heads for him. Paris shoots again.

speaker_heading: BRISEIS
dialog: Stop!

speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: You have to get out.
speaker_heading: BRISEIS
dialog: Shh.
speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: Get out.

speaker_heading: ACHILLES
dialog: I chose this night... but you will
dialog: see the sun again. I want you to

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN SQUARE OF TROY - DAWN 201
text: The Greeks are victorious. The beautiful city of Troy is

text: atop the highest pyre, staring down at the body of
dialog: Achilles.
text: For a long time Odysseus looks at the dead man's face. He
dialog: knows the world will never see another Achilles. Finally

text: places them over Achilles' eyes.
speaker_heading: ODYSSEUS
dialog: Find peace, my brother.
text: Odysseus climbs down from the pyre. A LIEUTENANT hands
