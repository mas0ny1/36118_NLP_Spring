speaker_heading: SUPER: SUMMER, 1984
scene_heading: DELAYED SUPER: IPSWICH, MASSACHUSETTS
scene_heading: AN ALLURING, MELODIC ‘80s SYNTH BEAT FADES IN OVER --
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: It’s easy to think of the suburbs as
text: a dead end. A weird Bermuda triangle
text: where the American dream strangles
dialog: all the excitement outta life. But
dialog: looks can be deceiving...
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIPER STREET - DAY
text: Newspaper bag slung over his shoulder, DAVEY ARMSTRONG (14)
text: cruises down the bucolic suburban street on his BMX. All you
text: need to know about the bright-eyed Davey is plastered on his
text: tee-shirt: “AREA 51 - I BELIEVE."
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
text: Just past the manicured lawns and
dialog: friendly waves, go inside any house.
dialog: Less than fifty feet from where you
dialog: sleep, entirely different lives are
dialog: playing out.
text: He watches his NEIGHBORS with curiosity. PEOPLE are out doing
text: yard work. KIDS are playing in the street.
text: DAVEY PEELS UP TO A MAILBOX. Grabs a paper -- Accidentally
scene_heading: DROPS IT revealing THE FRONT PAGE. A PICTURE OF A BOY (13)
text: beneath the headline, “NEWBURYPORT BOY STILL MISSING."
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
text: Behind the freshly painted walls next
dialog: door, anything could be happening and
dialog: you'd never know.
text: Davey’s eyes gleam at the headline as he scoops up the paper,
text: stuffs it into the mailbox. Speeds away...
text: AS HE PEDALS ALONG, Davey surveys the NEIGHBORS he passes...
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: Even serial killers live next door to
dialog: somebody...
dialog: 2.
text: A BALDING NEIGHBOR (40s) mows his lawn. Waves at Davey as
text: Davey passes. Davey politely smiles, waves back. But as soon
text: as the neighbor isn’t looking, Davey’s eyes turn skeptical...
text: A YOUNG COUPLE argues with one another -- Stop at the sight
text: of Davey zipping past. Smile as he goes by. A facade.
dialog: AROUND THE BEND, a shirtless YOUNG MAN (20) we’ll come to
text: know as KYLE washes his TRANS-AM. Sees Davey. Flips him off.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: But that’s what I love about it. It
dialog: always keeps you on your toes.
text: Davey pulls over to another mailbox at the foot of a long
text: driveway that leads to a well-maintained two-story colonial.
text: It reads "MACKEY."
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: When something you never saw coming
dialog: breaks the routine... that’s when
dialog: things get really interesting.
text: Davey opens the mailbox, stuffs a paper inside --
speaker_heading: MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Davey! Hey, bud -- What’s going on?
text: Davey looks up to find WAYNE MACKEY (40s) walking down the
dialog: driveway toward him. He’s your average suburban bachelor: a
dialog: little tall, athletic shoulders, kind eyes. Type of guy who
text: should have a family by now but doesn’t seem in a rush.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Hey, Mr. Mackey...
text: Davey scans Mackey. Sees his clothes are covered in --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What’s with all the dirt?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Oh -- Ha. Yeah. Been doing some
text: planting in the garden.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: There was no cash in your mailbox
dialog: yesterday. For the paper.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Has it been a month already? Jeez...
dialog: Actually, I was gonna ask if you had
dialog: a sec to help me lift something
dialog: inside?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: MACKEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can grab the money too. Kill two
dialog: birds with one stone?
scene_heading: INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Davey scans Mackey’s FAMILY PHOTOS while Mackey goes through
text: drawers in the kitchen.
text: FROM AN END TABLE, Davey picks up a FRAMED PHOTO of a smiling
text: TEENAGE BOY and his PARENTS.
text: Mackey comes up behind Davey. Hands him a $5 bill.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Knew I had it. Here ya go...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You’ve got a big family, huh?
text: Mackey scans all the pictures on the walls, tables...
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Yeah, just make sure you don’t live
dialog: too close to em or they’1ll always be
dialog: in your business, am I right?
text: Mackey moves to a WOODEN BUREAU. Slaps a hand on its top.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: This is it. Bought some new furniture
dialog: for upstairs. Need to get this hunka
dialog: junk down into the basement. Think we
dialog: can manage it?
scene_heading: INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Mackey and Davey carry the bureau down the stairs. Davey
text: struggles -- He’s clearly bitten off the max he can chew.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Watch your step...
text: As they level out on the concrete basement floor, pass a
text: large furnace -- KACHUNK! -- It KICKS ON, scaring Davey --
dialog: WHAM! He drops the bureau --
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Whoa, whoa! You okay?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Shit. Sorry.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Long as you didn’t get your foot,
dialog: it’s fine. We can rest a sec.
text: Davey appraises the UNFINISHED BASEMENT. Two dangling light
text: bulbs throw stark shadows against the sheetrock walls that
text: enclose THREE ROOMS.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Really appreciate the help. Flip side
dialog: of not living near family -- no one’s
dialog: ever around to help out.
text: Davey points to a cracked door. BLOOD RED LIGHT EMANATES from
dialog: behind it. Kinda creepy...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What’s in there?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: That’s where we’re going. Think you
dialog: can make it the rest of the way?
text: Davey nods. They hoist the bureau again. He spots a PADLOCK
text: ON THE DOOR IN THE CORNER. Odd. Then they’re moving --
scene_heading: INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT DARK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: -- THUD! Davey and Mackey put down the bureau...
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Heavy sonofabitch, huh...?
text: .. leaving Davey HUFFING AND PUFFING. Mackey CHUCKLES. He
text: looks oddly disturbing in the red glow. Everything does.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: So, whattaya think? Putting the
text: finishing touches on my dark room.
dialog: Sort of an amateur photographer.
dialog: Figured this beast would be good to
dialog: store some equipment.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: That’s cool. I’m sort of an amateur
dialog: videographer, so I get it...
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Just like your old man. Boy, I
dialog: remember your parents walking you
text: around the block in a stroller. Now
dialog: look at you. How old are ya anyway?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Fourteen.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Fourteen? Shit. Perfect age. Wish I
dialog: could just freeze it for you.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Anyway, I gotta get home for dinner.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Of course. I can take it from here.
dialog: Send your folks my best.
text: Davey nods, heads back up the basement stairs as THE SOUND OF
text: KIDS YELLING OUT ECHOES OVER --
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - HIGH ABOVE - NIGHT
text: A crystal clear New England summer night. Dense forest butts
text: up against the backyards of FIVE HOUSES that line a cul-de-
text: sac, each home separated by a sizeable yard.
text: NUMEROUS FLASHLIGHT BEAMS slice through the darkness. A
dialog: commotion of some sort. A search? No, it’s --
speaker_heading: TEENAGED BOY (0.S.)
dialog: (echoing, from a distance)
dialog: Manhunt! We’re coming to get you
dialog: shitheads!
text: AS WE SWOOP DOWN, we find Davey running through a neighbor’s
text: pitch black backyard, dressed in all dark clothes.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Go-go-go!
text: A few other KIDS (12-15), also dressed in dark clothing,
text: scatter in all directions, looking for hiding spots.
text: WE STAY WITH DAVEY as he bolts into what we recognize as
text: MACKEY’S BACKYARD. Ducks behind a thick bush up against
text: Mackey’s house. Looks around. Doesn’t see anyone --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)
dialog: Move over!
text: DAVEY JUMPS, turns to find CURTIS FARRADAY (14), AKA
text: “FARRADAY," his nerdy friend, squeezing in behind the bush.
text: Farraday's the kid puberty left behind -- high-pitched voice,
text: and about a head shorter than Davey with horn-rimmed glasses.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: The hell, Farraday? Find your own
dialog: spot! You’re gonna get us caught!
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: This is my spot!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Not right now -- Go!
text: Annoyed, Farraday slinks away. Davey listens. No movement.
text: Then HE HEARS MUFFLED, INDISCERNIBLE VOICES coming from --
text: INSIDE MACKEY’S HOUSE. Davey peeks into the window to find --
text: MACKEY, PHONE at his ear, sitting across the dining room
text: table from a TEENAGED KID (13). Scraggly red hair, acne,
text: freckles, GREEN ATARI shirt. Davey doesn’t recognize him.
text: Mackey shrugs apologetically, hangs up. No one answered. The
text: redhead nods, and Mackey says something that makes him LAUGH.
text: They head into another room and out of Davey’s sight...
speaker_heading: WOODY (0.S.)
dialog: GOT YOU, DUDE!
text: Davey recoils as FLASHLIGHT BEAMS NAIL him. Squints past the
text: light to find DALE WOODWORTH, AKA, “WOODY” (14) and TOMMY
text: EATON, AKA, “EATS” (14) smiling down at him, victorious.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Jesus, Woody!
dialog: Woody’s a bear of a kid. The opposite of Farraday -- Puberty
text: came fast and furious. Eats is the punk of the group. Like a
text: character out of The Ramones. A wise-ass through and through.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hiding in Farraday’s spot, man? Lame.
dialog: You're better than that.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Davey, treehouse in fifteen. After we
dialog: catch this little bitch.
speaker_heading: WOODY
text: He’s close. I can practically smell
text: the Noxzema on him.
text: As Woody and Eats dash into the night to continue the search,
text: Davey peers back into Mackey’s window. All’s quiet.
scene_heading: EXT. EATS’ HOUSE - SIDE YARD - NIGHT
text: A TREEHOUSE hangs in the limbs of a maple beside a classic
text: colonial house. A light glows inside as --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)
dialog: I can’t wait to get laid...
scene_heading: INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Woody’s got a PORNO MAG in hand, Davey and Farraday on either
text: side of him. Woody and Farraday look particularly intoxicated
text: by the pictures of beautiful, NAKED WOMEN.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Aren’t you guys sick of looking at
dialog: those same chicks?
text: Sitting across from them, Eats sips from a flask.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Shit no, man.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: or even just feel-up a chick.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Second base? That’s it? I rounded
dialog: third once. She was hot, too.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Just so happens to be a girl none of
dialog: us knows --
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: I was on vacation, dipshit.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: How convenient...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I'd be happy just to get on base with
dialog: Nikki.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Oh, man. How is she so friggin hot?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Too bad she’s into my brother.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Kyle!? No way! He’s twenty and he
text: works at the hardware store.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: When’s he getting us more pornos? The
dialog: pages on this one are wearing off --
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: I told you, he said we can go fuck
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Tell him we’re trying to. That’s why
dialog: we need the porno mags.
text: The guys all have a LAUGH as Eats passes the flask to Woody.
text: Woody takes a sip -- COUGHS, GAGS --
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Thank God for this treehouse. Wish I
dialog: could just live up here instead of
dialog: with my mom...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I dunno how safe that’d be. With
dialog: those kids going missing --
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Okay, here we go...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Come on, we all know what you’re gonna
dialog: say. “It’s a conspiracy. It’s all
dialog: connected. The disappearances aren’t
dialog: random, they’re part of some vast
dialog: governmental alien cover-up.” Right?
text: Davey just stares at him a moment, not wanting to admit he’s
dialog: right, but --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: So you don't think it's weird? Last
text: summer, a kid goes missing in
dialog: Hamilton. Now another kid disappears
dialog: in Newburyport...?
text: Eats and Farraday LAUGH. Davey looks to Woody for support.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Davey, you're my best friend, but you
text: sound like a nutjob.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Remember when he connected a Lite
dialog: Brite to his keyboard to try and
dialog: communicate with extraterrestrials?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Or when he swore there was a demonic
dialog: presence in his room cuz our houses
dialog: were built on Indian burial grounds?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: That was like... three years ago! And
dialog: our houses were built on an Indian
dialog: burial ground --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: There’s literally no proof of that --
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: All right, are we done here? I gotta
dialog: beat off before my parents get home.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Oh shit, good call. I'm outta here.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You guys are animals...
text: As Davey follows Farraday down the ladder, Eats grabs at the
text: porn mag in Woody’s hand, but Woody won't let go.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No way! Thought you were tired of
text: looking at these same chicks.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: I am. Why ya think I stopped bangin
dialog: your mom?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You're dead!
text: Woody grabs Eats, they wrestle playfully as we --
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - LATER
text: The room is literally wallpapered with the front pages of
dialog: various tabloids: “Satanic Cult Abducting Children," “I was
dialog: Bigfoot’s Love Slave,” “Back from the Dead -- For Two Years I
dialog: was a Zombie," “Are UFOs Abducting Cows?” etc...
text: Davey’s in bed reading “THE HARDY BOYS: THE SHORE ROAD
text: MYSTERY." His mother, SHEILA (40s), enters.
dialog: 10.
text: She has the big hair and business suit of a career woman, but
text: the gentle nature of a mom. She fixes his covers, takes the
dialog: book away.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: You know you shouldn't read this
text: stuff before bedtime. Scary dreams.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Mom, I’m fourteen. You don’t need to
dialog: tuck me in anymore.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Maybe you don't need me to. Doesn't
dialog: mean I'm ready to give it up.
text: She kisses him on the forehead.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Think Dad's gonna be home soon?
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: I don't know, hon. You know how the
dialog: news is. Always something going on
dialog: that needs reporting. Sleep tight.
text: Sheila flicks off his bedroom light, closes his door. As soon
text: as she’s gone, Davey reaches under his bed, pulls out a GE
text: ROBOT STARCODE WALKIE TALKIE. Speaks softly --
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Guys, Roller Palace tomorrow?
text: Davey hops out of bed. Grabs the BINOCULARS from his
text: nightstand and walks to the window ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS
text: ROOM. Pulls aside the curtains THAT FACE THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
text: BINOCULARS POV: A dimly-lit room. We can just barely make out
text: the shape of a bed, a nightstand...
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Scope some cuties? I’m in.
speaker_heading: EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Hope that chick from last week is
dialog: there. She was all over me.
speaker_heading: WOODY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: You asked to touch her boobs and she
dialog: threw you over the railing.
text: Davey scans the other windows, but the neighboring house is
text: empty. No signs of life. He couldn’t be more disappointed...
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Bet I didn’t look half as dumb as
dialog: Davey every time he sees Nikki in the
text: DJ booth and bites it.
text: Davey’s disappointment suddenly turns to a devilish smile --
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Know what doesn’t bite? The fact that
dialog: I can see her right now... Naked...
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Bullshit...
speaker_heading: WOODY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: If you're serious, I hate you.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Holy shit, she’s waving for me to
dialog: come over --
speaker_heading: EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Okay, now I know you’re full of it.
text: Eats, out.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: I'd trade both my nuts to have that
dialog: view. She's like your private dancer.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "A dancer for money. Do what you want
dialog: her to dooooo."
speaker_heading: WOODY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Tina Turner? I fuckin love her!
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Dude, me too! I mean, I know we're
dialog: technically not her demographic but --
text: CLICK! Davey turns off his walkie, rolls his eyes. Returns to
text: bed and looks out the LARGE PICTURE WINDOW AT HIS BEDSIDE at
text: the entire cul-de-sac. The perfect view. He grabs his --
text: BINOCULARS POV: Davey’s magnified gaze scans the other homes
text: in the cul-de-sac, finally landing on MACKEY’S HOUSE DIRECTLY
text: ACROSS THE STREET. No lights on. Nothing out of the ordinary.
text: Davey hops back in bed, pulls the covers over his head as --
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK
text: We HEAR RUSTLING, then... A RING OF LIGHT becomes a FLOOD OF
dialog: ILLUMINATION, revealing we’re --
dialog: 12.
text: INSIDE A GARBAGE CAN, LOOKING UP AT DAVEY as he drops a LUMPY
dialog: GARBAGE BAG down onto us --
scene_heading: EXT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Davey drops the lid back into place, covering his nose.
text: REFUSE is strewn across the deck around three garbage cans,
text: one of which is still knocked over. He looks over the
text: extraordinary mess and SIGHS. Pulls on YELLOW RUBBER GLOVES.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Can you at least make Mom double-bag
dialog: her meatloaf when she tosses it?
text: Smells like werewolf crap.
text: Davey’s father RANDALL (40s) supervises from the patio table
text: where he cleans the detached lens from a professional grade
scene_heading: BETAMAX CAMCORDER. CHANNEL SIX NEWS emblazoned on the side.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: If you remembered to put the cinder
dialog: blocks on those bins like I told you,
dialog: we wouldn’t have this mess.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I hate raccoons. You should do an
dialog: exclusive. Get pest control in here.
dialog: I could film it...
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Yeah, nice try. Camcorder’s off-
dialog: limits. It’s --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: -- expensive, I know. How am I
dialog: supposed to become the next Spielberg
dialog: if I don’t practice?
text: Randall gives an amused smirk. CLICKS the lens back in place
text: and heads for the patio door.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Just make sure this patio’s clean
dialog: before you go anywhere, capiche?
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - DAY
text: On their BMX bikes, clearly on a mission, bags of candy in
text: hand, the boys zip through the picturesque seaside downtown,
text: brushing past outraged PEDESTRIANS...
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT. ROLLER PALACE - ESTABLISHING - DUSK
text: A roller skating rink, parking lot filled. The SOUNDS of
text: Bananarama’s “CRUEL SUMMER" bleed into the night from inside
text: as the guys roll up on their bikes...
scene_heading: INT. ROLLER PALACE - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: The MUSIC POUNDS THE AIR as round and round the rink goes the
text: crowd of TEEN ROLLERSKATERS. Nearly in slow-motion, a
text: GORGEOUS TEEN GIRL glides past as...
text: Davey, Eats, Farraday and Woody stare, slack-jawed. Eats
text: nearly trips, almost takes Woody with him.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Control yourself, ya psycho!
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: I can't -- I got needs, Woody!
text: They all LAUGH as Davey’s gaze floats up to the DJ in the
text: booth overlooking the floor.
text: NIKKI KASZUBA (17) bobs her head as she searches through a
text: stack of VINYLS for a next song. Glaringly hot and aloof,
dialog: she’s the kind of girl guys throw their virginity at.
text: Davey stares up at her dreamily, slowing his roll. The guys
text: track his gaze. And now they’re all entranced.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Nikki Kaszuba. She’s like,
dialog: scientifically the perfect woman.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: If she was my sitter I'da been bangin
dialog: her the second my balls dropped.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Was it hard not to pop a boner every
dialog: time she gave you a bath?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It was four years ago, not ten. Calm
dialog: down. We just played games and shit.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: What kind of games? Naughty games?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I hate you guys...
text: Davey skates off toward the --
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: INT. ROLLER PALACE - BATHROOM HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Davey skates out of the bathroom drying his hands.
text: SOMEONE GRABS HIM, SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE WALL --
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Now you’re spying on me here too?
text: Davey’s eyes go wide -- It’s Nikki! And she knows!
text: words come out because HOLY SHIT IS THIS GIRL HOT!
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yeah, I know you pervs spy on me.
text: Davey’s heart is hammering in his chest.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Nothing to say? Really?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No, I just -- I never watch when
dialog: you're -- I mean, I don’t mean to
dialog: watch you, you’re just --
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I’m just what?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: perfect.
dialog: But
dialog: But no
text: The anger on Nikki’s face dissipates. She lets Davey go,
text: skates off. Davey watches after her, the weight of what just
dialog: happened sinking in. What did I just say!?
scene_heading: INT. ROLLER PALACE - RINK - CONTINUOUS
text: Davey rolls up on the other guys, who are plainly staring at
text: the asses of a GROUP OF OBLIVIOUS GIRLS a few feet ahead. He
text: still looks like he’s in shock.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: The hell happened to you?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Huh? Nothing...
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: You sure? We were worried maybe you
dialog: got kidnapped or something.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You’re such an asshole.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Coming from you, that’s a compliment.
dialog: Now, watch as I show you dicknoses
dialog: how to score with the ladies...
text: Eats speeds toward the group of oblivious girls. The guys
text: quicken their pace to catch up, but as Davey rounds the loop,
text: past the DJ booth, he glances up to find NIKKI LOOKING BACK
text: AT HIM. THE MOMENT LASTS AN ETERNITY. SHE SMIRKS! Then --
text: WHAM! Davey trips, takes a ridiculous spill, skin SCREECHING
text: on the wood. A few SKATERS trip over him, causing a pile-up.
text: IN THE DJ BOOTH, Nikki plays the famous sound bite from The
text: Surfaris’ “WIPE OUT.” LAUGHTER fills the air as we --
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Davey’s family sits around the TV eating dinner off TV TRAYS.
text: ON THE TV, a NEWS ANCHOR (40s) talks Summer Olympics...
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR (FROM TV)
dialog: now confirmed that 14 Eastern
dialog: Bloc countries, including the Soviet
dialog: Union, will boycott the Olympic Games
dialog: in Los Angeles later this summer...
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Unbelievable. Cold War's never gonna
dialog: end. Davey, your future’s doomed.
text: Sheila hands a thick folder off the end table to Randall.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: John dropped these off today.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Ah, great. Must be the fliers for the
dialog: block party.
text: Randall opens it.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Yup. They got a Beatles cover band to
dialog: play this year. Pretty neato.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Nikki’s not DJing like last year?
dialog: She’s amazing.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Probably not in the cards, what with
text: her parents getting a divorce.
dialog: 16.
text: Davey blanches as his heart drops.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Nikki’s parents are getting divorced?
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Where’d you hear that?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
text: Bob Burnquist bowls with Mike
dialog: Kaszuba. Said it’s pretty ugly.
dialog: Supposedly, Mike’s not even living in
dialog: the house right now.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Let’s not gossip, Randall...
dialog: (thinking about it)
dialog: But that’s awful. I never would’ve
dialog: thought they were having problems.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: That’s why they invented curtains,
dialog: hon.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Well, enough about that. At least the
dialog: block party sounds like it’1ll be fun.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Yeah, but why’s it always like the
dialog: last weekend before school starts?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: That’s kinda the point, pal. Say
text: goodbye to summer fun with a bang.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Mind still on Nikki, Davey grabs his binoculars. Goes to the

text: BINOCULARS POV: Nikki’s bedroom window. The lights are on,
text: but no one’s there. Davey focuses in on a FRAMED PHOTO on her

text: HALLWAY. Grabs the phone off the wall. Before he can answer,
text: he hears VOICES ON THE LINE. He’s about to hang up when --
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: RANDALL (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
dialog: Wanna tell me what’s so urgent I
dialog: can’t just come in tomorrow?
text: The UNKNOWN CALLER SIGHS, unsure how to say that --
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
dialog: Randall, it’s -- The Chronicle
dialog: received a letter from some guy
dialog: calling himself the “Cape Ann
dialog: Killer.” Claims he’s killed thirteen
dialog: teenaged boys over the last decade.
text: Davey’s eyes go wide. A moment of silence passes on the line.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
dialog: It’s legit. Story’s gonna break any
dialog: second. We need ya in here, pronto.
text: BACK IN HIS ROOM. Davey grabs the walkie-talkie as the VOICES
text: OF HIS PARENTS ECHO UP FROM DOWNSTAIRS. The front door SLAMS.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Guys! Something big is going down!
speaker_heading: EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Someone’s going down on who?
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: I was right. Know those missing boys?
dialog: It’s a serial killer! My dad just got
dialog: called in!
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Holy shit, you’re not kidding. It’s
text: on the news right now.
text: Davey drops the walkie-talkie and races back down to the --
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Sheila’s standing in front of the TV, remote control clutched
text: firmly to her chest. Davey sees the LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE
text: where DEPUTY SHERIFF LEWIS CALDWELL (50) addresses REPORTERS.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF CALDWELL (FROM TV)
dialog: This afternoon, the Cape Ann Chronicle
dialog: received an anonymous letter from
dialog: someone claiming responsibility for
text: the deaths of thirteen teenaged boys.
text: Davey can’t believe what he’s hearing. He looks at Sheila.
text: She watches in stunned silence.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF CALDWELL (FROM TV)
dialog: The author also provided a list of
dialog: names, dates and pertinent details
dialog: related to a number of open missing
dialog: persons cases. We’ve confirmed the
dialog: accuracy of these statements and can
dialog: now officially label this person an
dialog: active serial killer.
text: ON SCREEN, the feed cuts back to the IN-STUDIO NEWS ANCHOR.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR (FROM TV)
dialog: Sheriff's office reports they're
text: likely looking for a white male in
text: his late-30s to 40s, living alone.
text: Preferred targets appear to be males,
dialog: aged 12 to 16 --
text: CLICK. Sheila turns off the TV. Knuckles white on the remote.
text: Tense silence fills the void, until --
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: I just, I can’t believe something --
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - LATER
text: CLOSE ON Davey’s face, a familiar glimmer in his eye --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: -- like this could happen here! It
dialog: could be anybody! This is the coolest
dialog: thing that’s ever happened to us!
text: All four guys are here, though from their HUSHED VOICES, it’s
dialog: obvious they’re not supposed to be.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: They said he hunts guys our age.
dialog: Think maybe we should cool it with
dialog: the late night Manhunts?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Why? None of the missing kids are from
dialog: Ipswich. And Cape Ann's wicked big --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s not that big. How’re you not
dialog: freaking out that something’s finally
dialog: happening in this town?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Because there’s no way it’s gonna hit
dialog: us or this neighborhood. We love you,
dialog: man, but look at this place.
dialog: 19.
text: The guys scan the room: an “Area 51” poster hangs on the wall
text: beside a large framed still of the classic Patterson-Gimlin
text: Big Foot video. Alien figurines and toys cover most surfaces.
text: A large cross adorns a wall, garlic hanging from it.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: You’re desperate for crazy shit to
dialog: happen. You hear a news story and
dialog: suddenly every boogeyman in these
text: magazines lives down the street.
text: Farraday grabs the BINOCULARS. Looks out the SIDE WINDOW --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Excuse me for being the only one to
dialog: hear there’s a serial killer on the

speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)
dialog: Boner! Holy shit!
text: All the guys crowd to the window to follow Farraday’s gaze.
text: Could only be one thing. Eats scrambles to grab the extra set
text: of BINOCULARS Davey keeps near the window.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Move over, Woody! Fat ass!
text: Eats ducks down at Woody’s knees, and as the four adolescent
dialog: guys gaze out, WE SEE --
text: BINOCULARS POV: NIKKI, IN HER WINDOW. Undressing. Her back to
text: our boys, she slips off her bra. Sunkissed skin, the graceful
text: curves of her shoulders and bare neck achingly feminine.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: I bet her hair smells like Vidal
dialog: Sassoon.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Definitely. If I was over there right
dialog: now, she’d be pregnant.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Guys, show her a little respect. Her
text: parents are getting divorced.
text: A moment of silence passes... Then --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Statistically that means she’s, like,
dialog: 78 percent more likely to engage in
dialog: pre-marital sex.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You guys are disgusting.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Whatever, dude, you were thinking it.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Bank it and spank it.
text: Woody wrestles the binoculars from Farraday, SNEAKS A PEEK
text: for himself. His jaw instantly drops.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I feel like I just discovered the
dialog: meaning of life. Davey, you gotta get
dialog: with her, man.
text: Davey looks out at Nikki with a look of pure intoxication.
dialog: It’s not lust in his eyes, it’s something more. Until --
scene_heading: NIKKI SPINS -- REALIZES SHE’S BEING WATCHED!
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Shit-get-down!
text: The guys drop to the floor, BUT DAVEY’S FROZEN. He meets
dialog: Nikki’s gaze --
speaker_heading: WOODY (0.S.)
dialog: Dude...!
text: Woody yanks him to the floor and OUT OF FRAME. Far too late.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (0.S.)
dialog: I’m so fucked...
scene_heading: EXT. FARRADAY’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: Another upper-middle-class, two-story colonial on the cul-de-
text: sac. We can see Davey’s house a couple driveways over.
scene_heading: INT. FARRADAY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Stuffing sandwiches in their faces, Farraday and Davey hover
text: over a newspaper. The headline reads, “THE CAPE ANN KILLER -
scene_heading: 15 CONFIRMED VICTIMS AND COUNTING.”
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: The Cape Ann Killer. So rad. Dude,
dialog: look at this --
text: Davey runs his finger along a PHOTO of the killer’s letter.
text: It includes a LIST OF NAMES. The victims. Right there in
text: black and white, next to the info hotline number.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Now that we have their names, I bet
dialog: we can find details of their
dialog: disappearances at the library --
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: Absolutely not!
text: FRANCINE FARRADAY (40s), sets a bowl of Doritos between the
dialog: boys. Just looking at her, you can see the conservative,
text: razor-sharp intellect of a clinical psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: And if I find out you did, I’m
dialog: calling your mother, David. Besides,
dialog: Curtis has homework.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: So stupid. Everyone else gets to hang
dialog: out all summer. I hate the academy --
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: My son is not going to be the first
dialog: Farraday without a Ph.D. from an Ivy
dialog: League school. Period.
text: CURTIS FARRADAY, SR. joins the boys at the table with a
text: salad. He stabs a finger onto the paper.
speaker_heading: CURTIS SR.
dialog: Makes me sick. The media supporting
dialog: the name this psychopath gave himself
dialog: like he’s in the damn World Wrestling
dialog: Federation. Whoever he is, he’s
text: clearly deranged and beyond help.
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: All serial killers are beyond help.
dialog: That’s why they’re serial killers.
dialog: They can't stop themselves.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Why do they call em serial killers?
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: “Serial” just means “many.” So it’s
dialog: someone who’s driven to murder
dialog: multiple people over many years.
speaker_heading: CURTIS SR.
dialog: We’ve both done some research into
dialog: the subject. Francine more than me.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Can you tell us about some of em?
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: Oh, I don’t think it’s appropriate.
speaker_heading: CURTIS SR.
dialog: If they don’t hear it from us, Dear,
dialog: you can be sure they’1l learn about
dialog: it from the G.D. news...
dialog: Francine considers. Nods agreement.
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: Well, this country’s seen its fair
dialog: share. H.H. Holmes was the first one
dialog: documented. Built a hotel in Chicago.
dialog: Called it his “Murder Castle.”
speaker_heading: CURTIS SR.
dialog: No one knows how many people he
dialog: killed there. Probably hundreds.
text: Davey and Farraday’s eyes light up like the fourth of July.
speaker_heading: CURTIS SR.
dialog: Then there’s Ed Kemper, “The Co-Ed
dialog: Killer.” John Wayne Gacy, “The Killer
text: Clown.” Guy actually dressed up like
dialog: a clown for the kids in his
dialog: neighborhood. Never trust a clown.
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: Ted Bundy, “The Lady Killer.” My
dialog: favorite.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Mom...! Gross!
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: Meaning he’s fascinating. He
dialog: confessed to murdering thirty women.
dialog: Used his good looks to seduce, kidnap
dialog: and kill his victims. Some serials
dialog: even keep items from their victims,
dialog: which we call “trophies.” These are
dialog: deeply disturbed individuals.
speaker_heading: CURTIS SR.
text: The list goes on and on. All with
dialog: sensational names to sell newspapers
dialog: and gain ratings. The news media
dialog: disgusts me. No offense to your
dialog: father, Davey.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: But why would the Killer write this
dialog: letter after all this time?
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: To raise the stakes. Make it more of
dialog: a thrill, and show how confident he
dialog: is that he won’t be caught. He thinks
dialog: he’s smarter than the police, and
text: he’s trying to prove it.
text: Francine scoops the newspaper off of the counter. Peers down
text: at it, shaking her head in disgust as she walks over...
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: We thought this town was insulated
dialog: from all the madness out there. But
dialog: even Ipswich isn’t safe anymore...
text: and drops it into the trash bin --
scene_heading: INT. IPSWICH PUBLIC LIBRARY - MICROFICHE LAB - DAY
text: Mere feet away from an oblivious OLD WOMAN (70s), Eats
text: jokingly humps a bookcase. Ipswich isn’t safe anymore indeed.
text: He’s got Woody in stitches as nearby --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Guys, cut the shit! Unlike you, I
dialog: actually come here to study so don't
dialog: get me kicked out.
text: NEWSPAPER from Farraday's house on his lap, Davey sits at a
text: MICROFICHE MACHINE. Farraday loads in a SHEET. Maneuvers
text: through pages of OLD NEWSPAPER ARTICLES.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Just use these knobs to scroll, find
dialog: the articles you want. Easy...
text: Davey takes the wheel. Uses the current paper as reference.
text: Starts searching for VICTIMS’ NAMES. AS HE SCROLLS, WE SEE --
scene_heading: QUICK CUTS OF DISTURBING HEADLINES, LAST PHOTOGRAPHS OF
scene_heading: SMILING VICTIMS --
text: A BLOND BOY .... A FAT BOY .... A SHAGGY BOY .... MORE BOYS,
text: ALL TEENAGERS. And then a break in the pattern --
scene_heading: A FULL FAMILY (MOM, DAD, TWIN TEENAGED BOYS) AND A SHOT OF
text: THEIR CRIME SCENE: A DINNER TABLE WITH BLOOD SPLOTCHES IN
scene_heading: FRONT OF EVERY CHAIR.
text: TIME FLIES BY as one by one, he crosses names off the list.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: I can’t look at this stuff anymore.
text: Farraday gets up and walks off. But Davey’s eyes are wide
text: with morbid fascination. HE’S HOOKED.
text: WE SEE MORE GROTESQUE SHOTS OF THE CAPE ANN KILLER’S WORK as
text: Davey tracks the killer’s activities across MONTHS, YEARS --
text: PLOP! A MAGAZINE SPREAD drops in front of his face. A PAIR OF
text: BARE AFRICAN TRIBAL BREASTS close enough to motorboat.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: BOOM! Afri-CANS... Get it?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You guys aren’t gonna believe the
dialog: shit I found --
text: Davey turns to find Eats and Woody. A stack of NATIONAL
text: GEOGRAPHIC magazines in their hands, AKA the best source of
text: porn a fourteen year old can easily get his hands on.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Forget what you found -- We snagged
dialog: enough tribal muff to carpet your
dialog: house. We’re back in business.
text: Eats stuffs a pair of NatGeos down the front of his pants.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: The hell are you doing!?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Free porn, bro.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT
text: Dressed in black, Davey and the guys shoot the shit with the
text: usual crew of MANHUNT KIDS as the last of the sun sets --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Okay, where the hell’s Sammy? We need
dialog: him or we don’t have numbers.
scene_heading: NEIGHBORHOOD KID 1
dialog: I dunno. We haven’t heard from him in
dialog: a few days.
text: By the look on everyone’s faces, that’s not normal.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Are they home?
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: NEIGHBORHOOD KID 2
text: Car’s in the driveway. They must be.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Let’s go get the little shit. Woody,
dialog: stay here, make sure none of these
text: dickweeds leave.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOFFMAN HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
scene_heading: KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK -- Davey, Eats and Farraday await a
text: response... that doesn’t come. Eats and Farraday peek into
text: the windows beside the door...
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: No movement.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Or lights. Oh well...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Oh well? You don't think this is a
dialog: little weird? No one's seen Sammy in
dialog: days. What if --
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Don't even say it! They're probably
dialog: up at the lake or some shit.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Then why's their car here?
text: Davey goes to the Hoffmans' nearby station wagon. Squints in
dialog: the windows... Nothing out of the ordinary.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Maybe they rented one...?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Why would they --
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Who cares? The real issue is that we
dialog: don't have numbers because of the
dialog: little prick, so now I can't play
dialog: Manhunt. Whatever, I'm out.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: I'm gonna go catch up on my summer
dialog: reading. Fuckin homework. Later.
text: Fun extinguished. Eats and Farraday head off...
dialog: 26.
text: But Davey lingers. He approaches the front door, peers into
text: the darkened windows, morbid curiosity boiling over. He
text: casually TRIES THE FRONT DOOR KNOB, but it's locked. Bummer.
text: Davey turns around. Takes in the view from the Hoffmans' --
text: An unobstructed view of Mackey's backyard. Hmm...
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Davey puts the finishing touches on a PB&J. Grabs the jelly,
text: reaches for the refrigerator door -- Sees a NOTE WRITTEN IN
scene_heading: MARKER on the MAGNETIZED REFRIGERATOR WHITEBOARD:
dialog: “DATE: 6/29 MESSAGE: Working late again. Get a pizza. Call
dialog: one of the neighbors in case of an emergency.”
text: ON THE BOTTOM OF THE WHITEBOARD, a LIST of NAMES and PHONE
dialog: NUMBERS: “Farraday, Mackey, Woodworth, Eaton,” etc...
text: Davey puts the jelly back in the fridge, grabs the milk.
text: Pours himself a glass and places the CARTON on the counter.
text: Takes a glorious bite of the PB&J. Swigs the milk --
text: NEARLY CHOKES at the PICTURE ON THE BACK OF THE MILK CARTON --
scene_heading: “DUSTIN ‘DUSTY’ DEWITT - MISSING SINCE 6/2/84"
text: IT’S THE RED-HEADED KID HE SAW AT MACKEY’S HOUSE! HOLY! SHIT!
scene_heading: INT. TREEHOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: The flickering light of CANDLES on the table in the center of
text: the space gives a slightly crazy gleam to the eyes of --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Mackey's the Cape Ann Killer!
text: He looks like a man possessed. A prolonged silence hangs
text: between Eats, Farraday and Woody.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: I knew we shouldn’t have taken you to
dialog: the library. I blame myself.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: I also blame Farraday.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I know it sounds kinda ridiculous --
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Yeah, because it is. As soon as that
dialog: news report came out, we all knew it
dialog: was just a matter of time til you --
dialog: 27.
text: WHAM! Davey slaps the MILK CARTON onto the table.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Congrats, you’re getting your
dialog: calcium, so what?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No, man, look --
text: Davey points at the picture of DUSTY DEWITT. The guys grab
text: the carton. Take a closer look at the picture.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Who’s the missing ginger?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: That’s the kid I saw in Mackey’s
dialog: dining room a few weeks ago! When we
dialog: were playing Manhunt!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: How sure are you it's him?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Never been more sure of anything in
dialog: my entire life.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: That’s a low bar. Plus, redheads all
dialog: look the same.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: So true.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Did you tell your parents?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No way! They'd never believe me, and
dialog: they'd ground me. I need proof. Guys,
dialog: I was only like ten feet away! I saw
dialog: him clear as day! That’s him!
text: Eats and Farraday study the carton, considering this insane
dialog: possibility.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Plus, what about the Hoffmans? Their
dialog: lakehouse is only a couple hours
dialog: north, but their car's still here?
dialog: Something's definitely off. And they
text: have a perfect view of Mackey's yard.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: EATS
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: So, what if one of the Hoffmans saw
dialog: Mackey with Dusty in the yard --
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
text: The missing ginger.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: -- Mackey found out somehow, and then
dialog: killed them to get rid of the threat.
text: Silence. Everyone thinking over the details...
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Look, I'll admit this is all pretty
dialog: weird, but that's kind of a stretch.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Eats, tell him what Kyle said.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Farraday, what the fuck --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What'd Kyle say? Does he know
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Goddammit. Fine. He said Mackey comes
dialog: into the hardware store every week
text: and buys like fifty pounds of dirt.
dialog: Says it’s for his garden --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: His garden!? Bullshit! Who uses fifty
dialog: pounds of dirt a week in a backyard
dialog: garden? He’s also got a room in his
text: basement with a padlock on the door.
dialog: He’s single and he lives alone. Why
dialog: would he need that?
text: Davey plops down the CAPE ANN CHRONICLE. Points at a section
text: on the front page beneath the “CAPE ANN KILLER” headline --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Still not convinced?
dialog: (reading)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (CONT'D)
dialog: “Suspect is likely a white male,
dialog: late-30s to 40s, lives alone...”
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Dude, Mackey’s a cop. With a sick
dialog: reputation --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: That’s what’s genius about it! He
dialog: knows police tactics. He could plant
dialog: evidence to throw them off, or
dialog: destroy it if they ever found
dialog: anything bad. Who would suspect a
dialog: cop? It’s the perfect cover.
text: A sense of dread spreads around the table. He's got a point.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Guys, if Mackey is what I think he
dialog: is, we've gotta do something.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah, we gotta call the cops.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Have you not been listening? We
dialog: report anything to the cops, Mackey
dialog: will find out. Then he could just
dialog: destroy the evidence. Or walk over
dialog: and silence us. Permanently.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Okay, Magnum, P.I. What’s your plan?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We have to find out the truth -- And
dialog: be able to prove it. This is all
dialog: circumstantial; we’ve gotta find
dialog: real, hard evidence. Which means...
text: Mischief in his eyes, Davey smiles big. It's infectious as
text: smiles wipe across every face around the table. Even Eats'.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Stakeout?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Search and destroy. Who’s with me?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I'll bring the snacks. Davey, you get
dialog: the gear.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: This is batshit crazy. I'm in.
text: Exhilarated, Davey puts his hand out -- Woody's, Farraday's
text: and Eats' quickly SLAP down on top of it.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Operation Mack Attack starts now!
scene_heading: STAKEOUT MONTAGE
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS over an UPBEAT ‘80s SYNTH JAM -- OPERATION
text: MACK ATTACK in full swing:
text: -- Mackey tosses a DUFFEL BAG into his immaculate 1980 JEEP
text: WAGONEER, drives off. HIDING IN THE BUSHES, DAVEY lowers his
text: binoculars, jots down the time...
text: -- AT DUSK, Farraday hunkers down INSIDE HIS PARENTS’ PARKED
text: CAR as MACKEY’S WAGONEER rolls past heading into his
text: driveway. Farraday jots down the time...
text: -- IN HIS ROOM, Davey adds NOTES to a LARGE WHITEBOARD. Their
text: accumulated observations, laid out by day and time. It’s
dialog: starting to fill up...
text: -- ON HIS PAPER ROUTE, Davey chucks a NEWSPAPER. It lands on
text: a perfectly manicured lawn. WE SEE THE HEADLINE: “FEAR ACROSS
text: CAPE ANN REACHES FEVER PITCH.”
text: -- DURING A MANHUNT GAME, Davey peeks in Mackey’s windows.
text: Finds Mackey doing laundry. Sensing something, Mackey looks
text: out the window to find -- Nothing. Davey ducked just in time.
text: -- FROM HIS TREEHOUSE, Eats looks up from a porno mag to spot
text: Mackey eating dinner. Boooorrrring. Eats jots down the time,
text: goes back to his magazine, unfurling a centerfold. Yowza...
text: -- ON THE WHITEBOARD in his room, Davey adds MORE NOTES to
dialog: each day. Most days and times are filled in...
text: -- ON HIS PAPER ROUTE, Davey pulls a NEWSPAPER from his bag,
text: looks at the news headline: “FBI CONSULTED IN CAPE ANN KILLER
dialog: INVESTIGATION.”
text: -- Mackey wipes sweat as he digs in his GARDEN. ABOVE HIM,
text: HIDING IN A TREE, WOODY jots down a note...
text: -- FROM HIS BEDROOM WINDOW, Davey watches Mackey drive off.
text: He turns his binoculars to check THE HOFFMAN HOUSE. Still no
text: one home. Davey jots down notes...
dialog: 31.
text: -- Davey finishes adding a note to the WHITEBOARD and steps
text: back. It’s full of notes from the stakeout. A week in the
text: life of Mackey, HIS ENTIRE SCHEDULE, in black and white.
speaker_heading: END MONTAGE
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY
text: FOURTH OF JULY BANNERS strung from lifeguard towers float on
text: the wind above the crowded beach. Families play and swim in
text: the sand and surf beneath the golden sun.
text: ON A LARGE BEACH BLANKET, Davey, Eats, Farraday and Woody are
text: huddled around a NOTEBOOK --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Okay, run down. He leaves his house
dialog: every day at 8:24 with the same
text: duffel bag. Contents unknown. Grabs
text: the last day’s mail on the way out.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
text: Returns home with the bag around
text: 6:25. Goes into the house through the
text: garage door and closes it behind him.
dialog: Always closes it!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He gardens. A lot. Like, five days a
dialog: week. Veggies. Probably.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: He has dinner alone every night at
text: 7:00... ish. Then probably wanks it
text: and cries himself to sleep. Loser.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Eats’ CASIO CALCULATOR WATCH goes off.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Bikini break! One minute!
text: The guys turn as one to look across the sand and gawk at --
text: NIKKI, in a DNA-stirring bikini, tosses a football with a

speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: God I wish I was that bikini.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: I should've worn baggier trunks...
text: Davey watches Nikki. Longing. Smiles to himself.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: So amazing how, like, everyone loves
dialog: her, ya know?
text: The guys shoot Davey a disgusted look --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: What the fuck are you saying...?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No, I just mean she’s got a lot to
dialog: offer the world...
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The Casio alarm shatters their daydreaming.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: If you're done being a bitch, can we
dialog: get back to work, please?
text: But DAVEY'S GAZE REMAINS ON NIKKI as she bounces to and fro
dialog: with the football. It’s pure heaven.
speaker_heading: WOODY (0.S.)
dialog: Well, we know his schedule now, so
dialog: what do we do next?

speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: They’re aliens, and highly

speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Wait, was that it? Stakeout over?
speaker_heading: EATS
text: Let’s break into his garage.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We can’t do that. He’s a cop.
speaker_heading: DAVEY

speaker_heading: WOODY

text: Suddenly, finally, THE LIGHTS IN MACKEY’S HOUSE GO OFF.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: That.
scene_heading: EXT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Under cover of darkness, Davey runs across the street,
text: crouches behind the garbage cans. He watches Mackey’s windows
text: cautiously. No lights appear. The other guys catch up to him.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: What the hell’re we doing!?
text: Davey puts his hand on one of the garbage cans. Smirks.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: His fuckin trash? Are you kidding?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: There could be evidence in here.
text: Fingers or bloody rags or something.
dialog: We find anything, we got him.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Do you guys know me at all? I am not
text: digging through trash.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We're gonna get in trouble if we tear
text: up his trash on the street.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’ve had to clean our deck three
dialog: times in the last two weeks because
text: raccoons keep getting into ours.
dialog: That’s all anyone’s gonna think.
text: The guys look at each other, disgusted. But what the hell?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: If I find a used condom in here...
dialog: I’m gonna be so jealous.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: TRASH covers the base of the driveway. The guys’ hands and

speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: How do you know you can’t get AIDS
dialog: from trash?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Only way you're ever gettin AIDS...
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Yeah, good one. Don’t call me
dialog: tomorrow when you’re puking blood.
text: Davey tosses another EMPTY BAG onto the ground. Frustrated.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I can’t believe it. Nothing. Maybe he
dialog: doesn’t do the killings here?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He could have, like, a lair or
dialog: something somewhere...?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: A lair? He’s Cobra Commander now?
text: Farraday, still off to the side, spots Mackey’s MAILBOX.
text: Opens it, looks inside to find --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: What about his mail? Can tell a lot
dialog: about someone by the magazines
dialog: they’re subscribed to...
text: Big smile on his face, he digs out a brand new PLAYBOY, still
text: in its cellophane wrapper.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Ask and you shall receive!
text: Eats is all smiles as he snatches it, rips it open, tosses
text: the cellophane into the garbage pile and pages through it.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Farraday’s right. We can check his
dialog: mail every day and he’1l never
dialog: suspect a thing. See what bills he
dialog: gets, who’s sending him stuff...
text: Eats tucks the Playboy into his waistband. Per the usual.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: I’1l handle that responsibility.
text: Of course he will. Davey checks his watch.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s 10:30. We should get outta here

speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Night one, no luck.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Well, a little bit of luck --

text: As he and Farraday peel off toward their respective homes --
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hey Davey? Is it cool if I sleep over
dialog: tonight? Kinda don't wanna be home.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Yeah, I was gonna ask you to anyway.
dialog: I'll make popcorn and we can watch

text: DING-DONG! Davey JUMPS at the SOUND OF THE DOORBELL. Fuck! He

dialog: 38.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Davey bolts down the stairs, grabs the front door and swings
dialog: it open, revealing --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Dude, what took you so long?
text: NIKKI. She doesn’t wait for him to pick his jaw up off the
text: floor as she breezes past him into the house wearing a sexy
text: cut-off tee and short-shorts.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Expecting somebody this late?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Huh? Oh, just Woody -- My friend, I

speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Wow, I haven’t been over in awhile.
dialog: Your mom moved everything.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Uh -- I guess. Like a year ago.
text: Nikki continues into the kitchen, grabs a soda from the
dialog: fridge like she lives here.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Your folks aren’t home?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Nah, date night.
text: Nikki smirks, CRACKS the soda and it sprays the air. She
text: takes a long, luscious sip, her eyes never leaving Davey. She
text: wipes her wet lips and gives him an amused look --
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Good.
text: -- winks and walks confidently to the stairs. Heads up...
text: HOLY. SHIT. Is this happening right now? He realizes he’s
text: just standing there alone. Bolts after her --
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Davey flies into the room to find Nikki, already at his side
text: window, binoculars up to her eyes.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Huh... Better view of my room than I
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’ve never seen you naked!
text: Instantly mortified, Davey blushes. Grabs the binoculars.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Too bad. I’ve got a great body.
text: What!? Nikki smirks and walks away from the window.
text: Equal parts embarrassed and turned on, Davey starts
text: straightening up, stashing toys and nerd paraphernalia under
text: his bed, in the closet. Wherever he can.
text: But Nikki’s focused elsewhere, her hands tracing along the
text: peeling National Enquirer covers that wallpaper his room.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Wow... When I gave you that first
dialog: National Enquirer, I never thought
dialog: it’d lead to this. What was that one
dialog: again...? The cult that was, like,
dialog: brainwashing Elvis' daughter for his
dialog: money, right?
text: Davey points to the wall where the cover of that National
text: Enquirer permanently rests above his bed. Nikki smiles.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: We had so much fun. God, sucks how
dialog: much things have changed.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Things have changed, but good things.
dialog: Like, we're old enough to hang out
dialog: together now.
text: Totally onto his clumsy attempt at being suave, she lets her
text: finger gently touch his hand. Clearly having fun making him
text: squirm.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Too bad I'm leaving. Guess we better
dialog: get it all in now.
text: Her big eyes lock onto his, gleaming with mischievous intent.
text: Every gasket in Davey's brain about to blow, he remembers --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: How, uh -- how’re your parents?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Let’s stick to yours. What time did
dialog: you say they’d be home?
text: Uhhhhh... Mind. Frozen. She moves closer to Davey
text: CLOSER... THEIR LIPS ABOUT TO MEET... THIS IS IT -
dialog: 
text: THUD! They HEAR the DOOR OPEN AND CLOSE DOWNSTAIRS!
speaker_heading: SHEILA (0.S.)
dialog: Davey! We’re back!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Oh, fuck me.
text: Nikki LAUGHS OUT LOUD at his reaction, slaps a hand over her
text: mouth. They share a look of excited amusement, then she
text: rushes to the window. Climbs out using the roof of the garage
dialog: to get down to the ground safely.
text: Davey watches her go. Totally in love. Then leaps onto his
text: bed, drapes his comforter over his lap as --
text: HIS DOOR OPENS and his parents come in.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Honey? I thought I heard --

dialog: It’s the home of a boy without parents. Unless you count --
text: BRENDA WOODWORTH (50s) lies passed out on the couch, still in
text: her nurse’s uniform. Makeup smeared across her face. Hair a

text: WHITE PILLS carelessly poured out beside a BOTTLE OF GIN.
text: Woody stands in the doorway looking at his parent. His
text: security. And he knows he’s on his own.
dialog: 42.
text: He walks over, not needing to be stealthy. Digs a hand in her
text: purse. Comes out with her CAR KEYS. Gives Brenda one last

speaker_heading: WOODY

dialog: Are your parents happy?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I dunno... I guess...
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You must think I’m a loser, bringing
dialog: you out here for this.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No way. I love hanging out with you -
dialog: - I mean, ya know, as friends.
dialog: 49.
text: Nikki looks at him. Realizing for the first time --
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You really care about me, don’t you?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Well, yeah. I always have.
text: They hold each other’s gaze for a long moment. Then --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Can I tell you a secret...?
text: Nikki gives him an expectant look over her beer as she takes
text: a swig. He musters his courage...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I think Mackey’s the Cape Ann Killer.
text: Nikki nearly spits out her beer. Davey’s words seem to just
text: hang there in the air between them. Then Nikki CHUCKLES.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’m not kidding.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Mr. Mackey? Davey, he’s friends with
dialog: my dad. He’s totally harmless.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: That’s what he wants you to think.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I know how your mind works. But
dialog: you’re wrong.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: This is different. We’ve been spying
dialog: on him and --
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: He’s a cop! If your mom and dad found
dialog: out you’re spying on him, they would
dialog: flip their shit.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I know. That’s why they’re not gonna.
dialog: Not until we have real evidence to
dialog: show them.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Davey, listen to me. You gotta stop.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You’re just like everyone else...
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: No, look -- If you’re wrong, you'll
dialog: look like a lunatic and be in trouble
dialog: forever. And if you’re right... he
dialog: might catch you, or come after you.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’m not gonna get caught.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Please, just let the police handle
dialog: the killer. I don’t want anything bad
dialog: to happen to you... You might just be
dialog: the only person left in this
dialog: neighborhood I actually care about.

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: It’s the freakin mother lode.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Staking out Mackey was the best idea
dialog: you've ever had, Davey.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Had a pretty good idea, myself --
text: Farraday pulls out a BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Snagged it from my dad’s stash.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: So you’re using those brainpowers for
dialog: good. About damn time. Gimme some --
text: They eagerly pass the bottle around and take swigs. One by
text: one, they cringe in disgust and GROAN. Farraday COUGHS --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Oh, it’s bad. It’s so bad.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Tastes like my mouth is bleeding.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Guess you dickheads aren’t men yet.
dialog: 51.
text: Eats keeps the Jack, clearly forcing it down with each tiny
text: sip as the other guys spit and swish sodas like mouthwash.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: So let’s hear it, what's up with you
dialog: and Nikki?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We hung out again last night. She
dialog: says she likes talking to me. We
dialog: have, like, a connection.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Fuck you, a “connection.” Only
dialog: connection I want with her is
dialog: vaginal. Oral if she’s into it --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Don’t talk about her like that!
text: The guys all blankly stare at him -- Who are you? Davey
text: refocuses on Mackey’s house, miffed.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Ya think she douches?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Eww, Jesus, Woody!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: What? My mom does --
speaker_heading: DAVEY

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Not if we missed it the first time.
dialog: Grab the flashlight.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOFFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The guys approach the front door. Everything dark inside.
text: Davey shines his DURABEAM FLASHLIGHT through the windows but
text: can't make out anything. He tries the doorknob --
text: ERRRRRK -- AND IT OPENS! The front door slowly sways wide,
text: revealing a pitch black house. Davey’s eyes light up.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: What. Everyone keeps their door
dialog: unlocked around here.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Yeah, but this was locked last
dialog: time... We gotta go in. What if
dialog: they're dead in there?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: You said the killer kills kids, not
dialog: adults.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: That’s not totally true. One of the
dialog: articles at the library said he
dialog: killed a whole family in Rockport.
dialog: Police said something must've gone
dialog: wrong. And if it's Mackey...
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Fuck! That! You wanna go in there, be

text: But Davey’s already on his way inside...
speaker_heading: EATS

dialog: Guys, I got a bad feeling.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOFFMAN HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
text: Farraday and Woody hang onto each other as the guys creep

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Light’s not working.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: You guys smell that?

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah. Smells like... roadkill.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: If it's a bunch of dead bodies, I'm
dialog: totally gonna shit my Calvin Kleins.
text: Davey redirects the flashlight toward the room revealing --
text: THE PLACE IS A MESS. An overturned chair in the living room;
text: two open trash bags in the kitchen, flies swarming -- A CAT
text: eating among the refuse; mail and other debris on the floor
dialog: throughout. It looks like some shit went down!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Still think I'm crazy?
text: BRRRING -- The HOME TELEPHONE RINGS, scaring the hell out of

speaker_heading: FARRADAY

speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Farraday, check your Calvins.
text: AS THE PHONE CONTINUES TO RING, Davey pushes ahead, moving
text: through the dark, nervous as hell, the boys huddled behind
dialog: him. Step by painstaking step...
text: Davey aims the flashlight into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Woody, try the kitchen light. It's
text: around the corner.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Me!? Why me!?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Just do it! I'll shine the light.
text: Woody falters, but forces himself toward the now-illuminated
dialog: kitchen doorway, rounds it --
text: AND BUMPS INTO SOMEONE STANDING THERE HOLDING A KNIFE! Woody
text: falls backward onto the floor --
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: AHHHH!
speaker_heading: ALL OUR GUYS
speaker_heading: AHHHHHHH!
dialog: 54.
text: THE FIGURE FLIPS ON THE KITCHEN LIGHT revealing --
dialog: IT’S NIKKI. And it’s not a knife she’s got, it’s a

speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: What the fuck, fuckers! Nearly had a
dialog: goddamn heart attack.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You guys scared the shit outta me!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We scared you!?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What are you even doing here? With
dialog: the lights off?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: A fuse blew while I was vacuuming
dialog: this mess. Stupid cats.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Why’re you cleaning up after the
dialog: Hoffmans’ cats? And where’re the
dialog: Hoffmans?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: They're at the lakehouse for the
dialog: summer. They pay me to make sure
dialog: Barnaby and Trixy don’t die. Easy
dialog: money. Usually...
text: The guys share a look of relief tinged with disappointment.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Wanna explain what the hell you guys
dialog: are doing in here?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Sammy’s been missing so we thought
dialog: maybe... the Hoffmans were dead.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: And that it might’ve been Mackey...?
dialog: Seriously...?
text: Nikki CHUCKLES. Davey looks away, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: You told her? Okay, what is going on
dialog: with you two? You hookin up?
dialog: 55.
text: Davey gives him a piercing, horrified look. But Nikki smiles,
text: totally seeing what’s going on. She switches on the sexy.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Let’s just say he’s more of a man
dialog: than you jerkoffs.
text: She winks at Davey and heads off into the kitchen.
text: Davey’s eyes couldn’t be wider. He’s in shock. The other guys
text: LAUGH and HOLLER, proudly clapping him on the back.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Holy fucking shit. You’re my God.
text: JUST INSIDE THE KITCHEN, Nikki smiles wide, hearing it all...
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - DAY
text: Davey crashes into his room with a basket full of clothes --
speaker_heading: SHEILA (0.S.)
dialog: and don’t forget to clean your
dialog: room! I mean it --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I know, Mom. God...
text: Knocks a FRAMED PHOTO off of his nightstand. Picks it up --
text: It’s a PHOTO of DAVEY (10) WITH HIS YOUNGER MOM AND DAD. He
text: places it back on the nightstand as he dumps the clothes onto
text: his bed. Looks around the room at the MESS. Ugh...
text: He opens his disaster of a closet, jams more junk inside. As
text: he's about to close it, his eyes fall on --
text: TWO WORN GAMBLES G.I. JOE WALKIE-TALKIES atop a crate of old
text: toys. Davey’s wheels start spinning. He grabs his regular
scene_heading: STARCODE WALKIE --
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Guys, what time’re we playing Manhunt
dialog: tonight? I’ve got an idea...
scene_heading: EXT. MACKEY’S YARD - NIGHT
text: Dressed in black, the guys sprint through backyards, under
text: porches, over driveways, converging in the bushes along
text: Mackey’s house. They’re all out of breath, but exhilarated.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Arright, here’s the plan --
text: Davey pulls out the pair of old school G.I. Joe walkies.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Holy shit, you still have those?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: While you guys are spying, I’m gonna
dialog: plant one of these outside Mackey’s
dialog: window. Use the other one to listen.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Audio surveillance. Smart.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Let’s just not get caught, okay?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Mackey spots you, act like it’s part
dialog: of the game. We probably got five
dialog: minutes til those little shits are up
dialog: our asses with flashlights, so let’s
dialog: be quick. Farraday, Woody, you guys
dialog: take ground level. Me and Eats are up
text: top. Operation Manhunt starts now.
text: They break. Eats follows Farraday. Woody follows Davey...
text: -- Farraday runs into the bushes along the driveway. His head
text: pops up to LOOK INTO THE KITCHEN WINDOW as --
text: -- Eats climbs a tree to get eyes on the UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.
text: Looks down at Farraday. Thumbs up. Then flips him off.
text: -- Woody sneaks along the house to THE DINING ROOM WINDOW.
text: Where Davey saw the missing boy weeks ago. Looks up at --
text: -- Davey scales the tree at the front corner of the house,
text: over the driveway. Finds a VIEW INTO MACKEY’S BEDROOM.
text: Gazing into the window, Davey makes sure Mackey’s not there.
text: Whips out the G.I. Joe walkie, some duct tape. Wraps the tape
text: around the walkie SO THAT THE TRANSMIT BUTTON IS PERMANENTLY
scene_heading: PRESSED DOWN (i.e. ALWAYS LISTENING).
text: Davey slides himself out along a thick branch that reaches
text: toward the bedroom window. Manages to PLACE IT ON THE
text: WINDOWSILL just outside the bedroom. CLICKS IT ON --
speaker_heading: TOMMY (O.S.)
dialog: Found ya, ya big, bearded ball sack!
text: A BRIGHT LIGHT suddenly nails Woody below. He holds a hand to
text: his eyes, looks into TOMMY WARRENS’ (9) flashlight.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Fuck off, Tommy! We got time out!
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No, ya don’t -- I caught you!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Want me to beat the shit outta ya?
dialog: Cuz I will, ya little --
text: AHHH! Tommy runs off into the night, terrified. Just then --
speaker_heading: EATS (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: I got eyes on him!
text: IN THE TREE AROUND THE HOUSE, Eats hugs the branches to hide
text: as THROUGH THE WINDOW, he sees --
text: MACKEY, YELLOW RUBBER GLOVES on both hands. He gathers
text: CLEANING SUPPLIES into a BUCKET. He seems perturbed.
speaker_heading: EATS (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: He’s wearing rubber gloves! And he’s
dialog: got a bucket of cleaning shit.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Like, stuff to clean up blood?
text: Mackey heads out of the bathroom with his cleaning kit.
speaker_heading: EATS (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Guys, I lost him. He’s on the move.
text: IN THE BUSHES BELOW, Farraday sees Mackey enter the kitchen.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Got him! He just came downstairs.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: What’s in the bucket?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
text: Looks like bleach. And a scrubbing
dialog: brush. Can’t tell what the rest is.
text: What the...? Farraday spots a RED STAIN on Mackey’s shirt --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Blood! He’s got blood on him!
speaker_heading: DAVEY (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Holy crap -- Are you sure?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Well, maybe it’s paint? I don’t know.
dialog: It’s on his shirt -- Oh shit!
dialog: 58.
text: FARRADAY DROPS into the bushes as MACKEY WALKS RIGHT PAST the
text: window. When Farraday sneaks a peek again... MACKEY’S GONE --
text: ON THE DRIVEWAY SIDE, Mackey comes into Woody’s view --
speaker_heading: WOODY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: I got him!
text: Woody watches, face as close to the glass as he can get
text: without fogging it up as Mackey pauses at the BASEMENT DOOR.
text: Checks his bucket. Pissed, he rushes down the steps...
speaker_heading: WOODY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: He went into the basement!
text: Woody bolts to the nearest basement window. Crouches down to
text: look in but IT’S BLACKED OUT. PAINTED ON THE INSIDE. He
text: rushes to the next window. Same. Next window... Same. Shit.
speaker_heading: WOODY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Mackey’s M.I.A. All his basement
text: windows are painted over.
text: DAVEY DROPS TO THE GROUND, looks up at the bedroom window.
text: THE WALKIE IS HIDDEN by the sill except the tip of the
dialog: antenna. No way you’d see it. Unless you were looking for it.
text: Satisfied, Davey sneaks up to the nearest window. Raises
text: himself up to look inside just as --
text: MACKEY POPS INTO THE WINDOW! Slides it open to get fresh air,
dialog: not noticing Davey, until --
text: DAVEY PANICS! SCREAMS, sprints away, Woody right behind him!
text: From the far side of the house, Eats and Farraday sprint out
text: from the shadows following Davey and Woody.
text: Mackey stares out at them, concerned...
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: In bed but wide awake, Davey has the other G.I. JOE WALKIE on
text: his chest. He shakes it a few times, but nothing changes.
text: Total radio silence. He grabs his binoculars, looks out at --
text: BINOCULARS POV: Mackey's house. The tree beside it blocks
text: Davey’s view of the G.I. Joe walkie on the bedroom
dialog: windowsill. Damn.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
text: The G.I. Joe walkie’s not working.
dialog: 59.
text: He looks back at Woody who's lounging on the floor in his
text: sleeping bag, reading a comic by flashlight.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Did ya test em first?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Yeah, the batteries are brand new.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No, the distance. Remember? Those
dialog: things were junk, that’s why we
dialog: upgraded. They couldn’t transmit far.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Shit -- I forgot.
text: Woody hops up onto Davey's bed, grabs the binoculars and
text: gazes out toward Mackey's house.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: So what’re ya gonna do? Just say frig
dialog: it and leave it up there?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No way. Who knows what we could find
dialog: out. I gotta make it work.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - MORNING
text: Davey wheels down the sidewalk on his bike, chucking
text: newspapers onto porches. As he reaches Mackey’s driveway, he
text: slows to a stop. Waits -- No movement inside the house.
text: Coast seemingly clear, Davey drops his bike and newspaper
text: bag, hurries up the driveway...
text: At the side of the house, he reaches down and SWITCHES ON THE
text: G.I. JOE WALKIE clipped to his belt. NOTHING TRANSMITTING.
text: He goes to the tree below the window, gets ready to climb up
text: when he looks in the backyard and sees --
text: MACKEY, covered in sweat, dumping a big bag of dirt OVER A
text: HUMAN-SIZED MOUND IN THE GARDEN.
text: Davey freezes in disbelief as MACKEY LOOKS UP, SPOTS HIM --
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Yo, Davey!
text: Davey strains to keep himself from bolting as Mackey claps
text: dirt off his hands, walks up to the fence. Leans on it.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Hey, bud -- Gotta tell ya, you scared
dialog: the shit outta me last night. Had no
dialog: idea you were in my bushes. Great
dialog: hiding spot.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Yeah. Your yard’s full of em.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Guess you didn’t see me coming
dialog: either, huh? One hell of a scream.
text: Mackey LAUGHS. Davey fakes it. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck...
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: So what’s up? Oh -- Lemme guess, I
dialog: owe you money?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Uh, yeah.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Right. This time I’m ready for ya.
text: He pulls a $5 bill from his wallet. Holds it out to Davey.
text: Davey reluctantly walks toward him. AS HE NEARS THE HOUSE --
text: SCREECH! A HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK fills the air -- WALKIE-TALKIE
text: FEEDBACK! Horrified, Davey scrambles to turn off the
text: screaming walkie on his belt. Finds the POWER SWITCH. Flicks
text: it off. Immediately, the FEEDBACK STOPS.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Sorry. Must’ve left it on. From the
dialog: game last night.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Mind if I have a look at it?
text: Davey cautiously hands the walkie over. Mackey gives it a
text: quick once over. Hands it back.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: You know, if you ever want some real
dialog: walkies, I have a few retired ones
dialog: from the force just collecting dust
dialog: inside. Why don't ya come in and I'll
dialog: show ya. They pick up everything --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I can't. Right now. Gotta get back to
dialog: my route. But thanks for the payment.
dialog: 61.
text: Davey swipes the $5 bill from Mackey’s hand. Hurries back to
text: his bike. As he loads up and pedals off, he looks back.
text: Mackey hasn’t moved. Gives Davey a parting wave.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Davey tries to read his Hardy Boys book, but it’s impossible.
text: He grabs the G.I. JOE WALKIE, paces with it, glaring at the
text: object that nearly got him caught. Unable to resist the urge
text: anymore, he grabs his binoculars --
text: BINOCULARS POV: Mackey’s house. The tree outside Mackey’s
text: bedroom window is still blocking the view of the sill. Davey
text: PANS ACROSS the house. Finally lands on --
text: MACKEY! STARING BACK THROUGH BINOCULARS OF HIS OWN FROM A
scene_heading: DIFFERENT WINDOW!
text: Davey dives out of sight, heart in his throat, shaking --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Shitshitshitshit...
text: Cautiously, he picks up the binoculars again, kneels at the
text: window. Gathering his courage, he looks out to find --
text: BINOCULARS POV: MACKEY’S GONE! And then Davey sees it -- ON
text: THE INSIDE SILL OF THE WINDOW WHERE MACKEY JUST STOOD...
text: THE OTHER G.I. JOE WALKIE, STILL WRAPPED IN DUCT TAPE!
text: He knows! Davey lowers the binoculars, hands shaking, face
text: frozen in horror -- DEEP BREATH... DEEP BREATH...
text: What the fuck do I do!? Davey paces. Grabs his walkie --
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO WALKIE)
dialog: Guys! Guys! You copy? .... Come in!
dialog: (radio silence)
dialog: I’m freaking out! Woody, you there!?
text: Dead air. Davey chucks the walkie onto his bed. His eyes
text: canvas the room with purpose, landing on --
text: THE LOUISVILLE SLUGGER BASEBALL BAT leaning in the corner. He
text: grabs it. Pulls a chair to the window. Loops the binoculars
text: around his neck and props himself up on his elbows to keep an
text: overnight watch on Mackey's house. EYES WIDE, vigilant --
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - MORNING
text: BLINK... BLINK... Davey wakes. Still in the chair, still
text: holding the baseball bat. Realizes it's morning. Jolts up.
text: Wipes his eyes quickly, scanning the room. He’s alive.
dialog: 62.
text: Purpose in his eyes, he checks his watch: 9:33am. Bolts to
text: his nightstand, grabs his walkie. Pulls his notebook out of
text: the top drawer. Flips through pages until he lands on --
text: “MACKEY'’S DAILY SCHEDULE” Eyes pouring over the details,
text: Davey hones in on one line -- “11PM: GOES FOR A JOG.”

dialog: Guys, we gotta talk. Treehouse in

scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN IPSWICH - NIGHT
text: MACKEY. Dressed in Larry Bird short-shorts, high socks,

text: He’s all alone, king of the abandoned late night streets.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
text: The friggin walkie was sitting in his

speaker_heading: FARRADAY (V.O.)
dialog: Oh my god. He's onto us. I should've

speaker_heading: EATS (V.O.)
dialog: Your parents? Who listens to their

speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: There's no way he knows why we're

dialog: he's not onto you, he's onto me.
dialog: Which is why I need you guys now more

text: As Mackey keeps jogging, in the distance behind him, TWO

speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
text: Mackey goes for a jog every night at

dialog: Where are you and Eats gonna be?
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: INT. TREEHOUSE - EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON
text: The guys are all in front of the whiteboard. A military

speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: While you two follow Mackey, we’re
dialog: gonna tear up his garden. See if we

speaker_heading: EATS (V.O.)
dialog: What if Mackey catches us?
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: Not gonna happen. If he starts

text: Davey plants a HANDHELD CB RADIO in the dirt. Turns it on,

scene_heading: INT. TREEHOUSE - EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON
text: The guys seem a little hesitant.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Okay, but what about the garden? He’s
dialog: gonna notice it’s all dug up.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Raccoons. Just like with the garbage

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Food!

scene_heading: EXT. SELF-STORAGE FACILITY - OUTSKIRTS OF IPSWICH - NIGHT
text: Panting, the sweat-stained Mackey runs up to your typical

text: door. Enters and lowers the door ALMOST TO THE GROUND...
text: FROM AROUND THE CORNER, Farraday and Woody watch on, their
dialog: bikes on the ground. But from their perspective, they can’t

speaker_heading: FARRADAY

text: Woody turns back to find FARRADAY IS ALREADY GONE!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Farraday! Goddammit...
text: SNEAKING ALONG THE UNITS, Woody catches up to Farraday who’s
text: moving as silently and quickly as possible.
text: They finally get to the edge of Mackey’s unit, hearts
text: pounding. Farraday looks at Woody. Puts a finger to his lips:
dialog: Don’t make a sound! Woody snarls back: No shit!
text: Farraday points to Woody’s eyes, then around the corner: Take
text: a look. Woody angrily mouths, Why me? Farraday: DO IT!
text: Annoyed and terrified, Woody leans down, peeks inside the
text: unit. HE CAN ONLY SEE ALONG THE GROUND. The roll up gate is
text: blocking everything higher than a foot tall.
text: ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNIT are a shitload of BAGS OF SOIL, four
text: or five SHOVELS, the PICKAX, and a stack of LARGE, STRIPED
dialog: BAGS labeled “NaOH.”
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: “Noah"...?
dialog: 65.
text: Next to the bags is A CAR, only its tires visible --
text: SCREECH! MACKEY PULLS UP THE UNIT DOOR --
text: The guys jump back into the shadows as Mackey hops into his
text: YELLOW VOLKSWAGEN BUG. The car engine PUTTERS to a start...
text: Mackey PULLS THE CAR OUT OF THE UNIT. Hops back out, SINGING:
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: “Every step you take... Every move
dialog: you make...”
text: Mackey closes the unit door after him. Locks it...
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: “Every word you say... Every game you
dialog: play, I’ll be watching you...”
text: jumps back into his VW Bug and ZIPS AWAY...
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Was he talking to us?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: What? No dude, that was The Police.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You heard the police!?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: I pray for you sometimes...
text: Farraday and Woody sprint back to their bikes. As they race
text: away, Farraday YELLS into his HANDHELD CB RADIO --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (INTO CB RADIO)
dialog: Guys, Mackey just got into a yellow
dialog: Volkswagen Bug. We lost him.
scene_heading: EXT. MACKEY’S BACKYARD - GARDEN - CONTINUOUS
text: ON DAVEY’S CB RADIO, partially covered in dirt, VOLUME STILL
scene_heading: LOW. FARRADAY’S WORDS ARE BARELY AUDIBLE.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER CB RADIO)
dialog: I repeat, we lost him. Do you copy?
text: TEN FEET AWAY, the oblivious Davey and Eats are still
text: excavating, soaked in sweat.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: This is a lost cause. There’s nothing
dialog: here.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We're just not digging deep enough.
text: Their heavy breathing fills the air...
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: You know Mackey had a shed back here?
text: Davey turns. Sure enough, deep in Mackey’s backyard,
text: naturally camouflaged by trees, IS A UTILITY SHED.
scene_heading: EXT. MACKEY’S BACKYARD - UTILITY SHED - MOMENTS LATER
text: Davey and Eats peek inside the windows with bulky Durabeam
text: flashlights, but the glare on the glass is blinding.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Can’t see anything.
text: On the shed door is a PADLOCK. Davey jiggles it. IT’S LOCKED.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: I got this...
text: Eats reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a keychain. On it is
text: a PAPERCLIP. He unbends the paperclip, sticks it into the
text: padlock. Works it around skillfully for a moment --
text: CLICK -- The padlock releases. Eats nods arrogantly.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: How the hell’d you do that?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: I’m just good at working the hole.
text: Eats removes the lock. Opens the door.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Dude, I’m serious.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Honestly, just jiggle it a bunch,
dialog: work it around and it’1l pop open
dialog: most of the time. Wicked easy.
scene_heading: INT. UTILITY SHED - CONTINUOUS
text: The guys check every nook and cranny with their Durabeams:
text: tools, a lawn mower, a work bench... Usual shed stuff.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Well this whole night's been a waste
dialog: of time.
dialog: 67.
text: But something catches Davey’s eyes. In the corner. He shines
text: his light on it... and his eyes go wide!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Until now.
text: Davey reaches out, grabs a SHREDDED GREEN TEE SHIRT that’s
text: fallen underneath a workbench. Recognize the LOGO on it?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: It’s a shitty Atari shirt, so what?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: So, this is Dusty Dewitt’s shirt!
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Who...? .... Oh, the ginger.
text: Davey looks over the shirt, sees --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: This is blood!
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Fuck, dude. Heinous --
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, what are you doing in here!?
text: Davey and Eats nearly shit themselves as they spin to find --
text: FARRADAY AND WOODY, laughing their balls off.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: You two got a death wish!?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Us? What about you? We’ve been trying
dialog: to call you on the CB for like twenty
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Oh shit, we left it by the garden.
speaker_heading: WOODY
text: Mackey has a storage unit outside
text: town. And he keeps a VW Bug in it. He
dialog: drove off and we lost him --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: We have no clue where he’s going.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Then we better get the hell outta
dialog: here. Check out what we found...
text: As Davey shows the guys the bloodied Atari shirt, we --
scene_heading: INT. FARRADAY’S HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Eats picks through Farraday’s refrigerator while the other
text: guys chow down on PB&J sandwiches.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Why’s he got all those bags of dirt
dialog: in the storage unit?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Plus shovels and a pickax...?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Same reason he’s got Dusty Dewitt’s
dialog: shirt. He killed him and buried the
text: body somewhere.
text: Davey tosses the bloody, shredded shirt onto the counter.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Dude...! My mom makes my mac n’
dialog: cheese right there...
text: Farraday grabs a pair of TONGS out of a drawer, picks up the
text: nasty shirt and rests it atop the trash.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He also had a bunch of bags of...
dialog: something. They had chemical warning
dialog: signs on em, looked hazardous as
dialog: hell. “Noah,” that’s what it said.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: “Noah”? What the hell’s that?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: How the hell should I know? But it
dialog: was spelled kinda weird.
text: Woody grabs a notepad and a pen. Jots down a few chemical
text: symbols and writes “NoAH." Slides it over to Farraday --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Classic Woody. This look right?
text: Farraday crosses out “NoAH.” Writes down, “NaOH.”
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Yeah. Same thing.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: No, what you wrote means nothing.
dialog: What I wrote is the chemical formula
dialog: for Sodium Hydroxide.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Congrats, Woody -- You’re retarded.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Shove it, Eats.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What the hell’s sodium hydroxide?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: I know it isn’t useful in gardening.
dialog: Pretty sure it’d be toxic to plants.
text: Davey hurries to the bookcase full of ENCYCLOPEDIA
text: BRITANNICAs and scans them. Finds volume “Q-T.” Pulls it out,
text: flips through rapidly --
text: IN THE BOOK, Davey’s finger traces down the page landing on
text: “SODIUM HYDROXIDE." His eyes grow wider.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Holy shit, you guys!
text: As the guys gather around Davey, he reads aloud:
speaker_heading: DAVEY
text: “Sodium Hydroxide breaks down the
dialog: chemical bonds that keep flesh
text: intact, turning organic tissue to
dialog: liquid. It's frequently used to
dialog: decompose roadkill dumped in
dialog: landfills, as it prevents the growth
dialog: of microorganisms, therefore
text: neutralizing and immobilizing acidic
dialog: components formed in the
dialog: decomposition process. This will
dialog: reduce the odor of decomposition.”
text: Eats, Farraday and Woody listen in stunned silence.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: This sicko’s using this stuff to
dialog: cover up the smell from the dead
dialog: bodies he’s dumping someplace!
dialog: “Holy shit" looks all around.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Got good news for ya, Woody. It’s
dialog: time to tell my parents.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Out of breath, Davey and the guys unload on Davey’s visibly
text: distraught parents. Dusty Dewitt’s frozen face stares back at
text: them from the EMPTY MILK CARTON that sits atop the coffee
text: table beside the shredded BLOODSTAINED ATARI TEE SHIRT.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Mackey’s the Cape Ann Killer!
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: David Aaron Armstrong! Lower your
text: voice. People outside might hear.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Mackey’s a cop for Chrissakes! He’s
dialog: also been our neighbor since before
dialog: you were born --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Every serial killer is somebody's
dialog: neighbor, Dad --
speaker_heading: RANDALL
text: Regardless, a milk carton, a tee
dialog: shirt and a storage unit don’t prove
dialog: a goddamn thing!
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: How could you all go along with this?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: We didn’t want to, trust me.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: We wouldn’t have if it didn’t make so
dialog: much sense.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: After we followed him to that storage
dialog: unit and saw --
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Jesus, you’ve been spying on him!?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We had to! And the more we watch, the
text: more the details stack up. He goes
text: jogging at eleven at night. He buys
dialog: tons of dirt every week.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (CONT'D)
text: He keeps a spare car in a storage
dialog: unit. Why would he do that? There was
dialog: nothing in his garden when we dug it
dialog: up, but I’m positive that if --
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You dug up his -- Goddammit, Davey!
text: Randall can’t sit anymore. He gets up and paces. Nervous.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You are in deep, deep trouble! All of
dialog: you! Vandalism, spying, stealing --
dialog: This is unacceptable!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We're trying to save people.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Worry about yourselves! We’re going
dialog: over there right now and you’re going
dialog: to apologize for all of this.
text: Randall grabs the milk carton. Rams it against Davey’s chest.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: I’m putting an end to this nonsense
dialog: right now. You better hope he doesn’t
dialog: press charges.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - DAY
text: Randall marches across the cul-de-sac, the boys following
text: like dead men walking. WHISPERING to each other.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Fuck, Davey! You know how much shit
dialog: we're all gonna be in now?
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: What’re we even gonna say to him?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He’s probably gonna kill us --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Shut up!
text: Davey inconspicuously tucks the bloody shirt into his back
dialog: pocket as they reach --
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: EXT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Randall RINGS THE BELL. The guys all cower behind him as the
text: DOOR OPENS. Mackey freezes.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Randall. Guys. What’s up?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Hey, Wayne -- Uh, listen, the boys
dialog: have something they need to tell you,
dialog: and I wanna apologize in advance.
dialog: Just know that Sheila and I are as
dialog: outraged as you're about to be...
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Jesus... Well I’m sure whatever it
dialog: is, we can make things right.
text: Randall and Mackey look back at Davey, waiting. Davey sweats
dialog: under the pressure of being this close to Mackey. He can’t
text: find the words. Randall nudges him.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Uh, hey, Mr. Mackey -- We just wanted
dialog: to say we’re sorry. We’re the ones
dialog: who ripped up your garden. And your
dialog: garbage.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Oh man, I just assumed it was
dialog: raccoons. Why’d you do that?
text: Davey hands Mackey the MILK CARTON. Mackey looks at it,
text: confused. Randall shakes his head, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: A few weeks ago, I thought I saw that
dialog: boy in your house. We were playing
dialog: Manhunt and I was hiding in your
dialog: bushes and...
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: And...? Come on, out with it.
text: Davey looks to his buddies for support, but their looks
dialog: suggest he’s on his own. You got us into this...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I had this idea that you were,
dialog: maybe... the Cape Ann Killer.
text: Mackey stares at him a long, tense moment. The guys all ready
text: to run like hell. But then... Mackey LAUGHS.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: The guys at the station are gonna
dialog: roar when they hear this!
text: Randall smiles, relieved. The guys all chuckle a bit,
text: uncomfortable and unsure where this is going. Even Davey
text: gives an embarrassed smile, though it doesn’t reach his eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: So, who was the kid that was here?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: That was my nephew, Jamie. He was
dialog: helping me renovate my darkroom.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Thought ya didn’t have family nearby?
dialog: And we found this in your shed --
text: Davey hands the Atari shirt from his back pocket to Mackey --
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: David!?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: You broke into my shed, too?
text: Randall's blood boils, utterly embarrassed, as Mackey
text: inspects the shirt. Sees the blood immediately.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Wayne, I’m so sorry. You don’t need
dialog: to respond to that --
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: It's fine. We were hammering nails
dialog: all day. He must’ve cut himself.
dialog: Look, I can call him right now. Come
dialog: on in, let’s just settle this --
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: No, no. That’s not necessary. We just
dialog: wanted you to know what happened and
dialog: that the guys promise to fix anything
dialog: they damaged, no matter how long it
dialog: takes. Right?
speaker_heading: THE GUYS
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Well, I appreciate the apology. No
dialog: hard feelings, honestly.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: MACKEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I remember being a boy in the summer.
dialog: Hard to turn down an adventure.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You're a better man than me, Wayne.
dialog: 74.
text: Randall grabs Davey and pulls him away. The guys follow...
scene_heading: EXT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS
text: The guys try to avoid Randall’s seething gaze as he opens the
dialog: front door...
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Tell your friends goodbye, then get
dialog: in your room and don’t come out. The
dialog: rest of you, go home. We’1l be
dialog: calling your parents.
text: and heads inside -- WHAM! -- SLAMS the door.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Well, that was a fucking disaster.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: This doesn't change anything.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Seriously? Davey, come on. I mean, is
dialog: it possible he’s the killer? Maybe.
dialog: But odds are still that it’s not him.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Your summer’s fucked, but we may get
dialog: outta this with just garden duty. I’m
dialog: not risking what little of the good
dialog: life I got left...
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Spying on him was cool, but let’s
dialog: just move on already.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You guys, we just need a couple more
dialog: pieces of real evidence --
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Give it up, dude! I’m outta here.
dialog: Call me when you get a life...
text: Eats crosses to his own yard without looking back. Davey
text: looks imploringly at Farraday.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: I wanted to believe it too. But
dialog: what’s more likely? That we got
dialog: caught up in the moment, or that a
dialog: cop we’ve known all our lives is a
dialog: serial killer?
text: Farraday claps Davey on the shoulder, heads home.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Sorry, Davey. I’11 radio you tonight.
text: Woody walks off, leaving Davey alone on the porch. Davey
text: glares across the street to Mackey’s, enraged.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: A PAPERCLIP jiggles in the keyhole of a PADLOCK. Davey bites
text: his lip in concentration. Nothing. Jiggles some more. Then --
text: CLICK! The lock opens. Davey smiles as --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Holy shit, it worked...
text: BRRRING! The house phone RINGS. Davey bolts off his bed, runs
text: into the hallway and answers --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Hello...?
speaker_heading: NIKKI (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
dialog: Can you come over?
scene_heading: INT. NIKKI’S HOUSE - NIKKI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Davey looks around, enthralled. HE’S IN A GIRL’S BEDROOM! And
dialog: not just any girl’s room -- NIKKI FUCKIN KASZUBA’S!
text: Half-packed CARDBOARD BOXES fill the room. It’s a mess. Nikki
text: sits on the bed in the eye of the storm as Davey takes it in.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Did I get you in trouble for calling
dialog: so late? I was hoping your mom
dialog: wouldn’t pick up.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Nah, they’re downtown at a meeting
dialog: about how to handle the block party
dialog: situation. Looks like you’re the one
dialog: who could use some help, though.
dialog: Nikki hands him something --
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Hey, check out what I found...
text: Hands him a WORN PHOTO of the two of them together, back when
text: she had braces and he was still in grade school.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: It’s coming with me.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: To UConn? Really?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yeah... It’s going up on my wall.
text: Davey swells with pride as an overwhelmed Nikki drinks in her
text: barely-recognizable room...
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: God, feels like I’m packing up my
dialog: whole life. I didn’t think I’d miss
dialog: this place, but now... I can’t deal.
text: Out of his depth, Davey sinks down to the bed beside her.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Seriously? Aren’t you the one who
dialog: says this town’s lame?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I don’t know what I feel anymore.
dialog: Everyone keeps talking to me like I’m
text: already gone and it’s wigging me out.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s probably just cuz everyone’s
dialog: gonna miss you. I know I will.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Wish my parents felt that way.
dialog: They’re so wrapped up in the divorce,
dialog: they don’t even care that I’m gonna
dialog: be gone. I just feel so... alone.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You’re not alone.
text: He puts a supportive hand on her arm. There’s a smooth
text: confidence to him that’s charming. Nikki can’t help smiling.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You're sweet. Hope the students at
dialog: uConn like me half as much as you.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: They will. You’re destined for way
dialog: more than living in this stupid
dialog: neighborhood forever. I'd give
dialog: anything to get outta here with you.
text: Nikki reads Davey’s conflicted face like a National Enquirer.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Okay, spill.
dialog: (Davey feigns ignorance)
dialog: I remember that look. Used to see it
dialog: all the time. You're in trouble, huh?
text: Davey considers... Finally comes out with it --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’m grounded, big time. My parents
dialog: are pissed. My Dad made me admit the
dialog: whole thing to Mackey --
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What!? No he didn’t!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: The guys bailed on me. Worst part is
dialog: I know I’m right about him. Just
dialog: don’t know what else I can do.
text: Nikki takes his hand. He meets her concerned gaze.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Let it go. You only get the chance to
dialog: be a kid once. Enjoy your life while
dialog: you can. Trust me.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: If I’m right, who’s gonna stop him?
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAY
text: ON THE FRONT DOOR -- KNOCK! KNOCK!
text: WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING THE STAIRS, revealing --
text: Davey. He fixes his hair in the mirror beside the door,
text: clearly hoping it’s Nikki. He opens the door to find --
text: MACKEY. In his police uniform. Oh shit! Davey immediately
text: stands straighter. Glances at the GUN in Mackey’s holster.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Hey, Davey. What’s goin on?
dialog: Davey just
dialog: His choice
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What’re you doing here?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: I wanted to make sure we’re good. I
dialog: feel pretty bad about everything that
dialog: happened yesterday.
text: stares back at him, unsettled.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Mind if I come in for a second so we
dialog: can talk?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Now’s not a good time.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Cool. I get that... You know we’ve
dialog: got everyone out looking for this
dialog: sicko, right?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Then why haven’t you found him yet?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: These things take time. Sometimes
dialog: years. If ya want, I can stop by and
dialog: give you updates.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You don’t have to do that. I see the
dialog: paper before anyone, remember?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: You sure? It’d be my pleasure. I know
dialog: this stuff interests you.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Was there anything else, Mr. Mackey?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Wow, you really don’t like me, huh?
dialog: That really bums me out, Davey. Last
dialog: thing I want is for there to be bad
dialog: blood between us.
text: of words sober Davey. He pauses... Softens...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Yeah, me too. It’s just my summer’s
dialog: basically destroyed now because of
dialog: the whole garden thing. Pretty sure
dialog: my parents hate me.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Want me to talk to them? See if I can
dialog: lighten the sentence? Happy to.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s all right. Thanks though.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: I just keep wondering what I did that
dialog: made you so suspicious of me...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I dunno. My dad says I read too many
dialog: mysteries. With the Killer on the
dialog: loose, I just got caught up in it.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Hey, I get it. That’s why I became a
dialog: cop. It’s exciting what’s going on,
dialog: and you wanna help. That’s awesome.
dialog: I’1l admit, the stuff you thought was
dialog: proof looked pretty bad out of
dialog: context. You’ve got the brain for
dialog: this kinda work.
text: Davey smiles. Finally lets down his guard.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Anything I can do to smooth things
dialog: over once and for all?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Yesterday you offered to call your
dialog: nephew. Wanna maybe call him now?
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Yeah, absolutely. Kinda gotta come in
dialog: to do that though.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Actually, our cord’s wicked long.
dialog: Wait here a sec --
text: Davey hurries off into the --
text: KITCHEN. Back against the cupboards, Davey’s freaking the fuck
text: out. He slowly sneaks a peek around the corner to find --
text: Mackey’s taken one step into the house. Standing there
text: looking as awkward as anyone would in this scenario.
text: Davey leans back into the kitchen. Takes a few DEEP BREATHS.
text: Spots the WOODBLOCK FULL OF KNIVES.
dialog: 80.
text: Plucks out the BUTCHER KNIFE and slides it carefully down the
text: back of his pants. Picks the kitchen phone off the jack,
dialog: heads back into the --
text: LIVING ROOM. Hands Mackey the phone, cord dangling off into
text: the kitchen. Mackey points into the living room.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Place looks great. Haven’t been here
dialog: since -- Man, you were probably a
dialog: toddler. I helped your dad haul a
dialog: bunch of stuff into your attic.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Weird how times change, huh?
text: Mackey DIALS. Puts the phone to his ear --
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: My sister lives in New Hampshire.
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: Hmm, they might not be home. Jamie’s
dialog: big into baseball. Usually has
dialog: practice around now, I think.
text: He listens for a few more moments. Shakes his head. Holds out
text: the phone so Davey can hear the RINGING.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: I can come back if you want? Try him
dialog: again later...?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No, it’s fine -- I’m sorry for being
dialog: such an idiot. I promise we’ll fix
dialog: your garden even better than it was.
text: Mackey hands the phone back. Offers his hand to Davey.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: No hard feelings?
text: Davey’s hand trembles slightly as he takes it.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Sorry again you’re grounded. I’1l see
dialog: what I can do about getting you out
dialog: of the house, all right?
text: Mackey heads off down Davey’s driveway and Davey shuts the
text: door behind him. LOCKS IT. Peeks out to make sure Mackey’s
dialog: leaving. Bolts --
dialog: 81.
text: BACK INTO THE KITCHEN. Rushes to the whiteboard on the
text: fridge. Grabs the MARKER and DIALS “0” on the PHONE.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
dialog: Operator. How may I direct your call?
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Can you tell me the last number
dialog: dialed from my house?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (0.S.)(OVER PHONE)
dialog: The last number dialed from that
dialog: residence was 508-356-0742.
text: Davey writes the number on the whiteboard. HANGS UP, eyes
text: wide. He quickly scans the list of EMERGENCY NUMBERS beside
text: the whiteboard, finds what he's looking for --
text: IT'S MACKEY'S PHONE NUMBER!
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - LATER
text: The guys are all here. Davey looks between them for some kind
dialog: of reaction, other than disinterest.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: How are you not freaking out right
dialog: now!? He called himself! There is no
dialog: Jamie! He tried to throw me off and I
dialog: caught him. This proves he's guilty!
dialog: We gotta get into that house to find
dialog: out what’s in that basement --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Are you crazy? Look how much trouble
dialog: you're in just for digging up his
dialog: garden --
speaker_heading: SHEILA (0.S.)
dialog: Davey! Get down here!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Shit. Wait here. Don’t make a sound.
text: He grabs his walkie. Clips it to his belt.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: If I think my mom knows you’re up
dialog: here, I’1l radio so you can climb out
dialog: the window.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Davey jumps down the stairs to find his mother Sheila
text: standing before the television once more.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: I want you to see this.
text: ON THE TV is a LIVE PRESS CONFERENCE. Sheriff Caldwell is at
text: a podium filled with microphones.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF CALDWELL (FROM TV)
dialog: -- happy to report that we have the
text: Cape Ann Killer in custody.
text: A MUGSHOT of an average WHITE GUY (40s) pops onto the screen.
text: Beneath the photo: “JAMES VIGNERON - ‘THE CAPE ANN KILLER’”.
text: Davey’s jaw drops in disbelief as the PHONE RINGS. Sheila
text: goes to answer it in the kitchen as Davey subtly reaches for
text: his walkie. Holds down the TRANSMIT BUTTON --
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: The three guys are mid whisper argument when the WALKIE in
text: Woody’s hand suddenly comes to life. They shut up --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF CALDWELL (0.S.)(OVER WALKIE)
dialog: Thanks to the fine effort of the
dialog: Ipswich Police Department, we
dialog: apprehended Mr. Vigneron earlier
dialog: today. I’d like to bring up the
text: arresting officer, Wayne Mackey.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Holy fucking shit!
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Davey watches on in stunned silence as Sheila talks on the
text: phone, hidden from view in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MACKEY (FROM TV) SHEILA (0.S.)
dialog: I know this has been a trying No, I think it's perfect!
dialog: time for our community. But +... In poor taste? No, this

dialog: will bring peace to those who to help lift their spirits.
dialog: have been living in fear. +... Ok, be there in a few.
text: Mackey looks at the camera, as though seeing Davey through
text: the airwaves. Davey stares back, unflinching.
speaker_heading: MACKEY (FROM TV)
dialog: Justice will be served. Thank you.
dialog: 83.
text: Mackey waves and steps down as the CROWD APPLAUDS and Sheila
text: returns to stand at Davey's side.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: The block party's back on. And all
dialog: because of Mr. Mackey. While the rest
dialog: of us are celebrating, I want you to
dialog: think about your actions. Because it
text: turns out the man across the street
dialog: isn't a killer, David, he's a hero.
scene_heading: EXT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A frustrated Davey stands before his incredulous buddies.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: He’s not a hero! Did you guys not
dialog: just hear that broadcast? Now we know
dialog: he’s guilty!
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Are you retarded? He caught the
dialog: killer! It can’t be him!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Don’t you think it’s a little
dialog: coincidental that the guy we just
dialog: accused of being the killer just so
dialog: happens to then catch the killer?
dialog: Farraday, you said it yourself --
dialog: Cape Ann’s wicked big, right?
dialog: Farraday shrugs: Yeah, I guess...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: This is exactly what we talked about
dialog: -- He’s a cop, it’s the perfect
dialog: cover. He can plant evidence to make
dialog: someone else look guilty! If Mackey’s
dialog: got these bodies, all he’d have to do
dialog: is plant one in someone’s yard. Boom
dialog: -- They’ve got a suspect.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Dude, you just sound desperate now.
dialog: Just admit you were wrong and --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’m not wrong! I know there’s
dialog: something behind that locked door! We
dialog: have to find out what before some
dialog: innocent guy takes the rap for Mackey
dialog: and more people die!
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Even if you got in, how are you gonna
dialog: get any evidence out? Can’t just drag
text: a body out of a basement.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I don’t have to. I’m gonna use my
dialog: dad's camcorder, film it all. No need
dialog: to steal evidence if I get it on
dialog: tape. Tape doesn’t lie.
text: Davey can see clearly the doubt etched on their faces.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I just need you guys to keep watch,
dialog: and make sure Mackey doesn’t come
dialog: home while I’m in there.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: No, I’m done with this shit. You’re
dialog: gonna get caught, either by Mackey or
dialog: your dad --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Everyone’s gonna be at the block
dialog: party. All I need you to do is set up
text: at the bus shelter down the street.
dialog: Bring booze and pornos, whatever.
dialog: Just radio me if Mackey’s car comes
dialog: up. And Farraday --
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: You know my parents make me go to the
dialog: block party every year --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’m counting on it. You can keep eyes
dialog: on Mackey there. He leaves early, you
dialog: give me the heads-up. We’1ll have
dialog: multiple layers of protection. No way
dialog: we get caught.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: “We”?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You’re coming with me. I’11l owe you.
text: The guys consider for a few moments. Then, finally --
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: If it means we're gonna finish
dialog: this... I guess I'm in.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: Yeah... me too. One last shot.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Whatever, fine. But if anyone asks,
dialog: I’m pinning the whole thing on you.
text: Davey smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Mackey’s crazy if he thinks he can do
dialog: this shit on our block and get away
dialog: with it. Time to make him pay.

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: This is so not fair!
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: David, a punishment’s a punishment.
dialog: If you really gave a damn about going

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Just lemme go and I’11 be grounded

speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Not happening! End of story!
text: Randall heads out with Sheila. Once the door is shut --

text: FROM HIS DRIVEWAY, Mackey pulls out in his SQUAD CAR. Gives a
text: friendly BWOOP-BWOOP and flashes the lights for the CHEERING

text: IN THE CROWD, Farraday hangs back from his parents, eyes on --
text: MACKEY, dressed in his police uniform. He’s beside a few

text: VAN. Davey opens the trunk, pulls out the BETAMAX CAMCORDER --—
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Hold this.
text: He hands the camcorder to Woody, grabs a BATTERY PACK, an

text: UNKNOWN POV: From across the street, we watch Davey and Woody

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Kay, now let me in.

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: He’s definitely killed kids in here.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Why would you say that right now?

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What're you doing here?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: After everything you've told me, I

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Thought you said I should let it go.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Yeah, well, if you're right, who else

text: Farraday moves closer to get a better view. As he splits
text: through the crowd, he sees --
text: MACKEY and five other POLICE OFFICERS, SHOVELS IN HAND,
text: camera-ready, gathered along a brand-new median strip. In the
text: strip are beautiful flowers, COVERED IN FRESH SOIL. A PICKAX
text: leans against the centerpiece of the strip, a TREE.
text: A SIGN sticking out of the dirt reads, “DOWNTOWN
scene_heading: BEAUTIFICATION PROJECT - SPONSORED BY THE IPSWICH P.D.”
text: Farraday nearly shits himself, face turning white as a ghost.
scene_heading: INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We don’t have to go down there...
text: CLICK -- Davey turns the doorknob, slowly opens the door.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I do.
text: Woody GULPS. TURNS ON THE CAMCORDER as Davey flicks the light
text: switch. NOTHING HAPPENS. The stairs remain pitch black.
speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: FARRADAY (0.S.)(OVER CB)
dialog: Davey! Davey, you copy!?

speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO CB)

text: In an alley, away from the crowd, Farraday spies the

speaker_heading: FARRADAY (INTO CB)
dialog: Way worse. You’re wrong about

speaker_heading: FARRADAY (INTO CB) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO CB)
dialog: That doesn’t prove anything.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY (INTO CB)
dialog: Listen to me -- It’s over. You’ve

dialog: focus. I’m out, Davey.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (INTO CB)
dialog: Farraday, wait --
text: CLICK. Farraday shuts off his CB, joins the fun.
speaker_heading: WOODY

dialog: just go. This is crazy. We just broke
dialog: into a friggin cop’s house!
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: We're already here. May as well take
dialog: a look. If it's not him --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s him. And we’re about to find the
dialog: proof.
text: Davey takes his first step down into the darkness --
scene_heading: INT. JUNIPER STREET - SCHOOL BUS SHELTER - CONTINUOUS
text: Massive Cariole headphones over his ears, Eats sits on the
text: shelter bench, tears in his eyes, listening to a punk song --
text: HEADLIGHTS wash over him and he perks up, freaked out. Wipes
text: his tears. Is it Mackey!? Grabs his CB RADIO...
text: but the car rolls past. Relief.
scene_heading: INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: As they make their way down the basement steps, scared
text: shitless, the pitch blackness blends with a BLOOD RED GLOW.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Tell me you brought a flashlight.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
text: The camcorder's got a light.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: This thing has a light and you’re
dialog: just telling me now!?
text: Davey reaches over, clicks the camcorder’s light switch --
text: ITS BEAM PIERCES THROUGH THE CRIMSON DARK, bright, focused,
text: but THE PERIPHERY IS ABSOLUTE BLACK. TUNNEL VISION.
text: Woody uses the light to scan the area. TO THEIR LEFT is
text: Mackey’s dark room, red light emanating from within. TO THEIR
text: RIGHT, a washer and dryer. EVERY WINDOW IS PAINTED BLACK.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Creepiest basement ever --
text: WHACK! Woody hits his head on A DANGLING LIGHTBULB --
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Jesus, fuck!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s just a light!

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I can’t see! I can’t see --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Calm down. Just follow me.
text: Woody puts his hand on Davey’s shoulder as they move to --
text: THE PADLOCKED DOOR in the corner that captured Davey’s
dialog: attention from the moment he saw it --
text: KACHUNK! Woody SCREAMS, whips the camcorder around to find --
text: THE LARGE FURNACE, its metal GROANING.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Woody! Chill out, you girl!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I’m not built for this shit.
text: Davey moves to the door. Pulls a PAPERCLIP out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
text: Shine the light right on the lock.
text: Woody brings the light over. Davey straightens the paperclip.
text: Sticks it into the keyhole. Jiggles it around --
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Seriously? Did Eats teach you that?
dialog: Because it doesn’t work --
text: CLICK! THE PADLOCK RELEASES.
scene_heading: INT. JUNIPER STREET - SCHOOL BUS SHELTER - SAME
text: Eats hasn’t moved, still desolate, off in another world --
text: SCREECH! Eats’ eyes burst open -- What the fuck was that!? He
text: RIPS OFF HIS HEADPHONES, looks around, listens intently...
text: THE ONLY SOUND IS THE TINNY MUSIC COMING FROM HIS HEADPHONES.
text: A SUMMER BREEZE COURSES through the trees, questionable
text: sounds all around. And then --
text: DEAFENING SILENCE envelops the area. Until --
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (0.S.)
speaker_heading: VAGINA!
text: AHHH! Eats jumps back, petrified, to find --
text: FARRADAY, laughing his ass off.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: You’re such a friggin dick!

speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Why’re you even here? You’re supposed
text: to be watching Mackey.
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: My mom and dad wanted to leave. I ran
dialog: ahead to fuck with you. I’m sorry.
dialog: You can go home. Whole thing’s off.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: What do you mean? Davey’s still in
dialog: Mackey’s house --
scene_heading: MR. AND MRS. FARRADAY approach -- EH-EHM!
speaker_heading: CURTIS SR.
dialog: Thomas. What on Earth are you doing
dialog: at the school bus shelter this late?
text: Eats releases his death grip. Straightens Farraday’s clothes.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Oh, I was just showing Curtis here a
dialog: few Karate Kid moves I’ve been
dialog: practicing. Wax on, wax off...
text: They don’t get the reference. Academic types. Awkward.
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Hey, mind if I sleep over tonight? My
text: parents are fighting again.
speaker_heading: FRANCINE
dialog: Of course. Poor thing. They have no
dialog: idea the damage they're doing to you.
speaker_heading: CURTIS SR.
dialog: But Curtis, no fun until your
dialog: reading’s done. Understood?
text: Farraday nods, annoyed, as his parents head off...
speaker_heading: FARRADAY
dialog: How bad is it this time?
speaker_heading: EATS
dialog: Let’s just say I don’t wanna witness
dialog: a murder-suicide...
text: Eats grabs the handheld CB. TURNS IT OFF --
scene_heading: INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - MAKESHIFT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: We finally get a good look at the place as Woody moves the
text: light around. It’s a bedroom. A teenage boys’ room. Sports
text: posters on the wall. A twin bed. Vintage radio on a dresser.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What is this place?
text: Davey touches the frayed ear of a stuffed bunny that sits in
text: a heap of old stuffed animals on a rocking chair. He lifts
text: the blanket on the bed. It’s raggedy, worn. Pillowcase too.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You think he keeps his victims down
dialog: here or something?
text: Davey inspects the AUTOGRAPH on a RED SOX TEAM POSTER...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: “To Wayne. Keep it up, Slugger.”
dialog: 94.
text: He finds the year on the poster -- 1956. Davey looks around
text: with new eyes, realizes why it all seems off. Everything’s
text: frayed and yellowed under a sheen of mold and dust. It’s old.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Holy shit. This stuff’s all his. Like
dialog: from when he was a kid or something.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: But Mackey didn’t grow up here. My
dialog: dad said he's from Maine.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: He must've brought it all here.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: You said there was gonna be proof,
dialog: Davey -- Where is it?
text: As the camcorder light moves around, SOMETHING CATCHES
text: DAVEY’S EYE ON THE WALL BEHIND THEM --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Wait, shine it back over there!
text: Woody retraces his path. The light falls on --
text: A WALL OF PICTURES. They move closer to discover... THE
text: PICTURES ARE OF THEM! SPYING! IN THEIR ROOMS, THE TREEHOUSE,
text: THE TENT, THE BUSHES, GOING THROUGH MACKEY’S TRASH, ON
text: WALKIES, USING BINOCULARS!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: This enough proof for you?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He was watching us the whole time!?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Suburbia's so fucked up.
text: THUD! Woody whips the light around as they all look at the
text: far corner of the room. STRANGE NOISES come from behind a
text: door they hadn't noticed. SHUFFLING... MUFFLED SOUNDS...
text: Davey slowly approaches the door, grabs the knob. Looks back
dialog: at Woody and Nikki. This is it.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Make sure you're filming.
text: Woody nods, terrified. Davey yanks open the door revealing --
dialog: 95.
text: A BATHROOM. Woody shines the camcorder light around at eye-
text: level. Mold stains the walls beneath peeling paint. Gross.
text: The light finally finds a bathtub, its CURTAIN CLOSED.
text: FLIES BUZZ in the air -- Davey, Woody and Nikki swat at them
text: as Davey inches toward the curtain, HEART POUNDING... Reaches
text: out... GA-GLUNK... Grabs it... Then RIPS OPEN the curtain --
text: A BURGUNDY SLUDGE fills the tub, a couple UNIDENTIFIABLE BITS
text: jutting slightly out of it.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: What the heck is that?
text: Davey grabs the plunger, pushes it into the sludge. Rotates
text: whatever's in there, EXPOSING MORE OF IT.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Gimme some more light.
text: Woody focuses the camcorder’s light on the bits jutting out
text: of the sludge, and WE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE --
scene_heading: THE PARTIALLY DECOMPOSED HAND AND FACE OF DUSTY DEWITT, THE
text: MISSING REDHEADED BOY!!! !!!ii!ribbrriet
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s fuckin Dusty Dewitt!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Oh god... oh my god...
text: AHHHHHH! NIKKI LETS OUT A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM! Woody
text: follows her gaze, aiming the camcorder at the floor where --
text: A PAIR OF HANDS ARE WRAPPED AROUND NIKKI'S ANKLE! The light
text: reveals duct-taped wrists, moves up the emaciated arms to
text: find the battered face of BOBBY COKER! One ankle chained to a
text: radiator.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Get him off me! Get him off!
text: Davey drops to his knees, wrenching Bobby's hands from Nikki.
text: But Bobby grabs Davey's collar, yanking Davey's face just
text: inches from his own as he SCREAMS around the gag --
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: HELP ME!!!
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. MACKEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Davey and Woody burst out of the basement, holding up Bobby

text: at it, FACES VISIBLE IN THE MOONLIGHT. Something registers...
text: Davey stops to pick it up, realization in his eyes --

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Davey, let’s go! .... Davey!
text: IN THE PICTURE, a smiling BLOND BOY (15) --
scene_heading: FLASH! MICROFICHE, FROM DAVEY’S TRIP TO THE LIBRARY. Front

text: A PHOTO OF DAVEY AND HIS FAMILY! THE ONE FROM HIS NIGHTSTAND!
speaker_heading: DAVEY

dialog: 97.

text: A handful of COPS have the same looks of horror as they watch
text: the Betamax tape in stunned silence. Standing among them,
text: Brenda Woodworth, in her nurse’s uniform, flanked by Randall
text: and Sheila holding her hands in support.
text: THROUGH THE CONFERENCE ROOM WINDOWS, Davey watches Bobby
text: Coker wrapped in a blanket, his PARENTS holding him and
text: crying. A family reunited. Because of him.
text: As the tape ends, Sheriff Caldwell looks at Davey and Woody
text: across the table.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF CALDWELL
dialog: You found all this in his house?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: And there's pictures of dead people
dialog: all over the fuckin walls!
text: Caldwell stands, addresses the gathering of cops.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF CALDWELL
dialog: Somebody get out to Mackey’s. And
dialog: bring that sick son of a bitch to me.
dialog: (to the parents)
dialog: You folks mind sticking around to
dialog: give a report? Only take a while.
text: Randall and Sheila nod approval as the cops scatter ina
text: rush. Before heading out, Caldwell turns back.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF CALDWELL
dialog: You two must be proud. These boys are
dialog: heroes.
scene_heading: EXT. IPSWICH POLICE STATION - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: Stepping outside, Davey takes a deep breath of fresh, cool
text: night air. He looks back through the glass doors to see all
text: the parents talking with Sheriff Caldwell.
text: From inside, Nikki sees him, breaks away from her parents and
text: jogs out to meet him.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Hey. You okay?
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Is it me or does none of this feel
dialog: real?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You're telling me. I just saw my
dialog: parents hug each other for the first
dialog: time in... awhile. So yeah...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Wow, that's awesome.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Not gonna get my hopes up but... That
dialog: happened because of you. So thanks.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I dunno about that. I mean --
text: Nikki seizes the moment -- AND KISSES HIM. Davey's eyes go
text: wide, then close. He's in Heaven. Like, whoa.
text: When Nikki pulls away, Davey's eyes stay closed.
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: See ya, Davey.
text: Heading back inside, Nikki passes Davey's parents who exit to
text: find Davey staring after her, still in a stupor.
scene_heading: INT. RANDALL’S CAR - HOURS LATER
text: The family drives in silence. Exhausted from giving a police
text: report, and from the depth of depravity they’re faced with.
text: Davey meets Randall’s gaze IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR... And
text: Randall dissolves to tears.
text: Sheila leans over on Randall, embracing him as he drives,
text: tears in her eyes.
text: Davey lets it all wash over him -- The fear, the anger, the
text: sorrow, the unadulterated reality of what’s happened. Tears
text: stream down his face as he looks back up to meet --
text: RANDALL'S RELIEVED EYES, in the REARVIEW once more.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: I’m so sorry, Davey. I love you, pal.
dialog: Proud of you. Real proud.
text: Sheila reaches back, squeezes Davey’s hand as --
dialog: 99.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - LATER
text: Davey’s perched atop his bed, staring out the picture window.
text: BLUE AND RED LIGHT flickering on his face from outside.
speaker_heading: SHEILA (0.S.)
dialog: And Davey’s got the sleeping bag all
dialog: set up for ya --
text: Woody, Sheila and Randall enter the room.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: -- when your mom gets off her shift
dialog: in the morning, she’ll pick you up.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong.
text: Randall and Woody join Davey at the window. Look out to see
dialog: the beehive of activity below --
text: POLICE CRUISERS crowd Mackey’s driveway. OFFICERS move in and
text: out of the house carrying BAGGED EVIDENCE. Another CRUISER
text: sits parked at the end of Davey’s driveway. NEIGHBORS crowd
text: around, watching, gossiping.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: You're safe, guys. They’ll keep an
dialog: eye out, make sure nothing happens.
text: Davey LOCKS HIS WINDOW.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Wonder where he is...
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: The A.P.B.’s been out for hours. Just
dialog: a matter of time now.
text: Davey climbs into bed as Woody settles in on the floor.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: We love you. You boys are gonna be
dialog: the talk of the town. How’s it feel?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Like nothing’s ever gonna be the same
dialog: again...
text: Randall and Sheila kiss Davey on his head and exit. Once
text: they’re gone, Davey looks back out the window at the activity
text: at Mackey’s house. Woody joins him.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Think they’1l catch him?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
text: There’s nowhere left for him to hide.
dialog: It’s over. We got him.
text: The boys give each other a high-five, crawl back into bed.
text: But as Davey lies down, he stares at the ceiling, worried...
speaker_heading: HOURS LATER
text: The boys have finally fallen asleep. WE TRACK THROUGH the
dialog: room, OUT INTO THE --
text: HALLWAY. MOVING THROUGH the darkened house until we TILT UP --
text: ERRRRK... THE ATTIC DOOR QUIETLY OPENS, seemingly on its
text: own... The slide-down ladder extends toward the floor... A
text: SHOE drops down, hits the first step. A COP’S SHOE.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Still asleep in his bed, Davey stirs a bit. Rolls over on his
text: side, back to the doorway --
scene_heading: SENSING SOMETHING, HIS EYES OPEN AS --
text: A HAND, A CHLOROFORM RAG, COMING DOWN, SMOTHERING HIS MOUTH
text: AND NOSE, MUFFLING HIS HYSTERICAL SCREAM!
text: DAVEY FIGHTS FOR A MOMENT... But his spirit is quickly sapped
text: thanks to the chemical’s handiwork.
text: Davey looks into MACKEY’S EMPTY EYES as his own flutter shut.
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK
text: The CONSTANT SUMMERTIME DRONE OF KATYDIDS AND CRICKETS...
text: WAVES GENTLY WASHING ASHORE, not far away...
text: A TUGBOAT HORN, far off in the distance...
text: FLASHING LIGHTS, BLUE AND RED, through closed eyelids...
scene_heading: BWOOP-BWOOP! A POLICE SIREN SHOCKS US --
speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
dialog: 101.
text: BLINK-BLINK... BLINK... AS WE COME-TO, OUR VISION IS BLURRY.
text: STROBING RED AND BLUE LIGHTS BLIND US. But AS OUR SIGHT
dialog: CLEARS, we realize we’re in --
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT
text: Davey sits up quickly, panicked. Looks around. Where the fuck
text: am I? Realizes he’s in the back of a cop car, WINDOWS FOGGED
text: UP. He’s bound at the wrists with rope and gagged. Beside
text: him, Woody is out cold, bound and gagged as well.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (muffled, through gag)
dialog: Woody! .... Woody!
text: Davey leans into Woody, nudging him hard as he can -- WOODY
text: COMES-TO. Looks around -- FREAKED THE FUCK OUT, he bolts back
text: against the car door, BREATHING HARD.
text: Davey moves his jaw and neck, makes his way out of the gag.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Turn around. I’1l untie you.
text: Davey and Woody sit back-to-back. Davey struggles to loosen
text: the rope around Woody’s wrists. Finally unties it. Hands
text: free, Woody removes his gag, unties Davey’s wrists --
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Davey, what the fuck is going on!? I
dialog: don’t even know how I got here --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s Mackey.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Where the hell are we!?
text: They wipe the fog off the windows. Scan the darkness outside,
text: illuminated in bursts by the STROBING POLICE LIGHTS...
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I can’t see shit!
text: THUD! SOMETHING HEAVY HITS THE SIDE OF THE CAR -- The boys
text: jump away from the windows, eyes darting every which way.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: The fuck was that!?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I don’t see anything!
dialog: 102.
text: WHAM! A ROCK HITS, LODGES INTO THE FRONT WINDSHIELD,
scene_heading: SPIDERWEBBING THE GLASS --
speaker_heading: DAVEY /WOODY
speaker_heading: AHHHHHH!
text: SILENCE AGAIN. No signs of life. Just absolute stillness --
text: CRASH! A ROCK SHATTERS THE WINDOW BESIDE WOODY, shards of
text: glass cutting the side of his face! They bolt to the other
text: side of the car, looking all around!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We need to get outta here!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No way!
text: They listen intently, peering desperately into the woods
text: through the fogged-up glass. Nothing in view. No movement.
text: The painful anticipation is shattered as --
text: THUD! The guys spin around to find --
text: MACKEY! HIS MANIACAL FACE just inches away! IN HIS HAND, HE
text: HOLDS A HUGE SERRATED KNIFE AGAINST THE GLASS --
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: RUUUUN!
text: AHHHH! Woody opens the door opposite Mackey, bolts out, Davey
text: hot on his heels! They sprint for the surrounding woods as --
text: A POWERFUL FLASHLIGHT SLICES INTO THE WOODS AFTER THEM, its
text: beam fractured, cascading across the trees. The boys peel off
dialog: into the darkness...
speaker_heading: MACKEY (0.S.)
dialog: (via cruiser loudspeaker)
dialog: I know how much you guys like games.
dialog: So I’ve got a surprise for you.
text: As they run, the SOUND OF THE POLICE SIREN ECHOES OUT!
text: REMAINS ON! A SYMPHONY OF DEATH FOR MACKEY TO HUNT TO!
speaker_heading: MACKEY (0.S.)
dialog: (via cruiser loudspeaker)
dialog: We’re gonna play Manhunt, only now,
dialog: we’re gonna play for real!
text: Davey and Woody stop, both leaning against a tree, out of
dialog: breath, utterly petrified. Is this really happening!? Davey
text: notices a PISS STAIN down Woody’s leg.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Hey. He won’t catch us if we keep
dialog: moving. All right? Let’s go.
text: SPRINTING THROUGH THE WOODS, the boys finally come to a
dialog: clearing to find --
text: WATER! The dark, remote Ipswich Bay stares back at them! No
dialog: other land in sight!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: What the hell...?
text: Davey turns around to find MACKEY’S FLASHLIGHT BEAM IS GONE!
text: He looks in all directions... Nothing! The SHRILL SCREAM OF
text: THE POLICE SIREN just adds to the panic as --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Where’d he go!? Come on!
text: Davey instinctively ducks back into the treeline, sprinting
text: diagonally between the water and the police cruiser, its
text: lights still flashing chaotically.
text: The dense forest zips past as they dash through, adrenaline
text: pumping. They come to another clearing, revealing --
dialog: WATER! Again! Still no land in sight!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Where the fuck did he take us!?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: (realizing, desolate)
text: A barrier island. He knows no one
dialog: comes out here.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What? It can’t be an island! He drove
dialog: his car!
text: Woody crouches at the water line. Watches the movement of the
dialog: water in the moonlight...
speaker_heading: WOODY
text: Tide’s coming in.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What’s that got to do with anything?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I grew up clam digging with my Uncle
dialog: around these islands. At low tide,
text: there’s a road onto them.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT’D)
text: At high tide, the road’s covered by
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: So what does that mean?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: If we don't find the road off the
dialog: island soon, we're gonna be stranded
dialog: out here til the tide goes back out.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We have to go back to the cruiser.
dialog: Follow the tracks.
text: THE POLICE SIREN ABRUPTLY STOPS! KATYDIDS AND CRICKETS once
text: again own the night. Waves gently wrestle with the shore.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He’s at the cruiser right now! We
dialog: can’t go back there!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: How deep is it? Can we swim?
speaker_heading: WOODY
text: The undertow and rip tides are
dialog: insane. We’d be as good as dead.
dialog: These islands aren’t that big. If we
dialog: just keep going around, eventually --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We’ll find the road.
text: MOMENTS LATER, the guys are in a mad dash along the edge of
text: the island. The dense tree canopy blocks most of the light
dialog: from the moon, just enough getting through to light the way --
text: Woody trips over SOMETHING, rolls his ankle, FALLS HARD. As
text: Davey comes to help Woody up, they both lock eyes on --
text: THE BLISTERED, DECOMPOSING BODY OF A TEENAGE BOY!
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: AHHH --
text: DAVEY BLOCKS WOODY’S MOUTH as they both fall away from the
text: body, terrified! But they quickly realize THEY’RE IN A PUDDLE
text: OF SLUDGE FROM ANOTHER DECOMPOSING BODY!
text: They slip and slide to their feet, backing away quickly. They
text: look around, speechless at the sight of --
dialog: 105.
text: BODIES, in varying stages of decomposition and burial. It's
dialog: impossible to tell, but there could easily be twenty of them.
text: Maybe more. IT’S MACKEY’S KILLING FIELD!
text: Woody spots something. A FAMILIAR, EMPTY, STRIPED BAG. He
dialog: kneels down. Sees that it’s --
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: “Noah”...
text: Empty bags of the stuff litter the ground --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Get down!
text: MACKEY’S FLASHLIGHT PEEKS THROUGH THE TREE, not too far away.
text: Davey and Woody try to be as silent as possible, watching as
text: THE FLASHLIGHT MOVES CLOSER...
speaker_heading: MACKEY (0.S.)
dialog: I know you’re close.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We gotta get to the cruiser.
text: Woody nods agreement, but suddenly dissolves into tears.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I don’t wanna die out here, Davey. My
dialog: Mom needs me.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You’re not gonna die. I got you into
dialog: this mess, I’m gonna get you out of
dialog: it. We’re gonna split up --
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Why you always wanna split up?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: We have to. Because I’m gonna be your
dialog: diversion. I'll get Mackey’s
dialog: attention so you can get to the
dialog: cruiser. Find a way out.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I’m not gonna let you --
text: But before Woody can protest, DAVEY BOLTS --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Hey Wayne! Fuck you, you fuckin
dialog: loser! Eat shit!
dialog: 106.
text: MACKEY SPOTS HIM! GIVES CHASE!
text: DAVEY RUNS LIKE HELL, FLASHLIGHT BEAM waving chaotically as
text: Mackey sprints after Davey, frenzied!
text: Davey zig-zags through the brush! He’s never run faster in his
text: life, pure adrenaline coursing through his veins! Until --
text: DAVEY TRIPS OVER A FALLEN TREE! Quickly pulls himself into
text: the nook beneath it, GASPING FOR AIR!
dialog: Quiets himself... SILENCE. Where the fuck is he!? Is he
dialog: gone!? Did I lose him!? Shit...
text: Davey slowly, hesitantly peeks out from under the tree --
text: SLIT! DAVEY BUCKLES, BLOOD POURING OVER HIS SHOE, HIS
text: ACHILLES SLICED IN HALF!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
speaker_heading: AHHH!
text: AND THEN MACKEY’S THERE! IN DAVEY'’S FACE! He tears Davey out
text: from under the tree! THROWS HIM TO THE GROUND as he cleans
text: the blood off of his MASSIVE KNIFE!
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Stay the fuck there.
text: Mackey takes off, disappearing into the night. Seriously
text: injured and hobbled, tears form in Davey’s eyes. He musters
dialog: his strength, SCREAMS --
speaker_heading: DAVEY
text: WOODY! HE’S COMING! RUUUUUN!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: WOODY. Racing through the dense overgrowth. TERRIFIED.
text: He breaks free of some low hanging branches and stops. Sees
text: the SQUAD CAR about 50 yards ahead, LIGHTS still coloring the
dialog: night. Makes a dash for it --
text: WHAM! A BODY careens out of the shadows, SLAMS INTO WOODY!
text: They tumble over each other, whacking the ground hard.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No! Please! Let me go!
text: Landing face first, Woody WHEEZES in pain, the wind knocked
text: out of him. Before he can get up, a HAND GRABS HIS HAIR.
dialog: YANKS HIS HEAD UP --
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: WOODY
speaker_heading: DAVEEEEY!
text: AND A KNIFE SLITS HIS THROAT! !!!!!1}Piibbrrdbrrdrbage
text: Woody's WHEEZING abruptly turns to a SURPRISED GURGLE.
text: Still clutching Woody’s hair, Mackey gets down low over him.
text: Puts his head against Woody’s, face drawn in an expression of
text: ecstasy as he PANTS hard and relishes the struggle of WOODY’S
text: FLAILING DEATH THROES. THE BOY’S FINAL, AGONIZING BREATHS.
text: When it’s over, Mackey stands, soaked in his prey’s blood.
text: Eyes closed in rapture, chest heaving, he smiles wide. Alive.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
text: On his feet, barely, Davey hobbles toward the RED AND BLUE
text: LIGHTS. Leg gushing blood, it drags behind him, useless.
text: Teeth gritted, he GROWLS through the pain and tears. Urging
text: himself on. He finally sees the SQUAD CAR ahead --
text: THE BLINDING LIGHT OF A FLASHLIGHT CATCHES HIM. Coming
text: closer... CLOSER...
text: He crumples to his knees, SOBBING.
text: MACKEY GRABS DAVEY. Crouches and draws him close. Their faces
text: just inches apart. Covered in blood except his big, bright
text: eyes, Mackey looks truly terrifying. He whips the KNIFE to
text: Davey’s throat. Davey CRIES OUT in fear.
text: HATRED MAKES MACKEY'S VOICE QUIVER. He digs the knife into
text: Davey’s skin just a bit, DRAWS BLOOD -- Davey WHIMPERS.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: You brought this on yourself! All you
dialog: had to do was leave me alone! This is
dialog: YOUR GODDAMNED FAULT!
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry!
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: Sorry? You forced me out of my home!
dialog: Stole my life! And you think you can
dialog: get out of this by saying you’re
dialog: sorry!? All I want to do is kill you.
dialog: I want you dead RIGHT FUCKING NOW!
text: Davey winces! But the killing blow doesn’t come...
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: But that’s not enough. Not for you.
text: Through the fear, Davey meets Mackey’s gaze. Confused.
speaker_heading: MACKEY
dialog: You’ve spent so much time thinking
dialog: about me. I want you to keep thinking
dialog: about me and imagining what I’m going
dialog: to do when I come back for you. And I
dialog: will. After you’ve lived looking over
dialog: your shoulder, seeing me in every
dialog: dark corner, every nightmare. Live in
dialog: the fear that every day might be the
dialog: one I come back to claim what’s mine.
dialog: One day... you’ll be right.
text: Mackey shoves Davey to the ground. STOMPS ON DAVEY’S SLASHED
text: LEG. Davey SCREAMS in pain. Mackey smiles and turns back into
dialog: the darkness --
text: Davey CRIES OUT in pain, unable to move. After a few moments,
text: HE HEARS the squad car’s driver side door OPEN -- SLAM SHUT.
text: Davey struggles to sit up as the CAR’S ENGINE STARTS UP.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No --
text: Dirt and rocks kick up behind the car as it drives off into
text: the night. THE RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FADING into the void --
text: DAVEY’S FACE, alternating red and blue in the lights, is
dialog: swallowed whole by the night as we --
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
text: SLOWLY FADE UP on STROBING LIGHTS. Distant and numerous. WE
scene_heading: SOON REALIZE WE’RE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN FROM --
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - HIGH ABOVE - NIGHT
text: HALF A DOZEN POLICE CRUISERS, parked throughout the cul-de-
text: sac, their LIGHTS bathing the lawns and houses in blood red
text: and crime scene blue.
text: WE PAN OVER THE STREET, CROWDED WITH NEIGHBORS AND COPS, TO
text: THE EQUALLY CROWDED BACKYARDS, TO THE WOODS behind the
text: houses. FLASHLIGHTS scour the darkness in all directions --
scene_heading: THE VOICES OF TERRIFIED, DESPERATE PARENTS AND POLICE CALL
text: OUT INTO THE NIGHT --
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: NEIGHBORHOOD PARENTS
dialog: (distant, echoing)
scene_heading: DAVEY! -- WOODY! -- DAVEY! --
text: It’s another Manhunt. As the PAN MOVES over the woods, we --
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK
text: SLOWLY FADE UP as HEADLIGHTS cut the darkness, revealing a
text: single, hobbling SILHOUETTE. It raises its arms, desperate for
text: help. The headlights slow. Stop as the silhouette collapses.
text: The driver's door opens and a FISHERMAN (male, 60s) jogs over.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP TRUCK - EARLY MORNING
text: Davey, exhausted, barely holding onto consciousness, lies
text: against the passenger window. Wrapped in a blanket. Pale as
dialog: shit. He might not make it to the hospital.
text: The fisherman is doing his best to reassure Davey and keep
text: him awake. WE CAN’T HEAR WHAT HE’S SAYING, but his expression
text: is one of panic, SPEEDING as fast as he can.
text: Davey stares out the window, in another world. The sun just
text: starting to rise, the sky turning from black to indigo blue.
text: He perks up a bit suddenly as the truck passes --
text: MACKEY’S SQUAD CAR. ABANDONED on the side of the road. AND ON
text: FIRE, all its identifying marks scorching to oblivion.
text: Davey’s head turns, watching it as they go by. Terror in his
text: eyes. Mackey’s long gone. Somewhere out there. Waiting...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Randall and Sheila hold Davey tight, the family all sitting
text: on Davey’s hospital bed. CRYING together. Relieved. Broken.
scene_heading: EXT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Randall's CAR pulls into the driveway. NEWS REPORTERS and
text: CAMERAMEN crowding the front porch rush to the car as --
text: Davey hobbles out, LEG IN A CAST.
speaker_heading: SEA OF REPORTERS
dialog: Davey! /David!/Can you tell us what
dialog: happened?/How’d you survive?
text: Randall helps Davey along, shielding the boy as they reach
text: Sheila and head inside, leaving the news folk clamoring as --
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - DAY
text: BICYCLE TIRES spin quickly over the sidewalk. They slow to a
text: stop and a familiar SHOE drops to the pavement, the other
text: foot in a SUPPORTIVE BOOT.
text: Newspaper bag slung over his shoulder, Davey stands with his
text: bike at the foot of Mackey’s driveway.
text: CRIME SCENE TAPE blocks the way up to the house, more of it
text: strung across the front door. But no police. The house was
dialog: searched and cleaned out long ago.
text: He TOSSES A THICK SUNDAY NEWSPAPER on the asphalt at his
text: feet. The headline reads: “CAPE ANN KILLER WAYNE MACKEY STILL
text: ON THE LOOSE." Davey gazes at it a moment. Pedals on...
text: He makes his way around the street, tossing NEWSPAPERS onto
text: front porches IN REVERSE OF THE ORDER AT THE OPEN.
text: The yards are empty. Doors closed, probably locked. Curtains
text: drawn. No one watering their plants or playing games in the
text: lawn. It’s all gone quiet. A neighborhood haunted by ghosts.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: When something you never saw coming
dialog: breaks the routine... that’s when
dialog: things get really interesting.
text: The SOUNDS OF AN APPROACHING CAR make Davey stop. He looks to
text: see it’s Nikki’s parents’ car. PACKED TO THE BRIM WITH
text: NIKKI’S BELONGINGS. A UConn sticker on the fender.
text: IN THE BACKSEAT WINDOW, Nikki looks out at Davey as the car
text: passes. Davey gives her a solemn WAVE. She presses a hand to
text: the glass. The sad look on her face tells all. They hold each
text: other’s gaze until the car disappears from view...
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: But that’s what I love about this
dialog: place. It always keeps you on your
dialog: toes.
text: Davey pedals on... As he throws a paper to Farraday’s porch,
text: Davey spots Farraday looking out from his bedroom window.
text: Farraday holds Davey’s gaze for a moment, remorse on his
text: face. Then Francine comes to the window, closes the blinds.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
text: Behind the freshly painted walls next
dialog: door, anything could be happening and
dialog: you'd never know.
dialog: 111.
text: Passing Eats’ house, Davey looks into the side yard, sees
text: Eats, Kyle and their father with CROWBARS. DISMANTLING THE
text: TREEHOUSE. Davey stops to watch, gutpunched by the sight.
text: Sees Eats’ solemn face as Eats pulls another board free.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
text: Just past the manicured lawns and
dialog: friendly waves, go inside any house.
dialog: Less than fifty feet from where you
dialog: sleep, entirely different lives are
dialog: playing out.
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S HOUSE - DAVEY’S ROOM - DAY
text: Now devoid of all the childish toys and collectibles that
text: once filled it. Davey stares at his walls, still covered in
text: National Enquirer pages. Tears in his eyes, in a fit of rage,
text: he rakes his fingers down the wall and rips them all down.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: It’s easy to think of the suburbs as
text: a deadend. A weird Bermuda triangle
text: where the American dream strangles
dialog: all the excitement out of life. But
dialog: looks can be deceiving...
scene_heading: EXT. JUNIPER STREET - CUL-DE-SAC - NIGHT
text: FRONT PORCH LIGHTS GLEAM on every house. Giving a sense of
text: security. Everything seems quiet. Safe.
speaker_heading: DAVEY (V.0.)
dialog: Even serial killers live next door to
dialog: somebody...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
