text: FLASH of QUICK DISSOLVES: a little GIRL'S hands,

dialog: waves...
speaker_heading: TITLES UP
text: ...the hands DISSOLVE into a WOMAN'S hands, a simple gold

text: broken ends.
text: RADIO FADES UP as the hands DISSOLVE again. The ring is stil}
text: there, the professional quickness. Only now the hair they

text: stages of getting their hair done, one with her head bucx
text: a sink, another covered in foils; a diamond collared
text: chihuahua barks incessantly at the blow dryer being used on
text: her OWNER. The STYLIST just grins, icily, and tries to ignore

speaker_heading: VALERIE
