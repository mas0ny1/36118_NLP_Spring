speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I’m probably going to return them.

speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: What I meant was ... never mind.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What? Tell me.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: It’s just that some women don’t need
dialog: this kind of thing to be ... desirable.
text: Claire laughs, her face flushing with embarrassment.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: I’m no expert or anything, but I’ve
dialog: always thought true sex appeal is
text: intangible. Something that comes from
dialog: inside. Women like Vicky try to be sexy
dialog: by wearing things like this. But it’s
text: really all just smoke and mirrors.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Plenty of men seem to go for that.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Plenty of men are idiots. Any guy

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What do you teach?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Classical Studies, specializing in
dialog: Ancient Greek Literature.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Really? I didn’t think they still
dialog: taught stuff like that in high
dialog: school
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: VICKY

speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, I mean let’s face it. How

text: As he speaks, Travis’s eyes flit to a CURVACEOUS WOMAN in a

text: a glimpse, but Claire notices.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Kids nowadays need to be prepared
dialog: for the realities of the job

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Skills?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah, a trade like plumbing or

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Ah, money. That’s the goal then.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Nothing wrong with that.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Except when it’s motivated by
dialog: nothing more than greed.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Ooooh, we've got ourselves a live
dialog: one here. You're a little

dialog: aren’t you?
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: You know, maybe we should order a

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Seriously? A “firecracker”? Is
dialog: that how you regard women who have

dialog: Only if it disagrees with mine.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Come on, Vicky. You can’t possibly

speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: So you pick a fight with him?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He deserved it.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: What is your problem? Can’t you
dialog: just lighten up and have some fun?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Maybe I’m not ready for “fun.”
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Then sit at home alone and mope if that’s
dialog: what you want. But I guarantee you
dialog: that’s not what Gary’s up to.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: As a matter of fact, Gary told me
dialog: he hasn’t been with’ anyone.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Oh, please. He screwed around when
dialog: you were together. You think he’s
text: suddenly become celibate now that

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Thanks a lot, Vicky.
text: Claire opens her car door, but Vicky stops her.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: I’m sorry. But this limbo thing

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: God damn it.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
text: Claire gets out of the car and struggies to lift the door.

speaker_heading: NOAH (0.S.)

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: NOAH

dialog: I need to pull the car in.
speaker_heading: NOAH

scene_heading: INT. PETERSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire enters in her wet clothes, switches on the lights.
text: She starts to draw the curtains, but stops and looks out.
speaker_heading: NOAH’S WINDOW
text: Dark, lifeless. No way to tell if he’s there. She contemplates it.
text: Then, with the curtains still open, she UNZIPS HER DRESS and lets it
text: drop to the floor.
text: She stands there, unflinching, in nothing but LACY BLACK UNDERWEAR.
text: Slowly, her hands travel to the front of her bra. They tremble as
text: they unhook the clasp. She hesitates, then pulls it open.
text: Her BARE BREASTS
dialog: spring forth.
text: She breathes heavily, electrified. Then, gathering all her

scene_heading: HER NAKED BODY
text: stands erect but quivers with fear and arousal.
text: For what seems like an eternity, she stares out at Noah’s
text: window, completely vulnerable, baring her body and soul.
text: Finally; unable to endure it any longer, she raises both arms
text: and pulls the curtains shut.
text: Alone now, her body shakes uncontrollably. She sinks to her

text: an anguished moan.
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - DAY
text: BRIGHT SUNSHINE beats down on Claire, who is on her knees

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: NOAH

speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Hey, you've been out here all day.
dialog: Have you eaten?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, I --
speaker_heading: NOAH

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Thanks, but I should --
speaker_heading: NOAH

speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: We're still waiting for some of the
dialog: furniture. Hope you don’t mind
text: sitting on the floor.
text: He pours wine into two glasses and offers her one.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh, no. I shouldn’t. And neither
dialog: should you.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: I’ve been drinking wine since I was
dialog: a kid. My mother grew up in
dialog: France, so she was pretty liberal
dialog: about things like that.
text: He takes a sip and holds her glass out to her. She
text: reluctantly takes it, but doesn’t drink.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: She always said it’s nobody’s business
dialog: what people do in the privacy of their
dialog: own homes.
text: He clinks his glass against hers and takes another sip.
scene_heading: INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING
text: The light outside has faded. Claire and Noah eat on the

text: last of the wine into Claire’s empty glass.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I’ve been meaning to thank you.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: For watching out for Kevin. Jason
dialog: Zimmer has had it in for him since
dialog: grade school.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Zimmer’s a punk.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Gary keeps telling him to ignore
dialog: him. “Be the bigger man” he says.
dialog: But honestly? There’s a part of me
dialog: that wishes Kev would just haul off
dialog: and belt the kid.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Being the “bigger man” is a nice
dialog: concept. But sometimes it’s more
dialog: important just to be a man.
text: Noah gazes at Claire, really taking her in.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: I’ve never seen you with your hair
dialog: up like that. It looks nice.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh, it’s a mess.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You have a little stork bite on the
dialog: back of your neck.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You know, that little red mark some
dialog: babies are born with? It usually
dialog: goes away, but you still have yours.
text: He lifts her pony tail and speaks softly near her ear.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Right ... there.
text: He rubs his finger along the back of her neck. She shivers.
text: He puts his lips to the spot. She closes her eyes for an
text: instant, clearly aroused. Then she pulls away.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Noah. I can’t.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Do you want to?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I need to go.
text: She gets to her feet. He follows.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Last night. In the window ...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You were there ...
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Claire. You’re magnificent.
text: With that, Claire’s defenses crumble.
text: Noah takes her face in his hands and kisses her tenderly.
text: She responds, reluctant at first, then hungrily.
text: He pushes her against the wall, pressing his body against
text: hers. They grope each other, tear at each other’s clothes.
text: Noah pulls off Claire’s shorts, her panties. He finds her.
text: Bores into her. Pounds her rhythmically.
text: Claire moans and writhes. Poised between pleasure and guilt.
text: Until finally abandoning all thoughts of anything but now.
text: Her hands clutch his waist, his buttocks. She pulls him into
text: her ... and climaxes, wedged between his body and the wall,
dialog: nowhere else to go.
text: For a jong moment, Noah remains pressed against her, his eyes
text: fixed on hers. He kisses her softly, intertwines his fingers
text: with hers, and pulls her toward the stairs.
text: She resists, but with one more tug, she follows.
scene_heading: INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EVENING
text: The door flings open. Claire and Noah stumble in, ripping
text: off what’s left of their clothing, their hands, lips and
text: tongues all over each other.
text: Noah throws Claire onto the bed, kissing her neck, her
text: breasts, touching her in ways she hasn’t been touched in
dialog: years.
text: Suddenly, Claire pushes him off. Confusion flashes across
text: Noah’s face. But in the next instant, Claire thrusts him
text: down on his back and crawls on top, straddling him.
text: She makes love to him with urgency. Noah groans with pleasure.
scene_heading: INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: LEBRON JAMES comes in and out of focus.
text: Gradually we realize we’re looking at a life-size poster

text: Claire looks to the other side of the bed. Empty.
text: She gets to her feet and pulls on some clothes while scanning the
text: room: trophies, team pennants, sports memorabilia.
dialog: 31.
text: She stares at a collection of BOBBLE-HEADED CARTOON CHARACTERS.
text: She touches one and watches its head bob, her face grim.
text: Then she sees:
text: A PHOTO OF NOAH AND HIS MOTHER
text: They’re hugging and smiling. Noah looks about twelve. His
text: mother is not a day older than Claire. Claire gapes at it, the
text: horror of what she has done crashing in on her.
text: Noah enters, shirt off, toweling his wet hair.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Morning.
text: He sees her wan face.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: NOAH

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: This was a mistake.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You’re having second thoughts.
dialog: It’s normal.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: This isn’t normal. Nothing about
dialog: this is normal.
text: She searches for her shorts, her shoes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Damn it. Where are the rest of my
dialog: clothes?
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Downstairs. Remember?
scene_heading: INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Claire races down the stairs, Noah at her heels.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Would you stop for one minute?
text: She finds her shorts, puts them on.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I am old enough to be your mother.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: We have a bond, Claire. Age
dialog: doesn’t matter.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It most certainly does.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Did it last night?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I wasn’t thinking clearly last
dialog: night. I got swept up in the
dialog: moment. In you. You’re very ...
dialog: sweet. And I’ve been so ... it was
dialog: flattering.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: It was more than that.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I know this is hard for you to
dialog: understand right now. But someday
dialog: when you meet the girl of your dreams
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Oh my God ...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: --_a girl your own age, you’1l
dialog: realize this wasn’t meant to be. And
dialog: I don’t want you_to think any of this
dialog: is your fault. I’m the adult. I’m
dialog: the one who should have --
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Stop it! Just stop acting like we
dialog: did something wrong. No matter
dialog: what you say, it wasn’t wrong.
text: They stand silent for a long moment.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I hope we both can move past this.
dialog: I mean, we’re neighbors and ...
dialog: I would like us to stay friends.
text: He looks away, struggling with his emotion.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are you going to be okay? Noah?
dialog: Please look at me.
text: He slowly turns to her, mustering a pathetic smile.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Don’t worry about me. I’1l be
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, well ...
text: She gives him an awkward one-armed hug, which he halfheartedly

dialog: 33.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You expect me to believe that?
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Well, yeah.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, assuming that’s what it was,
dialog: did you think for one minute about
dialog: how it would look? A student
dialog: sending a teacher flowers?
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: That’s why I didn’t sign the card.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: you're a real piece of work,

speaker_heading: NOAH

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Give it a shot.
speaker_heading: ALLIE

dialog: avoid his fate. Yet it continually
dialog: catches up with him, doesn’t it?
text: Noah raises his hand again, but Claire ignores it.

speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Yeah, well I had a different take
dialog: on the whole thing.
dialog: 49.
text: Claire visibly stiffens at the interruption.
speaker_heading: NOAH

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Hey, it’s okay. He was just --

text: of madness in his of es. Kevin watches with a combination of
text: horror and awe. er students gather at a distance.
text: Jason lands a punch or two, but he’s no match for Noah's
text: torrent of fury. Soon enough, Jason falls to the floor, face
text: down, barely moving.
text: Noah pulls Jason's head up by the hair and hisses into his ear.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: He’s mine. Understand?
text: Jason blinks, utterly confused.
text: Noah lets Jason’s head drop to the floor, then gives him a
text: kick in the gut for good measure. He turns to Kevin.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Go ahead. Give it all you got.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: No. It’s enough.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Pussy. Just like your old man.

text: Kevin sits mute, wanting no part of this.
speaker_heading: / CLAIRE
dialog: Kevin?
text: Kevin looks to the floor, silent.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: Then I have no choice but to

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Jason was being a jerk to me again.
text: Noah tried to stop him.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: He told Zimmer to knock it off.
dialog: That’s when Zimmer popped him.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jason has been suspended for a
dialog: week.
text: Kevin shrugs, spits.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I realize what a tough spot Mr.

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: What’s gonna happen to Noah?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: A_week’s detention. And he’s not

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: He wasn’t going anyway.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: This suspension will go on Jason's

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TRAIL/CLEARING - DAY

text: Breathing deeply, she stretches against the fallen sycamore
dialog: when she spots:
text: THE CARVING OF HER AND GARY’S INITIALS.
text: It’s been gouged out with a knife. Completely obliterated.
text: Claire stares at it, agitated, her mind racing.
text: Suddenly, a BRANCH CRACKS somewhere behind her, the sound

scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE’S SUV (MOVING) - DAY
text: Claire drives, searching for the Audi. She comes to a bus
text: intersection and spots it sitting at a light a couple of blocks

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Damn it.
text: After a moment, the Audi gets a green light and continues on.
text: Claire waits impatiently for hers to turn.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Come on ....
text: When her light turns green, she guns it, cutting in front of

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I keep asking myself what she’s

speaker_heading: VICKY

scene_heading: INT. WALK-IN REFRIGERATOR - NIGHT
text: Claire pulls open the HEAVY STEEL DOOR and_flicks on the

text: Suddenly, the door SLAMS SHUT.
text: She Jumps, startled. She looks around. She’s all alone, but
text: somehow it doesn’t feel like it.
text: She grabs the punch and rushes to the door. But the handle

speaker_heading: NOAH

dialog: Who got him a date for the dance?
dialog: Who handled Jason Zimmer? Would

speaker_heading: ALLIE

speaker_heading: ALLIE

speaker_heading: KEVIN
text: On the cello.
speaker_heading: ALLIE

text: Claire’s students stir with confusion, then erupt in giggles

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I love you, Gary.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I love you, too.

scene_heading: INT. WILKERSON PREP - CLAIRE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. WILKERSON PREP - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Headmaster Warren turns the knob just as Claire swings the

scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: What’s going on here? The bell

scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: You_know classroom doors are not to

text: He steps into the room and looks around.
text: Claire barely breathes as Warren’s eyes travel past the

text: Sophocles quote that Noah scribbled on the board.
text: He turns back to Claire.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: I'd like to see you in my office
text: after class.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What for?
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: We’ll discuss it then.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I’ll be there.
scene_heading: INT. WILKERSON PREP - HEADMASTER’S OFFICE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

text: She rifles through the files until finding Noah's.
text: She pulls out a TRANSCRIPT from BAY VIEW HIGH SCHOOL in Milwaukee.

scene_heading: INT. INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What’s this about, Ed?
text: He sits down behind his desk, his face grim.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: I want to know what’s going on
dialog: between you and Noah Sandborn.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What do you mean?
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: Mike Schmidt reported an incident
dialog: yesterday on the field.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh that ... It was nothing. I was
dialog: reprimanding him. For skipping
dialog: class.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: Mike said you got physical with
dialog: him. You grab! im.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I may have pulled his arm a little,

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes, of course, but --

scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: Frankly, I’m more than a little
dialog: concerned, what with the interest

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Interest? I did nothing more than
dialog: I would for any student who wanted

scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: And then there’s this.
text: her a photo of a wall covered in graffiti. Phrases
dialog: “I fucked Mrs. Peterson” and “Claire Peterson is

scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
text: It was on the wall of the boys’
dialog: javatory across from your room.
dialog: I’ve had it painted over but I
dialog: intend to speak to the boys in your
dialog: class about it. Including Noah.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Come on, Ed. You start questioning
dialog: the boys and you’re just going to
dialog: fuel the flames of a ridiculous
dialog: rumor.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: This is a serious matter.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I’m sure I’m not the first teacher
dialog: whose name has appeared on the bathroom
dialog: wall. That’s what boys do.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: I’m not questioning your integrity,
dialog: Claire. But we can’t tolerate even
dialog: an appearance of impropriety

dialog: It’s for your own protection.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That’s bullshit and you know it.
scene_heading: HEADMASTER WARREN
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Claire --
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Let’s not pretend that this is

speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Oh Jesus, Claire.
text: Vicky sits back, the wind knocked out of her.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I can’t go to the police. They
dialog: could arrest me for sleeping with a
dialog: minor.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: That is such bullshit. He’s not some
dialog: innocent little kid you took advantage
dialog: of. He’s practically a grown man. And
dialog: he knew exactly what he was doing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I’m not so sure everybody would see

text: They fall silent until a gang of rowdy kids passes.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: You have to tell Gary.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: You don’t really have a choice here.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He’s been trying so hard. And this

speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: He’s got to understand. You were

dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You can’t blame him. I did this.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Okay, but you said yourself that

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And what if Noah goes to the school
dialog: with this video? “Or to the police?
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Do you really think he’s going to

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t know. There’s something
dialog: not right about him.
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Yeah, no kidding ...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, I mean, all this time he’s been

dialog: and that’s when sees it:
text: A TINY HOLE in LEBRON JAMES’S EYE.

scene_heading: INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY
text: Through the shadows, Claire follows the noise to a WOODEN

text: She opens it and finds hundreds of candid photos of herself.
text: The early photos capture Claire performing mundane tasks:

text: UNDRESSING FOR NOAH AT HER BEDROOM WINDOW.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Bastard.
text: She scrolls down and lets out a tiny gasp when she sees a MOVIE

dialog: been looking for.
text: Claire drags the movie file and the photos to the trash and
text: hits the “SECURE EMPTY TRASH” button.

text: - Marissa exits a red brick building, teenagers all about.
text: - She walks to a waiting car.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Damn it.
text: She rummages, finds a few stray sheets and shoves them in.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Of course.
text: She starts to close the door, but Robie puts a hand to it.
text: He looks her over, head tilted with curiosity.
speaker_heading: JIM ROBIE
dialog: You don’t look like a cleaning

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I used to be a teacher. Before the

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What about her boyfriend?
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: Alex treated her like shit -- made

dialog: Noah saw how vulnerable she was,

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

dialog: He knew every button to push. And

dialog: What are you saying? He was set
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: RHONDA
dialog: Marissa would tell me things about

dialog: I love you, Gary.

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
text: Kevin stops in the clearing. With the RAVINE up ahead and
text: Noah right behind, he’s got nowhere to run.
text: He spies the FALLEN SYCAMORE and tucks himself under its
text: massive trunk, accidentally brushing against the TIRE SWING
text: and setting it in motion.
text: Noah enters the clearing.
speaker_heading: NOAH ;
dialog: Come on, Kev. I’m not going to
dialog: hurt you. I just want to talk.

speaker_heading: KEVIN
text: sees Noah’s legs so close he could reach out and touch them.
text: He barely breathes.
speaker_heading: NOAH
text: circles the clearing, searching, as DISTANT SIRENS grow
text: louder. His impatience builds.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: So you‘re just going to let me get

dialog: Begging me for it ...
speaker_heading: KEVIN

speaker_heading: NOAH (0.S.)

speaker_heading: NOAH

speaker_heading: NOAH

dialog: Kevin!
speaker_heading: NOAH

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I’m coming!

speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: (calling to Claire)
dialog: He’s got a knife!
speaker_heading: NOAH
text: Finally. A set of balls.
text: Noah lunges for Kevin with his knife. Kevin dodges him.
text: Noah comes at him again, but this time Kevin grabs his wrist.
text: They lock ina struggle over the knife. The blade inches
text: ever closer to Kevin’s throat.
text: Finally, in an act of utter desperation, Kevin knees Noah in
text: the groin. While Noah is doubled over in pain, Kevin tackles
text: him. The knife goes flying.
text: The two boys wrestle. Kevin lands a couple of lucky punches,
text: but Noah quickly gains the upper hand and pummels Kevin until
text: he PASSES OUT.
text: Straddling Kevin, Noah raises a large rock overhead and is
text: about to crush Kevin’s skull with it, when...
speaker_heading: WHACK!
text: Claire’s shovel bashes Noah upside the head. He keels over
text: and lies motionless in the dirt.
text: Claire rushes to Kevin. She listens for breathing, wipes the
text: blood from his face.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Kevin? Can you hear me? Come on,
dialog: honey. Wake up ...
text: Noah starts to come to. Claire shakes Kevin.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Kevin!
text: Noah groans and sits up. Claire scrambles to her feet, wielding
text: the shovel like a batter anticipating a four-steam fastball.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Stay away, Noah. I’m warning you.
text: Noah gets to his feet, but keeps his distance.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: He doesn’t appreciate you, Claire.
dialog: Not like I do.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Like the way you appreciated your
dialog: mother?
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You know nothing about my mother or
dialog: how it was between us! She loved me!
dialog: The way you love me.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No ...
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You do. I know you do. I saw it
dialog: in your eyes that night. It
dialog: doesn’t just go away.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Stay where you are!
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: I saw it!
text: Suddenly, Noah charges her. Claire swipes at him but he’s
text: too quick. He comes in low and tackles her to the ground.
text: Claire thrashes and flails like a wild animal. Noah
text: straddles her writhing body, enduring her blows until pinning
text: her arms above her head.
text: Defeated and exhausted, Claire grows still.
text: Noah breaths heavily, exhilarated. He leans in to kiss her,
text: but she turns her head away. And that’s when she sees it.
speaker_heading: THE KNIFE
text: in the dirt, out of reach but a lifeline just the same.
text: Noah nuzzles Claire’s neck and begins to move on top of her,
text: pressing his pelvis into her, humping her.
text: Gradually, Claire begins to move with him. She moans with
text: pleasure. Purrs into his ear.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How do you do this to me?
text: With growing excitement, Noah's kisses travel up to her face,
text: to her lips. She kisses him deeply.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You see how good we are together?
dialog: I am all you need. Not them.
text: She nods, her eyes sincere. He smiles and leans in for
text: another kiss when Claire LUNGES up and BITES HIS NOSE.
text: Noah howls and thrashes wildly, his blood spurting. But Claire
text: hangs on like a pit bull.
text: Noah digs his fingers into her eyes and bashes her face with his
text: fist until finally she releases him. He jumps to his feet,
text: blood gushing from his nose.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You bitch!
text: She dives for the knife but before she can reach it, Noah
text: grabs her hair and yanks her to her feet.
text: He pushes her up against a WEATHERED WOODEN FENCE -- a flimsy
text: barrier between them and the RAVINE.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: I loved you!
text: Noah clamps his hands around Claire’s throat and slowly
text: squeezes the life out of her.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Please. Noah ...
text: Suddenly, off screen there’s an almost INHUMAN ROAR.
text: Noah turns to see Kevin charging toward them.
speaker_heading: KEVIN
text: MOTHER FUCKER! !!!!
text: Kevin rams Noah against the fence with A CRACK and lands a
text: few blows to Noah’s already mangled face.
text: Noah rallies, grabbing Kevin by the shirt and swinging him
text: around against the fence with ANOTHER CRACK.
text: Noah pummels him in the gut. Kevin stays on his feet but
speaker_heading: THE FENCE
text: splinters with each blow until finally, with the last punch, it
text: gives way. The boys go tumbling over the side of the cliff.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No!
text: Claire dashes to the cliff'’s edge and peers down into the black
text: abyss. She can make out only the vague contours of a NARROW
text: OUTCROPPING OF ROCK about fifteen feet below.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Kevin?
speaker_heading: KEVIN (0.S.)
dialog: (parely audible)
dialog: Mom ...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hang on!
text: Claire finds Noah’s knife and cuts the rope of the tire swing
text: with it. She ties one end to a tree and sends the other end
text: over the cliff.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Can you reach the rope?
text: After a moment, there’s a tug.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Good. Now climb up.
text: She sits on the ground and coils the rope around her hands.
text: Kevin’s weight is almost too much for her, but she holds on
text: fast, taking up the slack whenever she can.
text: After a few moments, she sees his hand reach up over the
text: edge. Claire grabs his wrist and pulls him up.
text: As the top of his head emerges from the darkness, he lets out
text: a small GRUNT OF EXERTION.
text: Claire stops cold, unnerved.
speaker_heading: / CLAIRE
dialog: Kevin?
text: He turns his blood-covered face up to her. And it’s not
text: Kevin’s eyes she’s looking into.
speaker_heading: IT’S NOAH.
text: Claire recoils and releases his wrist.
text: As Noah slides over the edge, he grabs Claire’s foot, dragging
text: her with him. She snags the rope just before going over.
text: OVER THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF
text: Claire dangles from the rope with Noah clinging to her. She
text: squirms and kicks, but he’s attached to her like a leech.
text: After a moment, he begins a slow and steady climb up the
text: length of Claire’s bo ly. His fingers rip her clothes, dig
text: into her flesh. Her grip grows weaker by the second.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I can't hold on.
text: He presses his lips to her ear, hissing.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Go ahead. Let go.
dialog: 104.
text: But she doesn’t. And he hoists himself up to solid ground.
text: Noah crouches down and extends his hand to her. Claire
text: stares up at him defiantly.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: I’d never do anything to hurt you,
dialog: Claire.
text: Claire’s HANDS SLIP.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You can trust me.
text: His face is as innocent as a choirboy’s.
text: Claire hesitates, then reaches out and grasps his hand. She
text: gives a hint of a smile before her grip tightens.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But you can’t trust me.
speaker_heading: NOAH’S EYES
text: widen with surprise as Claire yanks him over the cliff.
text: He lets out a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM as his body bounces off
text: the outcropping of rocks and plummets to the bottom of the
text: ravine.
text: Claire hangs there, gasping for breath. Then she slowl
text: climbs up. Fighting back tears, she peers into the ravine.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Kevin!
text: But there’s no response. Claire falls to her knees and wails
text: with despair. Then, suddenly there’s weak cry.
speaker_heading: KEVIN (0.S.)
dialog: Mom ....
text: Claire sees the rope MOVING. She peers into the ravine and
text: sees Kevin climbing up.
text: When he nears the top, Claire reaches out for him.
text: THEIR HANDS clasp together, united. Claire pulls Kevin to
dialog: safety.
text: Now on solid ground, Kevin falls into his mother’s arms.
text: They hold each other as SIRENS WAIL in the distance.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - DAY
text: A “SOLD” sign is staked on the snow-covered lawn. Claire and
text: Kevin load boxes into a U-Haul trailer.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You got everything?
speaker_heading: KEVIN
dialog: Except for my laptop.
text: He runs off to the house.
text: A POSTAL TRUCK pulls up and a MAILMAN hops out.
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: Need a signature.
text: Claire signs for it. He hands her an envelope and drives off.
text: Claire stares at the return address: ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF
scene_heading: EDUCATION.
text: She opens it and unfolds an official looking letter. She
dialog: reads: “We hereby inform you that your teaching license has
dialog: been permanently revoked.”
text: Claire smiles sadly and folds up the letter. She glances up
text: at the garage.
scene_heading: INT. PETERSON GARAGE - DAY
text: Dark and dusty. The automatic garage door opens.
text: Claire enters and looks around for anything she might have
text: left. She spots a small box containing dormant flower bulbs.
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: Honey?
text: Claire looks up and sees Gary, a jagged scar visible on his shorn
text: scalp, his movements stilted is if still nursing his wounds.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: You about ready to go?
text: Claire goes to Gary. They wrap their arms around each other
text: and walk to the car where Kevin waits.
text: We remain in the garage as the automatic door descends,
dialog: leaving us in total darkness.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
