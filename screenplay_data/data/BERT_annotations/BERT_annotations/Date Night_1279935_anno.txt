speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes
text: sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in.
text: In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his
text: mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of
text: WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he
text: finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA
text: FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the
dialog: one who told me not to mess up the
dialog: precious picture piles!
text: he gives him a long, slow kiss.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT ' D )
text: Minty fresh.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: That was nice.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It was nice.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Hey from now on when you change the
dialog: toilet paper, could you just make sure it
dialog: is out?
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLES)
dialog: Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's
dialog: over!
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Oh, believe me, we're just getting
dialog: started, Phil.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (reaches into picture pile)
dialog: Look at this one of your Mom with me. I
dialog: mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!
text: ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands
text: stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle
text: deep in a manure bin.
speaker_heading: CLARA
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: She just takes a while to warm up. You
dialog: guys are gonna be best buddies. You
dialog: picked a favorite of us yet?
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: That's exactly the one I picked!
text: Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.
text: It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look
text: joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Man, I wish I was them.
text: Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades
text: as she stares at the picture. He notices.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: WHAT IS
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I just... when I was growing up my Mom
dialog: and Dad had a picture just like this.
dialog: Now they can't even acknowledge each
dialog: other.
text: Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's always remember to have some time
dialog: that's just for the two of us. No matter
dialog: what else comes up in our lives - if it's
dialog: work or friends or when we have kids-
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We're having kids? With an "S"?
speaker_heading: (CLARA LAUGHS)
dialog: OK fine. But I promise you it's never
dialog: gonna happen to us.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that
dialog: when I'm long in the tooth.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You'll be even hotter long toothed.
dialog: Right now to be honest Clara they're a
dialog: little stumpy.
speaker_heading: CZ
speaker_heading: (GIGGLES
dialog: Oh really?
text: As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and
text: turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of
text: pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Phil. Tell me it wasn't the pictures.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: wasn't the pictures.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You know how long that took?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We'll fix the picture piles, Clara.
dialog: We've got all the time in the world.
dialog: From now on everything's gonna be just
dialog: about us.
text: Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.
speaker_heading: OLLIE (V.0.)
speaker_heading: MOM!
text: The Talking Head's "Once in a Lifetime" kicks
scene_heading: INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING
text: Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an
text: ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.
speaker_heading: E
speaker_heading: OLLIE (O.S.)
dialog: Mo-om!
text: It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan
text: in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER
text: while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a
text: T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each
text: side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite
text: directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the
text: hall and Phil to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom! Mom! Mom!
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I'm coming, Ollie!
scene_heading: INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
text: As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's
text: bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil
text: showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the
text: doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack
text: of PAPERS in his hand.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Uh Phil?
dialog: 0
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Phil doubles back, still looking at the papers.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yep?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I need to switch. I've got an open
dialog: house.
text: Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but
dialog: contains it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Yeah. Really.
text: As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: OK, so I say today we go for the slacker
text: look - cool yet approachable.
speaker_heading: OLLIE
dialog: Yeah, well Mom says that.
text: Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh. Well... that's cool too!
scene_heading: INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME
text: The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly
text: through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin
text: SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.
text: She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then
text: stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing
text: a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.
text: As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Ech. Mine.
text: She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts
text: brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of
text: razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.
text: Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to
text: discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and
text: shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5
text: Seeing the roll, she sighs as she takes it out of the
text: holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.
text: As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad
scene_heading: NT. KITCHEN
text: Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as
text: Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits
text: at the table. Phil finally notices.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: OLLIE
dialog: Breakfast?
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (HOPPING UP)
dialog: Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob
dialog: today. What's it gonna be?
text: Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign
dialog: of his tom.
speaker_heading: OLLIE
dialog: How about... some Captain Crunch?
text: Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (DISTRACTED)
speaker_heading: OL
dialog: Captain Crunch?The cereal?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Uh... yeah. Sure.
text: Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out
text: cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed
text: in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a
dialog: bowl yesterday.
speaker_heading: IE
dialog: But Dad already said yeah sure.
text: Clara glances at Phil.
dialog: said it. I said it
speaker_heading: ARCASTIC)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, sure! You know it's only one bowl
speaker_heading: A DAY-
speaker_heading: CLARA
speaker_heading: (CORRECTING HIM)
dialog: A week.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: One bowl a day a week.
text: Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already
text: in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is not for you today!
speaker_heading: CLARA
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLES)
dialog: Yeah right.
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Worth a try.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Did you get his lunch together?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh. Whoops.
speaker_heading: CLARA
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: You just get his breakfast and I'll do
dialog: it.
text: As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie
text: and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking
text: back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the
text: phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He
text: stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly
text: returning the carton to the fridge.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hey Jane? I'm getting a late start but
dialog: I'll be there as soon as I can.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sorry I dropped the ball. It's this
dialog: Quarterly Report to Mr. Rivers today.
dialog: You know how he freaks me out with all of
dialog: his mixed animal metaphors that I don't
speaker_heading: UNDERSTAND-
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (focusing on Ollie's lunch)
dialog: Ollie, do you want a banana?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Did you hear me?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (not looking at him)
dialog: Uh huh. He freaks you out with his mixed
dialog: animal metaphors that you don't
dialog: understand. Banana Ollie?
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So I should probably get going. With the
dialog: highway construction it takes forever to
dialog: get downtown these days.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: OK. Have a good day.
text: Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
text: off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly
text: kisses Phil on the cheek.
speaker_heading: CLL. -- (CONT ' D )
dialog: Sorry. Your mouthy was still ail milky.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sorry for the milky mouth.
text: He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1
text: dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,
text: then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk
text: in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her
text: head, she tosses the carton in the trash.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
text: next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks
text: a newspaper off his lawn.
speaker_heading: CHAZ (O.S.)
dialog: Well, well! We're up bright and early,
dialog: aren't we!
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yes we are!
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: ike you say to me every morning.
text: Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and
text: Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'
text: car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
text: inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING
text: STUCK halfway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: OW! OW! OW!
text: Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and
text: peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.
text: Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger
text: side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the
text: front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear
text: and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's
dialog: seat.
text: HONKING.
scene_heading: EXT. EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER
text: The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD
text: CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of
text: it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his
text: window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in
text: slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR
scene_heading: DIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OUR
text: HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his
dialog: watch.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
speaker_heading: E
text: Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her
text: 30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW
text: SIGNS on the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: His name's Juan and he's some kind of
dialog: Spanish, I think. He knows all these
text: exclusive, underground places downtown.
dialog: It's so exciting. And in bed...
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: I never knew I could still get my leg
dialog: back that far.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Too much information, Jane.
scene_heading: INT. OPEN HOUSE
text: Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each
text: move quickly around different parts of the vacant home,
text: cleaning and inspecting.
dialog: The divorce was the best thing that ever
dialog: happened to me. Seriously. You know
dialog: that great nervous feeling in your
dialog: stomach? Where you don't know what's
dialog: going to happen next?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9
text: On her way down the hall, Clara spots a mark up ahead on
text: the wall. She reaches into her large purse and pulls out
text: a mini-409 mister and a rag. With the aim of a
text: SHARPSHOOTER, she sprays ahead, wiping the mark as she
text: passes.
speaker_heading: JANE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: With Larry, I lost that. Everything had
dialog: just become routine, you know? Boring.
text: Jane's words hit Clara close to home. Passing on through
text: the kitchen, Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a
text: weird, loud buzzing noise.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: But now, all of a sudden I'm alive again!
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Good for you, Jane.
text: Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge, kicki
text: the side and silencing it.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Good for you.
scene_heading: T. FRONT HALLWAY - A LITTLE L
text: Clara and Jane sit on the floor, together
dialog: prospectuses.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: There's this g---eat restaurant downtown we
dialog: went to the ot__ar night that you guys
dialog: would love. _"st amazing view of the
dialog: city. You guys should check it out on
dialog: your next date night.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (focusing on stapling)
dialog: Yeah, well, maybe. We don't really have
dialog: those that much anymore.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: 't have date nights:
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (shrugs),
dialog: You know, we're pretty tired all the time
dialog: between work and Ollie. And some of the
dialog: shows on TV these days are really great.
dialog: Ah. I see.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 1Ï¿½1
text: They staple in silence for a second. Jane and Clara look
text: at each other.
speaker_heading: CLAM
dialog: I know that's really lame.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So it's Phil?
speaker_heading: CLARA
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: No, it's not Phil. It's the both of us.
dialog: I don't know. It just... happened.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So why don't you change it? All you have
dialog: to do is stir things up and have one
dialog: great, sexy, exciting night again.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I guess. Maybe.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not maybe. Tonight.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Nah. Tonight's no good.
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Why not? Seriously think about it.
dialog: What's really gonna be more important
dialog: tonight than that?
text: Clara takes this in. Jane's right.
scene_heading: INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE
text: Checking his watch, Phil shakes his head as he rushes
text: through the large bullpen of the Chicago Mercantile
text: Exchange. In the pits all around him, BUYERS and SELLERS
text: scream out their orders.
scene_heading: INT. MR. RIVERS' OFFICE
text: In a dark wood office with STUFFED AR 'ï¿½ L HEADS lining
text: the walls, a young, smartly dressed man in his 20's,
text: GEORGE, quietly goes through a binder with MR. RIVERS,
text: 60, at the older man's desk. As Phil bursts in they both
dialog: look over.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'm sorry I'm late. The construction on
dialog: the highways is insane these days!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS
dialog: Don't worry about it, Phil. It's fine.
dialog: Catch your breath.
text: George gives Mr. Rivers an ornate, pal-sy handshake, then
text: heads out with the binder, nodding at Phil. Phil nods
text: back warily, then takes out his binder, ready to launch
dialog: into his report.
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh, Phil. Listen, before we start...
dialog: I've been thinking... this next quarter
dialog: we need to venture into open tundra.
dialog: Start really ripping the meat.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (beat, trying to decipher)
dialog: Uh. OK. You mean... take the fund in a
dialog: more high risk direction?
dialog: MR.
dialog: Yeah. That's wha: I - -aid.
dialog: Sure. OK, fine. I can work up some
dialog: higher risk options and come back
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS
speaker_heading: (CLEARS THROAT)
dialog: OK. The thing is Phil, tomorrow I want
dialog: George to give me his thoughts on where
dialog: we need to be hunting too.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS
dialog: s nothing personal.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So let me get this straight. You're
dialog: telling me that tomorrow I'm going to
dialog: have to interview for the job I already
dialog: have? Against George?
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS
dialog: I wouldn't put it like that. I Just need
dialog: our pack leader to be more like... like a
dialog: momma kangaroo. Ya get me?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Kinda.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Actually, no. Not really at all.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS
text: The blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth
dialog: and knows its momma's teat is just always
text: there, ready to suckle. But at the same
dialog: time, momma kangaroo's still a wild,
dialog: dangerous creature.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sorry. Still not totally getting you.
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS
dialog: I've had a wife and a family. Three of
dialog: them. It's hard to stay the fastest
dialog: cheetah when you need to mind the pack,
dialog: Phil. George lives in the city, doesn't
dialog: have a family to worry about. He can rip
dialog: the meat.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Listen, Mr. Rivers. I don't need to...
dialog: I was ripping big bloody hunks of meat
dialog: and eating them like tartare when George
dialog: was still... in the jungle!
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I can't be demoted, Mr. Rivers. I just
dialog: can't.
speaker_heading: MR. RIVERS
dialog: Listen, nothing's set. It's just I gotta
dialog: say that lately your leadership on this
dialog: has felt a little... well... tame.
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (GETTING UP)
dialog: That's all you needed to say, Mr. Rivers!
dialog: I'll see you tomorrow.
text: Determined, Phil marches out of Mr. River's office.
speaker_heading: SCHOOL
text: Clara talks on her cellphone as she picks up Ollie from
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: So it's OK if we drop him off at 7? Our
text: reservation's at 7:45.
text: She passes another MOTHER desperately searching for a
text: Kleenex for her BOY with snot dripping from his nose.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
text: Without breaking stride, Clara reaches into her purse and
text: hands the grateful mother a tissue, then takes out a mini-
text: bottle of Purell and cleans her hands.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Thanks Mom. I really appreciate it.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Mrs. Foster?
text: Clara turns to see Ollie's teacher, the tight buttoned
text: MRS. CARDIGAN, 45, walking toward her in the parking lot.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Oh, that's Ollie's teacher. I'll see you
dialog: later.
text: Clara hangs up her phone and greets Mrs. Cardigan with a
text: warm smile.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been meaning to tell you that you
dialog: can just call me Clara, Mrs. Cardigan.
speaker_heading: MRS. CARDIGAN
dialog: I'd prefer Mrs. Foster. Boundaries
dialog: matter.
dialog: CLARA 1Ï¿½1
dialog: OK...
speaker_heading: MRS. CARDIGAN
dialog: Can we speak a moment? Alone?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Sure, sure. Ollie, go to the car.
text: As Ollie does, Clara turns back to Mrs. Cardigan.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Is everything OK?
speaker_heading: MRS. CARDIGAN
dialog: Well, I'm afraid not. Oliver's been
text: antagonizing the girls in the class a
dialog: great deal lately. Especially Jenny
dialog: Diggs.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Really? Oh no. Why do you think that's
dialog: happening?
speaker_heading: MRS. CARDIGAN
dialog: I'm going to leave that to you and your
dialog: nd to figure out. But beyond that,
dialog: ,i: overall attitude these days is
dialog: just... sub par. E
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MRS. CARDIGAN (CONT'D)
text: His penmanship is sloppy. He lacks
dialog: motivation and tries to just "get by" o
dialog: assignments. You know, this is a very
dialog: competitive school, Mrs. Foster. In my
dialog: opinion, maybe you should consider
dialog: whether this is really the right
dialog: environment for him.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (beat, stunned)
dialog: Uh... wow. OK.
text: Mrs. Cardigan starts away. Clara climbs into the car,
text: watching Mrs. Cardigan.
speaker_heading: CLARA (CONT'D)
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Wow. What a bitch.
speaker_heading: OLLIE
dialog: Did you just call Mrs. Cardigan a bitch?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (remembering Ollie's in the
speaker_heading: BACK)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: OL LIE
dialog: Yeah you did.
dialog: Â¢
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I didn't. I really didn't.
text: Clara quickly pulls out.
scene_heading: CAR PORT - LATER
text: Phil SQUEEZES out of his drivers seat with folders full
text: of RESEARCH. As he walks toward the house he spots the
text: TONS of room on the other side of Clara's car and shakes
text: his head.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Unbelievable!
scene_heading: INT. OLLIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Still carrying his research, Phil peeks in on Ollie, who
text: packs a suitcase.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hey buddy. Finally moving out? I gotta

speaker_heading: OLLIE
dialog: 0
dialog: I'm going to Nana's tonight.
dialog:

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: On a school night? Why?
speaker_heading: OLLIE
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Mom says you guys are going out.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Tonight? What? No.
speaker_heading: (CALLS OUT)
dialog: Clara?
scene_heading: INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Phil marches into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Clara? Cl-
text: He stops in the doorway as he spots her. Made up in an
text: evening dress in front of a full length mirror, Clara
text: looks STUNNING as she finishes putting an earring on.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. Wow.
text: Clara tns and smiles.
speaker_heading: IS
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I thought I could take you out to
dialog: celebrate you finally getting that report
text: in. A romantic dinner downtown like the
dialog: old days, and teen...
dialog: (raises :,er eyebrows)
dialog: Ollie's going to stay at Mom's so we have
dialog: the house all to ourselves. All night.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Wow... It sounds... great.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Great!
text: She turns back and continues getting ready.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It's just... is there any chance we coul
dialog: take a rain check?
speaker_heading: CLARA
speaker_heading: (TURNS)
dialog: A "rain check"?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah. Unfortunately I really need to do
dialog: a bit of work tonight. E
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I thought all the cramming was for this
dialog: report today. Did something go wrong?
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Uh, no. Nothing like that. I just
dialog: decided I could play with it a little
dialog: more. Make it a little better.
text: Clara takes him in a moment.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Oh. OK.
text: Controlling herself, Clara starts putting her jewelry
text: back in the case.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Listen, I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You don't need to apologize, Phil.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Listen, if I had more warning-
speaker_heading: E C
dialog: Then something else would have come up.
dialog: You know it. That's the thing, Phil. We
dialog: used to do things on the spur of the
dialog: moment all the time. Even after Ollie
dialog: was born. Now we never do anything
dialog: together.
text: They stare at each other, then Phil breaks
speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: HOLBROOKE

speaker_heading: CLARA

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I'm talking about right now. When we

speaker_heading: CLARA

speaker_heading: PHIL

dialog: whole pie with you. And now with Ollie
dialog: and your work, I'm barely even a piece of
dialog: the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a

dialog: mouth!
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home

speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you can say shit.

speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: You know, rumor is he's behind the whole

dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: Hush hush shell companies he owns. One

speaker_heading: BALDING MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: My guess is he's trying to screw up Mayor
