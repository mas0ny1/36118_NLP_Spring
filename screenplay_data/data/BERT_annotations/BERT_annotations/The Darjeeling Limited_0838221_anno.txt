scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: A city in India. A crowd of street-children scatters out of
text: the way as a small, sixties-style, black and yellow taxi
text: speeds up a narrow road.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI. DAY
text: The driver grips the steering wheel tightly. He wears a black
text: turban, large, plastic sunglasses, and a determined look. A
text: fifty-year-old businessman in a grey suit rides in the back.
text: He checks his watch and stares out the window, anxious. A
text: meter which looks like a slot-machine is mounted on the left
text: side of the hood outside the windshield.
text: The taxi shoots along the edge of a market. It cuts in-
text: between three bicycles and a buzzing scooter with a family of
text: four on it. The mother in a red sari rides side-saddle. The
text: taxi flies past two rickshaws stacked with table linens and
text: dodges a cow walking in the street.
scene_heading: EXT. DEPOT. DAY
text: The taxi skids around a corner and -- with one of the rear
text: doors already swinging open -- slides to a stop at the
text: entrance to a train station. Vendors on the sidewalk sell
text: fruits, vegetables, spices, pottery, textiles, etc. A man at
text: a stand makes fresh-squeezed sugar-cane juice.
text: The fifty-year-old man jumps out of the car carrying two
text: Samsonite suitcases. The driver shouts something after him in
text: Hindi. The fifty-year-old man looks back at him uncertainly
text: without stopping. He sprints into the building.
scene_heading: INT. DEPOT. DAY
text: The fifty-year-old man runs weaving through a bustling crowd
text: of people buying tickets and waiting on benches, past porters
text: in red turbans carrying piles of baggage on their heads, out
text: onto the platform.
scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM. DAY
text: Bells are ringing. Wheels are clacking. Smoke is blowing. The
text: train is already pulling out, and the fifty-year-old man runs
text: alongside the tracks behind it.
text: A teenager with a faint moustache and a half-unbuttoned shirt
text: watches calmly from a deck at the rear of the caboose. He
text: holds a cricket bat at his side. A sign above his head reads
text: The Darjeeling Limited with a picture of a running elephant
text: below it.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: The fifty-year-old man’s shoes slap along the cement. He
text: starts gaining on the train. The train picks up speed. The
text: fifty-year-old man grits his teeth. He clenches his fists. He
text: begins to lose ground. He yells over the sound of the
text: engine’s whistle -- but the train pulls further ahead.
text: A second runner appears behind the fifty-year-old man. He is
text: thirty-five. He is dressed in a navy blue, wool suit with a
text: light blue shirt. He wears slightly tinted aviator sunglasses
text: which sit crookedly on his nose. He carries an old, beaten-up
text: suitcase with a jungle pattern print of small cheetahs,
text: elephants, zebras, palm trees, and pelicans all over it and
text: the initials J.L.W. stencilled onto it. He sprints past the
text: fifty-year-old man, heads full-steam to the back of the
text: train, throws his suitcase onto the deck ahead of him, and
text: leaps on-board, looping his elbow around a pole. He is Peter
dialog: Whitman.
text: Peter looks at the teenager. The teenager squints at him.
text: They both turn to look back at the fifty-year-old man, who is
text: slowing down with an expression of sad frustration on his
text: face. Peter watches him sympathetically.
text: Peter picks up his suitcase and goes into the train.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. DAY
text: Peter walks quickly through two cars and enters a third. He
text: pulls a ticket out of his coat pocket and checks the numbers
text: next to each compartment door as he goes down the corridor.
text: He stops at one and double-checks his ticket.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: A number plate on the wall. It reads 40/41. Thin cardboard
text: strips inserted in slots have F. Whitman, P. Whitman, and J.
text: Whitman typed on them.
scene_heading: INT. COMPARTMENT 40/41. DAY
text: Peter slides open the door, goes inside, and shuts the door
text: behind him. He sets down his suitcase and sits on a bench
text: seat across from a sleeping twenty-five-year-old man with the
text: side of his face pressed against the window and his mouth
text: open. He has a Beatles-type moustache and wears a grey, wool
text: suit with a black shirt. He is Jack Whitman.
text: Four old, beaten-up suitcases of various sizes, plus a
text: matching trunk and two duffel bags, all with the same jungle
text: pattern print and the initials J.L.W. stencilled onto them,
text: sit piled on racks and shelves around the small compartment.
text: On a fold-out table, there is a pitcher of water, an empty
text: glass, and a small manila note book with a pen tucked into
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: its spine. A transistor radio plays Indian music at a low
text: volume on the windowsill. A small, metal fan whirs on the
dialog: ceiling.
text: Peter takes a foil strip-pack of green-striped pills labelled
text: Hypno-Aid with instructions on it in Hindi out of a yellow
text: plastic sack. He pours himself a glass of water and swallows
text: a pill. He is still breathing hard. He lifts up his glasses
text: to look out from under them and says quietly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Wake up, Jack.
text: Jack opens his eyes and closes his mouth. He sits up and
text: looks at Peter. He blinks a few times and clears his throat.
text: He laughs. Peter laughs. They both take out cigarettes and
text: light them. Jack says significantly, raising his eyebrows:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Have you seen Francis?
text: Peter hesitates, curious. The compartment door slides open. A
text: forty-year-old man in a light brown, wool suit with a yellow
text: shirt stands in the hallway holding a tray of whiskey
text: highballs (Irish whiskey over ice with club soda and a lemon
text: twist). He has gauze pads over his temples with medical tape
text: holding them in place and white bandages wrapped all around
text: his head. Both of his eyes are blackened and swollen, and he
text: has two sets of stitches plus numerous bruises, scratches,
text: scabs, and three small bandages on his face. He leans
text: slightly on a bamboo cane. He is Francis Whitman. He says
dialog: softly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Hello, Peter.
text: Peter looks startled at the condition of Francis’ face.
text: Francis smiles and laughs. He comes into the compartment,
text: shuts the door behind him, and sits down. He hands one of the
text: whiskey highballs to Jack and one to Peter. They all laugh.
text: Francis lights a cigarette. They drink their drinks quickly.
text: There is a knock on the door. Francis slides it open.
text: A thirty-year-old man with a beard stands in the corridor
text: with a hole-puncher in his hand. He wears a green silk turban
text: and a Nehru jacket with Chief Steward embroidered onto it.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: Good afternoon. Whitman?
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack nod.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: May I see your tickets, please?
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack take their tickets out of their
text: pockets and hand them to the chief steward. The chief steward
text: clicks the tickets with his hole puncher and snaps them into
text: a clip above the door. He points at a small No Smoking sign
text: over the sink.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: No smoking, please.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack hesitate. Francis awkwardly cracks
text: open the window. They all quickly take a last few puffs and
text: blow smoke out before they flick their cigarettes away into
text: the countryside. The chief steward looks annoyed.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: Welcome aboard.
text: The chief steward goes out the door. A twenty-five year-old
text: girl in a pale green, silk sari-uniform comes in with a tray
text: of pale green drinks in little cups. She has long eyelashes
text: and a red dot on her forehead. She wears tortoise-shell
text: glasses. She smiles and says:
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Sweet lime?
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack stare at the stewardess.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes, please.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I'll have one.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That sounds good.
text: The stewardess sets three cups of juice onto the table. She
text: dips her fingertip into a little, metal bowl of red powder
text: and carefully presses a dot onto each of their foreheads.
text: Francis' dot goes on his bandages.
text: The stewardess goes back into the corridor, looks at Jack for
text: an instant, and shuts the door. Francis, Peter, and Jack
text: drink their cups of juice. They look pleased. Francis says
dialog: suddenly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Let’s go get a drink and smoke a
dialog: cigarette.

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. DAY
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack walk quickly through the train,
text: balancing against the walls and windows as the cars jolt back
text: and forth. Francis limps and swings his cane. They light
dialog: cigarettes.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I want to start by thanking you both for
dialog: being here. Thank you.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You’re welcome.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You’re the two most important people in
dialog: the world to me. I’ve never said that
dialog: before, but it’s true, and I want you
dialog: both to know it.
text: Francis opens a sliding door and stops in-between two cars.
text: The sound of the wind and clacking wheels is extremely loud.
text: He yells over the noise:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I love you, Peter!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (moved but uneasy)
dialog: Thank you!
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I love you, Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (moved but curious)
dialog: I love you, too!
text: Francis opens the door to the next car and leads Peter and
text: Jack up the corridor.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: How'd it get to this? Why haven't we
dialog: spoken in a year? Let's make an
dialog: agreement.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: OK.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: A.) I want us to become brothers again
dialog: like we used to be, and for us to find
dialog: ourselves and bond with each other. Can
dialog: we agree to that?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: B.) I want us to make this trip a
dialog: spiritual journey, and for us to seek the
dialog: unknown and learn about it. Can we agree
dialog: to that?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: sure.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: c.) I want us to be completely open and
dialog: say yes to everything -- even if it's
dialog: shocking and painful. Can we agree to
dialog: that?
text: Peter and Jack hesitate. Francis continues:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I had Brendan make us an itinerary.
text: Francis takes a small manila envelope out of his pocket and
text: unties a string to open it. He hands Peter and Jack each a
text: small, laminated piece of paper.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: A type-written card with Travel Itinerary printed across the
dialog: top and a detailed list of trains, times, hotels, cities,
dialog: phone numbers, etc. below.
text: Peter and Jack look puzzled.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who’s Brendan?
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: My new assistant. He’s going to give us
dialog: an updated schedule under our doors every
dialog: morning of all the temples and spiritual
dialog: places we need to see and expedite the
dialog: hotels and transportation and everything.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: How’s he going to do that?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I had him bring a printer and a
text: laminating machine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (more puzzled)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (slightly defensive)
text: In a way, it, actually, doesn’t matter.
text: He's in a different compartment on
dialog: another part of the train, but we never
dialog: see him -- ever.
text: Peter and Jack look around the corridor, confused. Jack
text: starts to ask something, but Francis interrupts:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: So that’s more or less it. Does it sound
dialog: OK to you?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It sounds good. Sure.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. It sounds good.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Do you have any questions?
text: Peter lifts up his glasses and looks out from under them. He
dialog: says brightly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: OK. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What happened to your face?

scene_heading: INT. DINING CAR. DAY
text: Clouds, stars, and a moon are painted on the ceiling. The
text: room is filled with people seated for dinner. Waiters in pale
dialog: green,
text: silk uniforms rush around taking orders. Francis,
text: Peter, and Jack drink whiskey highballs. They share a table
text: with a grey-haired man dressed in a white tunic reading a
text: Hindi newspaper. There is a bowl of nuts in front of them.
text: Peter listens with his glasses lifted up.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I only remember certain details, but from
dialog: what I've been able to reconstruct, it
dialog: was raining, and I was going about fifty
dialog: miles an hour when I went into a corner,
dialog: did some wrong steering, and suddenly --
dialog: (snaps his fingers)
text: -- skidded off the road, slammed into a
text: ditch, and catapulted fifty feet through
text: the air. Little bits of glass and
dialog: particles were stinging me as I flew. For
text: a second, there was just silence. Then
text: the bike crashed to the ground, exploded,
dialog: and caught on fire, and I smashed into
text: the side of the hill with my face. I was
dialog: going home. I live alone right now.
text: Anyway, two joggers ran over and dug out
dialog: all the dirt that was jammed inside my
dialog: mouth and my nose and my ears (my heart
dialog: had stopped, and my brain had stopped, so
dialog: I was technically dead, at this point),
dialog: and they did all the procedures exactly
dialog: right, as a result of which I’m still
dialog: alive.
text: Peter and Jack look deeply impressed.
text: Francis stands up. His voice cracks slightly as he says:
text: Francis hugs Peter tightly. He hugs Jack tightly. He sits
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Boy.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: The first thing I thought of after I woke
dialog: up was: I wish Peter and Jack were here.
text: back down. He takes a deep breath. He says quietly to Peter:
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Have you heard anything from Mom?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Have you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Me, neither.
text: A girl's voice snaps sharply in Hindi at the other end of the
text: dining car. Jack turns to look. The stewardess stands among
text: the waiters and the chief steward with two empty champagne
text: bottles and a bucket of half-melted ice under her arm. She
text: argues with the chief steward at a whisper in Hindi.
text: Peter squints, mutters, and rubs his temples. He takes the
text: strip-pack out of his yellow plastic sack again. He pops out
text: another pill and swallows it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Some kind of Indian muscle-relaxer. I got
text: it at the pharmacy next to the train
dialog: station. You don't need a prescription
dialog: here.
text: Jack nods. He takes out a bottle of purple syrup labelled
text: Narco-Cough with instructions in Hindi on it out of his own
text: yellow plastic sack. He pours a capful, drinks it, then takes
text: a swig directly from the bottle.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A type of Indian flu medicine. It's got a
text: tranquilizer in it.
text: Francis nods. He takes a glass vial of amber liquid labelled
text: Opio-Sedate with instructions in Hindi on it out of his own
text: yellow plastic sack. He unscrews the top and drops three
text: drops under his tongue with a glass pipette.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: The strongest Indian pain killer you can
dialog: get. It's for my face.
text: Peter takes Francis' vial and studies it. He unscrews the top
text: again. Francis says warily:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Be careful with that. Just take one drop.
text: Peter and Jack drop drops of amber liquid under their tongues
text: with the pipette. Francis and Jack each swallow one of
text: Peter's pills. Peter and Francis drink sips of Jack's cough
text: medicine. The gray-haired man observes curiously over the top
text: of his newspaper. Two German women at the next table stare,
text: frowning.
text: Francis reaches into his mouth and digs between two teeth. He
text: takes out something small and white and sets it on the edge
text: of a plate. It is a false tooth. Peter and Jack look repulsed
text: and confused. Francis reaches toward the bowl of nuts but
text: hesitates.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I also lost a tooth.
text: Jack picks up the false tooth off the edge of the plate. He
text: examines it. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thin,
text: folded-up sheaf of pages. He says to Francis and Peter:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You want to read a short story I wrote in
dialog: France?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: How long is it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Never mind. Forget it.
text: Peter takes the sheaf of pages. He unfolds it and starts
text: reading. Jack hesitates.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You can save it until after dinner, if
dialog: you want.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 11.
text: Peter shakes his head and continues reading. Francis puts his
text: tooth back into his mouth. Peter sees this. He leans forward
dialog: and says suddenly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Maybe right before whenever you're about
dialog: to take out your tooth, you should say
dialog: something like, “Please, forgive this.”
dialog: Because it's, actually, kind of --
text: Francis recoils slightly, putting his hand to his face.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Can you back away a little? You just spit
dialog: in my eye.
text: Peter looks offended. The German women start arguing loudly.
text: Peter looks at them and frowns. He squints, mutters, and rubs
text: his temples. He resumes reading the short story. Francis says
dialog: to Jack:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: When was the last time you were in
dialog: America, by the way?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know. The funeral.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: In other words, a year.
text: Jack shrugs. Francis shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I have to tell you, I support this
dialog: relationship not working out.
text: Jack nods. Peter laughs suddenly without looking up from the
text: short story. Jack looks pleased.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What part are you on?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Nothing. It just reminded me of something
dialog: not related to it.
text: Jack looks slightly disappointed. The waiter comes over to
text: the table with a tray of whiskey highballs. He serves them
dialog: and says:
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: May I take your order, please?
text: Francis flips open his menu and says immediately:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Let's see. Do we want meat or fish? I'm
dialog: going to have the chicken. Jack, you want
dialog: to try the fish? I bet that's delicious.
dialog: And Peter? The lamb? A chicken, a fish,
dialog: and a lamb? How does that sound?
dialog: Silence. Francis continues:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Who wants a soup? Raise your hand.
text: Francis raises his hand. Peter and Jack reluctantly raise
text: their hands, too. Francis looks at Peter curiously.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Your glasses are crooked.
text: Peter adjusts his sunglasses slightly. They are still
text: crooked. Francis frowns. He points at Peter's face.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Are those Dad's?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Francis reaches across the table and takes Peter's sunglasses
text: off. He puts them on himself. He squints.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You've still got his prescription in
dialog: here. How can you see in these?
text: Francis returns the sunglasses to Peter and says to the
dialog: waiter:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
text: Three soups.
text: The grey-haired man looks up from his newspaper and orders in
text: Hindi. The waiter goes away. Peter says calmly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can you not order for me, please?
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Order for yourself.
text: Peter resumes reading the short story. Francis asks him:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: How's Alice?
text: Peter stops reading but does not look up. He says softly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: She's fine. She started a company making
dialog: these little clay pots. They're,
dialog: actually, kind of popular. We sent you
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Oh, yeah. Thanks!
text: Jack sees the stewardess come out of the kitchen carrying a
text: broom and a dustpan. She starts sweeping up some broken
text: crackers off the floor. She sees Jack looking at her. She
text: hesitates. Her lips part. Jack's eyes sharpen, and he sits up
dialog: straight. He says to himself:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I want that stewardess.
text: Francis turns around and stares at the stewardess. The two
text: German women start arguing again. Peter gestures toward them
dialog: and says under his breath:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: These Germans are bothering me.
text: Peter immediately turns to the women and says aggressively:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Ladies!
text: The women turn quickly to Peter, startled.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Please, keep it down. Lower your voices,
dialog: thank you.
text: The women look offended but intimidated. Silence. Francis
dialog: says abstractly, hopefully:

dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Did I raise us? Kind of.
text: Peter and Jack stare at Francis, surprised. They shrug and
text: nod slightly, vaguely positive. Francis nods. The chief
text: steward walks by carrying a tray of empty glasses.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Hang on. I'm just going to ask this guy
dialog: if he can get me a power adaptor.
text: Francis stands up and walks quickly after the chief steward.
text: Peter squints, mutters, and rubs his temples.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: She's pregnant. Alice.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Really? You're kidding.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (uncertainly)
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Seven-and-a-half months.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: It’s going to be born in six weeks or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I think so. I'm trying not to get too
text: caught up in it right now.
text: Jack looks puzzled. Peter sees Francis on his way back the
text: table. He says quickly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't tell Francis.
text: Jack hesitates. Francis says as he sits down:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Brendan got the wrong voltage.
text: The waiter arrives with four bowls of soup on a tray. Francis
dialog: says significantly:
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 10
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Please, forgive this.
text: Francis reaches into his mouth, takes out his false tooth,
text: and sets it on the edge of his plate.
speaker_heading: CUT TO: 10
text: Thirty minutes later. The table is filled with plates and
text: serving dishes covered with the remains of their finished
text: meal. The grey-haired man is now gone. Peter turns to the
text: last page and finishes the short story. He says to himself:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: am.
text: Peter folds up the sheaf of pages and puts it into his
text: pocket. Francis and Jack stare at him. Peter says finally:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is it supposed to be sad?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, I'm not crazy about the part where
text: I start screaming at the mechanic. That
dialog: never happened.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (hesitates)
text: The characters are all fictional.
text: The waiter comes over and sweeps a large number of crumbs and
text: bits of food off the tablecloth with a little tool and says:
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Would you care for any dessert?
text: Francis flips open his menu again and says immediately:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Let's see. Do we want sweets or fruit?
dialog: I'm going to have the pudding. Jack, you
dialog: want to try the cake? And Peter? What
dialog: looks good to you? The cookies?
text: Peter does not respond. Francis points to Peter and says to
dialog: the waiter:

dialog: 12
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: He's going to order for himself.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The cookies.
text: The waiter goes away. Peter stands up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Peter walks to the lavatory at the end of the car and goes
text: inside. Francis whispers to Jack:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Has he been rooting around and taking
dialog: things?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (uneasy)
text: Maybe. I think he's still in mourning.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Well, I probably am, too, but there's
dialog: something kind of unethical about it,
dialog: isn't there? Legally, those glasses
dialog: belong to all three of us.
scene_heading: INT. LAVATORY. NIGHT 11
text: Peter stands at the sink with the short story in his hands.
text: He re-reads a passage, trembling slightly. He has tears all
text: over his face. He folds up the sheaf of pages and puts it
text: back into his pocket. He pops another pill out of his strip-
text: pack and swallows it. He takes a deep breath.
scene_heading: INT. COMPARTMENT 40/41. NIGHT 12
text: The bunks have been prepared with white sheets and blankets
text: with The Darjeeling Limited embroidered onto them. The door
text: is open to the adjoining compartment. Francis, Peter, and
text: Jack are dressed in white pajamas. Jack has on a yellow
text: bathrobe with Hotel Chevalier stitched into the lapel. The
text: transistor radio plays the evening news in Hindi on the

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I'm going to take this bed, since I'm the

dialog: recall, so why don't you set up shop
dialog: topside -- and Jack, you're kind of a
dialog: lone wolf. You can bunk out next door.
dialog: How does that sound?
text: There is a shuffling sound outside the room. Three laminated
text: itinerary cards slide awkwardly under the compartment door.
text: Jack slides it open.
text: A twenty-five-year-old man with a completely bald head is
text: crouched in the corridor. He wears blue top-siders, a beige
text: cap, beige golf pants, and a matching beige polo shirt with
text: Francis Whitman Industries and a corporate logo stitched into

text: looks up, startled.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Hi. Sorry. I was just --
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Brendan, this is Jack, and this is Peter.
text: Brendan stands up and shakes hands with Jack and Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello, Brendan.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Brendan picks up the three itineraries from the floor and

dialog: for Brendan to step outside.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Let's update me.
text: Francis goes with Brendan into the corridor. Francis shuts

speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: Well, I don't know about his face, but I

text: Francis and Brendan in the corridor. Francis is suddenly very

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: How's everything going back there?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Pretty good.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: I never heard back.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: So try again. What are you waiting for?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Well, I left a message.
text: Brendan smiles innocently and shrugs. Francis frowns.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Why are you smiling?
text: Brendan stops smiling.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Call her again right now and keep calling

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How long are you going to stay here?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: What do you mean? He said until the end
dialog: of the month.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Why do you ask that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm just trying to know so I can figure

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What plans?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know yet. Anyway, I have my own

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Well, I'm not going to stay here with

speaker_heading: FRANCIS

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: He has this disease where his head is
dialog: shaved -- except he doesn't have to shave

speaker_heading: CUT TO: 15
text: Jack's head leaning out the window. He looks ahead, down the

text: The tracks wind around a corner revealing a wide lake, then
text: straighten again -- revealing the stewardess leaning out a
text: window of the next coach. She looks ahead, down the tracks,
text: with a cigarette in her mouth. Her hair swirls and snaps in
text: the wind. She grabs it, pulls it tight, and holds it in her
text: fist. She turns around and sees Jack.
text: The stewardess looks startled. Jack raises his eyebrows. She
text: takes the cigarette out of her mouth. He takes the cigarette
text: out of his mouth. She raises her glasses up above her eyes
text: and looks out from under then.
text: The tracks turn another corner, and the stewardess and her
text: car disappear from view.
speaker_heading: CUT TO: 16
text: Jack leaning back into the compartment. Peter switches off

text: Jack presses a buzzer on the wall. He stands up and paces
text: briefly between the adjoining compartments. Francis and Peter
text: watch him curiously. There is a knock on the door. Jack opens
text: it. The stewardess stands in the corridor.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Good evening, Mr. Whitman. How can I help
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is it possible for us to get some more of
dialog: the savory snacks, please?
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: of course. Can I offer you anything else?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: The stewardess closes the door. Jack says suddenly:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I forgot something.
text: Jack slides open the door.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT 17
text: Jack comes out of the compartment and shuts the door behind
text: him. He looks to the end of the car. He sees a light on ina
text: little galley with a shadow moving. He hears cabinets open
text: and close and dishes clink. He turns away and walks to the
text: other end of the coach. He slides open the door and stops in
text: the space between the two cars. He turns around and looks
text: through a window. He watches as the stewardess comes out of
text: the galley with a tray of cocktail nuts and a pitcher. She
text: walks to the compartment. Just as she is about to knock, she
text: sees Jack.
text: Jack waves for the stewardess to come to him. She frowns

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You want to smoke a cigarette with me in
dialog: the bathroom?
scene_heading: INT. LAVATORY. NIGHT
text: The stewardess is on the sink kissing Jack with her sari
text: pulled down and one breast out. Jack spreads her legs apart.
text: He licks his fingers and touches her. She inhales sharply and
text: says with genuine surprise, smiling crookedly:
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: You're crazy.
text: Jack holds the stewardess by the hips and presses into her.
text: They breathe slowly and quietly.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jack. What's yours?
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Rita.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're beautiful.
text: The stewardess arches her back and puts her hands on Jack's
text: face. She whispers:
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Don't come into me.
text: Jack looks at the stewardess uncertainly. Pause.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: OK.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't tell him I told you.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: Brendan's got all the tickets. There's a
dialog: whole itinerary. Where's he going?
text: Peter shrugs. Francis stands up and crosses quickly into the
text: adjoining compartment. Peter listens while Francis roots
text: around, clicking latches and unzipping zippers. Francis says
dialog: loudly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS (0.S.)
dialog: Air-Italiano?
text: Francis comes back into the room holding an airplane ticket.
text: He says in disbelief:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: What the fuck is this?
text: Francis turns around and goes into the adjoining compartment
text: again. Peter peers in behind him. Francis comes back into the
text: room with a passport in his hand.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I'm keeping his passport. In fact, give
dialog: me yours, too. I'm going to hold onto all
text: the passports, so nothing happens.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm going to keep mine.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: No, I want to keep them all together.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT 20

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Why are you standing there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: I'm waiting for you.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Mr. Whitman, the whole point of us coming

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (correcting her)
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right. I get it. OK. Good-night, then.
text: Jack starts to kiss Rita furtively, but she shields him away.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Go back to your compartment.
text: Jack turns and walks briskly down the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. COMPARTMENT 40/41. NIGHT 21
text: Francis lies in the bottom bunk, and Peter is in the top
text: bunk. The door slides open, and Jack comes in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Move over, please.
text: Francis props himself up onto one elbow against the wall.
text: Jack lies next to him. Peter leans down from the top bunk,
text: upside down. He and Francis stare at Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Where's the savory snacks?
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Sweet Lime.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Of course, not. I went for a walk.
text: Francis and Peter study Jack's face skeptically. Jack looks
text: uneasy but slightly electric.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Something just happened.
text: Jack gets up and goes into the adjoining compartment. He
text: opens one of his suitcases. He digs among his socks and takes
text: out a small package wrapped in brown paper and string. One
text: end of it has already been opened. He pulls something out of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: INSERT:
text: A tiny, pink, cut-glass bottle of perfume with a small
text: squeeze bulb made of red silk. The label reads Voltaire No.
dialog: 6, La Petite Mort.
scene_heading: INT. COMPARTMENT 40/41. NIGHT 22
text: Three A.M. The train has stopped at a quiet station. Outside
text: the window, people and dogs sleep on the platform, and a
text: vendor wheels a cart alongside the tracks. Inside compartment
text: 40/41, the lights are out, and a cricket is chirping. Francis
text: wakes up. He sees Peter leaning down over the side of his
text: bunk, staring out the window in the darkness. He turns over
text: and looks out the window, too. Jack stands at a public
text: telephone stand on the other side of the platform listening
text: with the receiver to his ear and a blank expression on his
text: face. He wears his bathrobe and pajamas. A telephone booth
text: attendant sits next to him. A meter clicks numbers. Francis
text: frowns.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Who's he talking to?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No one. He got the code to his ex-
dialog: girlfriend's answering machine, and he's
text: checking her messages.

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: What? When did he confide that to you?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Just now.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Why am I not a part of this?
text: Peter shrugs. Jack hangs up the telephone and pays the
text: attendant. He walks across the platform to the train. Francis
dialog: whispers:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I never liked that girl.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Me, neither. Anyway, I never trusted her.
text: Francis nods. The compartment door slides open. Jack comes
text: inside and shuts it behind him. He looks sad, confused, and
text: highly emotional. He says quietly in the darkness:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't feel good about myself.
text: Jack kneels suddenly to the floor and digs between two
text: suitcases. He stands up again with his hands cupped, pulls
text: open the window, and thrusts a cricket fluttering into the
text: air. It flies away under the lights of the platform, off into
text: the distance. The train begins to move. Francis sits up.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Let's make another agreement: on the
dialog: spiritual journey, it's crucial that we
dialog: don't splinter into factions or not
dialog: include somebody who has advice and might
dialog: know better. Can we agree to that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: What'd you find out?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Good.

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She put this in my suitcase.
text: Jack takes the bottle of perfume out of the pocket of his
text: bathrobe and sprays it in the air. Silence. Francis says
dialog: quietly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Is that her?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's her.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: How'd she gain access to your personal
dialog: belongings?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She came to see me in France for twenty-
dialog: four hours.
text: Francis sighs and shakes his head. Peter says bluntly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Could she be gaslighting you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: What's gaslighting?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Wait a second. Let's make another
dialog: agreement: from now on, if you want to
dialog: talk to her -- or check her messages -—-
dialog: you talk to us, first. Anytime, day or
dialog: night. Can we agree to that?
text: Jack nods. Francis points at the bottle of perfume.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I think we should destroy that.
text: Jack looks at the bottle of perfume. He sets it on its side
text: on the fold-out table, picks up the transistor radio, and
text: slams it down, obliterating the bottle and smashing part of
text: the radio. Bits of glass, plastic, and liquid scatter
text: everywhere. Francis and Peter look taken aback. Jack tests
text: the radio. Indian music plays.

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Here we go: the train stops first thing
dialog: tomorrow morning for an hour and forty-
dialog: five minutes, which is just enough time
dialog: for a quick visit to the Temple of 1000
dialog: Bulls --
text: Francis looks at his brothers with building excitement. He
dialog: says quietly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: -- probably one of the most spiritual
dialog: locations in the entire world.
scene_heading: EXT. TEMPLE. DAY 23
text: A stone shrine with gold and marble charging bulls carved
text: into its walls, doors, and columns. Hundreds of people are
text: packed into the square in front of it, and a throng of men
text: moves toward the building carrying huge, brightly painted,
text: wood and papier-maché idols. Music comes from every
dialog: direction.
text: Francis walks over to a cart that sells flashlights,
text: headphones, and batteries. He asks a vendor:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Do you have any power adaptors?
speaker_heading: VENDOR #1
dialog: (enthusiastically)
dialog: Yes! No adaptor! You use battery!
text: Peter shuffles through a box of shoes, gloves, and hats. He
text: picks up a pair of tan and white rabbit-fur slippers. He asks
dialog: a vendor:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can I get these in, say, a ten-and-a-
dialog: half, medium?

text: Jack crouches in front of a blanket covered with

text: Spray. He asks a vendor:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What ingredients does this have in it? I
dialog: don’t want to kill anybody or anything.
speaker_heading: VENDOR #3
dialog: (energetically)
dialog: Not for killing! For spray in face.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack got to a stall selling caged
text: parrots, white pigeons, and canaries. They stare mesmerized
text: into a small aquarium with four black snakes and one tiny,
text: thin, bright red one in it. A vendor says mysteriously:
speaker_heading: VENDOR #4
dialog: Most rare. From desert. Very poisonous.
text: Peter nods thoughtfully. His eyes are glued to the snake.
speaker_heading: CUT TO: 24
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack carrying three pairs of rabbit
text: slippers and strings of yellow, pink, white, and orange
text: flowers as they come inside the temple. Peter holds a
text: cardboard box the size of a small briefcase with a plastic
text: latch on the top. A black skull-and-crossbones is hand-drawn
text: on it. They all have their shoes and socks off.
text: Crowds of people walk back and forth from shrine to shrine,
text: praying. A man in a robe rubs dots of red powder from metal
text: bowls onto people's foreheads. Other men pour spoons of water
text: into people’s hands. The people press it into their hair.
text: Other men chant and sing. Other men burn incense. One man
text: throws rose petals and repeats a phrase in Hindi over and
dialog: over.
text: Francis turns to Peter and Jack with his back to the activity
dialog: and says wildly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: This is incredible!
text: Peter and Jack nod. They look bewildered and amazed. Francis
text: takes Peter and Jack to get holy water and press it into
text: their hair. He gives them each a handful of bills.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Take some of these rupees and put them in

text: Francis motions to a statue of a seated god with blue skin
text: and four arms. He sits on the floor with Peter and Jack. They
text: put some money into a slot and place their flowers on a step
text: with piles of other flowers, candles, and bananas. They watch
text: a group of women and children sitting around them, who touch
text: the base of the statue and then their foreheads and chests
text: while praying silently with their lips moving and their palms
text: pressed together. Francis, Peter, and Jack imitate them for a
dialog: minute.
text: Francis frowns. He points to a belt wrapped around Peter's
text: waist. It has small cowboys, horses, and Apaches in war-paint
text: all over it and the initials F.Cc.W. stencilled onto the
dialog: buckle.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: That's my belt.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Can I borrow it?
text: Pause. Francis says tensely:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS

text: Peter sighs. He takes off the belt and hands it to Francis.
text: Francis puts it on. He says gently:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Ask first next time.
text: Peter nods. A deafening bell gongs in the temple,
text: reverberating like a thunderclap. The sound slowly dies down.
text: Jack pats his breast pocket suddenly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where's my passport?
text: Jack starts checking every pocket on his body repeatedly in
text: rapid succession. He pulls out matches, bits of paper, and a
text: broken popsicle stick. He holds the can of pepper spray in
text: his hand. He says, stricken:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I got pick-pocketed. My passport got
dialog: stolen.
text: Peter exhales deeply and turns away. Francis says calmly:

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I hear you're leaving early.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I thought we made an agreement.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's why you stole my passport?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Well, I just think we might have a chance

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. You know:
text: Jack imitates Peter squinting, muttering, and rubbing his

speaker_heading: JACK
text: He left his shoe-shine kit.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Well, he can buy this whole building --
text: Francis jerks his thumb at a partially demolished storefront
text: where three men sit on the ground weaving baskets.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: -- now. Those are $3000 loafers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, but he only got one of them.
text: Peter and Jack laugh. Francis points to the rabbit slippers
text: in Peter's bag. Peter hands him one. Francis puts it on.
text: They all stand up. Silence. Francis says forcefully:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: We’'re in an emergency here! I got my face
text: smashed-in, Jack's heart's been ripped to
dialog: shreds, and Rubby's having a child! Let's

text: Peter looks to Jack and says in disbelief:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You told him?
text: Jack sighs. Francis says eagerly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: It's OK. That's what we're here for. To
dialog: start trusting each other. I don't get
dialog: it, by the way. Why aren't we
dialog: celebrating?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Because I don't want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Why not?
text: Peter looks away. He squints, mutters, and rubs his temples.
text: He says finally, throwing his hands into the air:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I guess because I always expected I'd
dialog: eventually get divorced, so having
dialog: children wasn't, actually, part of my
dialog: plan.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Well, you're never going to do better
dialog: than Alice, and what's the point in
dialog: getting married if --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why'd you expect to get divorced?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: I don't know. I love Alice! Maybe it
dialog: relates to how we were raised.
text: Francis nods. He shakes his head. He says, moved:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Come here.
text: Francis takes Peter’s and Jack’s hands and holds them.

dialog: (suddenly realizing)
dialog: I gave them to Brendan. Anyway, we'll do

speaker_heading: JACK
text: Those guys are laughing at us.
text: Jack points to a group of six thirteen-year-old boys in
text: school uniforms of bright blue shirts and navy blue shorts
text: standing on a patch of hard earth at the edge of a vacant lot
text: with trash all over it. They stare at Francis, Peter, and
text: Jack, smiling and laughing at them good-naturedly. They are
text: playing cricket with a dirty, old, faded tennis ball. Francis
text: shakes his head admiringly.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I love it here. These people are
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: They’‘re playing cricket with a tennis
dialog: ball.
text: The ball bounces into the street. Peter races over to it and
text: kicks it as hard as he can. It nails a wall and bounces back
text: into him. He stops it and dribbles crazily toward the
text: laughing boys. He feints and dodges one of them, then kicks
text: the ball against a cement post. One of the boys intercepts it
text: on the rebound. Francis and Jack look surprised. Peter keeps
text: his cigarette in his mouth and his hands in his pockets while
text: he plays. He yells sharply:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Give me the ball!
text: One of the boys throws the ball to Peter. Peter bounces it a
text: couple of times on the ground, then attempts a wild, windmill-
text: style cricket pitch. A boy with a cricket bat swats it back
text: hard. Peter turns and ducks but gets hit in the back.
text: The shoe-shine boy watches from over a fence. He holds the
text: snakeskin loafer tucked under his arm.
scene_heading: INT. AUTO-RICKSHAW. DAY 27
text: A green, three-wheeled taxi with a yellow vinyl roof.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack ride three abreast in the back. The

text: bicycle pedals alongside them. He smiles, puts out his hand,
text: and shouts cheerily without slowing down:
scene_heading: MAN ON BICYCLE
dialog: Hello! How do you do?
text: Jack laughs. He shakes hands quickly with the man on the
text: bicycle. Francis folds up the short story and hands it to
text: Jack. Jack puts it into his pocket. He stares at Francis.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: It's great.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: It's so well-written. You remember it all
text: so clearly. Peter getting all frantic
dialog: about trying to get the car started --

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (hesitates)
text: The characters are all fictional.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Well, anyway, I think it's the best thing

speaker_heading: JACK

scene_heading: EXT. DEPOT. DAY 28
text: Francis runs limping and hobbling on his cane with Peter and
text: Jack helping him behind the moving train trying to catch up
text: as it pulls out of the station. They jump onto the rear deck,
dialog: one by one.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. DAY 29
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack stand in the corridor outside a very
text: small compartment. There are two lap-top computers, a
text: printer, a set of guidebooks, a map of Asia, a bulletin
text: board, and a laminating machine inside. Brendan looks out at
text: them from the open doorway. He hands Francis a manila
dialog: envelope.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Here's the peacock feathers, plus some

dialog: It's got a skull-and --
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Let's update me.

text: Francis goes with Brendan into the compartment and pulls the

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Yeah. She got the message.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (puzzled)

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: That's it? She got the message? You're

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Well, she knows you're coming.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (pained)
dialog: Does she want to see us?
text: Brendan looks confused. He swallows. He says quietly:
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: But she's your mother.

text: and holds it out to Peter.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Happy birthday. From last year.
text: Peter takes the belt and immediately starts putting it on
text: over his suit jacket.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can't accept this. It's too valuable.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: It's got one wrong initial, but you can

text: Jack looks at the belt and nods.
scene_heading: INT. COMPARTMENT 40/41. DAY 30
text: The blinds are shut, and the sun comes in at the edges of the
text: windows. Peter lies in the top bunk under the sheets with a
text: sleeping mask on. The cardboard box with the skull-and-
text: crossbones on it is beside him. Francis reclines in the lower
text: bunk, and Jack is in the adjoining room. They both lie on top
text: of their covers, fully dressed but asleep. Jack has a towel
text: over his face. Numerous drug strip-packs, bottles, and vials
text: cover the vanity. Empty highball glasses and cigarette butts
text: litter the room. There is a knock on the door. Francis opens
text: his eyes. He frowns and shouts:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Yeah?
text: Rita's voice says through the compartment door:
speaker_heading: RITA (0.S.)
dialog: Would you like tea?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: OK.
text: Rita slides the door open and comes into the compartment
text: carrying a tea-tray with cups, saucers, and a pot of tea.
text: There is a cart in the corridor. She shuts the door. She
text: studies the room briefly. She sets the tray on the fold-out
text: table and pours three cups. Francis sits up on the edge of
text: his bunk. Peter pulls one edge of his sleeping mask up and
text: looks down at Rita curiously. Jack comes into the room
text: groggily and stands leaning in the adjoining doorway.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

text: Rita picks up a pack of cigarettes off the floor. She takes
text: one out and lights it. She cracks open the window and sits
text: down in a chair next to the fold-out table. She taps her
text: ashes into Peter's flower pot with the candle in it. Francis,
text: Peter, and Jack stare at Rita as she smokes. Her mascara is
text: smeared. She says quietly:
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I got to get off this train.
text: Jack hesitates. Rita stubs out her cigarette. She stands up,
text: closes the window, crosses the room, and slides open the
text: compartment door. She looks back. She goes out and shuts the
text: door behind her. Silence.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: What's her name again?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Rita.
text: Peter whispers something incomprehensible from the top bunk.
text: Francis and Jack look at each other, puzzled. They climb up
text: to stand on the lower bunk and peer over the side of Peter's
text: Mattress. Peter is frozen. He has pulled up the sleeping mask
text: to the top of his head. The lid is open on the cardboard box.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What'd you say?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (whispering intensely)
text: There's a hole in it. He escaped.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (confused)
dialog: No, he didn't. How?
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack stare into the box. A piece of
text: lettuce is inside, but the snake is gone. A flap on the side
text: is loose. Francis and Jack look at each other, alarmed.
text: Francis motions quickly for Peter to remain still. He
dialog: whispers to Jack:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Peel back the sheet.
text: Jack nods. He slowly peels the sheet off Peter's body. There
text: is nothing there. Peter breathes heavily. Francis says
dialog: calmly:

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: We're good so far, Peter. Keep going,
dialog: Jack.
text: Jack whips the sheet away. Peter screams. He bolts out of his
text: bunk and leaps down, crashing onto the floor. Francis and
text: Jack are knocked aside. They slam into the walls, banging
text: over glasses, bottles, and suitcases. Peter kicks his legs,
text: shaking them in the air, and rubs his hands rapidly across
text: himself, searching. He stops. He looks up and down. He looks
text: to Francis and Jack. He is dressed only in pink boxer shorts.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where is he?
text: Francis and Jack shake their heads. Peter scans the room
text: intently. He looks terrified.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There he is!
text: Peter throws open the compartment door and darts out into the
text: corridor. Francis and Jack race out after him, knocking an
text: open suitcase out of the room and breaking a glass.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. DAY 31
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack cower halfway down the car. Peter
text: shouts furiously:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Now you believe me, assholes?
text: The two German women, an elderly couple, and the grey-haired
text: all man watch standing in their compartment doorways. The
text: chief steward strides down the corridor with Rita behind him.
text: He sees shirts, socks, and broken glass on the floor. He
text: looks to Francis, Peter, and Jack with an incredulous
text: expression. Francis says reluctantly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I think a snake might've gotten onboard.
text: The chief steward walks past the compartment. Rita starts to
text: peer into the room. Jack pulls her back by the elbow.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't go in there, Rita.
text: The chief steward looks back at Jack and frowns. He goes into
text: the galley and comes out with a spatula and an ice bucket. He
text: hands the ice bucket to Rita. He disappears into the
text: compartment. There is a loud banging and some shuffling

text: sounds. Francis, Peter, Jack, and Rita look at each other
text: nervously. The chief steward lunges into the corridor with
text: the snake looped over the end of the spatula. He flips it
text: around and pinches it by the throat. Francis brightens.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You got him!
text: The chief steward goes over to Rita, drops the snake into the
text: ice bucket, and clamps the lid over it. He says something
text: briskly in Hindi, and Rita walks out of the car. He looks at
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack.
scene_heading: INT. COMPARTMENT 40/41. DAY 32
text: The chief steward moves slowly through the room, observing
text: the clothes, personal articles, airline bottles of liquor,
text: and dirty ashtrays strewn everywhere. Francis, Peter, and
text: Jack watch, uneasy. The chief steward says gravely:
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: I'm kicking you off at the next station.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack look stunned. Francis hesitates. He
dialog: pleads respectfully:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Please, don't do that. We're very sorry.
dialog: It won't happen again.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: I know it won't.
text: The chief steward sniffs the air. He says sharply:
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: What's that smell?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (tragically)
dialog: Voltaire, number six.
text: The chief steward looks puzzled. He crosses into the
text: adjoining compartment. He sees the drug strip-packs, bottles,
text: and vials on the vanity. He picks up a handful and examines
text: them. He turns to Francis, Peter, and Jack and says shortly:
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: Do you have a prescription for these?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: A prescription. I almost died.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

text: Silence. Francis looks to Peter and Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Give me a second.
text: Francis motions for Peter and Jack to step out of the room.
text: He shuts the adjoining door. He stares at the chief steward.
text: He takes a stack of money out of his pocket and holds it out.
text: The chief grabs the bills and jams them into Francis' breast
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: That animal is deadly poisonous, and you
dialog: brought him onto my train.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: We didn't know that. It was an accident.
dialog: We're just trying to experience
dialog: something.
text: The chief steward whips open the compartment door. Peter and
text: Jack stand listening in front of it. Francis says earnestly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: It's important to us.
text: Peter and Jack look concerned and vaguely menacing. A walkie-
text: talkie on the chief steward's belt makes a static sound, and
text: a voice comes over it talking in scratchy Hindi. The chief
text: steward frowns. He presses a button on the walkie-talkie and
text: responds rapidly in Hindi. He looks at Francis, Peter, and
text: Jack. They deflate. The chief steward softens slightly. He
dialog: sighs.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: You're confined to your compartment until
dialog: further notice.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack nod respectfully, relieved. The
text: chief steward starts out of the room. Peter asks sadly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is our snake getting confiscated?
text: The chief steward looks stupefied. He cannot bring himself to
text: answer. He slides open the door, walks out of the
text: compartment, and slams the door shut behind him. Peter
text: squints, mutters, and rubs his temples.

text: People circled around them sing a changing verse in Punjabi
text: over and over.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack sit near the back of the crowd. Each

text: opens his eyes and looks up to Peter and Jack. He frowns.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Are you guys not going to try to pray?

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT. DAY 33
text: A high plain with dying trees, scrub, and rocks. There is

text: loafer on the other. Peter ties knots in one of the
text: handkerchiefs and wears it on his head. A few other
text: passengers and train staff members lean out the windows or
text: stand around curiously. Three maintenance engineers in greasy

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: These guys are driving me crazy. Is there
dialog: an empty compartment I can move into?
text: Rita puts on her glasses. She says evenly:
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No, there isn't. We're fully booked.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I really want to kiss you.
text: Rita stares at Jack passively. Jack says simply:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Can I?
text: Pause. Rita answers in a quiet, resolute voice:
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: No?
text: Jack looks confused. A bell rings on the wall next to the
text: window. Rita ignores it. Jack whispers:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But we already did it. Why --
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I have a boyfriend.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You do.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Actually, I just broke up with him, or
dialog: I'm about to. In a way, it's good timing,
dialog: but it's also bad timing. I'm confused.
text: Jack presses his hair back off his forehead. The bell on the
text: wall rings twice more. The lavatory door inside Rita's
text: compartment sways with the movement of the train. A mirror on
text: it reveals Rita's back in the reflection. Her sari-uniform is
text: unzipped down to the middle of her ass. She has a tattoo of a
dialog: little tiger.

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I really need someone to talk to right
dialog: now, and I feel like you might be very
dialog: important to me in my life.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Really? I thought -- I mean, thank you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: Can you say anything more about that?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I would kiss you, but I'm confused.
text: Jack nods. He says quietly:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't be.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: All right.
text: Jack comes into the compartment and closes the door. He
text: kisses Rita. He slides his hands down her body. He says
dialog: suddenly:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's go to Italy.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: How?
text: The bell rings four times in a row. Rita slides the door open
text: and shoves Jack out of the room. She shuts the door. Jack
text: stands slightly dazed with lipstick smeared on his face. He
text: walks down the corridor.
text: The chief steward comes into the car. He is dressed in a more
text: formal version of his turban and Nehru jacket with embroidery
text: and gold trim. He sees Jack. He says to him furiously:
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: What'd I tell you? Get back in your room!
text: There is a loud banging sound from inside compartment 40/41.
text: Jack looks to the chief steward curiously. He slides the door
dialog: open.
text: Peter holds a lit cigarette in one hand and a flaming

text: the air, trying to put it out. He throws it in the sink and
text: turns on the tap. He looks to Jack and the chief steward.
text: Jack goes into the room and shuts the door behind him.
text: Rita comes out of her compartment at the other end of the
text: car. She sees the chief steward. She turns around and goes in
text: the opposite direction. The chief steward says loudly:
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (without stopping)
dialog: What do you mean?
text: The chief steward hurries to catch Rita. She slides open the
text: door at the end of the corridor. They stop in the space
text: between the two cars. The chief steward yells over the noise
text: of the wind and clacking wheels:
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: I rang the bell!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'll be right there.
text: Rita opens the door and starts to go. The chief steward grabs
text: her arm.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: Wait a second!
text: Rita looks back at the chief steward.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: What's going on with these brothers?
dialog: 40/41!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I think they're OK.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: They're being disorderly!
speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I understand.

speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: Can you handle this?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yes.
text: Rita opens the door and starts to go again. The chief steward
text: grabs her arm again.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: Wait a second!
text: Rita looks back at the chief steward and says sharply:
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (pained)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: Have I offended you?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: What did I do?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Let me go.
text: The chief steward releases Rita's arm. She goes into the next
text: car. The chief steward watches her anxiously. She walks away

scene_heading: 37 INT. COMPARTMENT 40/41. NIGHT 37
text: Peter shaves at the vanity with his shirt off. He uses an
text: old, silver razor. Francis lies on the bottom bunk smoking a
text: cigarette. Jack sits next to the window drinking a whiskey
text: highball. Francis frowns and says to Peter suddenly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Is that Dad's razor?
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Can I say something?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You don't have permission to take his
dialog: property that belongs to all of us and
dialog: use it for yourself as if it's yours.
dialog: Jack agrees with that. Right, Jack?
text: Francis looks to Jack for support. Jack takes a sip of his
text: drink and stares into space blankly. Francis continues:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Plus, Dad would've hated it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (shocked )
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: That's my opinion. I knew him well.
text: Silence. Peter says quietly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's a terrible thing to say.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Well, I don't mean it to be. I just don't
dialog: want you to feel like you're better
dialog: friends with him than we are or something
dialog: weird like that. Also, you can't leave
dialog: your wife just because she's pregnant.
dialog: Jack agrees with that, too. Right --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Stop including me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (steely)
dialog: I was his favorite. He told me that with
text: blood all over him, lying in the street,
dialog: right before he died.

text: Peter walks out of the room, into the adjoining compartment.
text: Francis looks to Jack and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: How's that supposed to make us feel?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I want my passport back.
text: Francis frowns. He raises his voice:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You know what? You're a drug addict --
dialog: all of us!
text: Peter says loudly from the adjoining room:
speaker_heading: PETER (0.S.)
dialog: Francis!
text: Francis leans from the mirror into the adjoining doorway.
text: Peter stands across from him with the belt in his hand.
dialog: Francis says bluntly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Here's your belt.
text: Peter throws the belt as hard as he can into Francis' face.
text: The leather slaps across Francis’ eyes, and the buckle snaps
text: hard into the bandages on his forehead. A line of blood runs
text: quickly from beneath the gauze above his eyebrow down along
text: the side of his nose. Peter looks angry but worried. Jack's
text: mouth falls open.
text: Francis charges into Peter, and they tangle into a furious,
text: scrabbling clutch. They smash into the walls and doors as
text: they try to bang their fists into each others’ faces. Francis
text: hollers in pain:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: My shoulder!
text: Peter looks alarmed and eases his hold on Francis. Francis
text: elbows Peter brutally in the jaw. Jack shouts:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stop!
text: Jack drinks his drink in one sip, throws his glass on the
text: floor, and rushes to intervene. He is immediately knocked

text: into the side of the washbasin. He retreats. He watches the
text: fight, concerned. He runs back into the adjoining room.
text: Jack heaves his trunk onto the bench seat, snaps the latches
text: free, and throws open the lid. He digs among stacks of
text: novels, a dictionary, pens, pencils, notebooks, a flashlight,
text: bottles of water, a camera, and piles of clothes. He finds
text: his can of pepper spray. He fiddles with the trigger and
text: snaps a small, metal capsule into the base. It cocks like an
text: automatic. He crosses back into the other room.
text: Francis holds his cane around Peter's neck in a strict
text: headlock, squeezing vigorously while Peter’s face turns
text: bright red. Peter digs his fingers under the bandages on
text: Francis’ head. The two brothers buck fitfully on the floor,
text: banging into things, shouting, and grunting.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You don't love me!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes, I do!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I love you, too, but I'm going to mace
dialog: you in the face!
text: Francis and Peter ignore Jack and continue fighting. Jack
text: takes a deep breath and holds it. He fires the pepper spray
text: at his brothers. It makes a pop and hisses.
text: Silence. Francis and Peter erupt into crazed screaming,
text: pawing at their eyes and gasping for breath. Jack looks
text: pained and scared. Francis grabs at Jack’s ankles. Jack
text: throws open the compartment door and retreats into the
text: corridor. He watches as Francis and Peter slowly stagger to
text: their feet, coughing and wheezing. Francis looks at Jack,
text: squinting. Jack says frozen:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I had to do it.
text: Francis lunges at Jack. Jack kicks him. He runs to the end of
text: the car, throws open the door, and heads into the next coach.
text: Jack turns around to face the door. He takes a step
text: backwards. He inserts a fresh capsule into his can of pepper
text: spray. He raises the cannister and waits. The door opens, and
text: Jack maces Francis and Peter again. Francis and Peter scream
text: and choke, clawing at their eyes. Jack shouts:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stop including me!

dialog: 56.
text: Jack turns and sprints away. He runs past the two German
text: women, who look out from their compartment doorway, angry and
text: frightened. He opens the door at the end of the car and races
text: into the next coach. He slams full-speed into the sliding
text: glass door to the dining room and blasts though it,
text: shattering glass everywhere.
text: The passengers at their tables are taken aback and stare at
text: Jack, stunned. Some people have on party hats. A banner
text: hanging from the ceiling reads Welcome Gala! There are
text: streamers and balloons everywhere. Jack lies on his back on
text: the floor, covered with glittering shards and splinters.
text: The chief steward strides toward Jack from the other end of
text: the dining car with an icy look on his face.
scene_heading: EXT. DEPOT. NIGHT 38
text: The train is stopped at a deserted station. The doors to the
text: ticket office are closed and padlocked. Francis, Peter, and
text: Jack stand on the platform next to their luggage in a large
text: pile. Their suitcases are partly unlatched, and bits of
text: clothes stick out of them. A laundry bag has been hastily
text: filled with shoes, books, toiletries, etc. Francis and Peter
text: have brightly bloodshot eyes which they blink and squint,
text: rubbing them continuously. Tears continue to stream down
text: their faces. They wheeze. Francis' false tooth is now
dialog: missing. (NOTE: it is never replaced.)
text: Two porters in red turbans come out of the train and stack
text: the printer and laminating machine with the luggage. Brendan
text: comes out after them wearing a bathrobe and carrying two
text: duffel bags. He looks confused.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: The next train's in twenty-four hours.
dialog: I'll find us a hotel. This came in.
text: Brendan hands Francis a bright yellow envelope.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Why are your eyes all red?
text: Francis frowns. He snaps bitterly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Why is your head so bald?
text: Brendan recoils. He says quietly, disappointed:
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Because I have alopecia.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Yeah, I know. That's like albino, right?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Not really.
text: Peter shakes his head in disgust. Francis points at Jack and
dialog: says to Brendan:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Jack maced us.
text: Brendan nods. He stares at Francis for a long minute. He
text: reaches into his pocket, takes out a small, plastic,
text: electrical adapter with three large, brass prongs, and hands
text: it to Francis. He turns away and gets back on the train with
text: his duffel bags. Francis stares down at the adapter in his
text: hand. He says, worried:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Was I just mean to Brendan?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (with contempt)
dialog: He's not coming back. He just quit.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: He did, didn't he?
text: The chief steward appears in the open doorway and looks out
text: from the train. His eyes are cold. Francis yells desperately:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Can we at least get our snake back?
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: It's dead.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: You killed him?
text: The chief steward shrugs. Peter throws his hands up in the
text: air, wounded. The chief steward slams the door shut and pulls
text: the latch closed. Francis grits his teeth and whacks the door
text: with his cane. Peter sees the two German women watching from
text: their open window. One of them says:
speaker_heading: GERMAN WOMAN
dialog: Shame on you.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

text: Peter clenches his fists and looks like he is about to
text: explode. He stammers:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Krauts!
text: The German women close their window coolly, unfazed. Jack
dialog: says to Francis:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your fake tooth's gone.
text: Francis checks the gap in his mouth with his finger. He
dialog: mutters:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Fuck.
text: Jack walks alongside the train to the next coach. Rita sits
text: looking out the window with her arms draped over the
text: windowsill. She has tears all over her face.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did you get maced, too?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No, I'm crying.
text: Rita hands Jack a small, paper sack. She looks to Francis and
text: Peter. They look back at her blankly. She says to Jack:
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Let me think about that. I'1l tell you
dialog: the next time I see you.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (withdrawing)
dialog: Sure. Tell me then.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (genuinely)
dialog: Thanks for using me.
text: Rita looks puzzled. She smiles sadly:
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You're welcome.
text: Jack nods. Rita stares at Jack. The train starts to move.

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good-bye, Rita.
text: Jack turns and walks away. Francis yells:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: So long, Sweet Lime!
text: The train begins to pick up speed. Peter picks up a rock and
text: throws it at one of the cars. Francis and Jack pick up more
text: rocks and pelt the train repeatedly. Frightened passengers
text: watch from their windows. The train pulls away, out of the
text: station. Francis, Peter, and Jack see the old man from the
text: train standing at the other end of the platform. A red car
text: pulls up to the station and honks its horn. Francis, Peter,
text: and Jack hesitate. The old man quickly gets into the car. He
text: says something to the driver in Hindi. He looks briefly at
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack and pulls away, spitting gravel.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack stand alone on the platform.
text: Crickets chirp. Francis opens the yellow envelope and takes
text: out a piece of paper and unfolds it. Peter and Jack look at
text: it over his shoulder. It is a typewritten letter. Francis
dialog: reads out loud:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Dear boys --
text: The platform lights automatically switch off with a clack.
dialog: Silence.
scene_heading: EXT. POTATO FIELD. NIGHT
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack walk on a rutted dirt road in the
text: dark lugging all their baggage. Jack rolls his trunk behind
text: him. Francis pushes a small trolley with the printer and
text: laminating machine stacked on it and secured with string.
text: Peter carries two suitcases on his head. They carefully cross
text: a narrow board over a dry ditch. Francis stares at the letter
text: as they walk. A woman reads in VOICE-OVER:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: -- bad timing! This morning I received

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Also, frankly, there is not much to eat.
dialog: I suggest you come in the spring when you
dialog: will be safe with me. You must know how
dialog: sad I am to experience this long
dialog: separation. I am yearning to see my boys.
text: Jack passes the letter back to Francis. The woman's voice
dialog: continues:

dialog: I hope you will eventually understand and
dialog: forgive me. God bless you and keep you
dialog: with Mary's benevolent guidance and the
dialog: light of Christ's enduring grace. All my

text: Francis folds up the piece of paper and puts it into his

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: That sounds like bullshit to me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Obviously.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: She's trying to sell us a vacuum cleaner.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEL PIT. NIGHT 40
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack sit on their suitcases around a
text: small fire made from sticks and garbage. Jack looks inside
text: the paper sack. He takes out a foil packet of cocktail nuts
text: and crackers labelled Savory Snack and a bottle of airline
text: gin and hands them to Francis. He takes out a foil packet of
text: chocolates and caramels labelled Sweet Snack and a bottle of
text: airline vodka and hands them to Peter. He opens a bottle of

text: Peter and Jack nod. Francis takes out one of his vials of
text: amber liquid. They each drop three drops under their tongues
text: with the pipette. Peter says suddenly with his voice choking
dialog: up:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Francis looks surprised. He nods and says with feeling:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I wasn't trying to aim for your face.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: It doesn't matter. It's already
dialog: demolished. Let's go home.
text: Peter nods. Francis continues sadly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: She doesn't want to see us, anyway.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: You don't think so? Not even on some
dialog: primordial level?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: She's been disappearing all our lives. We
dialog: weren't raised to be treated like that.
dialog: It's just not done.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe this is how it's supposed to
dialog: happen. It could all be part of it. Maybe
text: this is where the spiritual journey ends.
text: Pause. Francis suddenly grabs his briefcase, snaps it open,
text: and takes out the manila envelope. He reaches into it. He
text: pulls out the three peacock feathers. He hands one to Peter
dialog: and one to Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Did you read the instructions?
text: Peter and Jack nod distractedly.

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: OK. Let's do it.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack each walk away in a different
text: direction, into the darkness, counting fifty paces out loud.
text: They stop in the distance. Francis digs in the ground and
text: chants to himself. Peter spins around in a circle three times
text: and kneels down on one knee. Jack throws his feather into the
text: air, releasing it with the wind. They clench their fists and
dialog: shout.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack reconvene around the fire. Jack says
dialog: strangely:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Which direction did yours go?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your feathers. Mine blew towards the
dialog: mountains.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: That's not right. It's not supposed to
dialog: get blown away. You blow on it --
text: Francis pantomimes blowing on a feather.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: -- then bury it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I didn't get that. I still have mine.
text: Peter holds up his feather. Francis looks frustrated. He
dialog: says, pained:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: You guys didn't do it right. I asked if
dialog: you read the instructions. You did it
dialog: wrong.
text: Francis covers his hands over his eyes and shakes his head.
text: He tries to contain himself. He stammers:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I tried my hardest. I don't know what
dialog: else to do.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

text: Francis lifts his hands off his eyes. Peter and Jack look at
text: him desolately. They sit back down around the fire. Peter
text: takes off his sunglasses and looks at them. He says quietly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't think Dad would've hated it.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (distantly)
dialog: Well, I'm sure he would've been
dialog: flattered, anyway -- whether he thought
dialog: it was in good taste or not.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did he really say you were his favorite?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't know. I could barely understand
text: him. He wasn't really breathing.
text: Silence. Jack looks up at the stars.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I wonder if the three of us could've been
dialog: friends in real life. Not as brothers,
dialog: but as people.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We might've had a better chance, I guess.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (brightening desperately)
dialog: Let's make another agreement: we'll all
dialog: come back in the spring when the flowers
dialog: start to --
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: We're never coming back here. Let's just
dialog: find an airport and go our separate ways.
text: Jack takes out two airline bottles of rum and cognac and
text: hands them to Francis and Peter. He says wistfully:

scene_heading: EXT. RIVER. DAY 41
text: Daybreak. Francis, Peter, and Jack walk together lugging
text: their baggage along the banks of a fast-rushing river.
text: Francis hits a bump with his trolley. A string snaps, and the
text: printer and laminating machine tip off the top of it and
text: smash down onto the ground. Francis, Peter, and Jack pause.
text: They look down at the damaged printer and broken laminating
text: machine. They look at each other. The start walking again.
dialog: Francis points:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Look.
text: In the middle of the river, there is a flimsy raft mounted on
text: four oil drums with ropes looped under it reaching to the
text: banks. Three boys ride on it. One is ten, one is eight, and
text: one is six. They wear white cloths around their waists and
text: carry large baskets of vegetables. One has a white scarf
text: around his shoulders. They pull the raft across the river,
text: through the swift current, on a rope cable stretched in the
text: air over the water. Francis, Peter, and Jack watch them.
text: Jack's says calmly:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's going to tip over.
text: The raft bounces once, a rope snaps, and it flips. The
text: baskets tumble and radishes spill everywhere. The boys fall
text: into the churning water and hang on desperately. Francis,
text: Peter, and Jack watch, shocked. Peter says under his breath:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Go.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack drop their suitcases, sprint to the
text: river, and splash in, wading quickly into the deeper water.
text: Jack loses his footing and starts to get swept away. He
text: reaches out and shouts:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Francis!
text: Francis grabs Jack's hand and grips the cable tightly. Peter
text: leads them hand-over-hand along the rope. The three boys
text: cling to the upturned raft. They look terrified. Francis
dialog: yells to Jack:

dialog: yells:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't let go of me!
text: Francis and Peter pull themselves onto the upturned raft and
text: crawl over the oil drums to the other two boys on the far
text: side. The raft rocks and tilts. They struggle to balance.
text: Francis tugs the oldest boy out of the water. He and the boy
text: scramble back across the oil drums to the rope.
text: The current shifts, and the raft flips again, righting
text: itself, with Peter and the middle boy bracing themselves as
text: it swings through the air and slams down with a crash.

speaker_heading: PETER (0.S.)
dialog: We're OK! We're OK!
speaker_heading: CUT TO: 42
text: Peter and the middle boy in a dark space between the oil
text: drums. Peter clutches the boy with one arm and hangs onto the
text: slats above with the other. The sound of the rushing water
text: echoes against the hollow metal. The boy spits as he bobs in
text: the water. He tugs on a scarf wrapped around him, knotted and
text: twisted, caught on one of the oil drums. Peter jerks at it.
text: He says as he tries to tear the cloth:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do you speak English?
text: The boy nods with his eyes wide, trembling and terrified.
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You've got yourself all tangled up, don't

text: Peter starts ripping away at the tangled fabric. He tries to

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How old are you?
text: The boy does not respond. Peter continues:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you guys brothers?
text: The boy does not answer. Peter pulls at a hunk of wire,
text: straining to break the boy free.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You don't want to say anything?

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's stretching.

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Hang on!
text: Francis and Jack grip the broken cable as they are swept
text: downstream until the rope jerks taut. They whirl into a
text: tangle of reeds and branches at the shore with the oldest
text: boy. They watch the raft careening into the distance. Peter
text: surfaces for an instant, gasping and swimming desperately to
text: try to stop the raft. He goes under again. The raft bumps in
text: the rapids and disappears suddenly over a bank of rocks.
text: Francis and Jack race up to the dirt road and bolt down the
text: river after Peter. They look freaked out. Francis grimaces
text: and hops a step on his bad leg. The other boys run after
text: them. Jack sprints ahead, hurtling and sliding in the brush.
text: They run one full minute without a word. Jack snaps from the
text: bramble and shouts:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Peter!
text: Peter wades from the shallow water below, holding the middle
text: boy tightly in his arms. Planks of the demolished raft and
text: smashed oil drums float behind them. Blood rushes freely from
text: Peter's scalp and flows over the entire side of his face. The
text: boy's arms hang limp, and the wet cloth over his body is red
text: with blood. Jack screams back to Francis:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He's all bloody!
text: Jack starts down the embankment and falls, rolling over the
text: gravel. He picks himself up by the river and splashes out to

scene_heading: EXT. WHEAT FIELD. DAY 44
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack walk across the scrub, past bony,

text: and Peter is bloody. He carries the dead boy on his shoulder.
text: A group of old women holding baskets of grain stop and stare.
text: An small man with a wheelbarrow begins to walk alongside
text: them, curious and concerned. Children gather, chattering
dialog: nervously.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack reach the edge of a village. There
text: are thatched huts and clay brick houses. Agitated people run
text: out to meet them, yelling in Hindi. More voices shout in the
text: distance. Dogs circle.
text: A large man with a thick moustache and a horrified look on
text: his face rushes up to Peter, shouting. He lifts the dead boy
text: away, into his arms. He says something rapidly and grimaces.
text: He is the father. He dashes into the village followed by the
text: two surviving boys and most of the bystanders.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack are left standing with the small man
text: and some other children, who all stare at them. A teenaged
text: boy in a school uniform of a red shirt and orange pants says
text: something loudly to them in Hindi and darts off. Francis,
text: Peter, and Jack look at each other, weary and lost. The
text: teenaged boy comes back quickly carrying a metal pot filled
text: with water. He offers it to them. Francis, Peter, and Jack
text: share a drink.

text: Numerous people come in and out of the room and cross busily
text: through the courtyard speaking to each other in Hindi and
text: shaking hands with and bowing to Francis, Peter, and Jack.
text: Everyone stares at them continuously with kind eyes. Women in
text: saris attend to them, pouring cups of tea and serving bowls
text: of rice. A thin, smiling man drapes white towels over their
dialog: shoulders.
text: A tall man in a long, white shirt and glasses comes into the
text: room and walks through carrying a black doctor's bag. He is
text: bald and has a white beard. He opens the door to the next

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD. DAY 46
text: Francis', Peter's, and Jack's suits, shirts, and socks hang

text: in a wagon.
text: Francis lies on his back on a mat on the ground. Crouching
text: children stare down at him.
text: A woman in a yellow sari holds a sleeping baby with its hair
text: sticking up funny. The baby's hand grips Peter's finger.
text: Three men stand next to them, watching. One of them says
text: something quietly in Hindi. The mother offers the baby for
text: Peter to hold. Peter breathes slowly as he takes the baby and
text: cradles it into his arms. Others gather closer. Peter looks
text: up at the mother. He seems moved and dazed.
text: Jack sits in the grass with three girls helping them string
text: flowers together in long strands. One of them picks up a
text: beetle off the ground and throws it.
text: In the next courtyard, the dead boy lies on a rug on the
text: ground in front of a hut with a sheet over the lower half of
text: his body. With the help of two other men, the father pours
text: water over the boy's neck and chest and washes his skin with

dialog: I lost him when we went off the rocks --

text: (with a lump in his throat)
dialog: I want them to know that.
text: The boy says something in Hindi. Peter nods.
text: A bus appears in the distance. The boy steps into the road
text: and whips the handkerchief out of his pocket. He waves it in
text: the air. The bus approaches and comes to a stop. It is
text: decorated and personalized with colorful, hand-painted stars,
text: flowers, and patterns which cover it entirely.

text: bags of grain, etc. They all stare from their seats as
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack make their way down the aisle to the
dialog: back.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack jam their hand-baggage into an
text: overhead rack. A young man with two earrings quickly moves a

text: The two surviving boys run into the road in front of the bus
text: waving their arms and yelling urgently. The teenaged boy in
text: the school uniform runs behind them fluttering his pink
text: handkerchief. The bus driver honks again and stomps on the
text: brakes. The bus lurches to a stop. The driver throws the
text: doors open. The two surviving boys poke their heads inside
text: and exchange words rapidly in Hindi with the driver.
text: The driver looks to the back of the bus. He points to
text: Francis. Francis stands up and walks quickly to the front of
text: the bus. Peter, Jack, and everyone else on-board watch as
text: Francis, the driver, and the two surviving boys speak in

scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE. DAY 50

text: approach carrying the body of the dead boy. It is strapped to
text: the bamboo stretcher and wrapped in white silk with strings
text: of flowers all over it. The men place it on the back of the
text: truck. Francis, Peter, and Jack pick up some stray flowers
text: off the ground and add them to the pile on the body.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack walk past a camel towing a cart
text: filled with men in long white shirts and white pants. They
text: help an old woman climb onto the back. They continue around a

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Peter, we'll come back and get the car

text: with photographs of Bavarian landscapes and a racing calendar
text: tacked to the walls. He scans a wooden rack of keys on hooks.
text: He sees the set of keys on the Porsche key-chain. He grabs
text: them and goes out of the office.
text: Peter walks quickly back to the Porsche and sits in the
text: driver's seat. He puts in the key and tries to turn it over.
text: The car lurches and a puff of black smoke comes out of the

text: The battery's dead -- too.
text: Peter pops the hood-latch and jumps out of the car. He throws

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: Is that from Sweet Lime?

text: Separate the lights from the darks, and
dialog: give everything to Sandyha.
text: Patricia points to Peter and says to the teenaged girl:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Doesn't he have the most beautiful eyes?
text: The teenaged girl laughs. Patricia walks into the kitchen
text: while Francis, Peter, and Jack hand their laundry to the
text: teenaged girl. They follow Patricia. Patricia picks up a
text: ladle and tastes a broth cooking in a cauldron on the stove.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: This is kind of like soup.
dialog: (to Francis and Peter)
dialog: You'll like it, and you'll like it.
text: Patricia holds the ladle while Francis and Peter taste the
text: broth. They look pleased. Patricia turns to Jack:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: You'll like this.
text: Patricia lifts a little ball of dough out of another pot with
text: a spoon. Jack takes a bite. He nods appreciatively. Patricia
dialog: says to him regretfully:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Why'd you grow a moustache?
text: Jack shrugs. Patricia looks up above her and snaps her
text: fingers. A metal teapot lowers down to her on a rope. She
text: pours herself a cup and leads Francis, Peter, and Jack into a
text: vestibule. There is a silver bowl on a shelf. Patricia dips
text: her finger into it.

dialog: It's Ash Wednesday.
text: Patricia marks a cross on Francis', Peter's, and Jack's
text: foreheads with the ash.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL. DAY 69
text: A small, white church with a large, bloody crucifix above the
text: altar. Patricia leads a hymn from the pulpit with three
text: Indian nuns in blue habits. Another nun plays a plastic,
text: electric organ. Francis, Peter, and Jack stand in a pew
text: holding hymnals and singing with the rest of the congregation
text: of children, teachers, and workers. A metal fan with
text: fluttering ribbons attached to it whirs, rotating back and
text: forth in the open doorway.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST QUARTERS. NIGHT 70
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack lie on three narrow cots in a spare,
text: white room overlooking the edge of the cliff. They are
text: dressed in their white pajamas. There is a crucifix above one
text: bed, an illustration of St. Francis above another, and the
text: Virgin Mary above the third. There is a plastic bottle of
text: water next to each bunk. An electric mosquito coil is plugged
text: into the wall. Peter's candle burns on a night-table. The
text: trunk and suitcases are laid out in a row on the floor. Some
text: are open with laundry strewn around them. Wind rattles the
text: window-panes, and a light rain falls on the metal roof.
text: Patricia sits on the end of Jack's bed with her hands folded
text: in her lap. She says energetically:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: What do we want for breakfast? Jack,
dialog: you'll like the porridge. Peter? Fresh
dialog: Mango? And corn flakes for you, Francie.
dialog: Now who wants scrambled eggs? Raise your
dialog: hand.
text: Patricia raises her hand. Francis, Peter, and Jack
text: reluctantly raise their hands, too.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: OK.
text: Francis, Peter, Jack, and Patricia lower their hands.
text: Patricia squints at the night-stand.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: What's on fire in that hideous little
dialog: flower pot?

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Alice made that.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It's darling. Tell her I said so.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: OK. You want one?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: of course, I do. Good-night, boys.
text: Patricia goes from one bed to the next, kissing Francis,
text: Peter, and Jack good-night on the lips. She walks across the
text: room. She stops at the suitcases on the floor and looks at
text: them. The trunk is on its end. On top of it, there are three
text: tiny, hand-cranked music boxes in a row. Patricia winds one a
text: few turns, listening. She smiles at Jack. She switches off
text: the light and opens the door. Peter says softly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Mom?
text: Patricia stops. She turns around and stands darkly in the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Uh-huh?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There's one last thing.
text: Peter briskly stands up out of bed and strides to the door.
text: He turns the light back on. He says to Francis and Jack:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't know what I'm about to do, by the
dialog: way.
text: Peter takes Patricia by the arm and draws her quickly back
text: into the room. She looks startled. Francis and Jack sit up in
text: their bunks. Peter shuts the door. He points to a stool.
text: Patricia sits down. Peter returns to his bed. He, Francis,
text: and Jack stare at Patricia.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I want to tell you about my son.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What son?

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The one I'm going to have next month.
text: Patricia looks taken aback. She is suddenly overwhelmed. She
text: says in a different voice:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: I'm in shock. Is this for real?
text: Peter nods. Patricia says firmly:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: You should be with Alice.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You should've been at Dad's funeral.
text: Patricia falls silent. She stares at Peter evenly. She says
dialog: finally:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: So that's why you came here. To make me
dialog: feel guilty.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: We came here because we miss you.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: (pained)
dialog: I miss you, too.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But why didn't you come to Dad's funeral?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: (simply)
dialog: Because I didn't want to. He was dead.
text: Pause. Patricia takes a deep breath. She says, frustrated:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: What's wrong with us? Why are we talking
dialog: about this?
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: We should be celebrating!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: I live here. These people need me.

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What about us?
text: Patricia hesitates. She turns around and looks back over her
text: shoulder. She looks back to Francis, Peter, and Jack. She
text: turns around and looks back over her shoulder again. She
text: looks back to Francis, Peter, and Jack. She points to an
text: imaginary person behind her and says:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: You're talking to her.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack look confused. Patricia continues:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: You're talking to someone else -- not me.
dialog: I don't have the answers to these
dialog: questions, and I don't see myself this
dialog: way.
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Pretend I'm a lawyer, and you're paying
dialog: me $250 an hour. How can I help you?
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack are speechless. Patricia says
dialog: finally:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: I'm sorry we lost your father. We'll
dialog: never get over it -- but it's OK. There
dialog: are greater forces at work. Yes, the past
dialog: happened -- but it's over, isn't it?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Not for us.
text: Silence. Patricia says quietly:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: I told you not to come here. Why is
dialog: everything so hard for you?
text: A line of blood runs quickly from Patricia's nose. Francis,
text: Peter, and Jack look stunned.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: It's probably not the best time for us to
dialog: discuss this right now.
text: Patricia starts to stand up, but Francis moves toward her and
dialog: says calmly:

speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Tilt your head back.
text: Patricia hesitates. Francis puts his hands on the sides of
text: her head and leans back her neck to slow the blood. Peter
text: wipes her face clean with a handkerchief and holds it with
text: gentle pressure to her nose. Jack kneels down on one knee and
text: grasps her hand tightly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's OK.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Calm down.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Just relax.
text: Patricia sits quietly. She turns to Peter.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: What happened? Did the light change? Did
dialog: he cross without looking? Did the taxi
dialog: swerve and hit him?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't know. I didn't see it. He sent me
dialog: to buy cigarettes.
text: Patricia nods. She stares into space.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Did I do wrong? I wasn't ready to be a
dialog: mother. I regret it.
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: of course, I regret it.
text: Patricia looks down at the floor. Francis says quietly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: At one point, we thought about trying to
dialog: kidnap you away by force -- but it seems
text: kind of far-fetched now.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: How sweet. That would've been fun.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: You want to come home with us, anyway --
dialog: voluntarily?

speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: (genuinely)
dialog: I can't do that, baby.
text: Silence. Francis says suddenly:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: But you love us, right?
text: Patricia looks stunned. Her voice breaks as she says quietly:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Of course. Don't you know that?
text: Simultaneously: Francis shrugs, Peter shakes his head, and
text: Jack nods. Patricia swallows hard.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Maybe we can express ourselves more fully
dialog: if we don't say it in words. Should we
dialog: try that?
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack look intrigued. Patricia sits up
text: straight. She waves her hand, signalling to begin. She stares
text: at Francis, Peter, and Jack, focussing intently. They look
text: back at her, slightly confused. They try to communicate with
text: their eyes. Patricia listens and responds silently. She
text: suddenly grasps something.
text: Outside, a tall boy pulls on a rope, ringing the bell. One of
text: the orphans asleep in a bunk wakes up and listens -- then
text: another and another. Rita leans out the window of the train
text: smoking a cigarette. Her hair is tied in a knot on top of her
text: head, and she eats nuts from a bag of Savory Snacks. The
text: chief steward lies asleep in his bunk on a bedroll with his
text: unrolled turban draped on a hook above him. His compartment
text: is dark except for a small night-light, and the red snake is
text: in a small terrarium on his desk. The two surviving brothers
text: from the village sleep on a hammock in their hut. Their
text: father sits awake outside petting a dog. A very pregnant
text: Alice sleeps in her apartment as the morning light and sounds
text: of the city street filter in through a window. The mechanic
text: from the auto-shop sits alone dressed in pajamas at a kitchen
text: table drinking a cup of coffee. He watches a Formula One race
text: on a portable television set. Brendan sits upright, sleeping
text: peacefully, with a bright blue blanket wrapped around him on
text: an overnight flight. The businessman from the beginning of
text: the movie rides in a chair on the rear deck of a caboose,
text: looking out into the dark plain. Deep in the forest, a tiger
text: lies stretched in the grass under a tree.
text: (NOTE: with each cut, a sound is added -- bell ringing,
text: wheels clacking, snake hissing, dogs barking, city streets,

text: race-cars, jet engines, steam whistle, and jungle birds. The
text: noises build to a roar.)
text: Silence. The bell rings one last time. The Tibetan guide
text: listens in the dark, sitting on a mat among the horses with a
text: rifle slung over his shoulder. Lights go out all around the
dialog: compound.
text: Tears stream down Patricia's face. She wipes her eyes, claps
text: her hands together, and stands up. She says, lost and dazed:
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: All right. Let's make an agreement: A.)
dialog: We'll get an early start tomorrow morning
dialog: and try to enjoy each others' company
dialog: here in this beautiful place. B.) We'll
dialog: stop feeling sorry for ourselves. It's
dialog: not very attractive. C.) We'll make our
dialog: plans for the future. Can we agree to
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: To be continued.
text: Patricia kisses Francis, Peter, and Jack again. She walks to
text: the door, ties the white scarf over her head, goes out, and
text: closes the door behind her. Francis, Peter, and Jack look at
text: each other. They switch off the light and get back into their
dialog: beds.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST QUARTERS. DAY 71
text: The next morning. Francis and Peter are asleep. Jack sits in
text: an open window seat writing furiously in his manila note
text: book. He still wears his white pajamas. There is a tray of
text: sliced mango, scrambled eggs, corn flakes, porridge, orange
text: juice, and instant coffee on the table behind him. Francis
text: sits up slowly on the edge of his bed. He stretches his arms
text: and yawns. He says groggily:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Good morning.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

text: Jack drinks a sip of coffee and answers without looking up
dialog: from his writing:
speaker_heading: JACK
text: She's gone.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: What?
text: Jack finishes a paragraph, caps his pen, and closes his note
text: book. He goes over to Peter's bed and sits on the edge of it,
text: across from Francis.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was still asleep, but Oberoi saw her
dialog: go. She left our breakfast in the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: (kicking Peter's bunk)
dialog: Peter.
text: Jack pats Peter's legs to wake him. Peter sighs and rubs his
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
text: She's gone.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who?
text: Peter sits up in bed. He looks at Francis and Jack. He says
dialog: sadly:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: She's gone?
text: Jack nods. Peter sighs.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They couldn't say. They just said she
dialog: goes away sometimes.
text: Silence. Francis, Peter, and Jack go over to the table and
text: sit down. They start eating their breakfast. Francis stops. A
text: light snaps on in his eyes. He stands quickly, knocking away

text: his chair, and strides across the room. He opens his
text: briefcase and takes out the manila envelope. He reaches into
text: it and withdraws the leftover peacock feather. He looks to
text: Peter and Jack.
text: Peter and Jack nod. They follow Francis out the door, through
text: a small kitchen, onto the grounds. They go down a path along
text: the edge of the cliff, past the bell, and stop on a wide,
text: grassy plateau. A curtain of mist hangs over the hillside. A
text: river runs slowly into the distance far, far below.
text: Francis slowly extends the feather out in front of him. Jack
text: looks hopeful. Peter's eyes narrow defiantly. Francis takes a
text: deep breath, determined. They lean slowly toward the feather
text: and blow on it all at once. They kneel down together, dig a
text: hole in the ground with their hands, and bury the feather.
text: They stand up. They each perform a different, improvised
text: ritualistic gesture. They look off, beyond the edge of the
text: cliff. They look slightly electrified. Francis says gently:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: That went perfectly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO: 72
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack racing along a winding hillside road
text: seated three abreast in the back of an auto-rickshaw. Francis
text: checks his watch.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm working on a new short story. I wrote
dialog: the ending, but I don't know how it
text: starts.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Read us what you got.
text: Jack reaches into his pocket and takes out his note book. He
text: opens it and reads:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Whatever happens in the end, she said, I
dialog: don't want to lose you as my friend. He
dialog: looked into her eyes. I promise I will
dialog: never be your friend, no matter what,
dialog: ever. Her voice cracked. If we fuck, I'm
dialog: going to feel like shit tomorrow. That's
dialog: OK with me, he said. He lifted her shirt
dialog: over her head. I love you, she said. I
dialog: never hurt you on purpose. He nodded. I
dialog: don't care.
dialog: (looking up to Francis and Peter)
dialog: He would not be going to Italy.

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Does that sound OK?
text: Francis nods, considering this.

dialog: Yeah. It's hard for me to judge the
text: ending without knowing the rest of it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I like how mean you are.

dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. DEPOT. DAY 73
text: A train station on the edge of a small town in the mountains.
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack run through the terminal carrying
text: their suitcases accompanied by two porters in red turbans
text: pulling the rest of their luggage on a cart. They race out
text: onto the platform.
scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM. DAY 74
text: Bells are ringing. Wheels are clacking. Smoke is blowing. The
text: train is already pulling out, and Francis, Peter, Jack, and
text: the two porters run alongside the tracks behind it. A
text: teenager with wavy hair and a trumpet at his side watches
text: calmly from a deck at the rear of the caboose. A sign above
text: his head reads The Bengal Lancer with a picture of a leaping
text: tiger below it.
text: Francis', Peter's, Jack's, and the two porters' shoes slap
text: along the cement. They start gaining on the train. The train
text: picks up speed. The porters grit their teeth. Francis eggs
text: them on. They begin to lose ground. Francis turns to Peter
text: and Jack and yells over the sound of the engine’s whistle:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Dad's bags aren't going to make it!
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack exchange a quick look. They laugh
text: spontaneously. They drop their hand-baggage, sprint ahead,
text: run full-steam to the back of the train, and leap on-board.

text: They turn to look back at the porters, who are slowing down
text: with puzzled looks on their faces. They get smaller and
text: smaller as the train pulls away. Francis, Peter, and Jack
text: watch them sadly. They go into the train.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. DAY 75
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack walk quickly through two cars and
text: enter a third. Francis pulls three tickets out of his coat
text: pocket and checks the numbers next to each compartment door
text: as they go down the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. COMPARTMENT 62/63. DAY 76
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack sit looking out the window. There is
text: a knock on the door. Francis slides it open. A thirty-year-
text: old man with a beard stands in the corridor with a hole-
text: puncher in his hand. He wears a pink silk turban and a Nehru
text: jacket with Chief Steward embroidered onto it.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD #2
dialog: Good morning. Whitman?
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack nod.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD #2
dialog: May I see your tickets, please?
text: Francis takes out their tickets. The chief steward clicks
text: them with the hole puncher and snaps them into a clip above
text: the door.
speaker_heading: CHIEF STEWARD
dialog: Welcome aboard.
text: The chief steward goes out the door, and a twenty-five year-
text: old girl in a pale pink, silk sari-uniform comes in with a
text: tray of pale green drinks in little cups. She has a nose-ring
text: and her hair in a braid. She smiles and says:
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Sweet lime?
text: Francis, Peter, and Jack stare at the stewardess. Jack says
dialog: quietly:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why not?
text: The stewardess sets three cups of juice onto the table. She
text: dips her fingertip into a little, metal bowl of yellow powder
text: and presses it carefully onto Francis', Peter's, and Jack's
text: foreheads. She goes back into the corridor. She smiles. She
text: shuts the door.

dialog: finally:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why don't you hang onto mine?
text: Francis hesitates. Jack says gently:

dialog: It's safer if you keep them.

dialog: Let’s go get a drink and smoke a

text: Francis, Peter, and Jack stand up. Jack slides the door open.
