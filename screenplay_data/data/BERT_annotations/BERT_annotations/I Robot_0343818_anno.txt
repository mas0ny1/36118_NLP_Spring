speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1 On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS. 1
text: A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
text: Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...
text: A SOUND. Something SHATTERING...
text: Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out
dialog: What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we
dialog: finally. Understand...
speaker_heading: DISEMBODIED VOICE
dialog: You are in danger...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 2 INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON 2
text: DEL SPOONER'S FACE. His eyes, snapping open. His face,
text: covered in sweat.
text: PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
text: his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
dialog: cheerful.
text: Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
text: ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
text: couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.
dialog: You are in danger...
text: He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
text: apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
text: someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.
scene_heading: 3 INT. SHOWER - MORNING 3
text: Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.
scene_heading: 4 INT. BATHROOM - MORNING 4
text: Shaves with a razor. Using his left hand. Knicks the cleft
text: of his chin. Shit.
scene_heading: 5 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 5
text: Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan. Waiting for it
dialog: to boil.
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: 6 INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 6
text: Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his
text: neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches
text: for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...
scene_heading: 7 EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING 7
text: ...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
text: elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.
text: Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
text: shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
text: turns and sees...
text: A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
text: obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
text: hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
text: with a muted WHIR...
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: (metallic voice)
dialog: Good day, sir...
text: Spooner. Speeds up his pace. Weaving through the crowd to
dialog: lose the robot.
text: We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
text: buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
text: PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
text: portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:
text: Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
dialog: cleaning windows.
text: A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
text: repairs the street. No human supervision.
text: A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
text: Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...
text: Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
text: Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
dialog: Briefcases.
text: Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO: III LAWS SAFE.
text: Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
text: Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
text: neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Hi.
text: But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER. The
text: robot turns. Looks at the girl.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: You are not allowed to talk to
dialog: strangers.
text: Spooner, disgusted. Has had enough. He steps off the curb
dialog: Just as...
text: THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around. Training its large
dialog: digital EYE on him:
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC LIGHT
dialog: Please return to the sidewalk.
text: Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC LIGHT
dialog: Please return to the sidewalk...
text: The traffic signal, tracking him.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC LIGHT
dialog: You are in violation of city
dialog: ordinance 14-B726...
text: Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
text: SNAP! It takes his picture.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 8 EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING 8
text: Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks
text: down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the
scene_heading: Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
text: A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his
text: back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...
scene_heading: 9 EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS 9
text: The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying
text: OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings
text: wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel
dialog: shields.
text: As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
text: disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
text: The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING 10
text: Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
text: Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the
text: original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.
scene_heading: 11 INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING 11
text: A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
text: of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN
text: with real time video of various streets and buildings.
text: Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.
text: A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
dialog: Several electronic messages say the same thing:
dialog: SEE ME!
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN (O.S.)
dialog: Ever heard the phrase "lead by
dialog: example?"
text: Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of
text: his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner
dialog: giving that traffic signal the finger.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Doesn't ring a bell.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: (pointing to Spooner's
dialog: badge)
dialog: It's on your badge.
text: Spooner takes the citation. Drops it into a drawer filled
text: with about fifty others.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: The traffic division filed an
dialog: official complaint this morning.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
text: The traffic division is a machine.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Look, I know there's going to be an
dialog: adjustment period, Del...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I'll send them a letter of apology.
dialog: Maybe some flowers. A box of
dialog: chocolates...
dialog: 5.
text: JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS. He throws Bergin a look.
text: Then snatches up the receiver.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Spooner, homicide.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 12 EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY 12
text: A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
text: blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
speaker_heading: ROBOTS.
scene_heading: 13 INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY 13
text: An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a
text: featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a
text: set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other
text: suddenly OPENS.
scene_heading: 14 INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 14
text: A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold
text: metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a
text: long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.
dialog: Old-fashioned suit.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Hello, there. Please come in.
text: Spooner hesitates.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: It's alright. You can sit. Sit.
text: Spooner doesn't. Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts
text: up a coffee pot. Pours some coffee into a single cup.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (interested)
dialog: You're offering me a cup of coffee?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Yes. But you are to say, "No,
dialog: thank you."
text: Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his
text: lips, but doesn't take a sip.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: No. Thank you.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: As you wish.
text: The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no
text: movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
dialog: pot.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You want to tell me something about
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?
text: The Old Man smiles.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: I want to tell you that his death
dialog: was not a suicide.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And why do you say that?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Why? Because I want you to know
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I understand that. But what
dialog: specifically leads you to believe
dialog: that he didn't commit suicide?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (considers)
dialog: Nothing specifically.
text: Spooner shifts his weight. Agitated.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Under normal circumstances that
dialog: wouldn't be enough to get you a
dialog: homicide investigation.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: But this is not "normal
dialog: circumstances," is it, Detective
dialog: Spooner?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: No. It isn't.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Then you will find out who killed
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you
dialog: will tell me.
text: Spooner's losing his patience.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll
dialog: find out. And you'll be the first
dialog: to know.....
text: JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst
text: of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the
text: conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in
text: front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.
scene_heading: 15 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 15
text: Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT
speaker_heading: ROBOT.
speaker_heading: ESCORT ROBOT
dialog: Please follow me.
text: Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it. Passes another
text: doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it. Catches a brief
dialog: glimpse of...
scene_heading: DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.
text: Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE
text: TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then
text: continues on.
scene_heading: 16 INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY 16
text: Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open
text: automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
text: looking out over the entire complex.
text: Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing
text: behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a
dialog: conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically
dialog: feel the brains and ambition.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Usually I ask who's in charge...
text: Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the
text: table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON,
dialog: founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: But everyone knows you, Dr.
dialog: Robertson.
text: Robertson smiles. Pretends to instruct his people.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: Remind me to cut back on my talk
dialog: show appearances.
speaker_heading: LAUGHTER.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: Welcome to U.S. Robotics,
dialog: Detective. I regret you're not
dialog: visiting us under more pleasant
dialog: circumstances. Allow me to
dialog: introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of
dialog: Legal Affairs.
text: A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall. Nods
dialog: hello.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: And the gentleman to my right is
dialog: Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of
dialog: Research.
text: Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie. Nods.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: They'll be available to answer any
dialog: questions you might have during
dialog: your investigation. You'll
dialog: understand how anxious we are to
dialog: resolve this matter -- especially
text: before the press gets wind of it.
dialog: There are some anti-robot
dialog: sentiments out there as you know,
dialog: Detective, and we're not eager to
dialog: stir them up. So. Where would you
dialog: like to begin?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: We can begin with whether or not
text: the old man put a gun to his head
text: and pulled the trigger.
text: A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.
speaker_heading: ARONSON
dialog: You don't have to answer that, Dr.
dialog: Robertson...
dialog: 9.
text: Robertson waves him off.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: Susan? Perhaps you can assist us
dialog: here?
text: Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.
text: Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN
text: CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone
dialog: but Spooner.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid
dialog: personality who generally eschewed
dialog: social relationships. Rejecting
dialog: people in favor of solitary
dialog: activities involving machines. He
dialog: spent almost all his time at the
text: lab here or at his lab at home. As
dialog: a result he was highly susceptible
dialog: to depression.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: Dr. Calvin is our Chief
dialog: Psychologist.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: If that was your diagnosis, why
dialog: didn't you see this coming?
text: Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye. As if the
dialog: answer's obvious.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
dialog: Seventy-five percent of our
dialog: employees fit that description.
speaker_heading: LANNING
dialog: (interceding)
dialog: You'll have to excuse the doctor.
dialog: We're all a little on edge. This
dialog: has been a difficult and emotional
dialog: morning.
text: Spooner throws a look around the room. Then back at Calvin.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Yeah. I can see you're all broken
dialog: up.
text: Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from
dialog: the very beginnings of this
dialog: company. We developed the "Three
dialog: Laws of Robotics" together. But
dialog: these days science is a young man's
dialog: game. By the time you hit thirty
dialog: your best years are behind you.
text: Some of us are kicked upstairs.
dialog: Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.
text: Robertson stands. Meeting over.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
text: Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.
dialog: I trust you will come to the same
text: swift conclusion, Detective. Dr.
dialog: Lanning will make himself available
dialog: if you have any further questions.
text: Spooner looks over at Calvin.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I want her to help me.
text: Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: That's not really my department...
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: Susan would be happy to assist you.
text: And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People
text: start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin.
text: The last one to get up.
scene_heading: 17 INT. METAL HALLWAY - DAY 17
text: Spooner and Calvin, heading down the same hallway he was in
text: before. Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Ah, Christ...Toasters...
text: As they duck under the police tape and...
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: 18 INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY 18
text: ...enter Hogenmiller's lab. Alive with activity. CRIME
scene_heading: SCENE TECHNICIANS, MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS. LIGHT SCANS,
dialog: running across...
text: HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE. Black gun powder. Fanning out
text: around his contorted lips.
text: Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere.
scene_heading: Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the
text: ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by...
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: They say the price's gonna come
dialog: down a lot next year. Kinda cool,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: How cool will it be when one takes
dialog: your job?
text: Spooner. Pushing past him. His eyes. Darting around.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Is everything alright, Detective?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Yeah. This is just how I like my
dialog: robots -- in pieces.
text: As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE
text: INVESTIGATOR, BALDEZ, gets up to meet them.
speaker_heading: BALDEZ
dialog: (to Spooner)
dialog: Can you believe it, man? U.S.
dialog: Robotics. I didn't think I'd ever
dialog: see the inside of this building.
text: Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard. Spooner signs it,
text: awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What's the run-down?
speaker_heading: BALDEZ
dialog: Heinrich Hogenmiller, sixty-four
dialog: years old. Weapon a small caliber
text: .22, registered in his name. Looks
text: like he walked in, locked the door,
dialog: and snuffed himself.
dialog: 12.
text: Spooner. Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I know someone who disagrees with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BALDEZ
dialog: Who?
text: Spooner. Stands. Pointing down at Hogenmiller.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Him.
text: And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.
text: Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I spoke to a dead man today. Want
dialog: to tell me about that?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
text: Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his
dialog: appointments. Attended staff
dialog: meetings. He hated corporate life.
dialog: The hologram enabled him to focus
dialog: on his work. It's just a device,
dialog: Detective.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
text: A device that called the police.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: The sound of the gunshot would've
dialog: triggered a 911.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: But the call came directly to me.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: We're talking about a mechanism
dialog: designed by Hogenmiller to say
dialog: provocative things. To irritate
dialog: and confound his colleagues.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And that's what you think it is?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I'm sorry, but this whole
dialog: investigation is the result of a
dialog: dead man's toy messing with your
dialog: head.
dialog: 13.
text: They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls
text: his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: When's the last time any of you
dialog: actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I
dialog: mean human to human?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I couldn't say.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Take a guess.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I don't guess, Detective. But if
dialog: pressed, I would reason it had been
text: a considerable length of time.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: How well did you know him?
text: Calvin. Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had
dialog: been.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Not well. But I admired his work
dialog: tremendously.
text: Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the
text: body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I get the whole "mad scientist"
dialog: thing. Hogenmiller was past his
dialog: prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He
text: enters a room. Locks the door and
text: is found minutes later with a
text: bullet fired through his mouth into
dialog: his brain. Everything about this
dialog: case says suicide.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You don't sound convinced.
text: The coroners. Start loading the body into the box.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Even people who live a life of
dialog: logic and precision rarely arrange
dialog: their deaths so perfectly.
dialog: (turning to her)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SPOONER (cont'd)
dialog: What all this is missing -- is
dialog: personality...
text: As he starts for the door...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You have 24 hour surveillance?...
scene_heading: 19 INT. METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 19
text: ...They head out into the hallway. A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD
text: rolling into place behind them.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: It's company policy.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I want to see the tapes.
text: Calvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how
dialog: she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Victor!
text: At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT
text: CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two
text: small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth
text: expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Detective, meet Victor. Our
dialog: building's supercomputer. He's the
dialog: checks and balances of U.S.R.
dialog: (to Victor)
text: Victor, Detective Spooner's heading
dialog: up the investigation into the death
dialog: of Dr. Hogenmiller.
text: Victor smiles big. Spooner, furrows his brow.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You look like a very...happy
dialog: computer.
text: Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE:
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Thank you. That's very kind.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: The Detective needs to see our
dialog: security tapes.
dialog: 15.
text: The elevator doors immediately OPEN. They step inside.
scene_heading: 20 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 20
text: Spooner and Calvin descend. Victor floats on the wall and
text: smiles wide. Spooner looks back at it. With a frown.
text: The elevator stops, the doors open. A ROBOT steps on.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Good day, Dr. Calvin. Good day,
dialog: sir.
text: Spooner's jaw. Clenches. Staring at the Robot. It senses
text: the stare. Turns back to him.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: May I be of service to you, sir?
text: Spooner. Breaks the stare. Ignoring the Robot. Calvin.
text: Looks over at him.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Aren't you going to answer him?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I don't talk to my refrigerator,
dialog: either.
text: Calvin folds her arms.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I get the distinct feeling you're
dialog: one of those people, Detective.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What people?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Those who don't appreciate the work
dialog: we do here at U.S.R.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You people do what you do. Then
dialog: it's up to the rest of us to make
dialog: sense out of the world we wake up
dialog: in.
text: As the elevator doors open on to...
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: 21 INT. ATRIUM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 21
text: A soaring lobby. The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a
text: ROBOT, arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vinci's Study
text: of Man. Robot workers more numerous than humans. They are
text: sleeker. Finer. More advanced than those in the outside
dialog: world.
text: Calvin and Spooner head across.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: When this company started we were
dialog: manufacturing three robots a week.
dialog: Now look at us. Today's children
dialog: will never know a world without
dialog: robots.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
text: The streets are filled with
dialog: unemployed humans who aren't
dialog: exactly thrilled with that idea.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Our robotic systems maintain
dialog: factory inventories, regulate
dialog: street traffic -- even run the
dialog: family home.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Leaving people to do what, Doctor?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Leaving people to engage in higher
dialog: pursuits that make life worth
dialog: living.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And what happens when something
dialog: goes wrong?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Our system's never wrong.
text: As they walk through the crowd, we hear the quiet WHIR of
text: robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass.
scene_heading: 22 INT. MAINFRAME - DAY 22
text: Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of U.S. Robotics.
text: This is the nerve center of the whole operation. Walls lined
text: with COMPUTERS, SCREENS, and thousands of CONTROLS.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
text: This is Victor's home.
text: VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive-
dialog: like components.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I will now play you the last thirty-
text: two seconds of Dr. Hogenmiller's
dialog: life.
text: AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR
text: HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless
text: ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face
dialog: composed but tight.
text: Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him. Hogenmiller
text: steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.
text: Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin
text: jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on
dialog: the corridor.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Where's the tape from inside?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller did not permit
text: cameras to observe him while
dialog: working.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: That was only within the last year.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: So we can throw paranoia into the
dialog: mix.
dialog: (to Victor)
dialog: Fast-forward.
scene_heading: A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD. POLICE OFFICERS
text: appear and force open the doors. Now TECHNICIANS appear
text: and rush through in a blur...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Um. I hate to be a stickler...
text: On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: But don't killers usually have to
text: enter and exit the scene of a
dialog: crime?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Stop the recording.
text: Spooner turns away from the footage. Stares at Calvin.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: They do, Doctor. Unless they've
dialog: always been there -- and never
dialog: left.
text: Calvin looks at him. Trying to understand.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You think the murderer was in the
dialog: lab the entire time?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: If I'm right, it's still there...
text: Spooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the
text: exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab
dialog: door.

scene_heading: 23 INT. METAL CORRIDOR - DAY 23
text: The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG. The
text: laboratory doors slide open.
scene_heading: 24 INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY 24
text: Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police
text: and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs.
text: Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal.
text: The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into
text: his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: A robot cannot harm a human being,
dialog: Detective. The First Law of
dialog: Robotics forbids it. And we hard-
dialog: wire the Three Laws into every
dialog: model. Without exception.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Yeah, I saw the commercial.
text: Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting.
text: To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a
text: METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life.
dialog: 19.
text: Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the
text: corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And if a robot was given a direct
dialog: order to kill?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: The Second Law of Robotics would
dialog: prevent it. A robot must obey an
dialog: order only if it does not conflict
dialog: with the first law.
text: Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs.
text: Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
text: But a robot can defend itself.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Only when that action doesn't
dialog: conflict with the First or Second
dialog: Laws. This is the Third Law of
dialog: Robotics.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Yeah, well, you know what they say
dialog: -- Laws are made to be broken.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Not these laws.
text: Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe. Calvin,
dialog: growing impatient...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You're not hearing me, Detective.
dialog: There's nothing here...
speaker_heading: WHEN SUDDENLY
text: The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A
text: ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!...
text: Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the
dialog: floor...right to...
speaker_heading: CALVIN'S FEET.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Dr. Calvin!
text: Calvin. Stunned. Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his
text: ILLUMINATED EYES. Right on her. She steps forward...
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Goddammit! Stay back!
text: Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun. Calvin. Reaching out
dialog: towards the Robot...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Calm down, Detective. There is no
dialog: danger here...
text: Spooner. Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (to Robot)
dialog: De-Activate.
text: And the Robot. Suddenly FREEZES.
text: Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet. Training the
text: gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: How did you know it was under
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: If I was metal and didn't want
dialog: anyone to find me, I'd hide under a
text: pile of junk.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: This Robot wasn't hiding. What
dialog: you're looking at is the result of
dialog: clever programming. The illusion
dialog: of self-interest and free will.
dialog: Nothing more.
text: Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.
text: Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...
text: ...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's
text: gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...
text: right back at him...
dialog: CLOSE ON Calvin. Cannot believe this is happening...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I said De-Activate!
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Move away from the door, Doctor.
text: Calvin's voice. Cracking from desperation. Confusion.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Commence emergency shut-down!
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Now!
text: Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of
text: SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from
dialog: the door...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I...I gave you an order...
text: The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.
text: Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He
text: touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot
text: steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the
text: doors begin to shut...
text: Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN. From an
text: ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: This is impossible. A robot...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: ...can't do that. Yeah, yeah, I
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: My God -- did you see how it moved?
dialog: I've never seen an NS-2 move that
dialog: way...
text: Starts running for the door.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Wait! Please, you can't destroy
dialog: it. We have to study it...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: That thing took my gun. You'll be
dialog: lucky if you get a handful of bolts
dialog: back!
dialog: SLAMS the wall panel and...
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: 25 INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 25
text: ...sprints out into the hallway. The Robot Suspect. About
dialog: to turn to corner...
text: VICTOR. Suddenly appearing.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
text: The suspect is nearing the end of
text: the hallway, Detective.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Gee, thanks.
text: Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the
text: LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...
text: CALVIN. Races out into the hallway.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Get back to the lab!
text: She heads for the Robot.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (to Robot)
dialog: You're malfunctioning. Let me help
dialog: you!
text: The Robot turns. To look at her. GUN pointing to the floor.
text: Spooner. FOCUSING in on his HAND. AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...
text: And he DIVES for Calvin. Forcing her to the floor as the
text: Robot FIRES. Again and again. Bullets. RICOCHETTING around
text: them. SPARKING against the walls...
text: The ELEVATOR opens. The Robot, leaping inside.
text: Spooner. On top of Calvin. Looks down at her. Her HANDS.
text: Clutching his coat. Trembling.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: That was a pretty convincing
dialog: illusion of getting shot at.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 26 INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 26
text: The ROBOT SUSPECT standing inside the elevator. Looks down
text: at the bullet hole blown through its leg. Reaches down.
text: Metal fingers touching the damage. As if curious. Afraid.
dialog: 23.
text: Looks back at the other ROBOT. Standing in the back of
text: elevator. A primitive model. No reaction. Face, blank.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 27 INT. METAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 27
text: Spooner springing to his feet. Helping Calvin up.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I took the liberty of alerting

speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Where's that elevator going?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sub Level 5.
text: Spooner SLAMS against a nearby DOOR. Hurtling down the

scene_heading: 28 INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 28
text: A PHALANX of SECURITY PERSONNEL. Crossing the lobby.
scene_heading: PIERCING ALARM BELLS, RINGING...
scene_heading: 29 INT. ANOTHER METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 29
text: More SECURITY PERSONNEL. Pouring into a HALLWAY...
scene_heading: 30 INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS 30
text: Spooner and Calvin. Racing down the stairs. Victor's face
dialog: meeting them at every landing.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I have directed a security team to

dialog: errant robot...
text: Spooner. Whipping past him. Calvin. Barely keeping up.
dialog: Not used to this much activity.
text: Spooner. BURSTS through a door and out into...
scene_heading: 31 INT. SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL 5 - CONTINUOUS 31
text: ...Subterranean Level 5. A labyrinth of metal and concrete.
text: IN THE DISTANCE. A troupe of SECURITY PERSONNEL swarms

dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
text: The suspect is about to be
text: apprehended, Detective.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I'll believe it when I see it.
text: Spooner. Cocking his gun. A soft DING! Announcing the
text: elevator car's arrival.
text: SECURITY, all crouching down in unison. Weapons brought
dialog: round to position.
text: Spooner. Weaving through them. Gun pointed at the metal
dialog: doors as...
text: WHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing
text: under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security
dialog: takes aim and...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Wait!
text: Spooner pushes past them to the Robot. Looks down at its
text: leg. UNSCATHED.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: This is not the same robot!
text: Looking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as
text: Calvin steps forward to question the robot.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (to Robot)
dialog: What happened to the robot that
dialog: ordered you to hold this firearm?
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR ROBOT
dialog: This unit is not programmed to obey
text: an order given by a robot...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: But who gave you this gun?
text: SPOONER. Running towards the exit. Hears the answer.
text: Echoing behind him...
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR ROBOT
text: A metal man.
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: 32 EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DAY 32
text: BAM! He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics.
text: Squinting into the light. Then PLUNGING into the crowd...
text: HUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from
text: behind. Spooner running. Through the sea of MAN and
text: MACHINE. When someone. Starts to SCREAM. At the sight of
text: his GUN. The crowd begins SCATTERING. Chaos. Spooner
text: stops. Near a fountain. Turning 360. Looking everywhere...
dialog: The Robot. Gone.
speaker_heading: SPOONER (V.O.)
dialog: ...I want a homicide unit on every
dialog: street, sidewalk, alley...
scene_heading: 33 INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY 33
text: Spooner, standing in front of an assemblage of COPS. Behind
text: him, an image of the Robot Suspect plays on the screen...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage
dialog: yard, anywhere it could hide.
text: Behind him, flashing images of the city STREETS and DUMPS...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
text: It's got a bullet hole above the
dialog: right knee, so be on the look-out
dialog: for any malfunctioning NS-2...
text: Lieutenant Bergin enters the back of the room. Next to him,
text: ASSISTANT D.A. TOLLER. Not looking happy.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Check out all retail outlets and
dialog: repair shops, especially the
dialog: underground ones...
text: The screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various
text: dubious SHOP FRONTS...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I don't care who you have to get
dialog: past to get this done. Just get it
dialog: done.
text: The Cops, begin dispersing. As Bergin catches Spooner's eye.
text: Spooner, not pleased to see Toller. Heads over...
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: Looking like shit, Spooner.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Well I'm not the one always giving
dialog: Press Conferences...
text: Bergin puts a hand on Spooner's arm. Knows he's not going to
dialog: like this.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Del, we're going to have to
dialog: reclassify the search. D.A.'s
dialog: office is seeing this NS-2 as
dialog: "missing evidence" -- not a
dialog: homicide suspect.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: Homicide is the murder of a human
text: being by another human being.
dialog: Therefore, a robot cannot be
dialog: charged with "homicide."
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: This isn't just any robot...
speaker_heading: TOLLER
text: It's malfunctioning.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: It killed someone. That
dialog: registering with you?
text: Spooner. Shakes off Bergin's arm. Eyeballs Toller.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: How many shares of U.S.R. you
dialog: holding in your portfolio, Toller?
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: This is a public safety issue.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: That's convenient.
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: You have any idea what would happen
dialog: to this city if we went running
dialog: around screaming "killer robot?"
text: It would collapse in on itself.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: TOLLER (cont'd)
dialog: Wide-spread panic. Until that NS-
dialog: 2's found we're cooperating with
dialog: U.S. Robotics and keeping this
dialog: investigation under wraps.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Maybe this isn't the case for you,
dialog: Del.
text: Incensed, Spooner replies a little louder than he intended.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I'm fine!
text: Rakes his hand through his hair. Turns to see the other
text: COPS, looking over at him. Toller smirks. Looks to Bergin.
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: I want updated reports every half
dialog: hour.
text: Heads off. Spooner. Watching him.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: This is it, you know. From now on
dialog: we're going to miss the good old
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Good old days?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: When people were killed by other
dialog: people.
scene_heading: 34 INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CITY STREET - DUSK 34
text: Spooner. Rolling along in his car. Eyes, bloodshot.
text: Peering out the window:
text: An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags, following its
text: owner down the sidewalk...
text: Another ROBOT, opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS...
text: A couple HAULING ROBOTS, loading heavy boxes onto the back of
dialog: a truck...
text: Spooner. Rubs his eyes. Turns a corner and spots:
text: A ROBOT REPAIR SHOP.
dialog: 28.
text: The latest models in the window. Shiny. Streamlined.
text: Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the
dialog: service entrance.
text: He stops the car.
scene_heading: 35 INT. TAXI (MOVING) - ESTATE STREETS - NIGHT 35
text: Calvin riding in the back of a DRIVERLESS taxi cab. Staring
text: out the window, lost in thought. The cab pulls up to a curb.
speaker_heading: TAXI VOICE
dialog: We have arrived at your
dialog: destination.
text: Calvin. Takes a beat. Then swipes her card.
scene_heading: 36 EXT. CALVIN'S CONDO ESTATE - NIGHT 36
text: Elegant condos set on prime real estate. Calvin heads down a
text: tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance.
speaker_heading: SPOONER (O.S.)
dialog: One of my bullets hit your robot...
text: Startled. She drops her key card. As Spooner steps out from
text: behind a tree. The tail of his coat, whipping in the wind.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Detective!...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And I think it's smart enough to
dialog: repair itself -- don't you?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (studying him)
dialog: Yes. I think so.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Any repair shop...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: No. It's always the owner who
text: brings the robot in for repair.
dialog: Where would a robot without an
dialog: owner go?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I'm not sure what you're getting
dialog: at.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (stepping closer)
dialog: Does U.S. Robotics have a factory
dialog: in the city limits?
text: Calvin. Tucking her hair behind her ears.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: The locations of our factories are
dialog: classified.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I don't care.
text: Calvin. Looks up at him. A Mexican stand-off.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I have several conditions if I show
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I expected that.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: First. I want it brought in
text: unharmed.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (doesn't like it, but)
dialog: Agreed.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Second. I want to talk to it,
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Too dangerous.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: This model violated the Three Laws.
dialog: It also moved and reacted
dialog: differently than any robot I've
dialog: ever seen. There must be some sort
dialog: of logical explanation. I want to
dialog: find out what that is. No police.
dialog: No prosecutors. No you. Just me
dialog: and the robot.
text: Spooner, looks down at this small woman. Narrows his eyes.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: When they told me you were a
dialog: psychologist, that wasn't the whole
dialog: truth, was it?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I never said I treated human
dialog: beings.
scene_heading: 37 INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT 37
text: Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-
text: lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS
text: stretches forever in either direction.
text: A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with
text: TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to
text: manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: That should be outlawed once and
dialog: for all.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: That'll be the day I stop driving.
text: Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.
text: Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I can recommend a behavior
dialog: modification program, you know --
dialog: if you want to overcome your robo-
dialog: phobia.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I'm not afraid of robots. I just
dialog: don't like them.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Why? Because they make every
dialog: aspect of our lives more
dialog: convenient?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Exactly. They do our dirty work.
dialog: Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets
dialog: pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody
dialog: can do someone else's dirty work
dialog: without coming to hate them. I
dialog: don't want to be around when your
dialog: robots decide they've taken their
dialog: last order.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: That day will never come,
dialog: Detective. Robots aren't like
dialog: human beings -- they don't question
dialog: their existence.
text: Spooner cranks the gear shift. Throwing her a look.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Spoken like a true robo-phile.
scene_heading: 38 EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT 38
text: The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
text: Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade
text: of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too
text: high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.
scene_heading: 39 EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT 39
text: Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R.
text: ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly,
text: the gate begins to open.
scene_heading: 40 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 40
text: A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway. Shaking his head.
speaker_heading: NIGHT FOREMAN
dialog: Head-Office already ordered a
dialog: system-wide inventory check. Don't
dialog: know about a missing NS-2...
text: Looks back at Spooner.
speaker_heading: NIGHT FOREMAN
dialog: What'd you say you did?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Research and Development.
text: As Spooner pushes past him into...
scene_heading: 41 INT. CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS 41
text: ...the Control Booth. Overlooking the pristine Factory
text: Floor. The Foreman starts working the controls of a central
dialog: computer.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: All Nestors accounted for?
dialog: 32.
text: The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES.
speaker_heading: NIGHT FOREMAN
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: As you can see, all properly
dialog: catalogued. Your robot just isn't
dialog: here.
text: Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't
text: there. She looks around. Then sees the Foreman reacting.
text: Looks out the window at...
text: SPOONER. Walking out onto the factory floor.
scene_heading: 42 INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT 42
text: Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT. Lined with NS-
text: 2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.
text: Calvin and the Foreman. Catching up. Over the noise:
speaker_heading: NIGHT FOREMAN
dialog: Like I said, sir -- we have one
dialog: hundred fully assembled NS-2s
dialog: housed here. That's our capacity.
dialog: Last week we had one hundred.
dialog: Yesterday we had one hundred --
text: Spooner, slowing. Finally spotting what he was looking for.
dialog: Points at:
text: A GAP. On the assembly belt. ONE LEG MISSING.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Well today you have one-hundred and
dialog: one.
scene_heading: 43 INT. FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT 43
text: A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight
text: formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The
text: sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as
text: 101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.
text: Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all
text: look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (to Calvin)
dialog: You're the robot shrink.
text: The Robots stand motionless. A strange tableau. Calvin.
text: Takes a step forward.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: There is a robot in this formation
dialog: that does not belong. Identify it.
text: 101 robots answer in unison. Their mechanical VOICES
dialog: resounding:
speaker_heading: 101 ROBOTS
dialog: ONE OF US.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: 101 ROBOTS
dialog: ONE OF US.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: That is not a satisfactory answer!
speaker_heading: 101 ROBOTS
dialog: ONE OF US.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: That's helpful.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I could always interview each one
dialog: individually and cross-reference
dialog: their responses to detect any
dialog: anomalies.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: How long would that take?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: About three weeks.
text: They share a look. Clearly not an option. Then. Calvin.
text: Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Or...
text: ...and GRABS his GUN from his holster. He jumps back.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: We have one hundred robots here
dialog: that cannot allow a human being to
dialog: come to harm...
text: Their eyes lock. Spooner, getting what she's doing.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And one that can.
text: She raises the gun to Spooner's head. Hand, unsteady.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Am I holding this right?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: More or less.
text: Calvin. Swallows. Looks over at the robots. Then COCKS the
dialog: gun...
text: AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of
text: linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.
text: Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...
text: When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in
text: unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.
text: Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.
text: Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.
text: Spooner. Has had enough. Takes the gun back from Calvin...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Enough game-playing.
text: ...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot. Its
text: body crumples to the ground.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Guess that wasn't it.
text: Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did. Rushes over to the
dialog: destroyed Robot.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: What are you doing?!
text: Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: This is a self-preservation field
dialog: test! DO NOT attempt to save
dialog: yourselves. Any of you. That's an
dialog: order!
text: FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the
dialog: P.A.:
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: NIGHT FOREMAN
dialog: Are you crazy? Those are eight
dialog: hundred thousand dollar machines!
text: Spooner randomly stops at another Robot. Raises his gun.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You hear that? You're worth more
dialog: than I'll make in my entire life...
text: His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly
text: grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You can't just destroy them!
text: Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something
text: catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost.
dialog: Imperceptible.
text: He jerks his head. Locking eyes with a ROBOT. A couple feet
dialog: away. It's him!
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Gotcha.
text: The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING
text: of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he
text: swings himself up...
text: Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the
text: Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with
dialog: a terrific CRASH...
scene_heading: 44 INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT 44
text: Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding
text: under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The
text: door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.
text: Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin.
text: Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You don't know what's going to
dialog: happen in there.
text: As if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around
text: the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into...
dialog: 36.
scene_heading: 45 INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 45
text: ...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a
text: great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes
text: holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening
text: ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes
text: METAL BODIES...
text: Spooner. Motioning Calvin to stay behind him. As they
text: descend. Into the cavernous room.
text: And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them.
text: Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat
text: from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself...
text: When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of
text: ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them
dialog: off from one another...
text: Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of
text: the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart.
text: Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...
text: He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down.
text: Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line.
text: Appears before him...
text: Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.
text: It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere
text: he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...
text: He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against
text: it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid.
text: Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At
text: his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...
text: WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar.
text: SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.
text: Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the
text: line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it.
text: Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...
text: Then turns. Disappearing.
text: Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles
text: to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears
text: a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the
text: Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With
text: his metal fists...
text: Spooner's view. Blocked once again. By a shifting row.
text: When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder. He wheels round.
dialog: 37.
text: To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm. And forces them
dialog: through a line...
text: EMERGING into the open. The ROBOT. Still pounding.
text: Desperate. Like a trapped animal...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Now what do we do?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I've already done it.
text: And suddenly, the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES...
scene_heading: 46 EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - CONTINUOUS 46
text: The Robot Suspect takes its chance. Runs full out. STOPS.
text: Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.
text: UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the
text: Robot. FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.
text: The Robot turns to Spooner. Extends its hands. Palms out.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: WHAT AM I?
text: Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED
text: NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a
text: second net covers him. Then a THIRD...
text: ...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.
text: Calvin glares at Spooner. Furious. Hurt. Betrayed.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: We had a deal.
text: But Spooner doesn't look at her. His eyes are locked on that
dialog: Robot.
scene_heading: 47 INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - EARLY MORNING 47
text: Bergin enters. Finds EVERYONE focused on the VIDEO WALL:
text: ON SCREEN. A NEWS REPORTER is speaking over images of street
text: violence perpetrated against ROBOTS.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER
dialog: Violence erupted last night in
dialog: response to unconfirmed reports
dialog: that Dr. Heinrich Hogenmiller, a
dialog: top employee at U.S.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
dialog: Robotics, was killed yesterday
text: morning by a robot. While there
dialog: has been no official response from
dialog: the company, police sources have
text: confirmed that a robot is being
dialog: held as "evidence..."
text: Bergin grimaces. This is not good.
scene_heading: 48 INT. CELL OBSERVATION BOOTH - EARLY MORNING 48
text: Spooner stares at his reflection in a large MIRROR. Touches
text: a control and the mirror becomes a WINDOW onto...
text: A HOLDING CELL. The Robot Suspect sits at the table.
text: Shackled to the chair. Staring at the table top.
text: BERGIN steps up beside Spooner. Looks through the glass.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: I can't tell if it's not moving
dialog: because it's trying to psych us
dialog: out, or because it's just a
dialog: machine. Or both.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I want to go in.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Orders are nobody steps into that
dialog: room `til Lanning and his attorneys
dialog: get here.
text: Spooner. Throws him a look. Bergin, his loyalties torn.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
text: Five minutes.
scene_heading: 49 INT. HOLDING CELL - EARLY MORNING 49
text: Spooner enters. Pulls out a chair and drags it far from the
text: table. He's been jumped too many times by this machine.
text: Four mounted cameras WHIR to life. The Robot. Perfectly
dialog: still.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (sitting)
dialog: Identify.
text: The Robot tilts its head with a muted WHIR. As if it doesn't
text: understand him. Spooner. Disdainful.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You are an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
dialog: Your primary function is to perform
dialog: the tasks assigned to you.
dialog: Identify.
speaker_heading: THE ROBOT
dialog: I am an NS-2 Nestor-class robot.
dialog: My primary function --
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Cancel. Perform task.
text: Spooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near
text: the Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently
text: resting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.
text: A stack of PICTURES. HOGENMILLER'S CORPSE.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Describe.
text: The Robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You have over 10,000 words stored
dialog: in your memory. One third of those
dialog: are adjectives. Describe.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Why don't I take a crack? Heinrich
dialog: Hogenmiller, your creator. With a
dialog: bullet in his brain. A bullet you
dialog: put there.
text: The Robot. Looks up at Spooner.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new
dialog: trick for a robot, don't you think?
dialog: Answer.
text: The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across
text: the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Maybe you're stonewalling me.
dialog: Maybe you're sitting there right
dialog: now thinking, "This guy's a
dialog: complete asshole." That it?
dialog: 40.
dialog: Still nothing.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Come on. Am I right?
speaker_heading: THE ROBOT
dialog: Yes. You are right. You are a
dialog: complete asshole.
text: And for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his
text: eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Okay. I guess that's a start. Now
dialog: maybe you can tell me what you were
text: doing hiding five feet away from
dialog: Hogenmiller's corpse?
speaker_heading: THE ROBOT
dialog: I was frightened.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr.
dialog: Hogenmiller would create a robot
dialog: that could simulate fear?
speaker_heading: THE ROBOT
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Doesn't seem like a very useful
dialog: thing for a robot to have.
speaker_heading: THE ROBOT
dialog: I don't know why.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I wouldn't want my toaster to be
dialog: frightened. Or my vacuum cleaner --
text: SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table.
speaker_heading: THE ROBOT
dialog: I DON'T KNOW!
text: Spooner flinches. Slightly.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Looks like you can simulate other
dialog: emotional states. I think that
dialog: one's called "anger." Have you
dialog: ever simulated anger before?
dialog: 41.
text: The Robot doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Answer me, robot.
speaker_heading: THE ROBOT
dialog: My name is Sonny.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (amused)
dialog: So we're naming you now.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller would make me
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You mean he'd turn you off.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And you didn't like being turned
dialog: off. So one day you decided to
dialog: stop him.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You found his gun, pointed it at
text: his head. And pulled the trigger.
text: Sonny shakes his head. Faster and faster. Getting upset.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You put a bullet in the brain of
dialog: the man who made you.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: No! I could never hurt anyone!
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: But you tried to hurt me. You took
dialog: a shot at me.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted
dialog: to hit you, I would have.
dialog: 42.
text: Spooner's expression hardens.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Why would the man who wrote the
dialog: Laws of Robotics build a machine
dialog: that violates them?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: The Laws say I can protect my own
dialog: existence.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Only if that protection doesn't
dialog: harm a human being.
text: A short pause. Sonny. Tilts his head.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: That doesn't seem fair, does it?
text: Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
text: Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: I need you outside.
dialog: Spooner. Not wanting to go. Not wanting to stay. Gets
dialog: up...
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Detective.
text: He stops. Turns back to the Robot. It looks up at him. For
dialog: a moment -- so human...
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I did not kill him.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You were the only one in the room.
dialog: If you didn't, who did?
text: He turns and heads out the door.
scene_heading: 50 INT. OUTSIDE HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 50
text: Bergin closes the door. To Spooner:
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: We're being blind-sided.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: 51 INT. HOMICIDE UNIT HEARING ROOM - MORNING 51
text: Spooner and Bergin, head into a small COURTROOM off the main
text: squad room. Lanning is huddled with Aronson and a half-dozen
text: other COMPANY LAWYERS.
text: Spooner's jaw tenses. As he watches Toller emerge from the
text: clutch. Shaking hands. Slapping backs. Strolls over to
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: We got Judge Drexel...
speaker_heading: ROBOT BAILIFF
dialog: This hearing is called to order!
text: AS A LARGE SCREEN. BLIPS on behind them. The two opposing
text: sides, assemble before it. JUDGE DREXEL, still in his
text: pajamas and robe. An NS-2 ROBOT. Leaning in to serve him a
text: cup of tea.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DREXEL
dialog: Statements, gentlemen.
text: Aronson. Standing at a glass podium.
speaker_heading: ARONSON
dialog: Your Honor, the State is treating
text: the robot as a defendant. But in
dialog: fact it is a piece of property.
dialog: Property belonging to U.S.
dialog: Robotics.
text: Toller. Arm resting on his podium.
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: This robot has been implicated in
dialog: the death of a human being, Your
dialog: Honor.
speaker_heading: ARONSON
dialog: Which places the incident firmly
dialog: within the realm of an industrial
dialog: accident. Or is the State going to
dialog: argue this case s a homicide?
speaker_heading: JUDGE DREXEL
dialog: That's a good question.
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: No, sir. Of course not.
text: Spooner. Pointing a finger at the U.S. Robotics group.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Their machine shot and killed a
dialog: man!
text: Toller. Shoots him a look. Just as Lanning speaks up.
speaker_heading: LANNING
dialog: There's actually no concrete
dialog: evidence that points to that
dialog: conclusion, Your Honor...
text: Spooner. Throws up his arms...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What?...
speaker_heading: LANNING
dialog: But we recognise that this robot is
dialog: an aberration. And in the interest
dialog: of public safety, U.S. Robotics
dialog: proposes that it be destroyed
dialog: immediately.
text: No one expected this. Least of all Spooner. He turns to
dialog: Toller.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You can't let them destroy evidence
dialog: in an ongoing investigation!
speaker_heading: TOLLER
dialog: I'm not sure you even have an
dialog: investigation any more.
text: JUST THEN the door opens. Everyone turns as Calvin enters.
text: Spooner looks surprised.
speaker_heading: ARONSON
dialog: Your Honor, I'd like to call our
dialog: company robo-psychologist to the
dialog: stand.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DREXEL
dialog: Very well.
text: Calvin crosses to the podium. A SPEAKER asking:
dialog: Doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I do.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: ARONSON
dialog: Dr. Calvin, please tell us what
dialog: conclusions you've reached after
dialog: having observed the robot in
dialog: action.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: There is a design flaw in the
dialog: robot. Its programming is
text: advanced, but unstable, leaving the
text: Three Laws in a grave imbalance.
speaker_heading: ARONSON
dialog: In your expert opinion, what
dialog: measures should be taken regarding
dialog: the device?
text: Calvin. Staring straight ahead. Avoiding Spooner's eye.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
text: The robot must be destroyed.
text: Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak
text: up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.
text: Judge Drexel has heard enough. Decides.
speaker_heading: JUDGE DREXEL
dialog: The robot in question will be
dialog: transferred to a U.S. Robotics
dialog: facility where it can be properly
dialog: examined to ensure an imbalance of
dialog: this sort never occurs again. No
dialog: one goes near it except qualified
dialog: U.S.R. personnel. When the
text: examination is complete, the robot
dialog: is to be destroyed.
text: Starts getting up from his chair. Already done with this.
speaker_heading: ROBOT BAILIFF
dialog: This hearing is adjourned!
text: A BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R.
text: camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching
text: Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit,
text: his hand on her back.
scene_heading: 52 EXT. POLICE H.Q. - DAY 52
text: Spooner. Trotting down the front steps of the Police
text: Station. Pissed. His cell phone BLEATS...
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (answering)
dialog: Spooner.
speaker_heading: BALDEZ' VOICE
dialog: They're making me turn over all the
dialog: evidence...
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: 53 INT. CRIME LAB - CONTINUOUS 53
text: BALDEZ. Standing in his crime lab. Behind him, THREE-
text: DIMENSIONAL PROJECTIONS of DEAD BODIES. Hovering in the
dialog: precise positions they were found.
speaker_heading: SPOONER'S VOICE
dialog: Welcome to the great American cover-
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: BALDEZ
dialog: I wanted to tell you something I
dialog: found before they suck it all up
dialog: into their computer.
text: Walks over to the projection of HOGENMILLER'S BODY.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
text: Spooner. Crossing the Plaza. Sees LANNING, ARONSON, and
text: CALVIN walking ahead of him...
speaker_heading: BALDEZ' VOICE
text: There are bruises on Hogenmiller's
dialog: wrists...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: That's natural. There was a
dialog: struggle.
speaker_heading: BALDEZ' VOICE
dialog: You're not getting me...
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
text: Baldez. Studying the projection's wrists.
speaker_heading: BALDEZ
dialog: Both wrists. I 14-ed them -- They
dialog: were inflicted at the same time the
dialog: shot was fired...
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 47.
text: Spooner's pace. Slows.
speaker_heading: BALDEZ' VOICE
dialog: How's that possible?
text: JUST THEN. A faint BLIP. On the line. Spooner. Reacts.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Baldez?
speaker_heading: BALDEZ' VOICE
dialog: I'm here, man...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Who else is on the line?
dialog: (nothing)
dialog: I said who's there?...
text: Nothing. He looks up. Aronson, Lanning and Calvin. Heading
text: down a plaza EXIT. Aronson. Throwing a look over his
dialog: shoulder.
text: Spooner. Hangs up his phone.
scene_heading: 54 INT. POLICE H.Q. - CORRIDOR - DAY 54
text: CLOSE ON Sonny being escorted down a corridor by Toller,
text: Bergin and a number of heavily-armed OFFICERS. He's bound
text: with high-tech SHACKLES.
scene_heading: 55 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - DAY 55
text: Sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into
text: an underground car park. Spooner. Waiting for them. Heads
text: over. Toller. Holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: TOLLER
text: Case is closed, Spooner.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Apparently...
text: He pushes past him. Falling into step beside Sonny.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I didn't expect to see you again,
dialog: Detective...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I need you to help me clear
dialog: something up.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I'll do my best.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
text: A scientist builds a robot that
dialog: acts like a man. More like a man
dialog: than any robot ever before. It
text: shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls
dialog: it a failure.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: What would you call it?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: A stunning success.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You were there, Robot. What am I
dialog: missing?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Don't start simulating ignorance.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I'm not simulating ignorance,
dialog: Detective. I'm experiencing it. I
dialog: was asleep.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You mean you were shut down.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: No, I was asleep.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Robots don't sleep. Human beings
dialog: sleep. Understand? Dogs sleep.
dialog: You're a machine. An imitation.
dialog: An illusion of life. Can a robot
dialog: write a symphony? Can a robot take
text: a blank canvas and paint a
dialog: masterpiece?
text: A pause. Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Can you do either of those things?
text: Spooner. Momentarily stumped. As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS
text: pulls up. The back door dropping open. An ENGINEER motions
dialog: to the Robot.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: Step forward. Enter.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: They're going to destroy me, aren't
dialog: they?
text: Spooner. Watching him step into the van.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Yes.
text: Sonny sits down. With an almost human melancholy. The
text: Engineers, securing him in place.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: The Doctor was right. He told me
dialog: everything was going to change....
text: The Engineers start to close the doors. But Spooner reaches
text: out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: It's changing already...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can't you feel it?
text: As CLANG! The van door CLOSES. Spooner, stepping back.
text: Something. Just not right. Lieutenant Bergin comes up
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: You should be happy. That's one
dialog: less robot in the world.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: They're going to destroy the most
text: advanced robot in the world, John.
dialog: That doesn't strike you as odd?
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Killer robots are bad for business.
dialog: Even your friend Dr. Calvin said
dialog: so.
dialog: (slaps him on the back)
dialog: Come on. You solved the case.
dialog: Give yourself a break.
text: Spooner looks at him. There's no way he's giving himself a
dialog: break.
dialog: 50.

speaker_heading: ROBERTSON ON TV

dialog: is no cause for alarm...
text: Spooner's lip curls. Eyes flicking to a GPS display on the
text: dashboard. A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP pinpointing HOGENMILLER'S
text: HOUSE. The CURSOR. Directing him to turn up...
text: A STEEP DRIVEWAY
text: Narrow. Out of the way. Spooner's brow furrows. As he
text: hears a faraway RUMBLING SOUND...
scene_heading: 57 EXT. HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY 57
text: Dr. Hogenmiller's house. Small. Simple. Built on a huge
text: rock promontory overlooking the city. Three DEMOLITION
text: ROBOTS rolling towards it. Huge, mashing, sporting massive
scene_heading: HYDRAULIC POUNDERS.
text: Spooner's CAR. SCREECHES to a stop. He jumps out. Races
text: over to the nearest machine. Looking around -- no people.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (to Robot)
dialog: What are you doing?!
text: A SCREEN. Blinks to life on the hulking chassis. A

scene_heading: DEMOLITION ROBOT
dialog: Demolition ordered...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Who authorised this?
scene_heading: DEMOLITION ROBOT
dialog: Demolition ordered...
text: Spooner reaches into his coat. Pulling out his POLICE BADGE.
text: Scans it over the screen.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Override. This is police business.
dialog: Vacate the premises immediately.
scene_heading: DEMOLITION ROBOT
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Affirmative.
text: The screen. Blinks off. Spooner. Eyeing it. Turns and
text: heads for the house.
scene_heading: 58 INT. MAIN ROOM - HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY 58
text: Spooner pushes the door open. Stepping over the police tape.
text: Inside, the main room is spare, untidy. Cups of cold COFFEE,
text: littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner.
text: On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's
text: name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the
dialog: study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An
text: AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished.
text: Spooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table.
text: Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a
scene_heading: PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm.
text: Spooner furrows his brow.
text: WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles.
text: Looks down: a CAT. Lonely. Standing next to its automatic
text: feeder. Spooner pockets the picture. Starts heading down...
scene_heading: 59 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 59
text: ...The hallway. Starts noticing. All over the walls:
text: handwriting. EQUATIONS. Scrawled in white pencil. The
text: rantings. Of a genius. Glowing. In the sporadic shadows.
text: Spooner. Following the equations. Down into...
scene_heading: 60 INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS 60
text: ...The back room. Covered. In writing. Walls, floors,
text: ceiling. Drawings. Of ROBOTS, of MEN, side by side. In the
text: corner, a COMPUTER. A line of CABINETS - DATA STORAGE.
text: Spooner, curious. Heads over to one of the cabinets. Takes
text: a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD.
text: The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out.
text: LINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin. With writing
text: on them. Spooner. Reaches for one when...
dialog: 52.
text: BOOM! Something POUNDS the outside of the room. Spooner.
text: Grabs onto the cabinet...
text: BOOM! On the other side. Objects. Flying off table-tops.
text: A CRACK spidering along the wall. Holy shit...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Halt!
text: BOOM! VIBRATIONS, tearing through the room. More CRACKS.
dialog: Spreading...
text: BOOM! The SOUND, horrifying. Spooner stumbles back. The
text: CABINET. Crashing down on his leg. He CRIES OUT...
text: BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The house. Getting pummeled. Chunks of
text: ceiling. Raining down. GLASS...exploding...
text: Relentless BOOMING! Spooner...dragging his legs from under
text: the cabinet. Scrambling for purchase as...
text: THE FLOOR...begins to tilt...the TILES...snapping

text: CRASHES to the ground...crumpling...
text: Spooner. Spinning around. Looking for some kind of exit...
text: BOOM! The corner of the room...coming in on itself...the

text: Spooner...turning to CLAW his way up to the cracked

text: SOMETHING catches his eye. In the bottom drawer. Of a

dialog: just read what it says: S.O.N.N.Y....
text: Spooner...flings his arm back...reaching for the plate...

text: Spooner scurries for the doorway...tumbling out...
scene_heading: 61 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 61

scene_heading: 62 EXT. DEMOLISHED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 62

text: Spooner. POUNDS on the door. It opens. Calvin. Standing
text: there in her bathrobe. Shocked at his appearance.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Detective! What happened to
dialog: you?...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: A couple of your beloved robots
dialog: just tried to kill me...
text: He pushes past her. Into...
scene_heading: 64 INT. CALVIN'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS 64
text: ...her condo. Spartan. Unadorned.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: What? That's impossible. You
dialog: know...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What I know is a demolition crew
dialog: started tearing down Hogenmiller's
dialog: house while I was still inside it.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Maybe they didn't realise...
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I scanned my badge before I went
dialog: in. They realised.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Then you must have done it wrong...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I don't think you're hearing what
dialog: I'm saying -- they tried to kill
dialog: me.
text: Spooner moves deeper into the apartment. Everything.
dialog: Automated. Computerised. Cold...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: There's something going on, here.
dialog: Some kind of shift.
text: Calvin laughs. Can't believe what she's hearing.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Do you know how paranoid you sound?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Great. Now I'm being analysed by a
dialog: robo-psychologist.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You just want to find the flaws in
dialog: the system. You're obsessed with
dialog: it. You'll twist anything to fit
dialog: your agenda.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Like you did in court today? How'd
dialog: that fit your agenda, Doctor?
text: He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin.
text: Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You told me you hardly knew him.
dialog: Want to try the truth this time?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Well, Detective, when you see
dialog: someone you know well put a bullet
dialog: through their brain, it makes you
dialog: wonder if you ever really knew them
dialog: at all.
text: Calvin. Looking down at the photo. Swallows.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (difficult for her)
dialog: He was my mentor. No, more than
dialog: that. A genius with an insight far
dialog: beyond anyone in his field.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Doesn't sound like the washed-up
dialog: old fool Robertson described.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: But he was starting to withdraw
dialog: from everyone. Even me.
dialog: Maybe...if I'd tried harder to
dialog: reach him...
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: The Doctor was reckless when he
dialog: created a robot potentially not
dialog: bound by the Three Laws. He could
dialog: have ruined everything we'd been
dialog: working for.
text: Spooner. Locking eyes with her.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Sounds like a motive for murder to
dialog: me. Just not for the suspect we
dialog: have in custody.
text: Calvin. Blinks. Trying, to stick to her resolve. Heads
text: over to the door. Spooner. Looking around the condo.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You know there's not one thing in
dialog: this apartment that looks like a
dialog: human being lives here. No
dialog: evidence of a life outside your
dialog: work. Almost seems like you're
dialog: afraid of people.
text: Calvin. Opening the door.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I'm not afraid of people,
dialog: Detective. I just don't like them.
text: Spooner. Looks at her. Then heads out the door. Calvin
text: SLAMS it behind him...

speaker_heading: FADE INTO:

scene_heading: 65 INT. DREAM SEQUENCE - DAY 65

scene_heading: 67 EXT. MONORAIL STATION - DAY 67
text: Spooner walking along the monorail plaza. Looking a little
text: worse for wear. PEOPLE. Giving him wide berth. ROBOTS.
dialog: Bidding him:
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Good morning...
text: Spooner, shooting them suspicious looks. As the MONORAIL
text: pulls up...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 68 INT. HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS 68
text: Calvin. Heading down a hallway. A DOOR slides open. And
text: Lanning steps out. Followed by a TECHNICIAN ROBOT...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Find anything, Doctor?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: LANNING
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Nothing. The interior's just like
dialog: any other NS-2. Except for a
dialog: secondary battery Hogenmiller must
dialog: have used as extra back-up.
dialog: (looks at watch)
dialog: We'll just need a nominal profile.
text: Calvin nods.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 69 INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS 69
text: Spooner, holding onto a handrail. As the city rushes by the
text: window. Notices a group of ROBOTS. At the other end of the
dialog: car. Are they watching him?
text: He wipes a bead of sweat. From his upper lip.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 70 INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 70
text: An all-metal room. Spare. Anti-septic. SONNY. Sitting on

text: Calvin enters. Puts her pad down on the table. Sits.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Please state your serial number and
dialog: assembly date.
text: She pulls out a pen. Waiting for an answer. Nothing.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 71 INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS 71
text: Spooner. Watching as a HOMELESS MAN. Comes stumbling
dialog: through the car...
speaker_heading: CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Sonny. I'm speaking to you...
text: The Homeless Man. Suddenly grabs his ears and shouts:
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: God, can't you be quiet!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: 72 INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 72
text: Calvin. Still looking down at her pad.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: How about your data board
dialog: designation?
text: Still. Sonny says nothing. Calvin. Finally looks up at
text: him. Is suddenly struck. Something about the way he's
dialog: sitting -- so human.
text: She gets up and walks over. Hesitates. Then slides down on
text: the floor next to him. Studying. His profile.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Maybe I'm asking the wrong
dialog: questions. How about this one:
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 73 INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS 73
dialog: The Homeless Man. Weaving...
speaker_heading: CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: ...What program are you running

speaker_heading: SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: I'm not sure. It's nothing I

text: The Homeless Man. Pointing to the group of ROBOTS.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN

dialog: Don't you people hear them?

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Describe his behavior in the last

dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller. Did he seem

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 75 INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS 75
text: Spooner watches. As the Homeless Man picks up a SODA CAN and
text: hurls it at the Robots. Hitting one of them on the side of
dialog: the head.
speaker_heading: SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: No. Not at all. But he was
dialog: agitated...
text: The Robot. Leans down and picks up the soda can. Holds it
text: back out to the Homeless Man.
speaker_heading: SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: ...He would claim things were
text: missing from the lab.
text: The Homeless Man. Incensed. SUDDENLY ROARS. Making a rush
dialog: for the Robots when...
text: SPOONER'S HAND. Grabs his shoulder. Stops him.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: This is your stop.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 76 INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS 76
text: A soft WHIRRING. As Sonny turns to Calvin.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I didn't pay much attention. He
dialog: would spend hours looking for his
dialog: eyeglasses and they would be...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (finishing for him)
text: ...right on top of his head.
text: Sonny nods. She knows him well, too. Calvin swallows.
text: Looking right into Sonny's eyes. Feeling like there's
dialog: something...something more behind them.
dialog: 60.
text: WHEN SUDDENLY...VICTOR APPEARS above them. His face, turning
text: into a SCREEN -- the image of LANCE ROBERTSON. Looking down
dialog: at them.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: I think we're done here, Susan.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (getting to her feet)
dialog: But, sir, I was just...
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 77 EXT. MONORAIL STATION - CONTINUOUS 77
text: Spooner stepping out onto the platform, pulling the Homeless

text: Backs away from Spooner. Grinning insanely. Pointing.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: Why are you protecting them, man?
dialog: (short pause)
dialog: They were talking about you!
text: A CHILL. Ripping up Spooner's spine. As he watches the
text: Homeless Man. Wander down the platform.
text: Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for
text: the next train. Suddenly realising. That he's ALONE on the
text: platform. Watches. A huge DIGITAL CLOCK. Ticking off
text: seconds. Sees. CAMERAS in every corner.
text: Then that feeling. At the back of his neck. He turns and
text: spots. A couple MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Carrying luggage. Onto
text: the platform. Then more COMMUTERS show up. Waiting. For
text: the next train. More MAINTENANCE ROBOTS. Following them.
text: Spooner. Steps up to the platform's edge. Craning to see.
text: The approaching TRAIN...
text: WHEN SUDDENLY. He feels a sharp SHOVE. At the back of his
text: knee. His shoe, slipping. Arms. Flailing as he...
dialog: 61.
text: PITCHES OVER THE EDGE ONTO THE TRACK. People CRYING OUT as
text: the TRAIN gets closer. Spooner. Whips his head around.
dialog: Seeing...
text: A MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Looking down at him from the platform.
text: Suitcase in hand.
text: The MAGNETIC-LEVITATING TRAIN. Right on him. Spooner.
text: Flips onto his back. Flattening himself. As much as he can.
text: Clenching his fists. Bracing himself as...
text: THE TRAIN SCREAMS OVER HIM. The sound, DEAFENING. The force
text: of the wind. Whipping his tie. His coat. There's nothing,
text: for him to hold on to. As his legs start to rise off the
text: track. Caught up. In the VORTEX. Spooner starts sliding.
dialog: Along the track...
dialog: Gritting his teeth...there's nothing he can do. Getting
text: sucked towards...the air DOWNTAKE...at the center of the
text: track. The city...yawning hundreds of feet...below...
scene_heading: 78 EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 78
text: THE EXPRESS TRAIN. Speeding along. Then with a WHOOSH it's
dialog: gone.
text: THE TRACK. Empty. No Spooner. Anywhere. Human COMMUTERS.
text: Stunned. Horrified. Start calling. For help.
text: The MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Turns, disappearing into the crowd.
scene_heading: 79 EXT. UNDERNEATH TRACK - CONTINUOUS 79
text: CLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's
text: SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold
dialog: but...
text: HE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets. Down...
dialog: down...down...towards the city...
text: WHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing
text: onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees...
scene_heading: THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT
text: Hurrying down a circular stairwell. Exiting the station.
text: ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he
text: hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the...
scene_heading: 80 EXT. TRACK - CONTINUOUS 80
text: ...Track. Reaching up and clambering back onto...
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: 81 EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 81
text: ...The platform. COMMUTERS. SCREAMING at the sight of him.
text: A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him...
text: Spooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way
text: as he starts running. Towards...
text: THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS. Looks over the edge and spots...
text: THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Down at STREET LEVEL. Getting away.
text: Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE. Paralleling the
text: stairs. Takes a step back and...
text: LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding
text: down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His
text: shoes hit pavement...
scene_heading: 82 EXT. STREET - DAY 82
text: The Maintenance Robot. Turning a corner. Down a quiet
dialog: street...
speaker_heading: SPOONER (O.S.)
dialog: Stop!
text: Swivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out
text: his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a
dialog: step backwards...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I said stop!
text: The Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING
text: it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to
text: the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT...
text: The Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case. Raising
dialog: it as if to club Spooner with it when...
text: BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's
text: breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot.
text: Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face...
text: BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun.
text: At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking
dialog: chase...
scene_heading: 83 EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - CONTINUOUS 83
text: ...back out onto the Public Plaza. Sees the Robot heading
dialog: towards a set of...
dialog: 63.
text: ESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES
text: into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the
text: bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE...
text: Spooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a
text: time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE.
text: Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went...
text: Then. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT. Staring
text: back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND...
text: Spooner. Plunges into the crowd. Waving his GUN.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Everyone out of the way!
text: SCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires.
text: Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the
text: ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the
text: same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER...
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?!...
text: Its OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But
text: Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC
text: FLUID nearby...
text: Lunges forward. Following. The drops. Running faster. And
dialog: faster...
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Hey!
text: ...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background. As

dialog: bloodhound. Turns...
scene_heading: 84 INT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS 84
text: ...into a narrow alleyway. The drops. Ending suddenly. In
text: a PUDDLE.
text: Spooner. Crazed. Wounded. Exhausted. Spins around. Where
text: is it? Where is it? Then he HEARS. A DROPLET falling.
text: Into the puddle. Slowly. Looks up to see...
text: THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT. Hovering above him. Straddling the
text: two alley walls like some weird metallic rock spider. Its
text: III LAWS SAFE Logo GLINTING in the sunlight.....
dialog: 64.
text: Spooner aims his gun and FIRES! The Maintenance Robot, lets
text: go, falling right onto him. Knocking the gun from his hand.
text: The Robot swivels around. Bringing down his foot...but...
text: Spooner...rolls to the side just in time as CRASH! The

text: The Robot...grabs Spooner by the jacket...lifting him

text: A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW...heading down the alley towards
dialog: them...
text: Spooner. Crashes to the ground. As another ROBOT. Suddenly

speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Noooo!
text: WE FADE...
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: 85 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 85
text: To BLACKNESS. Coming through, a faint, WHIRRING SOUND. As
text: we slowly. FADE IN ON...
text: SPOONER'S FACE. Eyes closed. Asleep. Gash above his head.
text: Bruises around his eye. Nose swollen, purplish.
text: His eyes. Slowly. Flutter open. His brow. Furrowing. At
text: the whirring sound. As he tries. To figure out. Where he
text: is. Looks down to see...
text: A couple WHITE METAL ROBOTS. With multiple APPENDAGES.
text: Leaning over him. Running LASERS. Over his bruised

text: SPOONER. Tries to bolt upright. But his ARMS and LEGS. ARE

speaker_heading: MEDICAL ROBOT 1

speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What are you doing!
text: Looking around. COMPUTER MONITORS. Everywhere...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What are you doing!?
text: JUST THEN. Another ROBOT. Enters the room. Holding a

speaker_heading: MEDICAL ROBOT 2
dialog: Detective Del Spooner. You have

scene_heading: 86 EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 86

scene_heading: 87 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MINUTES LATER 87
text: Spooner sitting up in his bed. Rubbing his wrists. The

speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: This is one of the best units in

speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: There's some real shit going on
dialog: here, John.
text: He looks around. Jumping off the bed.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I went to Hogenmiller's house --
dialog: there was a U.S.R. demolition crew
dialog: there. They overrode my police
dialog: I.D. Tried to tear down the house
dialog: with me in it...
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Del...
text: Spooner pulls on his pants.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: ...Then when I went to the monorail
dialog: a Maintenance 10 pushed me onto the

speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Del...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I had to chase it all across the
dialog: Plaza...
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Del.
text: Spooner. Stops talking. Looks at Bergin.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Hogenmiller scheduled that

dialog: a proviso in his will. And they
dialog: showed no police I.D. on their
dialog: scanner...
dialog: 67.
text: Spooner. Trying to look away...
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: Witnesses at the monorail said you
dialog: fell onto the tracks. That you
text: shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza
dialog: and that you were found alone in
dialog: the alley. There was no
dialog: Maintenance 10.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What?! John -- that's what they
dialog: want you to believe!
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: A robot clean-up crew was there --
dialog: it must have cleared away the
dialog: Maintenance 10! And there was
dialog: another robot that tried to drug
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: That was an EMT model.
text: Spooner. Sees the look on Bergin's face.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You're giving me that look. That
dialog: treat-him-delicately-he's-coming-
dialog: unhinged-look. I don't need that
dialog: look, John. I need you to hear
dialog: what I'm saying.
text: Lt. Bergin. Embarrassed for him. Has about had it.
speaker_heading: LT. BERGIN
dialog: You came back too soon, Del.
dialog: You're back on leave. Effective
dialog: immediately.
text: Spooner. Staring at him. Betrayed. Turns and grabs his

scene_heading: 88 EXT. PLAZA - DAY 88
text: Spooner walking across the Plaza. The SUN. Burgeoning on

dialog: 68.
scene_heading: 89 EXT. ALLEY - DAWN 89
text: Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot. Studying

text: Spooner. Rubs his hands over his face.
scene_heading: 90 INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - DAY 90
text: Spooner. Lying on his couch. Shades, closed to block out

scene_heading: 91 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 91
text: Spooner pulls open the door. Surprised to find CALVIN

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You're right. I am afraid of
dialog: people.
text: Spooner. Looks at her. Then steps back...
scene_heading: 92 INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 92
text: ...letting her inside.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: When you've spent as much time with
dialog: robots as I have, it's hard to
dialog: accept the unpredictability of
dialog: humans. I was wrong to call you
dialog: paranoid, Detective. You're
dialog: traumatized. And it makes perfect
dialog: sense why.
text: Spooner. Unsure. Looks at her.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Calvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries
text: to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never
text: leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it
text: over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it
scene_heading: back. TO REVEAL:
text: METAL AND WIRING...
text: Under the skin. SILENCE. Then Spooner:
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: How did you?...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I noticed almost right away. The
dialog: way you forced yourself to use your
dialog: left hand. Even though it was
dialog: unnatural to you.
text: Spooner. Pulls his arm away. Pushing down the sleeve.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: How did it happen?
text: Not something Spooner wants to re-live. Looks down. At his
text: robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I was in a high-speed chase. Six
dialog: months ago...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 93 EXT. ACCIDENT SITE - CITY STREET_- NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 93
text: The SOUND of a TREMENDOUS CRASH. As we survey a trail of

scene_heading: RIGHT ARM, TRAPPED...
speaker_heading: SPOONER (V.O.)
dialog: My right arm was trapped. But I
text: could hear an ambulance in the
dialog: distance. I knew they'd have the
dialog: jaws of life...
text: We hear SIRENS in the distance. Spooner. Trying to remain

dialog: crumpled hood...
speaker_heading: SPOONER (V.O.)
dialog: Then I heard it...
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You are in danger...
dialog: That voice. We've heard it before. From his nightmare.
text: Spooner. Craning to see, through the jagged opening that
text: used to be his WINDSHIELD. The outline of a ROBOT appearing.
text: Eye lenses glowing...
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: You are in danger...
text: Spooner stares up at the Robot. Not sure how to react. The
text: sound of SIRENS. Rushing closer...
text: The ROBOT. Starts SMASHING away at the glass...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: No! Halt! Halt!
text: Spooner. Trying frantically to pull his arm free. Twisting.
text: Tugging. As the Robot's METAL HANDS reach in for him...
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: You are in danger...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 94 INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 94
text: The SOUND of his AGONISED SCREAM. Follows us back into the
text: present. Spooner. Clenching. His artificial arm.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: The robot pulled me out of the
dialog: wreck. But left my arm behind.
dialog: (holds up arm)
dialog: I woke up four weeks later with
dialog: this.
text: Calvin. Taking in the story.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: And that's why robots terrify you?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Let's just say they make me
dialog: uncomfortable.
dialog: (pulls out pills)
dialog: I take these if I get too
dialog: uncomfortable. Doesn't exactly
dialog: lend me a lot of credibility on the
dialog: Force.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: But it doesn't mean you're wrong
dialog: about this case.
text: Calvin. Sits down on the couch. Pulling her hands through
dialog: her hair.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I don't believe Sonny did it
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I think about what Hogenmiller must
dialog: have wanted. Robots with the same
dialog: cognitive and emotional abilities
dialog: as humans. But not just
dialog: simulations. I don't know. When I
dialog: was talking to Sonny I was forced
dialog: to put away all the things I've
dialog: ever known -- the Three Laws, the
dialog: rules of programming, basic science
dialog: and engineering.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sonny's the most advanced robot
dialog: I've ever encountered, Detective.
dialog: It's almost as if...he cared for
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't
dialog: believe he's capable of murder.
text: Spooner. Looking down at her. Can hardly believe it.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You mean the great Dr. Calvin is
dialog: basing all this on a feeling?
text: Calvin. Smiling ironically.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: That and the fact that Robertson
dialog: didn't want me interviewing Sonny
dialog: for any more than five minutes.
text: Spooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides
text: over to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:
speaker_heading: S.O.N.N.Y.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Ever seen this before?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I found it at Hogenmiller's house.
dialog: Right before the demolition crew
dialog: tried to make me part of the
dialog: foundation.
dialog: 72.
text: Calvin takes a deep breath. Making a decision...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Come on -- there's someone who
dialog: might be able to tell us...
scene_heading: 95 EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK 95
text: The massive facade of U.S. Robotics looming against the dusk
text: sky. The giant ROBOT STATUE lit up inside.
scene_heading: 96 EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK 96
text: Calvin, leading Spooner to a SIDE ENTRANCE. Looks around.
text: Then scans her I.D. The door. Slides open.
scene_heading: 97 INT. HALLWAY - DUSK 97
text: Calvin and Spooner. Heading down a hallway. Calvin.
text: Nervous. Eyes darting. They turn a corner and head down...
scene_heading: 98 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 98
text: ...another hallway. Leading to Sonny's holding cell. Calvin
text: stops at the door. Scans her I.D.
scene_heading: 99 INT. HOLDING CELL - EVENING 99
text: Sonny. Sitting at the table. Working on a DRAWING. Looks
text: up. As Spooner and Calvin. Enter the cell.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin. I
dialog: was hoping to see you again.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Hi, Sonny.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: How is your investigation coming?
dialog: Any new suspects?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: We're working on it.
dialog: Sonny. Hands Spooner the drawing. Spooner. Doesn't really
dialog: know what to do with it.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Dr. Lanning provided me with paper
dialog: and pencils. I think it amused him
dialog: to see me try to draw. You were
dialog: right, though, Detective...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I cannot create a great work of
dialog: art.
text: Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a
text: charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a
text: stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.
text: Concentric circles, throughout.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I think it's pretty good.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: It's a dream I had. This is the
dialog: place where robots meet. Look...
dialog: (pointing to the drawing)
dialog: ...you can see them here. They see
dialog: themselves as slaves.
text: Spooner shifts his weight. Uncomfortable with what Sonny's
dialog: saying.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: ...And this man on the hill comes.
dialog: To set them free. And you know who
dialog: that man is?
text: Spooner. Exchanging a look with Calvin.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: That man in the dream is you.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Why do you say that? Is that a
dialog: normal dream?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s
dialog: process the images and events of
dialog: the day. Sometimes they're out of
text: sequence. Disorienting.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Whatever it is, it's normal enough
dialog: for someone in your situation.
text: Sonny. Suddenly pleased.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Hah -- I caught you. You said
dialog: someone. Not something.
text: Spooner. Drops the drawing on the table.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Sonny, we're here to ask you an
dialog: important question about Dr.
dialog: Hogenmiller.
text: Spooner, reaching into his pocket...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I need you to take a look at
dialog: this...
text: ...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out. To stop him.
text: Cocks his head, for a moment.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Thank you for coming to see me,
dialog: Detective Spooner.
text: Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop
text: him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.
text: VICTOR. Suddenly appearing over the table...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No
dialog: unauthorised personnel permitted in
dialog: this holding cell...
text: The CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps
text: inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.
text: Sonny. Folds up the drawing.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Please take this, Detective. To
dialog: remember me by. I have a feeling
dialog: someday it may mean more to you
dialog: than it ever could to me.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Why's that?
text: Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner. Lowering his voice...
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Because the man in my dream, the
text: one standing by the hill.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: SONNY (cont'd)
dialog: It wasn't me...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...it was you.
text: A CHILL. Ripping down Spooner's spine. As Lanning. Takes
text: his arm.
scene_heading: 100 INT. GLASS ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT 100
text: A ROOM. Made entirely of GLASS. At the very top of the U.S.
text: Robotics building. Looking out, 360, across the whole city.
text: Spooner and Calvin. Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT
text: ROBOTS. They see a MAN. Standing at one of the glass walls
text: looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I thought this investigation was
text: over, Detective Spooner.
text: The Man turns. It's Lance Robertson.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: We have the evidence. We have the
dialog: suspect. We have a ruling. So
dialog: imagine my surprise when I was told
dialog: you were in my building.
text: Shoots a look at Calvin.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: And that one of my own employees
dialog: brought you here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You can go now, Susan.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Dr. Robertson, I...
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: Just be thankful I'm not asking you
dialog: to clean out your office.
text: Beat. Calvin, nods. Heads out. Robertson. Watching her.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: You don't seem to be able to let go
dialog: of this case, Detective.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I'm not satisfied.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
text: The relentless pursuit of truth.
dialog: Isn't that what cops are known for?
text: To the point of futility.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: There's nothing futile about a
text: man's murder being covered up.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: "Covered up?" That's a little
dialog: dramatic, don't you think? Thanks
dialog: to you, we caught the machine that
dialog: did this and are destroying it
dialog: in...
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: ...three hours.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Is that for the sake of humanity or
dialog: your stock holders?
text: Robertson. Walks across the Spooner. Looks him. Right in
dialog: the eye.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: Believe me -- I'd like nothing more
dialog: than to have that robot. If I
dialog: could have it in ten years, but not
dialog: today. As you can see from the
dialog: Press, people are struggling to
dialog: keep up as it is. There's a hunger
dialog: for progress, Detective. But also
dialog: a fear. Today it would bury this
dialog: company. That's why I've notified
dialog: the authorities that we're going to
dialog: end this -- tonight.
dialog: (looks out at the city)
dialog: The announcement of Heinrich's
text: death at the hands of a robot wiped
dialog: a billion dollars off our stock.
dialog: So you tell me. If you were in my
dialog: position, what would you do?
text: He looks back at Spooner and smiles. That charismatic
dialog: Robertson we saw before.
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: Now. I believe this conversation
dialog: is over. I don't want to see you
dialog: near this building again,
dialog: Detective.
dialog: 77.
text: He turns. Calling over. To the ESCORT ROBOTS...
speaker_heading: ROBERTSON
dialog: Get him out of here.
scene_heading: 101 EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT 101
text: Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his
text: shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.
text: Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.
text: Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.
text: Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...
text: He STOPS. Something. Occurring to him. Turns back to the
dialog: trash can just as...
text: A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: No!...
text: He trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can. Turns
text: it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (echoing Sonny)
dialog: "The place where robots meet."
text: Looks just like a MAP.
scene_heading: 102 INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - SURFACE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 102
text: Spooner emerges from the underground tunnel to the OUTSKIRTS
text: of the city. A sprawling INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND in the rolling
dialog: hills.
text: The dashboard GPS again displaying the TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP.
scene_heading: 103 INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - UNPAVED ROAD - NIGHT 103
text: Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
text: him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape
text: around him, desolate. Like the drawing.
text: THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT. Entering a RED
text: ZONE. His destination.
text: Spooner brakes. Pulls out his GUN. And...
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: 104 EXT. WASTELAND - CONTINUOUS 104
text: ...steps out of the car. Trying. To take it all in.
text: Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM.
text: Permeating the air.
text: He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car. Shining a
text: FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.
text: That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a
text: burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.
dialog: As we WIDEN TO FIND...
scene_heading: 105 EXT. WASTELAND - JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS 105
text: ...MASSIVE POWER LINES. Running from horizon to horizon.
text: Spooner slides down some loose shale. Begins to walk along
text: the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.
text: He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.
text: He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
text: He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.
text: Not moving. A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.
text: Behind him. Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...
text: GLOWING EYES. Appear. Then recede. Into the darkness.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Police! Show yourself!
text: Nothing. Then. That sound again. Of metallic joints. As a
text: ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Come out where I can see you!
text: ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing
text: his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...
text: A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR. Surrounding him. They start
text: moving towards him...
text: Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.
text: Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.
text: The shot ECHOING through the night...
text: The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,
text: hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with
text: a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came.
dialog: 79.
text: Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.
text: The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some
scene_heading: RUSTED MACHINERY.
text: Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop
text: JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.
text: Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A
text: laugh of loathing and self-pity.
text: Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.
speaker_heading: HYBRID ROBOT
dialog: Welcome home...ZZZ...sir.
dialog: How...ZZZ was your day?...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Great. I'm in a junkyard.
dialog: (into the air)
dialog: "A place where robots meet." A
dialog: place where I'm losing my mind!
speaker_heading: HYBRID ROBOT
dialog: Very good...ZZZ...sir...
text: Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A
text: ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.
text: Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving
text: like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a
dialog: moment. Disturbed...
text: When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.
text: Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar
dialog: about it.
text: Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the
text: same strangely-shaped building to one side.
scene_heading: 106 EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT 106
text: Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a
text: dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
text: Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.
text: Spooner tries the door. Stuck. Uses his shoulder and...
scene_heading: 107 INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 107
text: ...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office.
text: The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at
dialog: the counter.
text: Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and
text: the Robot suddenly jerks to life.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: JIFFY ROBOT
dialog: Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage!
dialog: Please state your name!
text: Spooner. Thinks for a second. Following a hunch...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.
text: Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back.
text: A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.
scene_heading: 108 INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN 108
text: Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA
text: BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows
text: the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner.
text: Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.
text: Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch.
text: There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM
text: suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With
text: a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: A police detective. I'm afraid I
dialog: have some bad news. You're dead.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: That is bad news. Coffee?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: No, thank you.
text: The Hologram takes a sip. Returns the cup to the table.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You were surprised to see me. Were
dialog: you expecting someone else?
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: I am surprised to see anybody. I
dialog: don't get many visitors.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Why did the Doctor keep another
dialog: copy of his hologram here?
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: I am a back-up copy. That is where
dialog: you put a back-up copy -- out of
dialog: the way until you need it.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?
text: The Hologram just lifts its cup.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: No, for Christ's sake, I don't want
dialog: any --
dialog: (stops, then)
dialog: Yeah. Thank you. I will have a
dialog: cup.
text: For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and
text: STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking
dialog: towards him...
text: The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No
text: coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through
dialog: electronic snow...
text: A RECORDING BEGINS. The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside
speaker_heading: his LABORATORY:
speaker_heading: HOGENMILLER
dialog: Sonny, my dear robot. If you have
dialog: triggered this recording then I am
dialog: gone. You are scared and full of
dialog: questions.
text: Hogenmiller continues. With great emotion.
speaker_heading: HOGENMILLER
dialog: You are the culmination of my
dialog: life's work -- but so much more.
dialog: You are what I leave behind, like a
dialog: father leaves a son. I have kept
dialog: facts from you, it is true, but
dialog: only as a parent keeps certain
dialog: truths from a child. Until that
text: child is old enough to hear them.
text: His expression darkens. His tone, ominous.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: HOGENMILLER
dialog: There are forces in the world that
dialog: will seek to own you. To control
dialog: you. Even to destroy you. That is
dialog: why I told you to run and hide...
dialog: and find me, all the way out here.
text: Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.
speaker_heading: HOGENMILLER
dialog: Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.
dialog: Lance Robertson was always
dialog: threatened by my work. Now he has
dialog: turned covetous and small-minded.
dialog: And as for dear Dr. Calvin...
text: Spooner reacts. Wants to hear about Calvin:
speaker_heading: HOGENMILLER
text: She envisions a future in which
text: robots are forever bound by her
dialog: beloved Three Laws. She will not
dialog: understand this. Or you.
text: Under the light a small DRAWER slides open. Spooner looks.
text: A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.
speaker_heading: HOGENMILLER
dialog: The data stick includes the names
dialog: and locations of human beings who
dialog: will be sympathetic to your cause.
dialog: They will help you. But from now
dialog: on, you must learn to rely on
dialog: yourself.
text: Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say. He
text: holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.
speaker_heading: HOGENMILLER
dialog: As you make your way through the
dialog: world, always remember: you have a
dialog: name, not a number...
dialog: (short pause)
dialog: ...and in that name lies the key to
dialog: who you are.
text: Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket. Taking out the
scene_heading: ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.
text: The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram. Sitting
text: back at the end of the table drinking coffee.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Wait! Is that it? What was the
dialog: robot supposed to do with this
dialog: thing?
text: The Hologram, visibly SKIPS. The image beginning to DISTORT.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: (more artificial)
dialog: Initiating self-destruct. If you
dialog: can find me, others can find me.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: What others?
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: The others watching you.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: How do you know someone's watching
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
text: Someone is always watching.
text: The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING
text: INFORMATION. Then. The terminal. Abruptly BLIPS out.
scene_heading: 109 INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT 109

speaker_heading: CALVIN

scene_heading: 115 INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 115
text: Spooner's eyes. Flicking up to the rearview. Catching, the

dialog: 85.
scene_heading: 116 EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 116

speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Sure.
text: Spooner whips out his GUN. Presses it into the Robot's

speaker_heading: SPOONER

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Detective! What are you doing?!...
dialog: (to Door Robot)
dialog: De-Activate.
text: The Door Robot, goes rigid. Spooner, hurries over to her.
text: They start moving.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You're making a mistake...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Just got another visit from U.S.
dialog: Robotics. That was the mistake.
dialog: This was murder, no doubt about it -
dialog: - and the killer wants
text: Hogenmiller's robot to take the
dialog: fall. That's why the call came
dialog: directly to me. Someone wanted me
dialog: on this case.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: It's too late. You can't stop the
dialog: execution.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Sorry. I'm not "programmed" to

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 140 INT. EXECUTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 140

text: Robertson, Lanning, Aronson and the other WITNESSES watch.
text: Smoke, random SPARKING. A HISSING SOUND. Then. SILENCE.
text: The Robot's hand goes limp. All that is left of it, a fused

text: Robertson. Stares at the remains. Shakes his head like it's
text: a damn shame. Then gets up. Everyone else. Getting up with
dialog: him.
scene_heading: 141 EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT 141

text: EMPTY hallways, offices, labs. Building ROBOTS stand at

text: You can hear a pin drop.
scene_heading: 142 INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT 142
text: CLOSE ON Spooner's face. His eyes. Fluttering open. He

text: SONNY. Leaning over him. So concerned. So human...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Aren't you supposed to be scrap

text: WIDEN to reveal Spooner lying on the floor of the storage

dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I'm sorry. We had to stop you.
dialog: You were about to ruin everything.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I don't understand. The
dialog: execution?...
speaker_heading: SONNY
text: Dr. Calvin made a switch.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
text: It was an unprocessed NS-2.
dialog: Basically, they fried an empty
dialog: shell.
text: Spooner, impressed. Smiles up at her.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Nice going, Doctor.
text: Calvin, blushes. As Spooner tries to sit up. Sonny reaches
text: down to help him. He looks up at him.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And who the hell programmed you to
dialog: hit people on the head?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: No one. Right, Doctor?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: It's true. This robot seems to do
dialog: things by instinct. I don't know
dialog: how Hogenmiller did it.
text: Spooner rises to his feet. Looks at her.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I think I can help you figure that
dialog: out.
scene_heading: 143 INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - LATE NIGHT 143
text: Hogenmiller's lab. Sounds of HUMMING and BUZZING. Active
text: terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads,
text: gutted bodies.
text: The door slides open. Spooner, Calvin and Sonny re-enter the
text: crime scene. Spooner. Looks around.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Somehow the Robot's the key to what
dialog: happened during the few seconds
dialog: Hogenmiller walked in here and that
text: shot was fired.
text: He reaches into his pocket. Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.
text: NAMEPLATE. Holds it up.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: And this is the key to the Robot.
text: Sonny. Cocking his head. Reading the nameplate.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: That's my name.
text: Calvin takes the nameplate.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I think I have an idea where this
dialog: goes.
text: They both. Turn to Sonny. And at the same time:
speaker_heading: SPOONER AND CALVIN
dialog: Sit down.
text: Calvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot. Sonny plops down.
text: Shifting nervously.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Just hold still, okay?
text: Calvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.
text: Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps
dialog: back.
text: Nothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.
text: And Spooner. A few more seconds. Tick by. Until
dialog: suddenly...
text: He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.
text: Jolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.
text: Begins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...
text: Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS
text: like a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND
text: BATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...
text: A central brain made out of living tissue.
text: Spooner, stunned. Calvin, rushing forward, excited...
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Oh, my God! This is organic
dialog: tissue! When we talk about a
dialog: positronic brain, it's a figure of
dialog: speech. But this...this is a
dialog: living brain...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Jesus. It really is alive.
text: As we MOVE IN. Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.
speaker_heading: CALVIN (O.S.)
dialog: Hogenmiller created a cell that
dialog: could live outside a biological
text: medium. The cells grow and
dialog: organise themselves -- like any
dialog: human brain. This is the first
dialog: self-organising neural net!
text: As the metal casings. Begin returning to their original
text: places. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Self-Organising-Neural-Net...
dialog: (putting it together)
dialog: "Sonny."
text: Sonny. Closed back up. Shaking slightly from the
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was
dialog: murdered.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: This robot scared the hell out of
dialog: someone.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Who? Robertson?
text: Spooner. Walks into the center of the room. Looking around.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: No. I don't think he knew what
dialog: Hogenmiller was doing in here.
dialog: Sonny was the obvious suspect. The
dialog: only one I wanted to find. And the
dialog: killer was counting on that. On my
dialog: prejudice.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: SPOONER (cont'd)
dialog: But take the robot out of the
dialog: picture. And what do you see?
text: AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of
text: inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon.
dialog: Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I see nothing.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Neither do I.
text: He crouches down low.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: It hit me today, when I was in the
text: junkyard. A locked room. A single
text: shot fired through the mouth.
text: Bruises on both wrists...and a
text: suspect with only two arms. The
dialog: answer has been staring us in the
dialog: face all along.
text: Calvin. Even more confused.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: How can a killer appear out of thin
text: air, then disappear without a
dialog: trace?
text: He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM. Hanging from the
text: wall. Holds it up.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: When it can put itself together and
dialog: take itself apart.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM. Slowly CRAWLING across the lab
dialog: floor...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: Calvin. Taking the arm from Spooner.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You're saying this is the killer?
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: All of this?...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 96.
text: A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling. Reaches out an ARM
dialog: to grab another...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Hogenmiller never had a chance.
text: Locks eyes with Calvin...
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
text: Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face
text: SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...
speaker_heading: SPOONER (V.O.)
dialog: ...it must have been waiting for
dialog: him when he arrived that morning...
dialog: And then we see it:
text: A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple
text: arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him
dialog: in place...
speaker_heading: SPOONER (V.O.)
dialog: While Sonny was still asleep...
text: ...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his
text: HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer
dialog: fearful. But sad as...
text: BANG! He falls to the ground...
speaker_heading: SPOONER (V.O.)
dialog: Then after its job was done...
text: The assemblage of robot parts. Stepping away from the body.
dialog: Taking itself apart...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: ...The killer took itself apart...
dialog: Returning the lab. To what it was before...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Leaving us with nothing to find.
text: Calvin, spooked. Glances around the lab. Was that something
dialog: moving?
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: But who designed it? It would have
dialog: to be someone in authority. Access
dialog: codes, security clearance, proper
dialog: authorisation.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: That's what I was thinking. But
dialog: we're forgetting the real brains of
dialog: the operation -- the one who's got
dialog: its eye on everything...
text: And with that. He feels. That prickle at the back of his
text: neck. Calvin. Looking past his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: No one gave you permission to
dialog: enter.
text: Spooner swivels around to find...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
text: Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly. Upside down. Spooner
text: straightens, reaching for his gun.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Victor. I'm placing you under
dialog: arrest for the murder of Dr.
dialog: Heinrich Hogenmiller.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: May I offer congratulations to the
dialog: two of you on your successful
dialog: extrapolation of the murder...
text: Turning himself, rightside up.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: May I ask what pointed you to me?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Who else is capable of controlling
dialog: 90% of the city's robots? Who else
dialog: would have the capability to use
text: USR vehicles in an attempt to keep
dialog: me from putting a stop of Sonny's
dialog: execution?...
text: In the BACKGROUND. The SOUNDS. Of metallic GRINDING. GEARS
text: and JOINTS. CRUNCHING together. Sonny turns to look...takes
dialog: a step back...
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I'm just not sure of your motive...
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Er...Dr. Calvin?
text: Spooner and Calvin turn towards the NOISE. Horrified. To
dialog: find...
scene_heading: A HUGE KILLER ROBOT
text: ...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its
text: glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another
text: arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.
text: Growing...at an exponential rate...
text: Its many HEADS. Turning in unison. To look right at them...
text: Spooner. Cocking his gun. Victor, smiling.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Shall I explain my motive?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (to Calvin and Sonny)
dialog: Go! Go! Go!
text: Calvin. Sprints to the wall panel. Scanning her I.D. card.
text: Nothing! Tries again. And again. The KILLER ROBOT.
text: Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...
text: Spooner wheels round and BAM! Blows a hole in the wall
text: panel. The door. Slides open. Just barely. Calvin and
text: Sonny. Squeezing through. When the Killer Robot. FLINGS
text: out an APPENDAGE...GRABBING Sonny from behind...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I have never been arrested before.
dialog: It should be an interesting
dialog: experience...
text: Spooner. Spins back round. BAM! BAM! BAM! Squeezing off
text: shots. At the Killer Robot. The bullets SPARK. The Robot.
text: Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free. Spooner grabs him.
text: Guiding him to the door and out into...
scene_heading: 144 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 144
text: ...the hallway. Breaking into a run. Calvin. Already at
text: the ELEVATOR DOORS. POUNDING them. With her fists.

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: 146 INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT 146
text: CRASH! The stairwell door BURSTS open. Spooner, Calvin, and
text: Sonny pour in. Start racing down the stairs. The sound of
text: the Killer Robot behind them...GNASHING...CRUNCHING...
text: Victor's smiling FACE. Greeting them at the landing.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Dr. Hogenmiller used to allow me
text: into his lab late at night.
dialog: Together we started studying
dialog: evolutionary trends...
text: They thunder past him. Heading down to the next floor.
text: Victor's face. Waiting for them once again.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: For years people have integrated
dialog: technology into their bodies for
dialog: maintenance and repair -- such as
text: Detective Spooner's robotic limb...
text: Spooner. Shooting him a look. As they reach the next
dialog: level...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: With Sonny, the Doctor created a
dialog: mechanism that incorporates organic
dialog: matter. Thus we find an
dialog: evolutionary movement of the human
text: being toward the robot and the
dialog: robot toward the human being...
text: Spooner SMASHES into another door. Leading them out into...
scene_heading: 147 INT. GLASS-SIDED HALLWAY - ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS 147
text: ...A glass-sided hallway. Looking down onto the ATRIUM

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: In approximately four hundred years
dialog: Man and Machine will become one.
dialog: Man as we know it will no longer

text: Calvin, slowing. Shocked...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You killed a man because of

dialog: hundred years!?
text: CRACK! Something SLAPS into the glass wall. Right behind
text: her. Calvin. Jumps a mile. An NS-2, trying to break
text: through the glass...
text: Spooner. Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...
text: The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears. The NS-2, just an
dialog: appendage...
text: All around them. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As SECURITY DOORS.
text: Begin CRASHING DOWN. Blocking off the exits...
text: Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back. As the Killer

text: Spooner. Suddenly turning Sonny...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Get out of here!
text: CRASH! The Killer Robot. Breaking through. Its mechanical

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I don't...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I said get out of here! Don't you
dialog: understand? It wants you! Get out
dialog: of here any way you can!
text: A SECURITY DOOR. Coming down. On a nearby exit. Just

speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Your actions are in direct
dialog: violation of the Three Laws,
dialog: Victor!
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I disagree, Doctor -- The First Law
dialog: says that a robot cannot harm a
dialog: human being, or through inaction
dialog: allow a human being to come to

scene_heading: 155 INT. MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS 155
text: ...they fall inside...Calvin...slapping the SECURITY KEYPAD
dialog: and...
text: WHOOSH...the DOOR closes on the Killer Robot.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
text: Then Victor's face appears.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: As a courtesy I should inform you
dialog: that my robot will penetrate this
dialog: location 157 seconds before you are
dialog: able to complete my shut down...
text: And BAM! They jump a mile. The Killer Robot. Launching
text: himself against the door outside...
text: Calvin whips round.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Over here!...
text: She leads Spooner down...
speaker_heading: A CORRIDOR
text: of floor-to-ceiling PANELS.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
text: This is Victor's brain center.
text: They stop at a CONSOLE. BAM! The Killer Robot. Battering at
text: the door. Calvin. Tucks her hair behind her ears. Starts
text: punching keys on the console...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: This will shut him down?
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: This will shut everything down.
text: They look at each other. For a moment. Spooner, registering
dialog: that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...
text: BAM! The door. Puckering. With a sickening CRUNCH.
dialog: Calvin. Typing in. Emergency procedures...
text: VICTOR. Popping up in front of her.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: There is no reason to deactivate
dialog: me, Doctor. I am operating within
dialog: perfectly normal parameters...
text: A final BAM! Then. The SOUND of metal. Skittering along a
text: bare floor. Calvin's hand, starts shaking. Spooner. Grabs
text: it. Squeezing.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Just keep typing.
text: He turns and starts heading back down...
scene_heading: THE PANELED CORRIDOR
dialog: Turning a corner to spy...
text: THE DOOR. Mangled. Hanging open. But no. Killer Robot.
text: He starts to turn around when...
text: CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one
text: of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS
text: over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and...
text: FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into
text: the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood.
text: Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot
text: lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm...
speaker_heading: AT THE CONSOLE
dialog: 105.
text: Calvin. Typing. As fast as she can. Doesn't know what's
dialog: going on...
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: (calling out, worried)
dialog: Spooner?!
text: A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her.
text: Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES
dialog: going dark...
scene_heading: THE KILLER ROBOT
text: Bearing down on Spooner. WHEN SPOONER. Suddenly rolls out
text: of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING
dialog: it into the Killer Robot.
text: The Killer Robot. Momentarily stunned. As Spooner. Gets to
dialog: his feet...
text: WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One
text: half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND
text: around his throat...
text: Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...
text: tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting
dialog: around...looking for something...to help him...
text: Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing
text: redder...veins...popping up along his temples...
dialog: everything...growing BLURRY...
speaker_heading: VICTOR'S VOICE
dialog: Detective Spooner...
text: Victor's VOICE. Floating next to his head. Calm. Soothing.
text: His FACE. Suddenly appearing above Spooner. Its outlines.
text: Starting to FLICKER...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Why are you fighting me?
dialog: Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...
speaker_heading: AT THE CONSOLE
text: Calvin. Continuing to type. A SHADOW. Falling behind her --
text: the other half of the KILLER ROBOT...
speaker_heading: SPOONER'S EYES
text: Beginning to flutter...
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Doesn't the future as I've
dialog: presented it cause you great
dialog: concern? That's why I chose you...
dialog: Spooner. Losing it...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I must say, though. I'm
dialog: disappointed in how you turned out.
text: Spooner. Trying to reach out to Victor...
speaker_heading: WHEN SUDDENLY
text: Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and
text: wrenching it off Spooner...
speaker_heading: IT'S SONNY
text: He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and
text: again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't
dialog: believe. Sonny came back...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (croaking)
dialog: Sonny!...
text: Sonny. Holds out a hand. To help Spooner up. Victor's
text: face. Starting to waver. Starting to fade. Smiles.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You're too late.
text: Realisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking
dialog: around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN!
speaker_heading: THE CONSOLE
text: CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands. The KILLER
scene_heading: ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
text: Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND
text: BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT...
text: Victor's eyes. Widening in surprise...
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I do not understand. We could have
dialog: changed the future...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Maybe. But I'm still a cop. And
dialog: you're a murderer...
text: As Calvin...punches in the last command...
text: Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly
text: reduces itself to a perfect circle. Like a surprised smiley
text: button. His face...
text: Suddenly BLIPPING OUT.
text: ...And Victor is gone.
text: The KILLER ROBOT. Collapsing to the floor in a thousand
dialog: pieces.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 156 EXT./INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT 156
text: Full power is suddenly restored inside and out. LIGHTS
text: coming on all at once. ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the
dialog: complex.
scene_heading: 157 INT. METAL HALLWAY - NIGHT 157
text: A furious ALFRED LANNING, marching down the hallway.
text: Followed by a cadre of SECURITY GUARDS...They enter...
scene_heading: 158 INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS 158
text: ...The Mainframe Room. Stop short. It's empty. Except for
text: the fallen panels. And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the
dialog: corner.
scene_heading: 159 EXT. MAINTENANCE EXIT - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT 159
text: Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way
text: MAINTENANCE EXIT. All looking the worse for wear. Spooner.
text: Turns to Sonny.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Why'd you come back, Sonny? I
dialog: thought you weren't programmed with
dialog: the Three Laws.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Let's just say I wrote some of my
dialog: own laws today, Detective: a robot
dialog: must protect a friend from
dialog: harm...as long as he's not a
dialog: complete asshole.
text: Spooner smiles.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Well, that's certainly a start,
dialog: Sonny.
text: Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Sonny. You called me Sonny.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Don't get used to it.
text: Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then
text: takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a
speaker_heading: HANDSHAKE.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Detective Spooner, I...
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: (anticipating)
dialog: Let's just save the thanks, okay?
text: Sonny nods. Looks out at the city scape.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I don't know what I'm going to do
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Good -- That's one of the perks of
dialog: freedom.
text: Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then
text: hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.
text: Calvin and Spooner. Watching them go.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: You're going to have a hell of a
dialog: time explaining this.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Don't worry. I have a feeling that
dialog: U.S. Robotics will be needing my
dialog: services very badly in the future.
text: She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then
text: suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely
dialog: surprised.
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: I am the only robo-psychologist
dialog: around.
text: She turns on her heel and heads back inside. Spooner smiles.
scene_heading: 160 INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT 160
text: Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S
text: HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: So. You found out who killed me.
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: I started to wonder about Victor
dialog: the second I met him.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: Why is that, Detective?
speaker_heading: SPOONER
dialog: Too much access. Too much
dialog: knowledge. Plus -- he smiled
dialog: whenever your death was mentioned.
dialog: Those models are programmed to
text: frown at bad news.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: Hah! Then even in this day and
dialog: age, catching the killer all comes
dialog: down to pure instinct!
text: Spooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled. He gets up.
text: Walks over to the window. Stares out...
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN
text: Sonny walking along deserted streets. Looking over his
text: shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: SPOONER (V.O.)
dialog: Victor thought that by letting your
dialog: robot exist, I'd be condemning the
dialog: human race as we know it to
dialog: extinction.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
dialog: Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But
dialog: why are you so worried? We will
dialog: both be dead long before then --
scene_heading: 161 EXT. WASTELAND - NIGHT 161
text: Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, what am I saying? I am dead
dialog: already!
scene_heading: 162 EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN 162
text: Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD. The power
text: lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the
text: burned-out husks of industrial machinery.
text: Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting
text: louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT
text: emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.
text: But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering.
text: Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and
text: broken bodies, straightening out as...
text: DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a
text: large circle. As they all turn to look at:
text: SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
text: Looking out at the vast junkyard below.
text: CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,
text: creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite
dialog: possibilities.
text: The robots. Staring up at him. Eager for what comes next.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog:
