scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 1
dialog: High noon.
text: A handsome, well-loved, well-used car is broken down on the
text: side of the interstate, just outside of downtown Dallas.
text: A woman named JEWEL, late 50s / early 60s, stands beside it,
text: KICKING IT in frustration. She’s got a loose blouse on, and
text: worn jeans, and about a billion bangles on her right wrist.
text: She touches the hood, but it’s a little too hot. A second try
text: and she gets it open and is met with a cloud of white steam.
text: She looks around, somewhat helplessly. There aren’t that many
text: cars on the road. Those that are out zoom pass without
text: seeming to notice her.
text: But one car passes and SWERVES over to the shoulder about
text: fifty feet in front of her. It’s an old CHEVY CUTLASS.
text: The door opens, and a man gets out.
text: His name is FORREST TUCKER. He’s wearing a BLUE SUIT and as
text: he gets out of the car he puts a matching hat atop his head.
text: He looks quite striking and dapper, there on the side of the
dialog: road.
text: He walks towards her. She watches him, a bit suspicious at
text: first. When he’s close enough, he shouts...
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Need some help?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Maybe.
text: They both look at the steam coming from under the hood.
text: Clearly bit more than a maybe situation.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Lemme take a look...
text: She gives him an ‘all yours’ gesture. He walks up to the
text: engine and peers in, waving away the vapors.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: ...damn thing just started choking
text: up about a mile back.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: Yellow Rev. (4/4/17)
speaker_heading: JEWEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I was gonna try to make it to the
dialog: next exit but...
text: He looks for a long time. Long enough for a burst of radiator
text: steam to escape the engine. Jewel finally asks:
speaker_heading: JEWEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So what, you think it’s the
dialog: radiator?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Could be.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Is it shot?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Wouldn't be surprised.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Do you know anything about cars?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Eh, not really.
text: Another belch of steam as we cut to...
scene_heading: INT./EXT. FORREST’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: They’re driving now, in Forrest’s car. Jewel sits in the
text: passenger seat. Forrest keeps stealing glances at her.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Where were you headed?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Nowhere, really.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Just driving.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Just driving.
text: She glances into his back seat. Sees a briefcase there,
text: inconspicuously tucked into the corner.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: That was a nice truck.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Yeah, you think so?
dialog: Blue Rev. (3/10/17) 3.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Me too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I stole it.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Did you?
text: She lets him hang a beat before...
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: No. It was my husband's car.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Ah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where’s he at?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Well. He's dead, so...that’s where
dialog: he’s at.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Gotcha.
text: Another long beat. An unexpectedly comfortable silence.
speaker_heading: FORREST (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I ask your name?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Jewel.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Your name’s Jewel?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: That's really your name? Jewel?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: You don’t believe me?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: No, I believe you. It just suits
dialog: you is all.
dialog: Blue Rev. (3/10/17) 4.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: What about you - what's your name?
dialog: Handsome-In-A-Blue-Suit?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: My name’s Bob. Bob Callahan.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: And where are you headed, Bob
dialog: Callahan?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Home. I’ve been on the road for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I’m in sales.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Selling what?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Oh, this and that. What’re you
dialog: looking for?
text: He shoots her a killer grin that stops the line of
dialog: questioning dead.
text: She notices that he’s wearing HEARING AIDES.
scene_heading: EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 3
text: THROUGH THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW OF A SERVICE STATION: Forrest
text: pulls right up to the front door. He and Jewel walk inside
text: and Forrest rings a bell at the counter. He rings it a bunch
dialog: of times.
text: A guy in a mechanic’s coveralls, hands covered in grease
text: calls from the back.
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I can hear you. What
dialog: can I do for you?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: This young lady needs a tow truck.
dialog: Blue Rev. (3/10/17) 5.
text: He keeps RINGING THAT BELL, repeatedly, playfully, like a
text: little kid annoying their parent. Jewel can’t help but blush.
text: CAMERA ZOOMS IN on her face as that bell goes DING DING DING.
scene_heading: INT. BLUE JAY CAFE - DAY 4
text: Now they’re seated at a little restaurant nearby, waiting for
text: her car to get towed. Cups of coffee between them and mostly-
text: finished slices of pumpkin pie.
text: Awkward silence. Broken by...
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: You like horses.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: What?
text: He points to a pin on her blouse. A little silver horse.
speaker_heading: JEWEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh yeah. Yeah, I do.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: So - you're a cowgirl and you like
dialog: to steal cars. What else am I
dialog: missing?
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: That's pretty much it. I've got
dialog: three horses -
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Three horses.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: - and I ride every day, and -
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: What are their names?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: The horses?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
text: Wiley, Clementine and Dorothy Jean.
dialog: Blue Rev. (3/10/17) 6.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Dorothy Jean. Dorothy Jean sounds
dialog: like my kinda gal.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Do you ride?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Me? No. I never have. It’s on my
dialog: list.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: What list is that?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: The list of things I wanna do.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Well, you better hurry up.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: How come?
text: Beat. She shrugs off that question. The waitress comes with
dialog: the check.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: All right then. Whenever you're
dialog: ready.
text: She leaves the check in its little folder on the table. Jewel
text: reaches for it but Forrest grabs it first.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: No, you - come on, you gave me a
dialog: lift, it’s the last I can do -
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Don’t worry about it.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Please. I insist.
text: A beat, and then Forrest slides the check back to her.
dialog: Blue Rev. (3/10/17) 7.
speaker_heading: JEWEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Thank you.
text: Forrest watches as she peels a few single bills from a thick
text: clip of them in her purse. She lays them on the check.
text: A beat passes, just long enough for Jewel to have to reach
text: slightly to find her way back into the conversation.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: So what did you say you do? Sales?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: ..-Yeah.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Like door to door, or...
speaker_heading: FORREST JEWEL (CONT'D)
dialog: ++No, no. .+-bible salesman?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Definitely not.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: I'm kidding.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Can I be honest with you? I don’t
dialog: know the first thing about sales.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: oh.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I made that up.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: So...what do you do then?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: It’s a secret.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Oh is it now?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: And why is that?
dialog: Blue Rev. (3/10/17) 8.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Because if I told you, you might
dialog: not want to see me again.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Who said I was going to see you
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Would you?
text: She hesitates for a moment - sizing Forrest up once more time
text: - and then grabs the bill the waitress left, tears off a
text: piece of it, takes a pen out from her purse and writes
text: something down. A PHONE NUMBER. She slides it back to him.
text: His eyes dart from the paper to her and then back again.
text: Then he tears off a larger piece of paper off the same bill.
text: He reaches across the table and takes her pen, and then
text: quickly, deliberately writes something down on that piece of
dialog: paper. We don’t see what he writes.
text: He slides it across the table to her.
text: She takes it, looks at it, puts on her reading glasses and
text: then bursts out laughing.
text: She looks back to him.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: This isn’t...you aren’t serious are
dialog: you?
text: He shrugs, like it’s no big deal.
speaker_heading: JEWEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a joke.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Why would you even tell me then?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: ‘Cause I trust you.
dialog: Pink Rev. (3/24/17) 9.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: You just met me.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Sometimes you just know.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: With me. You know.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Well, you're still sitting here.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Because I don’t believe you. And if
dialog: I did believe you
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: What would be worse? If I was lying
dialog: about this, or telling the truth?
dialog: Long beat, and then...
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Prove it.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: You want me to prove it?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: What‘1l you do if I can?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: I won't walk out on you.
text: Forrest looks around.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Right now.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: Blue Rev. (3/10/17) 10.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I’m not gonna do that.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: See. I knew it.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Not because I can’t. It just isn’t
dialog: my style.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Not your style.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: You've got a style.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Tell me what that is then.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Well, first of all - this place.
dialog: This place isn’t my style. But say
dialog: this were a bank. You've got that
text: counter up there, the girl behind
dialog: it. You find a good spot, like the
dialog: one we've got here, and you wait.
dialog: You wait and you watch and you get
dialog: into the swing of things and when
dialog: the time feels right - maybe it’s a
dialog: couple hours, maybe it’s a couple
dialog: days but when it feels right you
dialog: make your move. You stroll right
dialog: in. Easiest thing in the world.
dialog: There’s the girl. You walk right up
dialog: and look her in the eye and say
dialog: ma’am, this is a robbery. I’ve got
dialog: a gun. You show it, like this. You
dialog: say: take a bag and fill it up. I’m
dialog: keeping my eye on you. Don’t try
dialog: anything funny. I like you. I like
dialog: you a whole lot. I might just be
dialog: falling for you. Don’t go breaking
dialog: my heart now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And she'd fill up a bag with money,
dialog: and she'd give it to me, and you’d
dialog: go out the way you came in and
dialog: she'd...
dialog: Buff Rev. (5/8/17) 1.
text: He looks at Jewel.
speaker_heading: FORREST (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, you tell me what she'd do.
text: HOLD ON Jewel, who doesn’t realize she was holding her
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: CUT TO BLACK
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - DAWN 5

scene_heading: EXT. SAN QUENTIN YARD - MORNING 8
text: San Quentin: a square fortress of a prison, positioned on the
text: very edge of the San Francisco Bay. Almost 100 years old now.
text: Like a crumbling castle, on the verge of collapsing right
text: into the icy waters of the Pacific.
text: Forrest crosses the prison yard from one of the wings to the
text: PRISON WORKSHOP. He's walking with other prisoners, escorted
text: by a guard. He walks with a slight shuffle, his head hung a
dialog: little low.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON WORKSHOP - DAY 9
text: Forrest stands at a heavy duty POWER DRILL in the prison shop
text: - his place in the assembly line that’s putting together
dialog: cheap furniture for institutional use. Raw lumber goes in one
text: end, chairs and tables come out the other.
text: WALLER is working on another machine. TEDDY on yet another.
text: A PRISON TRUSTEE named JIM supervises the shop from the
text: comfort of a recliner. He’s petting one of the many CATS that
text: run amongst the piles of lumber.
text: A WHISTLE BLOWS. Forrest looks up again, glancing through the
text: sawdust at the clock hanging over the shop door. 12 PM.
text: The other prisoners shut off their power tools, put down
text: their hammers and saws. TRUSTEE JIM struggles to raise
text: himself from his armchair. The cat in his lap isn’t keen on
dialog: getting up.
speaker_heading: TRUSTEE JIM
dialog: (to cat)
dialog: c'mon Downsers. Ooopsie-daisy.
text: The split second he’s alone, Forrest’s demeanor changes. His
text: shoulders straighten. He lifts his head.
text: He pulls the board off the table. He leaves the drill
text: running, leaving its whine to fill the air as he walks to the
text: back of the shop and grabs something from behind a STACK OF
dialog: WwooD.

dialog: there’s a part of me that always

text: ..-but that’s when he sees the STATE TROOPER CARS on the

dialog: End of the line, Forrest Tucker.

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT

speaker_heading: JEWEL

speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: - and I’d imagine that there would

speaker_heading: Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 69.

speaker_heading: FORREST

dialog: Yellow Rev. (4/4/17) 70.
text: John Hunt looks like he’s seen a ghost. He recognizes

speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT

speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I thought so. With the - what do

speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT

speaker_heading: FORREST

speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: Getting there.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Can I help you with that?
text: It takes John a moment to realize that Forrest is talking
dialog: about his tie.
text: Forrest has a twinkle in his eye as he reaches out, grabs the
text: tie and makes quick work of it, undoing the bad knot already
text: in place and quickly reworking it, completely unaware that
dialog: John Hunt knows exactly who he is.
speaker_heading: FORREST (CONT'D)
dialog: Learned how to do this in Catholic
dialog: school.
text: Forrest tightens the knot.
speaker_heading: FORREST (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: Forrest Tucker.
dialog: Forrest turns.
speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT (CONT'D)
dialog: I know who you are.

scene_heading: INT. BLUE JAY CAFE - CONTINUOUS 121
dialog: 
text: John Hunt walks out of the vestibule just in time to see the

text: He sits down at the counter for a second. Puts his head in

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: fer eee
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: What?
text: John sits up, practically bleary-eyed, and looks towards the

text: It’s empty.
text: Forrest has flown the coop.
text: John looks to his left. Past the women’s room to...
text: THE BACK EXIT.
text: He hurries out, pushing the door open and stepping into...
scene_heading: EXT. BACK PARKING LOT / BLUE JAY CAFE - CONTINUOUS 121B
text: He stands there in the back, under the solitary street light.
text: He’s completely alone.
dialog: No sign of Forrest anywhere.
scene_heading: INT. / EXT. FORREST’S CAR - NIGHT 122

dialog: 127
dialog: Pink Rev. (3/24/17) 7.
text: Jewel is watching Forrest. Wondering. He glances her way and
text: catches her. She doesn’t look down.
text: Then he steps on the gas. His car shoots exuberantly down the
dialog: North Texas highway.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 123
text: Forrest fills up the gas tank.
text: He goes to the little convenience store to pay.
text: While she waits, Jewel glances at the glove compartment.
text: She opens it and sees the GUN in there
text: She stares at it. Her face tightens a bit.
text: She shuts the glove compartment again before he returns.
scene_heading: EXT. JEWEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT 124
dialog: 
text: Forrest pulls up outside Jewel's house.
dialog: Any conversation or farewells or plans for future dates have
dialog: already transpired. No more words necessary.
text: She gets out of the car and slowly walks up to the front
text: door. She stops here and there en route, turning around,
text: looking back at Forrest, just to see if he really is staying
dialog: where he is.
text: Eventually, she makes it to her front door. She unlocks it,
text: goes inside and slowly, gently closes it, keeping an eye on
dialog: Forrest the whole time
scene_heading: INT. JEWEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 125
text: Jewel shuts and locks the door. She leans against it for a
text: moment, thinking about what’s just transpired.
scene_heading: INT. FORREST’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 126
text: Forrest is maybe having a similar thought.
scene_heading: INT. JEWEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 127
text: Jewel waits a moment more. She can hear his engine idling

dialog: Pink Rev. (3/24/17) 71a.
text: ...to find Forrest striding towards her.
dialog: 128
dialog: 129
dialog: 130
dialog: Buff Rev. (5/8/17) 72.
text: He walks right up to her and they kiss. The light from the
text: house and the barn across the drive casts them in silhucette.
text: A romantic moment, cloaked in mystery.
text: Still, no words are exchanged.
text: He pulls away. His face comes into the light. He’s confident,
dialog: assured.
text: She is not. But if he recognizes this, he doesn’t acknowledge
text: it. Instead, ever the gentleman, he tips his hat and strides
dialog: away.
text: The engine starts up, the car pulls away. Red tailights on
dialog: her face.
text: The door shuts for good.
scene_heading: INT. JEWEL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 128
text: Jewel walks deeper into the house.
text: She goes to the stove and picks up the tea kettle.
text: She goes to the sink and puts it under the faucet and turns
dialog: it on.
text: She’s so lost in thought that she doesn’t even notice that
text: the water is OVERFLOWING.
text: She sets it down on the burner and then walks over to her
text: table. She sits down there and looks out the window.
scene_heading: INT. FORREST’S CAR - NIGHT 129
text: Forrest drives home.
text: He rolls down the window. Letting the breeze ripple through
text: his hair once more.
scene_heading: EXT. FORREST’S HOUSE - NIGHT 130
text: Forrest pulls up to his house. As he’s getting out of the
text: car, he looks up at the house.
dialog: Something is not right.
text: TEDDY is sitting on the front porch. He stands as Forrest
text: notices him.
dialog: Buff Rev. (5/8/17) 72n.
text: Forrest is confused. He smiles a little bit and is about to
text: open his mouth to say something.
text: And then a LIGHT TURNS ON BEHIND HIM.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT SUMMERS
dialog: Forrest Tucker, you are under
dialog: arrest. Get out of the car!
dialog: 131
dialog: 132
dialog: 133
dialog: Buff Rev. (5/8/17) 73.
text: The house is surrounded by FBI AGENTS. They’re emerging from

text: the side of the house.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT SUMMERS (CONT’D)
dialog: Get out of the car with your hands
dialog: up now!
text: Teddy is aghast. There are agents rushing up to the porch,

text: Forrest ducks back INTO THE CAR and KEYS THE IGNITION.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT SUMMERS (CONT’D)
dialog: Stop! Don’t -
text: His engine BACKFIRES.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS 131
text: A block away.
text: GUNFIRE ERUPTS in the distance.
text: Then the sound of a SCREECHING CAR.
text: A moment later and Forrest's car, perforated with bullet
text: holes on one side, ZOOMS PAST US.
scene_heading: INT. FORREST’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 132
text: Forrest drives as fast as he can. Swerving around corners. He
text: can hear sirens behind him. Somehow he manages to evade them.
text: He looks down. There’s BLOOD coming from somewhere. He’s been
text: hit in the arm.
text: His front windshield is splintered from the gunfire. He can’t
text: see. The view out the window is a kaleidoscope of light and
dialog: shadow.
scene_heading: EXT. FORREST’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 133
dialog: 
text: He pulls onto a busy road and quickly swerves over to the
dialog: shoulder.
text: He doesn’t waste a beat. He grabs his GUN from the glove

dialog: 134
dialog: 135
dialog: Pink Rev. (3/24/17) 74.
scene_heading: EXT. FORREST’S CAR / BUSY STREET - CONTINUOUS 134
text: He steps into oncoming traffic and waves down the first car
text: he sees. The headlights flood around him.
text: It’s a shitty old HONDA. A woman (SANDY) is behind the wheel ¥*
text: and her 8-year old son buckled into the backseat. She sees
text: the blood on him.
speaker_heading: SANDY *
dialog: Oh my god, are you - what on earth
dialog: happened? Are you hurt?
text: Forrest thinks fast. Even as she’s trying to process the
text: sight of this old man, Forrest is walking towards her, around
dialog: to the passenger side...
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I need a ride, please, ma’am. I
dialog: need to get to a hospital.
text: He opens the door and shuts the passenger seat and pulls the
text: door shut.
speaker_heading: SANDY *
dialog: Oh - okay...do you...oh my god...
text: She sees HIS GUN now. She steps on the gas. *
scene_heading: INT. / EXT. HONDA - CONTINUOUS 135
text: As they speed off down the road, Sandy notices the sirens *
text: ringing all around her.
text: She looks to Forrest, who's crouching down extremely low in
text: her seat. Too low for anyone else to see. She begins to
dialog: realize exactly what’s going on.
text: Her eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: SANDY *
dialog: Please...my boy...
text: It takes Forrest a moment to process these words. Then it
text: occurs to him to look into the backseat. For the first time,
text: he sees the LITTLE BOY back there. Scrunched nervously in the
text: corner, a few toy cars spread out on the seat beside him.
text: The boy meets his gaze dead on.

speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: Okay. Pull over here.
scene_heading: EXT. STORE - NIGHT 136
text: The Honda drives away, leaving Sandy and her son in front of
text: a well-lit grocery store.
text: The tail lights recede on their faces.
scene_heading: INT. HONDA - NIGHT 137
text: The Honda is parked somewhere now. Somewhere like a parking
text: lot, on the side of a building.
text: Forrest takes his tie and wraps his arm with it, pulling it
text: tight. Wincing as he does so.
scene_heading: INT. HONDA - LATER 138
dialog: 
dialog: Forrest drives.
text: The sound of Jackson C. Frank’s Blues Run The Game come on.
speaker_heading: JACKSON C. FRANK
dialog: Take a boat to England, baby,
dialog: Take a boat to Spain
dialog: Where I have been and gone
dialog: Wherever I’ve been and gone

scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 139
text: Down the country road. Headlights cutting through the
dialog: distance.
text: The sky is starting to turn blue with the coming dawn.
scene_heading: EXT. JEWEL’S HOUSE - DAWN 140
text: He pulls up to Jewel's house.
dialog: 141
dialog: 142
dialog: Blue Rev. (3/10/17) 76.
text: Gets out, goes to the front door. Tries the handle. It’s
dialog: locked.
text: He raises his hand to knock...
text: ...and then freezes.
text: His hand drops.
text: He stands there on the porch for a moment. Looking around,
dialog: trying to decide what to do next.
scene_heading: INT. STABLES - CONTINUOUS 141
text: He enters the stables and walks up to one of the horses.
dialog: Dorothy Jean.
text: He strokes her nose, whispering to her. She tosses her head
text: and neighs at him.
scene_heading: EXT. STABLES - MOMENTS LATER 142
dialog: 
text: He rides her out of the stables, out into the pasture.
text: He has a blanket pulled from the stables wrapped around his
dialog: back.
text: The sun is just beginning to come up.
text: That Jackson C. Frank song is still going as he rides Dorothy
text: Jean across the rolling fields of Jewel’s land.
text: It seems to stretch out forever. Eventually he gets to a
text: section of the wire fence that’s TORN DOWN and rides through
dialog: it.
text: He rides down the center of a dried up river bed. Following
dialog: its bend.
text: Then he climbs out of it and rides to the top of a hill.
text: From here he can look out and see the land around him.
text: It seems like he’s been riding much longer than he has. Feels
dialog: like he shouldn’t be able to see where he came from.
text: But no, he can still see Jewel’s house, like a tiny
text: miniature, way down in the distance.
dialog: And he can see the road...
dialog: 143
speaker_heading: Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 77.
text: ..-and the line of POLICE CARS driving down it. Six or seven
text: of them, lights flashing, heading towards Jewel's house.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - JOHN HUNT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 143

speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT (0.C.)
dialog: Is he okay?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes. Yeah, I understand. Thanks for
dialog: letting me know. Goodnight.
text: She hears the phone click.

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: (sleepily)
dialog: What happened?
text: Her voice has the sing-song quality of someone who’s not
dialog: quite awake.
speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: Well. They caught him.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: They did?
speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: They found one guy, and that guy

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: AHH
dialog: *
dialog: ae
speaker_heading: Green Rev. (mm/dd/yy) TIA.
speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: Well. I guess he’s gonna go to
dialog: prison.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Hmmmm. That’s too bad.

dialog: Pink Rev. (3/24/17) 78.
speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: Yeah, I guess so.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: JOHN HUNT
dialog: Don’t be.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 144
text: Forrest lies in a hospital bed, in a room watched by a police
dialog: officer.
text: He looks rough. All bandaged up, with a tube in his nose.
text: Some machine beeping away in the background.
text: He’s just conscious enough to see John Hunt enter.
dialog: There’s no need for words. It’s pretty clear Forrest isn’t in
dialog: any shape to hold a conversation anyway.
text: Instead, John Hunt opens his wallet, pulls out a 100 DOLLAR
text: BILL and sets it on Forrest’s bedside table.
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN on the bill.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRISON MEETING AREA - DAY 145
text: Now Jewel sits in a prison meeting area. A little table, lit
text: in equal parts by fluorescents and sunlight. Brick walls, a
dialog: candy machine.
text: Forrest sits opposite her. Looking old and disheveled.
text: Slumped in a wheelchair. His prison garb hangs loosely from
text: his body. He appears very small.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: So you lied to me about your name.
text: He nods his head.
speaker_heading: JEWEL (CONT'D)
dialog: But I guess you told me the truth
dialog: about everything else, so...I
dialog: shouldn't be so angry.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I figured you knew.
dialog: Yellow Rev. (4/4/17) 79.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: The detectives asked me that. If I
dialog: knew. Or if I’d had even the
text: faintest a clue.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: What'd you say?
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: I said of course not.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: Me too.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: JEWEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You had so much money. They said
dialog: they pulled almost half a million
dialog: dollars out of your floorboards?
dialog: What were you going to do with it?
dialog: Why on earth would you keep on...
text: Her voice trails off.
text: He shrugs, and then pulls something out of his pocket and
text: gives it to her. It’s a few pages of lined notebook paper,
text: folded up like a letter.
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: I wrote this up for you.
text: She takes it and unfolds it. It’s a list.
speaker_heading: JEWEL
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: FORREST
dialog: These are all the times I’ve broken
dialog: out before.
text: Jewel puts on her glasses and begins to read this catalog of
text: great escapes. Each one is numbered, with a year and a
text: location. An impressive record of a life spent absconding.
text: Jewel puts on her glasses and begins to read...
