dialog: so what.
text: Stocky Boy passes a folded note labeled “Danielle”.
speaker_heading: MR. POTTER
dialog: Most excellent. But I know how it
dialog: is. I was young too. Our hormones

text: DANIELLE (16) raises her hand, her fingernail polish is
dialog: chipped. She’s that girl that every high school has. The one
text: who is more mature, more sexual, and somehow, just
text: inexplicably dirty. Her clothes are always too small, her
text: hair is teased. She’is a skinny girl with disproportionately
text: large breasts, which are her pride and joy.
text: Mr. Potter notices Danielle, but does not point. She speaks
dialog: without being called upon.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: What are your thoughts on the
dialog: pullout method?
speaker_heading: MR. POTTER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DANTELLE

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MULRAY (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you have any positive males in
dialog: your life?
text: Danielle, pulis out her compact, fixes her lipstick.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: No, I'm pretty sure everybody’s
dialog: negative, but you can never be too
dialog: careful.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MULRAY
dialog: I mean...
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: It's none of your business.
text: She begins poofing her hair.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MULRAY
dialog: You are an exasperating girl, Ms,

dialog: expulsion. Mrs. Pierce will give
dialog: you your schedule.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: What's to know? It’s like that one
text: room in the basement all the time.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MULRAY
dialog: You're a smart girl, you just make
dialog: poor choices. If you do your
dialog: homework and stop being a
dialog: distraction to others, you’li be
dialog: back with the normal kids in no
dialog: time.
text: Danielle starts to leave.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MULRAY (CONT’D)
dialog: Danielle, nobody likes a dirty
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Gosh, thanks for that really
dialog: awesome advice.
text: Principal Mulray busies himself with some paperwork.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE (CONT‘D)
text: By the way, the challenger blew up.
text: Danielle exits.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MULRAY
dialog: (into speaker phone)
dialog: Mrs. Plerce, hold my calls.
text: Principal Mulray closes his mini blinds, sits across from

text: table apart, chewing his nails)
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: MRS. HATCHER
dialog: Okay. Today we are going to start a
dialog: project that will hopefully teach
dialog: us that parenthood is no joke,
dialog: right Sabrina?
text: SABRINA, a very pregnant teen, shakes her head, “no”.
scene_heading: MRS. HATCHER
dialog: Okay, everybody partner up with
dialog: someone of the opposite sex.
text: Clarke watches as the other students partner up. His face is
text: bruised from the morning beating. His lip is cut.
scene_heading: MRS. HATCHER
dialog: Who doesn't have a partner?
text: THREE STUDENTS, Clarke included, raise their hands.
scene_heading: MRS. HATCHER
dialog: Okay, Benita, why don’t you move
text: over next to Juan. And Clarke...
text: Clarke seems resigned to the humiiiation of people not
dialog: knowing what to do with him.
scene_heading: MRS. HATCHER
dialog: »-we‘ll think of something.
text: Clarke puts a set of headphones on his head, presses play on
dialog: a walkman. Melissa Manchester's ‘You Should Hear How They
text: Talk About You’ is faintly heard.
text: The classroom door swings open, Danielle enters, hands a pink
dialog: slip to Mrs. Hatcher. ,
scene_heading: MRS. HATCHER
dialog: Class, this is Danielle Edmonston,
dialog: she’s joining us today, say
dialog: hello...
text: The class is completely uninterested.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: {vaising a black power
dialog: fist)

text: This gets a stunned, silent response.
scene_heading: MRS. HATCHER
dialog: Danielle, we were just partnering
dialog: up. Why don’t you have a seat with
dialog: Clarke back there.
text: Danielle plops herself across from Clarke at his private
text: table, he removes his headphones.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: You're that fag, right?
text: Clarke bites his thumbnail.
text: Mrs. Hatcher pushes a cart between the desks, handing out
text: sacks of flour. During the following speech, Clarke and
text: Danielle stare at one another in silence.
scene_heading: MRS. HATCHER
dialog: For the next six weeks you are
dialog: married to your partner, and these
dialog: precious sacks of flour are your
dialog: bundles of joy. You will have to
dialog: name your baby, change your baby,
dialog: and most importantly, make sure no
dialog: harm comes to him-slash-her. You
dialog: will make daily entry journals of
dialog: your experiences.
text: Mrs. Hatcher sets a sack of flour between Clarke and
text: Danielle. Danielle looks from the dumpy sack of white flour
dialog: to Clarke.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: It takes after you.
scene_heading: EXT. NORMAN HIGH SCHOOL LOCKERS-— LATER
text: Danielle puts her books into her locker and slams the door,
text: revealing Clarke behind it holding the sack of flour.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: CLARKE
dialog: We're partners.
text: Danielle prowls down the hallway, Clarke right on her tail.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: No offense bud, but my designated
dialog: is, as of this morning, no longer
dialog: designated.
speaker_heading: CLARKE
dialog: I don‘t know what that means.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
text: Danielle's three D’s of dating.
dialog: Discriminate, designate, dump. And
dialog: since the unfortunate dumping of
dialog: Greg, due to his lack of sanitary
dialog: respect, I am onto the next, and
dialog: quite frankly as a dick smoker you
dialog: don’t qualify.
speaker_heading: CLARKE
dialog: But we’re supposed to be married.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: We're not on the samé level.
speaker_heading: CLARKE
dialog: Ms. Hatcher said we need to be good
dialog: parents.
text: Danielle sees what she’s looking for, a hot prospect named
text: BOBBY(i6, thin, but cute), smoking in his car with friends.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: (pointing at Bobby)
dialog: Discriminate.
text: She pulls a mirror out of her bag and hands it to Clarke.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Hold this.
text: Clarke holds the mirror up as Danielle fixes herself.
speaker_heading: - DANIELLE
dialog: Ms Hatcher is a hippie twat, and
dialog: you are currently lowering my
dialog: market value.
text: Danielle freshens her lipstick.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: CLARKE
dialog: Great,
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Designate.
text: Danielle struts over to Bobby’s car and knocks on the window.
speaker_heading: DANIELLE
dialog: Hey, you got a light?
dialog: (to the other guys)
dialog: Hey fellas.
text: Bobby lights Danielle's cigarette.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (knowing)

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You know what I heard about you?
speaker_heading: DANIELLE .
dialog: Don't believe everything you hear.
dialog: Unless it’s really good. Then it’s
dialog: true.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: i hear you're with the retards now.
text: The boys start to laugh, peel out, leaving Danielle in a
dialog: cloud of exhaust. :

text: tackle him again.
scene_heading: INT. DANIELLE’S DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER- AFTER SCHOOL
text: Danielle’s mom, SUE-ANN (mid-30's, but looks younger,
text: certainly not old enough to have a 16-year-old daughter.
text: Formerly trashy, she has cleaned up her act, but the
text: transformation isn’t entirely convincing). She is studying
text: the book of Mormon. She calls to Danielle as she heads to her
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: SUE-ANN
