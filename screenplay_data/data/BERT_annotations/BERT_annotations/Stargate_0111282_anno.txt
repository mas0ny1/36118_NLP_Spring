scene_heading: PRIMITIVE SKETCHES E.C.U.
text: Etched on stone, a JACKAL. Another of a GAZELLE, a spear
text: piercing its skin. Primitive, yet dramatic tribal etchings.
text: The SOUND of ancient CHANTING is HEARD. Widen to REVEAL...
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE, NORTH AFRICA - SUNSET 1
text: A young BOY chisels his artwork into the stone ROCKFACE at
text: the edge of this valley. An old MEDICINE MAN, his face
text: painted with bizarre white stripes, CHANTS nearby.
text: The boy abruptly stops his work at the SOUND of distant CRIES.
text: Quickly he climbs the stone. Standing at the top he SEES...
speaker_heading: HUNTERS.
text: RETURNING FROM A KILL. THEY MARCH TOWARDS A SMALL CAMPSITE. 2
text: The tribes people rushing to greet them.
dialog: Super up: North Africa 8000 B.C.
speaker_heading: OMITTED 3
scene_heading: A BLAZING FIRE - LATER THAT NIGHT 4
text: Silhouetted tribesmen dancing in bizarre animal MASKS. Feet
text: STOMPING. The young Boy stares at the fire, SPARKS rising
text: into the air. We PAN UP following the sparks into the sky.
text: A full moon.
text: A SHADOW is suddenly cast across the moon, blotting it out.
scene_heading: INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 5
text: The young Boy sleeps. Above him hangs an odd carving that
text: slowly begins to RATTLE. The tent's fabric begins to FLAP.
text: The Boy's eyes pop open. He HEARS the sounds of a quickly
text: brewing storm. Footsteps. People hurrying, calling out to
text: each other. Suddenly the tent's entrance flap SAILS OPEN.
text: BRIGHT LIGHT pours in through the entrance.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 6
text: The Boy exits his tent, staring at the light, intrigued. A
text: storm building all around. Unnatural and eerie.
text: Panicked, the tribesmen run in fear, racing away from the
text: light. The Medicine man, on his knees CHANTING.
dialog: 10
dialog: 11
text: The only one without fear, the Boy pushes through them,
text: towards the light. Tents begin to RIP from their posts in
text: the strong GALE WINDS.
text: As the frightened clan retreats, the young Boy moves closer
text: and closer to the light, squinting through the blurring sands.
text: A loud ROARING SOUND, building in ferocity.
text: Slowly we PUSH into an extreme CLOSE UP of the young Boy's
text: eyes which widen. If we could only see what he sees...

scene_heading: THE GREAT PYRAMID - SUNSET 8
text: A glowing orange setting SUN just above the pyramid's peak.
text: A car drives past.
scene_heading: Super up: GIZA, EGYPT - 1928
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SUNSET 9
text: PROFESSOR LANGFORD and his nine year old daughter CATHERINE,
text: who reads from a thick text book, are RATTLING in the back
dialog: seat.
scene_heading: EXT. DIGGING SITE - GIZA - SUNSET 10
text: The car SCREECHES to a halt. The passenger door opens and
text: Professor Langford JUMPS out. Catherine follows.
text: As they make their way down the ravine we slowly reveal the
text: breadth of this work site. Hundreds of Arab men digging
text: away in the sand.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN TAYLOR 11
text: Is crouched on the ground dusting off three large TABLETS
text: covered in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. Professor Langford
text: walks up behind him, staring in awe.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Cover stones. We found them this
dialog: afternoon.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Amazing. But why did you move them?
text: Catherine walks over to a small table, examining other

text: SYMBOL of the sun emblazoned on a gold disk.
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
dialog: 14
dialog: 15
dialog: 16
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
text: There was something hidden underneath.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: Hidden?
text: Taylor leads Langford over to a large digging pit several
text: yards away. Slowly we TRACK across the sand, over the lip
text: of the digging pit revealing a handful of workers struggling
text: to secure ropes onto something hidden beyond our view.
text: Suddenly the ropes grow taut as they begin to lift.
scene_heading: LARGE METALLIC RING 12
text: over twenty feet in diameter. The RING is slowly lifted out
text: of the pit revealing its shape and structure. It doesn't
dialog: seem to belong to ancient Egypt.
dialog: And perhaps not even this world.
scene_heading: ANGLE - TAYLOR AND LANGFORD 13
text: As they stare in wonder at this newly found treasure. Young
text: Catherine squeezes in between the two.
speaker_heading: LANGFORD
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What is that thing, Taylor?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I wish I knew.
speaker_heading: THE RING 14

speaker_heading: CRACK.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - RAIN - DAY 16
text: A cold rainy winter day. Traffic gridlock. Horns honking,
text: cabbies yelling. A grey LIMOUSINE is stuck in traffic.
text: Super up: NEW YORK, PRESENT DAY Through the rain-soaked
text: passenger window we see an ELDERLY WOMAN impatiently checking
text: her watch. Unheard by us, she speaks to her DRIVER who exits
text: and opens the passenger door for her.
text: Taking an umbrella from her driver, the Elderly Woman steps

scene_heading: marked: ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME 17
text: Testing the microphone, the M.C. adjusts the feedback as he
text: leans close to address a gathering of distinguished
dialog: Archaeologists.
dialog: M.C.
dialog: Our next guest speaker today will be
dialog: an extraordinary young man...
scene_heading: BOOKS AND PAPERS 18
text: Clumsily this stack of books and papers are organized atop a
text: man's lap. Gathered together, they're lifted as the man
text: attempts to make his way out of his seat, down the aisle.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Excuse me... Pardon me...
dialog: M.C.
dialog: ...He graduated with his masters at
dialog: the age of 20 and speaks eleven
dialog: different languages. He has written
dialog: several seminal articles on the
dialog: comparative linguistics of the Afro-
dialog: Asiatic language groups and the
dialog: development of the Egyptian language
dialog: from the Archaic Period to the Old
dialog: Kingdom. Please let me introduce to
dialog: you, Daniel Jackson.
text: CRASH. The books TUMBLE to the floor. As he leans down to
text: pick them up we SEE for the first time, DANIEL JACKSON,
text: nervously retrieving his belongings.
scene_heading: ANGLE - PROFESSORS 19
text: An older PROFESSOR leans over to his companion.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Ah, another Wunderkind.
speaker_heading: COMPANION
dialog: I've got socks older than this kid.
text: Daniel makes his way to the microphone.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You, Sir. What kind of car do you
dialog: drive?
text: Daniel points to the Professor who made the remark.
dialog: 20
dialog: 21
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: My car? Um..a Ford.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: A model T?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: (peeved)
dialog: I'm not that old. It's an Escort.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: An Escort. Power steering, fuel
dialog: injection. Modern "developments."
text: Ford starts with a model T then
dialog: "develops" into an Escort.
text: The audience doesn't get where Daniel's going with this.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Why didn't Egyptian culture develop?
dialog: Their sciences, art, mathematics,
dialog: everything was complete from the
dialog: very beginning. Why? Maybe, Egyptian
dialog: civilization was not a "development"
dialog: but a legacy!
text: There is an audible REACTION from the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME 20
text: The Elderly Woman walks past the beautifully displayed
dialog: Egyptian artifacts.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (0.S.)
dialog: The Mastaba tombs around the pyramid
text: are covered with hieroglyphics; names,
dialog: titles of owners, lists of offerings.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME 21
text: The Elderly Woman enters from the back of the room, her eyes
text: fixed on Daniel. Absently she fingers the GOLDEN SUN DISK
text: hanging from around her neck. This is CATHERINE LANGFORD,
dialog: no longer the child we met in Egypt.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: But the pyramid, the greatest
dialog: structure ever erected, has no
dialog: writings whatsoever. Why?
text: An imposing older man, PROFESSOR THOMAS interrupts.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Mr. Jackson, you've conveniently
dialog: left out the fact that Colonel Vyse
dialog: discovered quarrymen's inscriptions
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: of Khufu's name written within the
dialog: Pyramid.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: His discovery was a fraud.
text: The room ERUPTS in angry dissent.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You can prove that, I hope?
text: With surprising speed, Daniel draws a series of hieroglyphics
text: on the black board behind the podium.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: This was the cartouche Vyse claimed
dialog: to have found in the relieving
text: chambers above the King's Chamber of
dialog: the pyramid.
text: He circles the first symbol (a clear circle with a dot in
dialog: the middle).
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: But this symbol, representing the
dialog: first consonant in the name Khufu is
dialog: incorrect. The correct symbol is...
text: He draws a circle with the center darkened.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the same exact misspelling
dialog: of Khufu's name that appeared in
dialog: Wilkinson's Materia Hieroglphyica,
dialog: the book that Colonel Vyse used to
dialog: forge his big discovery. However,
dialog: in the very next edition of the same
dialog: book, they revised their translations
dialog: to correct this error.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The editor of this book admit his
dialog: mistake but we, the academic
dialog: community, refuse to.
text: AS several people begin to get out of their seats and walk
text: out, another PROFESSOR (#2) jumps to his feet, incensed.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR #2
dialog: Don't you think it's rather arrogant
dialog: to suggest the last hundred years of
dialog: academic research is a collection of
dialog: lies?!
dialog: He stands
dialog: join him,
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm simply saying that the great
dialog: pyramids of Giza were not built by
dialog: the Pharaohs of the fourth Dynasty.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR #3
dialog: This is ridiculous. I won't sit and
dialog: listen to this nonsense.
text: and exits the auditorium. As others in the audience
text: Catherine Langford steps forward.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Mr. Jackson, who do you think built
dialog: the pyramids?
text: There is an awkward silence as Daniel searches for an answer.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don't know.
text: A heavy set BEARDED MAN smiles and calls out.
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: Men from Atlantis?
text: The audience ERUPTS IN LAUGHTER, cueing more people to stand.
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Or Martians perhaps?!
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I didn't say that...
speaker_heading: BEARDED MAN
dialog: No, but you were about to.
text: More laughter. Daniel SEES more people filing out. Quickly
text: he tries to organize his notes but is clearly flustered.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: If we could just get back to the
dialog: subject. Perhaps their civilization
text: lies in the buried Wadis of Western
dialog: Sahara. In the Predynastic period
dialog: these areas would have been rich
dialog: with food and animals. New geological
text: evidence pre-dates that Sphinx to a
dialog: much earlier period, confirming my
text: hypothesis.. But as Daniel looks up
dialog: from his material he SEES the last
text: several people left in the room,
text: filing out the back door.
dialog: 22
dialog: 23
dialog: 24
dialog: 25
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE - DANIEL AT PODIUM 22
text: Alone in the room, Daniel stands at the podium. Sadly he
text: slowly closes his text.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Any questions?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE - SUBWAY EXIT - LATE AFTERNOON 23
text: Alone in a crowd, Daniel struggles with his books in the
text: rain as he exits the busy subway exit. Absently he steps
text: out into the street. HONK. A cab slams on the brakes, nearly
text: hitting him.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Wake up you idiot!
text: Startled, Daniel hurries out of harms way as he passes a
text: small FRUIT STAND. The ARMENIAN owner greets Daniel in his
text: native language, tossing him an apple.
text: Daniel responds with fluid ARMENIAN as he catches the apple
text: on his way over to an old brownstone building.
text: He steps around a grey LIMOUSINE double parked in front of
text: his building as he makes his way inside.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 24
text: Dripping wet, Daniel steps into the hallway. He stops as he
text: HEARS opera music playing through an open door at the end of
text: the hallway.
text: Slowly he makes his way to the open door only to find,
text: Catherine Langford, sitting inside, relaxed and smoking a
text: cigarette. She holds in her hand a bust of a beautiful
dialog: Egyptian woman.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (re: bust)
dialog: 14th century, B.C. Nice reproduction.
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 25
text: Taken off guard, Daniel walks into his apartment. His room
text: is a mess, multiple stacks of BOOKS line every wall,
text: hieroglyphic tracings and reproductions of Egyptian art.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How did you get in here?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Your landlord told me you're three
dialog: months behind in your rent, shame on
dialog: you.
text: Daniel puts down his drenched text books and removes his
text: dripping overcoat.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You were at the lecture.
text: Catherine returns the bust to a table next to a PHOTO of a
text: young couple.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Your parents?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Foster.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Oh, right. Your real parents died
dialog: in a plane crash in...'73?
text: She holds her cigarette out, requesting an ash tray.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
dialog: Why are you here?
text: Daniel puts a dead potted plant in front of Catherine.
text: Reluctantly she puts her cigarette out in its dirt.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: To offer you a job.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: A job? What job?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Translation. I want to put you to
dialog: work on some ancient Egyptian
text: hieroglyphics.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Since when is the military interested
dialog: in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Who said anything about the military?
text: Daniel walks close to her, defiantly.
dialog: 26
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: In front of my building is a grey
dialog: Lincoln town car with government
text: plates. Its chauffeur is wearing a
text: crewcut 'stead of a black cap. And
dialog: the only way you could have gotten
dialog: past my Nazi of a landlord was to
dialog: flash some pretty fancy credentials.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So why is the military interested in
dialog: ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics?
text: Catherine is clearly impressed. She smiles.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I wish I could tell you more but I
dialog: am not allowed.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What makes you think I'd take a job
dialog: I don't know anything about?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You mean beyond the fact that you
dialog: have no family, no friends, and no
dialog: hope of paying that stack of bills
dialog: sitting on your desk?
text: Daniel sneaks a sidelong glance at his mountain of mail.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, uh, yes.
text: Catherine stands, walks closer to Daniel. She pulls out a
text: snapshot from her bag and holds it in front of his face.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: To prove that your theories are right.
speaker_heading: THE PHOTO 26
text: A snapshot of the tablets found at Giza in 1928.
text: Mesmerized Daniel grabs at the photo, but Catherine quickly
text: pulls it away. She knows she's hooked him. She hands hima
text: stuffed envelope, instead.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Your travel plans.
text: She turns and heads for the door. Daniel calls out to her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm not big on flying.
dialog: 27
dialog: 28
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (0.S.)
dialog: Get over it.
text: Daniel watches her walk away, then stares at the envelope.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 27
text: A dark sedan with a GOVERNMENT SEAL comes to a stop in front
text: of a lower middle-class suburban house. Two OFFICERS in
text: military garb step out of the car and march to the front
text: door of the house.
dialog: Super up: Yuma, Arizona
text: As they walk, we SEE a black military FOLDER one of them
text: carries. The first Officer knocks on the door.
text: The door opens to reveal, SARAH, mid-thirties, tense. The
text: pain she carries tarnishes her once beautiful face.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Mrs O'Neil?
text: Seeing the Officer's military attire, she nods, moving away
text: from the door.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Come on in.
text: Sarah disappears into the house. The two Officers exchange
text: a glance and follow her inside.
scene_heading: INT. O'NEIL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 28
text: Immaculately kept, ordered. Sarah moves into the kitchen as
text: the two officers awkwardly make their way into the living
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Uh, Mrs O'Neil, is your husband at
dialog: home?
text: She answers from the kitchen where she continues her chores.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Do you think we might be able to
dialog: speak with him?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You can try.
dialog: 29
dialog: 30
dialog: 31
dialog: 32
dialog: 12.
text: Still she continues to clean in the kitchen. After a long
dialog: beat...
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: And where would we find him?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Last door, end of the hall.
text: The Officer nods his appreciation as he and his partner head
text: down the hall.
scene_heading: OFFICER'S P.O.V. - DOWN HALL 29
text: As they make their way down the hall, they reach an open
text: doorway at the hall's end. Peering in they SEE, a teenage
text: boy's room. Perfectly kept. Sports trophies, footballs,
dialog: etc.
text: As we TRACK across the room's belongings we FIND a man sitting
text: in a chair facing the window, his back towards us.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: Excuse me, Colonel O'Neil? We're
text: from General West's office.
text: But the man in the chair doesn't turn around.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Colonel?
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - COLONEL JACK O'NEIL 30
text: For the first time we see COLONEL JACK O'NEIL, long hair,
text: six day growth, intense and troubled eyes. There is nothing
text: military looking about this guy. He stares vacantly out the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SARAH'S P.O.V. - MOMENTS LATER 31
text: Sarah looks out the kitchen window and SEES the two Officers
text: returning to their car outside. Sarah turns and slowly walks
text: to the back of the house.
text: As she approaches an open bedroom door, she stops, peers
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: P.0O.V. - INTO BEDROOM 32
text: The black FOLDER laying on the bed. A pressed military
text: UNIFORM is laid down next to the folder.
dialog: 33

dialog: 36
dialog: 37
dialog: 13.
text: Pained, Sarah shuts her eyes and turns away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY 33
text: Quickly, we SAIL over the treetops through this dense forest
text: area. At the edge of the treeline we FIND a beat up and
text: bruised Chevy, sputtering up the windy mountain road.
dialog: Super up: Creek Mountain, Colorado
speaker_heading: OMITTED 34
scene_heading: EXT. GUARDED GATEWAY - DAY 35
text: The Chevy pulls up to a gate where two MARINES stand guard.
text: One walks up to Daniel's window. Daniel opens the envelope
text: Catherine gave him and hands some papers to the Guard.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Daniel Jackson. I think I'm supposed
dialog: to show this to.. SNEEZE. Daniel
text: grabs for a Kleenex.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Cold?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No. Allergies. Always happens when
dialog: I travel.
scene_heading: EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY 36
text: A group of MARINES are in the midsts of vigorous training.
text: Led by LIEUTENANT KAWALSKY, early thirties, big, friendly
text: and eager.
text: With a loud BACKFIRE, we SEE the Chevy making its way past.
text: Lt. Kawalsky signals for another soldier to take over, then
text: heads after Daniel.
text: As he walks away, the others stop and watch.
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - SAME 37
text: Tunneled into the side of a mountain, a large hollowed
text: entrance. Daniel has parked next to it and is struggling to
text: pull an enormous bag out of his trunk.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Daniel Jackson?
text: Startled, Daniel turns to see Kawalsky rushing up. Kawalsky
text: grabs and shakes Daniel's hand.
dialog: 38
dialog: 39
dialog: 40
dialog: 41
dialog: 42
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dr. Langford was worried you changed
dialog: your mind.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It took me three days to drive.
text: Again Daniel tries to lift his bag out but he can't.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Help you with that?
text: He reaches in for Daniel's bag.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Careful, books, they're very...
text: Effortlessly Kawalsky lifts the bag out with one hand,
text: SLAMMING the trunk down shut with the other.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: .. heavy.
text: He follows Kawalsky into the tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - SUNSET 38
text: DANIEL follows Kawalsky into the dark tunnel. Two large
text: CONCRETE DOORS open to reveal a METAL SHACK, a GUARD standing
text: alongside it. The guard hits a button on the desk and shack
text: OPENS exposing a STEEL CAGE inside. They walk over and enter.
scene_heading: INT. STEEL CAGE - CONTINUOUS 39
text: Suddenly with a loud hydraulic ROAR, the cage quickly DESCENDS
text: DOWNWARD. We WATCH as the cage DROPS down, deeper and deeper.
scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0.V. - THROUGH CAGE 40
text: Daniel counts the LARGE NUMBERS painted on the shaft walls
text: as they descend. They pass 18, 19, 20... so on.
text: Daniel tries to take it all in. Suddenly the cage STOPS.
text: The number reads 28. The two and the eight are separated as
text: the DOORS OPEN.
scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE - SAME 41
text: Several sterile hallways lead towards us, active with foot
dialog: traffic.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - TRACKING - CONTINUOUS 42
text: Daniel follows Kawalsky down the main hallway.
text: Walking out of an open office door is MEYERS, a balding middle-
text: aged scientist who extends his hand to Daniel as they walk.
dialog: 43
dialog: 44
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: Mr. Jackson, Dr. Gary Meyers.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hi. Where am I?
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
text: A nuclear missile silo.
text: Daniel turns to find BARBARA SHORE, late-thirties, walking
text: up alongside him.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Don't worry. It's been completely
dialog: converted. Barbara Shore. The token
text: Astrophysicist on the team.
text: Kawalsky stops at the end of the hall, turning back to Daniel.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: This is where you'll be working.
text: Kawalsky opens the door. They all enter.
scene_heading: INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS 43
text: Daniel's eyes widen. A large workroom. The walls are covered
text: with charcoal rubbings and photo enlargements of
text: hieroglyphics. On two large tables are various artifacts.
text: Meyers moves over to the back wall and pulls down a sheet
dialog: that was covering...
scene_heading: THE GIZA TABLETS (FROM THE OPENING) 44
text: The Giza tablets have been fastened to the wall. Daniel is
text: truly amazed, hypnotized. Standing near the tablets,
text: Catherine looks up from some papers and walks over to Daniel.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Glad you decided to join us.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Where did you find them?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Giza Plateau. 1928.
dialog: (pointing out parts
dialog: of tablets)
text: There are two lines of hieroglyphs.
text: The outer edge which has some familiar
dialog: figures, as you can see.
text: She points to a chalk board next to the hieroglyphics that
text: has a loose translation; YEAR 10 OF KING ?, SKY, RA, THE SUN
scene_heading: DISK, COFFIN, DOOR TO HEAVEN.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: And then there is the inner track,
dialog: here. These symbols, as you can
dialog: see, are unlike any ever found.
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Like Champillion with the Rosetta
dialog: Stone, we tried to compare the two
dialog: readings against each other for any
dialog: similarities.
text: Daniel, still in awe, walks over to the translation, examining
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's all wrong. what did you use,
dialog: Budge? Why do they keep reprinting
dialog: his books?
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: We tried decoding and translation
dialog: computer programs, used every known
dialog: technique, for years with no result...
text: Daniel erases the word TIME on the blackboard and replaces
text: it with the word YEARS. Peeved, Meyers steps forward.
speaker_heading: MEYERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Catherine stops him, watching Daniel, intrigued.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That's a curious word to use "qebeh."
text: Then an adverbial sedjem-en-ef with
text: a cleft subject "sealed and buried"...
dialog: (turning to Meyers)
dialog: NOT coffin.
text: Shore walks up next to Kawalsky, together they watch Daniel
text: work quickly re-working the translation.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: (to Daniel)
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: "Forever to eternity for all time".
dialog: You really should have gotten that
dialog: one.
text: Shore looks over at Meyers with an "I told you so" attitude.
text: As Daniel steps back from the board we SEE he has nearly
text: completed the translation of the top part of the Tablets.
dialog: 45
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This should read, A MILLION YEARS
text: INTO THE SKY IS RA, SUN GOD. SEALED
text: AND BURIED FOR ALL TIME HIS...
text: Then Daniel circles the last word.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not DOOR to HEAVEN. The proper
dialog: translation is... STARGATE.
text: There is a stunned beat. They can't believe how fast Daniel
text: can work. Slowly Daniel turns back to them.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, now will somebody please
dialog: tell me why the military has assembled
dialog: a team of archaeological scientists
text: in a nuclear missile silo on top of
dialog: mount nowhere to study five thousand
dialog: year old Egyptian tablets?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (0.S.)
dialog: My report says, ten thousand.
text: The group turns to SEE...
speaker_heading: COLONEL O'NEIL 45
text: Dressed in full military attire, his hair cropped tight, the
text: Colonel, in sharp contrast to the man we met before, is now
text: the very image of the spit-and-polish soldier.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Ten thousand?
text: Everyone turns, surprised at this intrusion. Clearly the
text: others in the room do not recognise O'Neil. Kawalsky snaps
dialog: to attention.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
text: At ease.
text: O'Neil opens the black folder, removes some papers and hands
text: them over to Kawalsky.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Excuse me, do I know...
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Jack O'Neil from General West's
dialog: office. I'll be taking over from
dialog: now on.
dialog: 18.
text: Shocked, Catherine turns to Kawalsky who looks up at the
dialog: papers and nods; it's true. Daniel could care less about
text: the changing of the guard and steps forward.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Wait a minute. Ten thousand? That's
dialog: impossible. Egyptian civilization
dialog: didn't even exist until...
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: We know, but the sonic and Radiocarbon
dialog: tests are conclusive. Look at these
dialog: artifacts from associated and
text: overlying strata. Clearly
dialog: Epipaleolithic or Neolithic, probably
dialog: related to the Natufian in Palestine.
dialog: Entirely consistent with the Ninth
dialog: to Tenth Millennium B.C. date.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: These are cover stones. Was there a
dialog: tomb underneath?
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: No. But we found something much
dialog: more interesting.
text: O'Neil interrupts, stepping between them.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Excuse me, but this information has
dialog: become classified.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Catherine, what's going on here?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: From now on, no information will be
dialog: passed on to non military personnel
dialog: without my expressed permission.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You can't be serious. This is
dialog: ludicrous. What the hell am I doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: You're a translator, so translate.
dialog: Lieutenant, I want all information
dialog: not directly pertaining to these
dialog: tablets to be removed and brought to
dialog: my office immediately.
dialog: 46
dialog: 19.
text: O'Neil turns for the exit.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Your office, Sir?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: And I'll need an office.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Yes Sir!
text: Kawalsky rushes for the door and leads O'Neil out.
text: O'Neil marches out. The group exchange confused glances.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: Who is this guy?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: I'll handle this.
text: Catherine goes running after O'Neil. Meyers and Shore exit
text: behind her leaving a confused Daniel alone with the Tablets.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Ten thousand?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 46
text: Kawalsky leads O'Neil down the hallway. From the rear,
text: Catherine rushes to catch up.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Colonel, just a minute.
dialog: (O'Neil stops)
dialog: I think you owe me some kind of
dialog: explanation. I was told I'd have
dialog: complete autonomy.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Plans change.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Things have gotten too loose around
dialog: here. You've even brought in another
dialog: civilian.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Jackson was approved.
dialog: 47
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: To translate. That's all.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: This has nothing to do with Jackson,
dialog: does it? What's this all about? why
dialog: did they bring you in?
text: At first he doesn't want to answer. Finally he decides to
dialog: tell her the truth.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: I'm here in case you succeed.
text: O'Neil turns and walks away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAB - NIGHT 47
text: To the strains of seventeenth century opera music pouring
text: out of a ghetto blaster, we PAN across the darkened lab.
text: Daniel's belongings are spread throughout the room, including
text: his Egyptian bust. Open books scattered all over the floor.
text: The room is a mess.
text: AS we see the Tablets, we TRACK UP the scaffolding surrounding
text: it until we find Daniel, laying by the top of the Tablets.
text: Daniel, looking harried and tired, is deep in thought.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY (0.S.)
dialog: Do you have a problem with the food
dialog: here? You've barely eaten in days.
text: Daniel leans over the edge of the scaffolding and SEES
text: Kawalsky standing below, a tray of food in his hands.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: You want anything else?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: A point of reference. Some context.
dialog: You want me to solve a puzzle but
dialog: you won't give me the clues.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: You know I'm under strict orders.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So disobey orders. You know what
dialog: Shakespeare said, "Let them obey
dialog: that know not how to rule."
text: Kawalsky calmly puts the tray of food down on the desk
dialog: 48
dialog: 49
dialog: 50
dialog: 51
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Must be tough to always be the
dialog: smartest person in the room.
text: Kawalsky turns and exits. Frustrated, Daniel lays back down
text: onto the scaffolding.
text: Daniel rolls over and climbs down the scaffolding and walks
text: over to a table. He grabs the coffee pot only to find it
text: empty. Carrying the pot with him, Daniel exits the lab.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 48
text: Just as he steps out of the lab, a NIGHT WATCHMAN looks up
text: from his post. Daniel holds the empty pot up.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: Out of water.
text: The Watchman nods as Daniel moves down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE O'NEIL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 49
text: Turning the corner, pot in hand, Daniel passes O'Neil's
text: office; O'Neil's name freshly painted on the door. Checking
text: to see that he's unobserved, Daniel walks up to the office
dialog: door.
text: Daniel examines a KEYPAD at the side of the door. He reaches
text: into his pocket and pulls out a small pair of nail clippers.
text: He jimmies the top of the pad open with the clippers and
text: jams them into the wiring, SPARKS jump. Suddenly the office
text: door glides OPEN.
scene_heading: INT. O'NEIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 50
text: Like his home, O'Neil's office is immaculately kept. Daniel
text: creeps inside, scanning the room.
text: He SEES a file cabinet and rushes over to it. But as he
text: opens its drawers he finds they are all empty.
text: Daniel opens the closet door and finds a large SAFE, very
text: high security. He looks down at the tiny nail clippers still
text: in his hand. No way.
text: Casually Daniel goes through the desk drawers, but again,
text: empty. Finally in the last drawer he finds a photo of
text: O'Neil's wife and son. Suddenly the GLOW of a computer screen
text: catches his eye. Daniel picks up the keyboard and starts
dialog: typing.
scene_heading: MONITOR - INSERT 51
text: Below the words, UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES, Daniel types
text: the word "query" a highlight list appears. Daniel moves the
text: highlight over the word PERSONNEL. The word SEARCH appears.
dialog: 52
dialog: 53
dialog: 54
dialog: 55
dialog: 22.
text: Daniel types in COLONEL JACK O'NEIL. The computer responds,
text: PLEASE WAIT...
text: Impatiently Daniel waits. Suddenly the SHADOW of a guard is
text: SEEN through the door. Daniel FREEZES. The guard passes.
text: Daniel looks back down to the computer and sees...
scene_heading: O'NEIL, JACK - COLONEL - RETIRED, TWO YEARS - RETURNED ACTIVE
scene_heading: DUTY, ONE MONTH.
text: Daniel types something into the computer but the only response
text: he gets is; CLASSIFIED.
text: Frustrated, Daniel shuts the desktop and moves towards the
text: exit. But just as he's about to walk out the door, he spots
text: something on the wall, back up.
scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0.V. - A STAR MAP
text: of the known universe. Several of the star constellations
text: marked out in white. Daniel reaches up and the Star Map
text: gets violently RIPPED from the wall.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER SCANNER
text: A bar of WHITE LIGHT scans across the table top, over the
speaker_heading: STAR MAP.
scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL:
scene_heading: INT. LAB - MINUTES LATER
text: Stuffing his face with a SNICKERS BAR, DANIEL sits behind
text: the bank of computers, working furiously.
speaker_heading: MONITOR
text: The screen FILLS with the image of one of the hieroglyphics.
text: We PAN UP from the computer to see it on the TABLETS just
text: beyond the screen.
text: Quickly Daniel punches something up on the computer. The
text: computer screen SPLITS putting the image of the hieroglyphs
text: on one side and the map's ORION star constellation on the
dialog: other.
text: Making some adjustments on the computer, Daniel ROTATES the
text: image from the Star Map until it forms the SAME SHAPE AS THE
text: HIEROGLYPHIC. They are, in fact, the same symbol!
text: Daniel turns to his Egyptian bust.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Bingo!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: MILITARY LIMOUSINES
text: Sliding to a stop. Dust. Doors opening. Stepping out of
text: the limos we SEE a DOZEN high ranking military OFFICIALS.
scene_heading: EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY
text: The group of OFFICIALS move towards the tunnel entrance. As
text: they march we see that they surround GENERAL WEST, 50's.
text: The group disappears inside.
scene_heading: INT. SILO - HALLWAY - SAME - DAY
text: Kawalsky leads Daniel, who carries a stack of papers, down
text: the hall. Kawalsky stops, opens a door marked BRIEFING ROOM.
text: Daniel enters.
scene_heading: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The Briefing room is packed; O'Neil, Catherine, Meyers, Shore
text: and all the OFFICIALS we saw entering the compound. At the
text: center of the conversation is General West.
text: Daniel clearly wasn't expecting such an audience.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Daniel, I'd like you to meet General
dialog: West.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: I've come a long way to hear this.
dialog: Let's see what you've got.
text: Daniel turns to Catherine who nods for Daniel to go ahead.
text: Daniel unfurls O'Neil's star map. Daniel circles one of the
dialog: constellations.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: This is a star constellation. Orion.
text: Identical to a symbol on the Tablets.
text: The scientists exchange interested looks.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: The symbols on the Tablets were not
dialog: words. They were constellations.
text: Put together in a meticulous and
text: unique order, forming an address.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: An "address"? You mean coordinates?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Exactly. The centerpiece of the
text: tablets holds the key.
dialog: 56
dialog: 57
dialog: 58
dialog: 59
dialog: 24.
text: Daniel draws the cartouche. Shore, Meyers and Catherine
text: exchange a look. Even O'Neil leans forward.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This cartouche is a map. What we
dialog: have here are the seven points to
dialog: outline a course to a destination.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Seven?
text: Daniel draws a diagram indicating the six points needed to
speaker_heading: determine a destination (SEE DIAGRAM).
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: In order to find a destination in
dialog: any three dimensional space we need
dialog: to find two points to determine exact
dialog: height, two points for width, and
dialog: two points for depth. Those points
dialog: are indicated here...
dialog: (re: cartouche)
dialog: ...with star constellations.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: You said you needed seven points?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes. While these symbols give us
dialog: our destination, in order to chart
dialog: our course we must have a point of
dialog: origin.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: But there are only six symbols on
dialog: the cartouche.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That's because the point of origin
text: is not inside the cartouche but below
dialog: it, here.
text: Daniel circles a small symbol at the base of the cartouche.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This here. This is the sign for
dialog: Earth. The point of origin. The
dialog: seventh symbol.
text: There is a long silence. Daniel waits for a response. It
dialog: is long in coming.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (sly smile)
dialog: He did it.
dialog: 60
dialog: 61
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Did what?
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: There is no symbol like that on the
dialog: device.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: Perhaps some other kind of
dialog: representation?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What device?
text: Catherine turns to O'Neil and General.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: You'll have to show him. He's the
dialog: only one who can identify it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Would someone please tell me what's
dialog: going on?
text: The General thinks a moment, turns to O'Neil.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: Show him.
text: O'Neil walks over to the back wall. He pushes a large BUTTON.
text: Suddenly the whole WALL SLIDES AWAY revealing a huge bay
text: window looking out at a much larger room below.
text: Surprised, Daniel turns. As Daniel walks over to the window
text: we PUSH IN TO SEE...
scene_heading: MISSILE SILO - DANIEL'S P.O.V. 60
text: Through the window we can see the converted missile silo
text: packed with high tech equipment. In the center of all this
dialog: technology sits...
scene_heading: THE METALLIC RING 61
dialog: This ring, the same one found in Egypt over sixty years ago,
text: now seems to be part of one gigantic functioning machine.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Your "Star Gate."
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: Take him downstairs. See if he can
dialog: identify this "seventh symbol."
dialog: 62
dialog: 63
dialog: 64
dialog: 26.
text: Catherine nods and leads Daniel and the others out of the
text: room, down to the silo. O'Neil and the General stay behind.
scene_heading: INT. SILO - MOMENTS LATER 62
dialog: Controlled chaos. This room looks much like "mission
text: control." Catherine escorts Daniel into the control booth.
text: He stares at the ring in total awe.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: While we didn't realize the symbols
dialog: were star constellations, it was
dialog: obvious to us that they match symbols
text: written on the star gate. Problem
dialog: was, we never knew about the seventh
dialog: symbol.
text: Through the observation window above, O'Neil and General
text: West watch as a video camera moves across a TRACK closing in
text: on the details of the Star Gate. General West turns to
dialog: O'Neil.
speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: Jack, it's good to have you back.
dialog: (O'Neil nods)
dialog: How's your wife?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Some days are alright, others aren't.
text: The General nods, understands.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANIEL AND CATHERINE 63
text: Catherine leads Daniel next to a MONITOR that shows a detail
text: of the symbols written on the rim of the star gate. Daniel
text: stares at the screen, watching the symbols pass as the ring
text: slowly rotates.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hold it!
text: Catherine turns, signals for the Star Gate to stop spinning.
text: Daniel walks closer to the monitor.
scene_heading: MONITOR - STARGATE E.C.U. - SYMBOLS 64
text: Lifting a black marker to the screen, Daniel draws the symbol
text: he found below the cartouche OVER a symbol seen on the screen.
text: Clearly this symbol is the other representation of the same
dialog: sign.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: That's it. We must have been blind!
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Let's try it.
dialog: 65
dialog: 27.
text: Catherine picks up a phone. Above we SEE General West picking
text: up a phone from behind the observation glass. He nods.
text: Catherine hangs up.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (announcing)
dialog: Let's run a test.
text: Over a Mic, Shore gives instructions to two TECNICIANS who
text: program the ring to TURN, front part and back in different
text: directions, aligning the sides. Each section stopping at a
text: particular sign, matching the cartouche.
text: Several ARMED GUARDS suddenly surround the star gate,
text: protecting it, from what, we don't know. A Technician opens
text: the top of the probe and places a caged RAT inside.
text: As each symbol aligns on the StarGate, a LASER ignites in
text: the center of the ring. Each additional laser builds the
text: intensity of the light. Daniel is amazed. He adjusts his
text: glasses to get a better look when they suddenly CRACK.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I should have warned you about that.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (taking off his glasses)
dialog: Incredible.
text: As the Seventh Symbol is matched up, there is an audible
text: HUM. The lasers BRIGHTEN and a strange light TUNNEL begins
text: to form at the center of the ring.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: It's guiding itself. Can you believe
dialog: this?!
text: Suddenly every computer in the room begins to activate.
text: Lights FLASH, data PRINTS out, technicians rush to deal with
text: all the input. Shore turns around to SEE...
text: MAP ON THE BACK WALL OF THE CONTROL ROOM 65
text: A detailed schematic of the Universe. A small red laser
text: CROSS HAIR begins to trek across the map, leaving Earth and
text: traveling across the galaxy, stopping at the far end of the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: SHORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God, the beam has locked onto
dialog: a point on the other side of our
dialog: Galaxy!
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN #2
dialog: It has mass. Could be a moon or
text: large asteroid.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Where are we on that map?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
text: Blue dot.
text: The flashing BLUE DOT is all the way on the OTHER SIDE of
text: the screen, lower right corner.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's right, Daniel. The other
dialog: side of the known Universe.
text: A PROBE is brought over to a ramp that leads into the center
dialog: of the RING.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: (filtered through
dialog: microphone)
dialog: Release the Probe.
text: The crew finishes their last preparations and rushes away,
text: leaving the PROBE sitting on the ramp.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: Initiate count down.
text: A COMPUTER COUNTDOWN begins. The technicians put on large
text: DARK SECURITY GLASSES. Catherine hands a pair to Daniel who
text: reluctantly puts them on.
text: Suddenly the PROBE STARTS TO MOVE. The PROBE moves tank-
text: like across the ramp heading directly into the center of the
text: RING. As the countdown reaches the end, the PROBE moves
text: INTO THE RING. Suddenly there is an audible POWER SURGE.
text: BLINDING WHITE LIGHT flashes from the RING. Even with the
text: glasses, Daniel and the others cover their eyes.
text: Suddenly the PROBE VANISHES!
text: Shocked, Daniel looks to Catherine for an explanation. She
dialog: gives none.
text: A SECOND count down begins, counting down from 60... 59...
text: 58... 57... With baited breath, the entire crew remains
text: motionless, waiting for the end of the countdown.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (whispered to Catherine)
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: We're waiting for it to come back.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Come back?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Never has before.
dialog: 32... 31... 30...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How is this possible?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
text: It's made out of a quartz unlike any
dialog: found on Earth. Some kind of natural
text: molecular disrupter. The device is
text: made out of it. It breaks down atoms
dialog: and sends them through another
dialog: dimension.
dialog: 22... 21... 20...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How long have you guys been working
dialog: on this?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: My father found it when I was a child.
dialog: But the Egyptian government didn't
dialog: release it until '71. Then we had
dialog: to get it from the British. And
dialog: from there it took another ten years
dialog: to get financing.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: From the Pentagon.
dialog: 8... 7... 6...
text: The tension is thick. Everyone in the room is anxious,
text: waiting nervously.
dialog: 3... 2... 1...
text: Through the ring, a vague SHADOW can be seen coming from the
text: other side. Slowly the shadow takes the form of THE PROBE,
text: moving slowly and steadily down the ramp.
text: Within seconds the ring TURNS ON ITS OWN and SHUTS DOWN.
text: The whole room explodes with CHEERS. The armed guards
text: surround the probe as it comes off the ramp. Two guards
text: immediately begin to examine it. One guard opens the top of
text: the probe, removing the caged RAT; still alive and well.
text: The technicians and crew members hug each other,
text: congratulating one another. Meyers rushes over to Daniel
text: shaking his hand, enthusiastically.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: Congratulations. I mean it.
dialog: 66
dialog: 30.
text: Unlike everyone else, Daniel remains incredulous.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: They're planning on going through,
dialog: aren't they?
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: That's what this was all about.
text: Suddenly the phone rings. Catherine picks it up and tries
text: to listen through all the cheering going on around her.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (yelling to room)
dialog: Quiet! Everyone!
text: The room settles down. As Catherine's expression darkens,
text: everyone in the room turns and looks at her, concerned.
text: Slowly we PAN UP to the observation window. Unheard by us,
text: O'Neil finishes his conversation with Catherine. Slowly the
text: wall LIFTS back up, COVERING the window.
text: Slowly Catherine hangs up the phone and turns back to her
dialog: cohorts.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're done. They're sending us all
dialog: home. He said they're taking over
dialog: from here.
speaker_heading: SHORE
dialog: What?!
text: Through the glass window of the control room we SEE...
scene_heading: TECHNICIANS - CATHERINE'S P.0O.V. THROUGH GLASS 66
text: Two Technicians move close to the probe. Suddenly several
text: of the armed guards block their path, rifles lifted. Behind
text: them Kawalsky instructs a guard who removes several DISKS
text: from the probe. Confused, the Technicians turn back to
dialog: Catherine.
speaker_heading: MEYERS
dialog: They can't do this!
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Yes they can.
text: Sadly she turns away, trying to hide her disappointment.
text: Everyone is shocked as the armed guards, led by Kawalsky
text: take the probe out of the silo.
text: Daniel can't believe it. He turns and looks at the
text: crestfallen faces around him. With a strange resolve, Daniel
text: storms out.
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: 67 INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME 67
text: The door bursts open as Kawalsky and two of the armed guards
text: march in carrying the recording disks from the probe. They
dialog: pass O'Neil and General West.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: It's up to you now, Jack.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: I'll be ready. Oh-six hundred hours.
text: O'Neil turns and exits the room.
scene_heading: 68 INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 68
text: Barely three steps out of the room, O'Neil is interrupted by
text: Daniel who races up, walking behind him.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Just what the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: We'll release all intelligence at
dialog: the appropriate time.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And who's going to make that decision?
dialog: The Pentagon?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Military intelligence.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That's a contradiction in terms.
text: Ignoring Daniel, O'Neil walks on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: How do you think you'll be able to
dialog: keep this quiet! The public will
dialog: want to know.
text: O'Neil stops, faces Daniel.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Who's going to tell them? You?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: If I have to.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (contemptuous)
dialog: Go ahead. Who do you think is going

dialog: 70
dialog: 71
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: You have no credibility left out
dialog: there. Face it, your only interest
dialog: here is to try and repair your damaged
dialog: reputation.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You're damned right I do. I've spent
dialog: the better part of my life studying
dialog: exactly what this project is all
dialog: about. I've dedicated myself to it.
dialog: What have you dedicated your life
dialog: to, Colonel?
text: The Colonel stares at him hard. He'd like to answer but
dialog: won't.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (cold; lethal)
dialog: Pack your bags and get off this base.
text: O'Neil turns and walks away. Frustrated, Daniel yells after
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You're going to need me!
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST (0.S.)
dialog: He may be right.

speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST

text: Fascinated, Daniel moves closer.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: The markings... they're different.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: That's why I wanted you to see this.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT LIEUTENANT
dialog: The readouts tell us it's an
dialog: atmospheric match. Barometric
dialog: pressure, temperature and most
dialog: importantly oxygen. All compatible
dialog: to Earth. As we expected.
text: The General steps behind Daniel.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: But I won't send our boys over there
dialog: if I'm not absolutely sure I can
dialog: bring 'em back.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT LIEUTENANT
dialog: We know the beam will only stay
text: connected for a short amount of time.
text: After the ring shuts itself down,
dialog: we'll have to re-establish the beam
text: from the other side.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We could re-establish from here.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: Once our team goes through, this
dialog: place will be evacuated and sealed.
dialog: We don't know what might come through
text: from the other side.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So you want me to go over with the
dialog: team, re-align the Star Gate and
dialog: bring everyone back home.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: Question is, can you do it?
text: Daniel takes a beat, turns to O'Neil and Kawalsky who stand
text: near the back of the room.
dialog: 72
dialog: 73
dialog: 74
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes... I can do it.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Positive.
text: General West turns to his counterparts who all nod in
dialog: agreement.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: Fine. You're on the team.
text: Dismissed, Kawalsky escorts Daniel out of the room. Once
text: they're both gone, O'Neil turns back to General West.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: He's smart. He won't go along with
dialog: us if he figures it out.
speaker_heading: GENERAL WEST
dialog: Then it's your job to make sure he
dialog: doesn't.

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I couldn't...
text: Lifting the necklace, Catherine puts it on a grateful Daniel.
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Bring it back to me.

scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER 75

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME 76
text: O'Neil marches towards the anxious and concerned faces of
dialog: our away squad; Kawalsky, five SOLDIERS (We recognize these

text: There's a long tense pause. Finally...
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Does anyone want to say anything
dialog: before we go?
text: O'Neil walks past each member of the squad who look up at

scene_heading: INT. SILO - CONTROL ROOM - MORNING 77

scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - SAME

scene_heading: INT. SILO - SAME

scene_heading: INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME

text: ...we then enter a gigantic black space, floating... until a
text: sun-like light RUSHES towards us, engulfing us... ...the

dialog: them away.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Jackson, you alright?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Calm down, Jackson, it's over.
text: Squinting through the bright light, Daniel can just make out

text: the room in various states of recovery.
text: Coughing, squinting and shaking off the cold, the team comes
dialog: together.
text: Suddenly the Star Gate begins to TURN on its own. As it
text: STOPS the light at the ring's center SHUTS OFF. TOTAL
text: BLACKNESS.
text: A FLARE ignites. Adjusting to the new light we SEE O'Neil
text: holding the flare, checking his men.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone alright?
text: Slowly the squad nods. One soldier, LT. FERETTI, shakes it
dialog: off.
scene_heading: LT. FERETTI
dialog: Tell me we don't have to go through
dialog: that thing again.
text: Daniel, slowly recovering, lifts himself up, dazed. A second

text: spotting the Star Gate. He's amazed.
text: As he looks around we SEE that we are in a massive stone
text: surrounding, not nearly as big as the silo, yet still
text: impressive. Behind Daniel the squad gathers equipment,
dialog: readies to move out.
text: One soldier, FREEMAN, attaches a light to a harness mounted
text: VIDEO CAMERA, while BROWN slips on a back pack connected to
dialog: a receiving DISH for collecting technical data. Brown checks
text: a readout monitor attached to the back of his arm.
text: O'Neil moves over to a doorway leading to a short hallway.

speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
text: Kawalsky, cover the rear.
text: Kawalsky nods as O'Neil moves through followed by another

text: Daniel spins, nods and follows.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAYS/MEDALLION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 94

text: O'Neil and his team move quickly through, followed by Daniel
text: who stops, noticing something. He reaches forward and grabs
text: Freeman, turning his light down to the floor.
scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.O.V. - MEDALLION 95
text: We see a large round MEDALLION on the floor. Tilting
text: Freeman's light we look up to find a similar object on the

text: Daniel doesn't know what to make of it. Annoyed, Freeman
text: shakes himself loose from Daniel and moves on.
scene_heading: BLACKNESS - HALLWAY 96
text: Two small blue-ish flares ROLL towards us, landing to a bumpy

scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS 101

scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0.V. - EXITING ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 105
text: Following closely behind O'Neil, Daniel slowly makes his way

dialog: I want to see where the hell I am.
text: Kawalsky, Feretti, secure the base

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'll go with you.
text: O'Neil ignores Daniel as he follows Kawalsky and Feretti
text: down the long ramp into the sands.
scene_heading: ANGLE - ENTRANCE RAMP 107
text: At the base of the ramp stand two LARGE OBELISKS. Kawalsky
text: and Feretti take positions on either side of the OBELISKS.
text: O'Neil and Daniel follow down the ramp and into the sand.
text: Behind them, Freeman marches down with his camera. As he

text: away from his eyepiece.
speaker_heading: FREEMAN
dialog: Holy shit!
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANIEL AND O'NEIL 108

scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - THE PYRAMID 109
text: Just like the great one of Egypt, only BIGGER and without
text: any decay. Glorious and breathtaking.
text: Looming just beyond the pyramid we see THREE SUNS in the sky
text: bearing down on us. Thrilled, exhilarated and frightened,
text: O'Neil and Daniel stand there in total awe. Too overwhelmed
dialog: to speak. Finally...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: I knew it!
text: O'Neil shoots him a look and heads back down the dune.
text: Overjoyed, Daniel just stares at the horizon, filled with

speaker_heading: O'NEIL

speaker_heading: FREEMAN
dialog: Yes, sir.

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: ...and you, get to work. I want us

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I need more time. There's bound to

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: What are you trying to say?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Look at it! It's an exact replica
dialog: of the great pyramid of Giza. We're
dialog: not going to find any hieroglyphic
dialog: or pictorial displays. We've got to
dialog: expand our search... Kawalsky and
text: Feretti exchange a glance. O'Neil
text: steps close to Daniel.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Your job is to re-align the star
dialog: gate and get us back home. Can you
dialog: do it or not?
text: There's a long pause as Daniel decides to answer.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Can't or won't?
dialog: 43.
text: Feretti leans close to Kawalsky who stares at Daniel, pissed.
speaker_heading: FERETTI
dialog: What's he talking about?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: If they marked the co-ordinates on
dialog: tablets back on Earth, there must be
dialog: something like that here. I just
dialog: have to find it.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Find it!? That wasn't the deal!
speaker_heading: O'NEIL

dialog: We'll set up base camp down here.
dialog: Organize our supplies.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY

speaker_heading: O'NEIL

speaker_heading: KAWALSKY

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: I've got that one.

speaker_heading: KAWALSKY (0.S.)
dialog: Sir, permission to speak?

speaker_heading: O'NEIL

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Don't let it happen again.
text: O'Neil turns away. Hurt, Kawalsky would like to say more,
text: doesn't. He leaves. O'Neil takes the tool, placing it into
text: the floor boards of the vehicle.
text: As he maneuvers the tool, a section of the floor COMES OFF,
text: revealing a hidden compartment below. O'Neil reaches in and
text: removes two heavy, SOPHISTICATED LOOKING DEVICES.
text: Placing the Devices on the floor, he adjusts something on
text: them, connecting the two pieces together. Joined, he opens
text: a common LID, exposing a small button.

speaker_heading: FERETTI

scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - MASTADGE 121
text: Climbing beyond the next dune we SEE a large hairy BEAST. A
text: strange cross between a Mammoth and a Buffalo, (called a
text: MASTADGE). Daniel is awestruck.
text: Slowly and cautiously, Daniel starts to make his way towards
dialog: it.
text: Halfway down, however, the Mastadge TURNS, spotting Daniel.
text: Daniel FREEZES in his tracks. So does the Mastadge.
dialog: 122
dialog: 47.
text: After a long beat where no one moves, Daniel takes a step
text: forward. The Mastadge takes a step back. Daniel freezes.
text: The Mastadge takes a step forward but this time a nervous
text: Daniel takes a step back. Both freeze.
text: Daniel notices something on the head and neck of the Mastadge;
text: A HARNESS. He reaches into his picket and pulls out a
text: SNICKERS BAR. He peels it and shows it to the Mastadge.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hungry?
text: With its great nostrils, the Mastadge SNIFFS the air. Daniel
text: inches closer as the Mastadge lowers its head. Slowly the
text: Mastadge moves closer to Daniel, cautious. Carefully, Daniel

dialog: TO:
scene_heading: ANGLE - O'NEIL, BROWN AND KAWALSKY 122

text: Daniel turns, sees O'Neil, but ignores him. The Mastadge
text: sticks out its MASSIVE TONGUE and LICKS the Snickers Bar.
text: Daniel, nervous, drops the bar. The Mastadge leans down and
text: picks it up with its teeth.
text: Daniel smiles and moves closer to it. He reaches out and
text: PETS the Mastadge. It makes a kind of PURRING SOUND as it
text: eats. It's cute as hell. It nuzzles Daniel.

dialog: Look, it's got a harness. It's
dialog: domesticated. See?
text: Daniel lifts one of the reins attached to the harness and
text: shows it to O'Neil. O'Neil nods apprehensively, signals his
text: men to lower their rifles.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a good old boy, aren't you.
text: The beast seems to respond. Daniel smiles as he runs his
text: hand over the Mastadge's head. But when Daniel's hand touches
text: the beasts EARS, it REARS UP, ROARING.
text: The Mastadge JUMPS UP onto its back legs. His reins get
text: caught around Daniel's leg. Screaming the Mastadge KICKS
text: and TAKES OFF RUNNING! Daniel gets DRAGGED OFF along with
dialog: the beast.

text: O'Neil and the Lieutenants lift their weapons but the animal
text: is too FAST. They watch as Daniel gets DRAGGED up and over
text: the next sand dune DISAPPEARING from sight.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: (yelling after Daniel)
dialog: Let go of it!
text: Frustrated, they lower their guns and take off after them.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANIEL AND MASTADGE
text: Daniel is DRAGGED, screaming as he's pulled. Twisting and
text: bumping. His mouth filling with sand.
scene_heading: ANGLE - O'NEIL, KAWALSKY, AND BROWN.
text: Huffing and puffing as they climb the top of the next dune.
text: Getting Daniel back in sight, they SEE how fast the Mastadge
dialog: is.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT - DESERT
text: Daniel is PULLED AWAY farther and farther from O'Neil who
text: chases from behind. No match for the speeding beast, the
text: distance between them grows.
scene_heading: DANIEL AND MASTADGE
text: Off into the distance, Daniel gets dragged over a sand dune,
text: out of sight.
scene_heading: O'NEIL, BROWN AND KAWALSKY
text: Come running over a dune, guns raised. Suddenly they slow
text: down as they SEE Daniel, laying in a heap, the Mastadge
text: standing over him. The team keep their weapons trained on
text: the beast as they approach from a distance.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANIEL AND MASTADGE
text: Daniel spits out a mouthful of sand as the Mastadge leans
text: over and begins to LICK HIS FACE.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Argh! Get your stinking breath away
dialog: from me!
dialog: (yelling back to O'Neil)
dialog: Somebody help me!
text: Finally O'Neil and his men arrive, but to Daniel's surprise
text: they PASS right by him, lowering their guns.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY

text: Daniel looks up, spits out the sand in his mouth. He stands
text: up and joins the others at a nearby ledge.
text: He finally sees what they see...
scene_heading: DANIEL P.O.V. - TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 129
text: Thousands of dark skinned PEOPLE populating the dune valleys
text: below. Humans, like on Earth, seemingly out of place and
dialog: time.
text: At the base of the huge dunes we see gigantic MINING PITS;
text: dark cavities in the sand. Dozens of ladders protrude out
text: of the dark pits up the sides of the dunes.
text: Covered with thick MUD, their faces barely recognizable as
text: human, dozens of WORKERS climb the ladders carrying heavy
text: loads on their backs.
text: At the top of the sand craters we see women and younger
text: workers, sifting through the piles of dirt carried out of
text: the pit. Mastadges harnessed to huge carts, to carry the
text: worker's cargo.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANIEL AND THE OTHERS 130
text: The brutal humanity of this work is a terrifying sight.
text: Amazed, they can't believe what they're seeing. O'Neil lifts
text: a pair of binoculars, scanning the area.
scene_heading: O'NEIL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - MINING AREA 130A
text: Spread across the sands, we SEE these people carrying out
text: back breaking labor. Suddenly a worker in the foreground
text: turns and looks DIRECTLY AT US.
text: O'Neil lowers his glasses just as he SEES... The workers all
text: start LOOKING UP, spotting them. The news SPREADS and more
text: and more workers put down their tools and turn to the
text: hillside. Several of the groups crowd closer, staring up at
text: the strange visitors.
text: Reacting, Kawalsky slowly lifts his rifle. O'Neil reaches
text: over, grabbing the barrel of the gun, stopping him. He
text: signals for the others to follow him down the dune.
scene_heading: GROUPS OF WORKERS 131
text: Gathering together, moving closer. As they assemble they
text: grow quiet, reverent.
text: The team cautiously makes their way down the sloping hillside
text: in the tense silence. Wind whistling through the hollow
text: pits. The Mastadge follows Daniel closely as they head down
dialog: the hill.
dialog: 132
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT - THOUSANDS OF WORKERS 132
text: All staring over at our crew as they arrive just a few yards
text: in front of the assembled crowd. Nervously the crew smiles
text: out at the workers who stare at them with a mixture of awe
dialog: and fear.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (under his breath to
dialog: Daniel)
dialog: Okay, Daniel. It's your turn.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Try and talk to them.
text: Daniel has no idea what to do. Slowly he walks over, a forced
text: smile for the crowd. He steps up close to a MUDDY WORKER.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (petrified)
dialog: Re... hello?
text: The Worker looks at him with curiosity. Suddenly a FLASH of
text: reflected LIGHT shines off of the Golden Sun Disk around
text: Daniel's neck. As the worker SEES this, his eyes widen.
text: Suddenly he SCREAMS something out, frightening our crew.
text: All at once, the entire assembly in a wave-like chain reaction
text: BOWS DOWN, FLAT ON THE FLOOR.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: I don't know.
text: They take a few steps closer to Daniel.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell did you tell them,
dialog: Jackson?
text: DANIEL turns back to O'Neil, nervous and confused.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Try to communicate.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How?
dialog: 133
dialog: 51.
text: Frustrated O'Neil steps forward. He singles out one of the
text: workers, a young boy, SKAARA, sixteen. Filled with fear,
text: Skaara averts his eyes.
text: O'Neil extends his hand. Skaara only looks at it with
text: mounting fright. Frustrated, O'Neil GRABS Skaara's hand,
text: shaking it.
text: Skaara SCREAMS OUT in fear and takes off RUNNING. He runs
text: as fast as he can until he disappears from view. O'Neil
text: turns to Daniel, confused.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So much for communication.
text: O'Neil shoots him a look.
text: Behind them, Brown leans over one of the piles of minerals
text: stacked nearby. He lowers a device over it, taking readings.
text: Kawalsky's attention is diverted to something far away.
text: Noticing Kawalsky looking away, Daniel and O'Neil turn to
dialog: SEE...
scene_heading: DECORATED MASTADGE AND ENTOURAGE 133
text: An elaborately decorated Mastadge with a covered carriage on
text: its back comes marching over through the gathered workers, a
text: small entourage surrounding it as it moves. Among them,
text: Skaara, who looks up to the carriage, speaking quickly.
text: Slowly it makes its way through the crowd over to Daniel and
text: the others. It stops and an elderly man, KASUF, the tribe
text: priest steps from the carriage.
text: As he gets to the front of the crowd he KNEELS before Daniel.
text: Kasuf begins to SPEAK in his language. His head bowed, Kasuf
text: speaks very FAST and with reverence.
text: Finally, when done, Kasuf STANDS again. This time the ENTIRE
text: CROWD stands with him, as though a prayer had ended. Daniel
text: looks at O'Neil.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Don't look at me.
text: Kasuf signals a group of WOMEN who approach carrying large
text: water basins. SARI, twenty, beautiful and painfully shy,
text: steps forward and offers some water to Daniel.
text: Her hair up in an Egyptian looking head covering looks like
text: the spitting image of Daniel's Egyptian bust. Daniel is
text: stunned, smitten. Slowly he accepts a drink. She humbly
text: bows her head and then moves on to Kawalsky. Kasuf steps
text: forward, again, speaking quickly. Asking a question.
dialog: 52.
text: Captivated by Sari, it takes Daniel a second to snap out of
text: it. He doesn't know how to respond. An idea hits him and
text: he digs into his pocket and retrieves another Snickers Bar.
text: Daniel walks over to Kasuf, peeling the bar. He shows it to
dialog: Kasuf.
text: Kasuf looks at it. He doesn't understand. Daniel takes a
text: bite. In a ceremonial gesture, Daniel hands the bar over to
text: Kasuf who reluctantly takes it. Hesitantly, he takes a bite.
text: He likes the taste and smiles.
speaker_heading: KASUF
dialog: Anaasar.
text: Daniel is thrilled. He smiles back at him.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Anaasar.
text: Pleased at communicating with Daniel, Kasuf waves his arms
text: invitingly towards the direction from which he came.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: He's inviting us to go with him.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: What makes you so sure?
text: Daniel exaggeratedly repeats Kasuf's gesture.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Sign language.
text: Everyone turns to the Colonel for a decision. He makes none.
text: He just stares at the departing Kasuf, considering.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Weren't we looking for signs of
dialog: civilization? Obviously we've found
dialog: it. You want me to get us back home?
dialog: This is my best shot.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Colonel, he's right. I took some
dialog: readings on what they're mining.
dialog: It's the same material as the Star
dialog: Gate.
text: Looking at the faces of the mud covered workers, O'Neil
text: finally makes a decision.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Give me the radio.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 134
dialog: 135
dialog: 136
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE CAMP - SAME 134
text: The wind has kicked up. Feretti and another soldier struggle
text: to re-tie the main tent to a post.
speaker_heading: FREEMAN
dialog: (yelling over)
dialog: Feretti! I've got O'Neil on the
dialog: radio.
text: Feretti hurries over to Freeman.
speaker_heading: FERETTI
dialog: (into Mic)
dialog: Yes, Sir...
text: Worried, the remaining members of the team huddle close.
speaker_heading: FERETTI (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you repeat that Sir?
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: Okay, Sir. Yes, Sir.
text: He hangs up, a strange look on his face. He turns to the
dialog: men.
speaker_heading: FREEMAN
dialog: Are they coming back?
text: Feretti is reluctant to answer. Finally...
speaker_heading: FERETTI
dialog: This is not good. I'm telling you
dialog: guys, this is not good.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - WIDE SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON 135
text: Over the boundless sea of sand dunes we PAN DOWN an endless
text: caravan of workers making their way across the desert. Kasuf
text: leads the procession, our crew in tow.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DANIEL AND MASTADGE 136
text: Daniel BLOWS his nose into a Kleenex, drawing strange looks
text: from the workers. Daniel's attention, however, is on the
text: beautiful Sari who walks across from him.
text: Suddenly the Mastadge BUMPS Daniel playfully from behind.
text: Daniel ignore it as he continues to gaze at Sari. The
text: Mastadge does it again. Skaara, who holds the reins of the
text: Mastadge, giggles at Daniel's plight.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (to Mastadge)
dialog: Cut it out.
dialog: 137
dialog: 138
dialog: 139
dialog: 140
dialog: 54.
text: Scolded, the Mastadge NUZZLES the back of Daniel's neck trying
text: to make up. Daniel takes out the remainder of his last
text: Snickers Bar and feeds it to the Mastadge who happily chews
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. Now stop bugging me.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: I told you not to feed it. Now you'll
dialog: never get rid of that stupid thing.
text: Again, the Mastadge playfully BUMPS Daniel from behind.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: (to Brown)
dialog: At least somebody likes him.
text: Suddenly the convoy STOPS. Ahead, Kasuf stops and turns
text: back towards Daniel, pointing off into the distance. As
text: Daniel walks closer he can see...
scene_heading: DANIEL'S TRAVELLING P.O.V. - NAGADA - SUNSET
text: The ancient village of the people of this planet set snugly
text: at the base of a rocky hillside. A huge settlement. People
text: milling around the gates surrounding it.
scene_heading: EXT. NAGADA VALLEY - MINUTES LATER - SUNSET
text: The long caravan makes its way down into this valley. The
text: town's people rush over to get a look at the strange guests
dialog: of Kasuf.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - KASUF
text: At the front of the convoy, Daniel and the team walk along
text: with Kasuf. The Mastadge still following behind.
text: Suddenly Skaara, pulls the Mastadge away joining several
text: other young SHEPHERD BOYS who corral the Mastadges. The
text: Mastadge WHINES a cry of protest as he gets pulled away from
dialog: Daniel.
scene_heading: INT. NAGADA VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Passing through the enormous gates to the village, Daniel
text: and the team are amazed at what they see. Hundreds of people
text: cram into these narrow streets to get a look at the visitors.
text: As they reach the end of the street, they reach an elevated
text: PLATFORM. Kasuf gives a signal and a curtain falls,
dialog: revealing...
dialog: 137
dialog: 138
dialog: 139
dialog: 140
dialog: 141
dialog: 142
dialog: 143
dialog: 144
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: GOLDEN SUN DISK 141
text: This Gold SUN DISK, two meters in diameter, hangs above the
text: platform. Daniel is totally astonished.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: The sign of Ra, the Egyptian Sun
dialog: God.
dialog: (to O'Neil)
dialog: They worship him. They must think
dialog: he sent us here.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: What gave them that idea?
text: Slowly Daniel lifts the Sun Disk hanging from his neck. As
text: he does, all the workers surrounding them bow down. Even
text: Kasuf kneels. O'Neil and his men exchange a worried look.
text: Daniel stares up at the SUN DISK. We DISSOLVE to the image
text: of the planet's three SETTING SUNS, disappearing behind the
dialog: dunes.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: BURST OF FLAME 142
text: ignites in a FIREBALL. The SOUNDS of CHEERS followed by
text: percussion instruments, primitive music.
scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL:
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - STREET - NIGHT 143
text: A group of women carrying trays of food pass. As we TRACK
dialog: with them we SEE the entire town has come out for a
text: CELEBRATION. We FOLLOW the women through the crowds over to
text: the platform where Daniel and the team sit with the town
dialog: Elders.
text: As the food arrives we SEE Sari, among the women, serving
text: the people on the platform.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I don't think we should be eating
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: They might consider that an insult.
text: Just then a TRAY is lowered before Daniel.
scene_heading: A DESERT REPTILE 144
text: A cooked beastie even Ethiopians wouldn't eat. Daniel looks
dialog: like he's going to be sick.
dialog: 145
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: You don't want to offend them, now
dialog: do you, Jackson?
text: Daniel looks at O'Neil, worried. In fact, no one on the
text: team wants to eat. They all exchange nervous glances. Kasuf
text: and the Elders turn, waiting for them to start.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on, eat.
text: Reluctantly Daniel leans over and takes a fleshy piece of
text: slimy meat. He takes a deep breath, shuts his eyes, and
text: eats it. Everyone stares at him. Finally after a long pause...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (chewing)
text: Tastes like chicken.
speaker_heading: SARI 145
text: kneels down next to Daniel, offering him some bread. For
text: the first time he sees her with her hair down, looking all
text: the more lovely. He just stares at her for a long awkward
text: beat. Sari won't look directly at him. Daniel is completely
text: enamored.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Jackson.
text: Daniel just smiles stupidly at Sari. The Elders and Kasuf
text: turn, noticing the interaction. They discuss it with
dialog: interest.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Jackson.
text: Nervous and embarrassed, Sari hands him the bowl and retreats.
text: The spell broken, Daniel turns back to O'Neil.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (absently)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Do you think you can keep your mind
dialog: on what we're here for?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh, I can't make it out. Their
dialog: language sounds familiar, a bit like
dialog: Berber, or maybe Chadic, or Omotic?
dialog: I can't tell.
dialog: 146
dialog: 147
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (re: above disk)
dialog: You said that was an Egyptian symbol.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Stands to reason, if they know one
dialog: Egyptian symbol...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: ...they'1ll know more. Let me try.
text: Daniel stands, walks before the town Elders. With everyone's
text: attention locked on Daniel, he kneels down in front of the
text: Elders and begins to draw in the sand.
text: The Elders lean forward to get a look. Daniel shows them a
text: quickly drawn hieroglyphic symbol. Instantly the Elders
text: REACT, turning to each other, speaking quickly, obviously
dialog: upset.
text: Worried he's done the wrong thing. Daniel tries writing
text: something else. The moment the drawing can be seen, the
text: Elders instantly RETREAT, backing down off the platform,
dialog: averting your eyes.
text: The crowd begins to MURMUR. The Elders clearly distraught.
text: As Daniel tries to write something completely different,
text: Kasuf rushes over and WIPES OUT the drawings in the sand.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: What's happening here, Jackson?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don't know. Look how they're
dialog: reacting. It's like...
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: ...writing is forbidden to them.
text: Realizing their hope of finding the clue to the gate is gone,
text: the team grows silent in despair. Suddenly through the
text: restless sounds of the crowd we HEAR the echoing SOUND of a
text: HORN. Daniel looks up to SEE...
speaker_heading: A LOOKOUT 146
text: Up top of the village a young LOOKOUT, lifts a small HORN,
text: and again sounds an ALARM that reverberates through the
dialog: streets.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - STREET 147
text: Reacting to the SOUND, the people quickly begin to gather
text: belongings and disperse. Tables and cushions are DRAGGED
text: AWAY. A cloth is DROPPED over the SUN DISK, covering it.
dialog: 148
dialog: 58.
text: Doors are LOCKED, windows SHUT.
text: Kawalsky and Brown rush to O'Neil and Daniel, nervous.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: What are they doing?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Colonel, I don't like the looks of
dialog: this... Before Brown can finish his
dialog: thought, we SEE the two huge entrance
text: doors at the end of the street begin
text: TO CLOSE.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: We're getting out of here.
text: Quickly O'Neil leads the team through the crowds, down the
dialog: streets.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why? Wait...!
text: Ignored, the team continues without him. Daniel rushes to
text: catch up. As the team moves down the street people REACH
text: OUT, trying to STOP THEM. Knocked aside, the soldiers push
dialog: onward.
scene_heading: ANGLE - FRONT ENTRANCE DOORS 148
text: Just as they SHUT. Two YOUNG MEN rush over and LOCK it down
text: with a crossbar. O'Neil moves quickly to the door, Kawalsky
text: and Brown behind.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Open that door!
text: O'Neil REACHES for the crossbar. One of the Young Men GRABS
text: his wrist. In lightning speed, O'Neil TWISTS the Young Man's
text: arm behind his back and SLAMS him into the door.
text: Quickly O'Neil DRAWS his pistol, shoving it into the side of
text: the Young Man's head. He SCREAMS OUT, but of course we can't
dialog: understand him.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No, don't!
text: Kasuf and the Elders push through the crowd. Sari watches
text: from the side, apprehensive. Skaara and the shepherd boys,
text: across from her, are glued to the action, peering through
dialog: the mob.
text: As the crowd moves closer, O'Neil aims his pistol high and
text: FIRES. Kawalsky and Brown lift their weapons, ready for a
text: Fight. The crowd quickly retreats. Skaara is AMAZED.
dialog: 149
dialog: 150
dialog: 151
dialog: 152
dialog: 59.
text: The crowd remains silent, frightened they've upset the Gods.
text: O'Neil holds the Young Man tight. A standoff.
text: Suddenly Brown's radio SQUELCHES ON. Brown lifts it to his
text: ear, listening.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Sir, I can't make this out.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE CAMP - SAND STORM - NIGHT 149
text: A huge SAND STORM blasts around the men who try to pack what
text: they can as they retreat from base camp. Feretti holds the
text: radio, yelling into it on the move. The tents tear apart
text: behind them.
speaker_heading: FERETTI
dialog: ...we have to abandon base camp. I
text: repeat... Feretti ushers his men
text: onward as he fights his way through.
scene_heading: EXT. NAGADA - ENTRANCE DOOR - SAME 150
text: O'Neil presses the radio close to his ear. Only every third
text: word is heard through the intense static.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (yelling into com)
dialog: Feretti, I can't hear you. Say again?
scene_heading: INT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - SAME 151
text: Through a wall of white sand, shapes appear, rushing towards
text: us. As we DOLLY BACK, we SEE that the team has reached the
text: safety of the pyramid entrance. They collapse from
dialog: exhaustion.
speaker_heading: FERETTI
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Do you copy? Do you copy?
text: But only loud STATIC can be heard. Feretti turns to the
text: nervous faces of the other soldiers.
scene_heading: EXT. NAGADA - ENTRANCE DOOR - SAME 152
text: Frustrated, O'Neil gives up, shuts the radio off.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Damn it.
text: The crowd still stares intently. Kawalsky and Brown hold
text: their guns at the ready. Suddenly O'Neil feels a TUG at his
text: shirt; Skaara, the young shepherd boy.
text: O'Neil SPINS towards him. Skaara backs off quickly. Moving
text: over to a ladder, he motions for O'Neil to follow him.
dialog: 153
dialog: 154
dialog: 60.
text: O'Neil looks over to Daniel who can only shrug.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Kawalsky)
dialog: Stay here.
text: O'Neil follows Skaara.
scene_heading: ANGLE - TOP OF THE NAGADA GATE - CONTINUOUS 153
text: Skaara reaches the top and moves to the side. O'Neil follows.
text: His face registers an important sight.
scene_heading: O'NEIL'S P.O.V. - SAND STORM 154
text: Moving quickly we SEE a WALL OF SAND moving towards the town.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Sir, what is it?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
text: Sand storm. Coming this way.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, that would have been an
dialog: excellent reason to shoot everyone.
text: Daniel moves over to the two soldiers, forcing them to lower
text: their guns. Daniel turns back to Kasuf, attempting to signal
text: the tension is over. Kasuf nods and calls out to the back
dialog: of the crowd.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (yelling down)
dialog: We'll stay 'til the storm is over.
text: Brown and Kawalsky exchange a look. A commotion behind them,
text: they turn to SEE a group of ELDERLY WOMEN push their way
text: through the crowd over to Daniel, surrounding him placing a
text: shawl over his shoulders. They giggle as they slowly pulla
text: surprised Daniel down the street.
text: The crowd laughs as they depart, moving to shelter. The
text: only one not laughing is Sari who watches Daniel pass. Daniel
text: yells back to O'Neil.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Should I go with them? I could
dialog: stay... I'll go. It'll be fine.
text: The women begin to toss strange POWDER over Daniel's head as
text: they enter a building down the street. Kawalsky leans close
dialog: to Brown.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: I hope they cook him.

scene_heading: EXT. PYRAMID SAND STORM NIGHT 155
text: The sand storm has hit full force. We can barely make out
text: the entrance to the pyramid through the murky sky.
scene_heading: INT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - SAME - NIGHT 156
text: Feretti shields his eyes as he stands in the doorway looking
text: out at the storm. The image of the moon scarcely pierces
text: through the whirling sand. Feretti turns and walks back
text: into the main entrance hall.
scene_heading: MOON ABOVE PYRAMID - SAME - NIGHT 157
text: Just as we saw in the opening, a SHADOW is cast across the
text: moon, blotting it out. Something moves in the sky above the
dialog: storm.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME - NIGHT 158
text: Feretti walks over to the group of soldiers who surround the
dialog: radio.
speaker_heading: FERETTI
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: This is base. Do you read?
speaker_heading: FREEMAN
dialog: You're wasting the batteries.
text: Feretti shuts off the radio and places his helmet over it.
speaker_heading: FREEMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We're not going to get anything during
dialog: this storm. We'll try again after
text: it passes.
speaker_heading: FERETTI
dialog: If it passes. I was stationed in
dialog: the Middle East and I've never seen
dialog: anything like it. I'm telling you
dialog: guys, this is not good.
text: There is a silent moment. Suddenly they all hear the SOUND
text: of RATTLING METAL. They turn and SEE Feretti's helmet SHAKING
text: against the radio. Slowly Freeman removes the helmet, the

text: to SHAKE. Soon, all their equipment begins to RATTLE.
text: Suddenly the ENTIRE ROOM begins to rumble. An eerie,

scene_heading: EXT. PYRAMID - SAME - NIGHT 159
text: Above the intense storm a SHAPE begins to take FORM, looming

text: The SHAPE begins to pierce through the turbulence. We can
text: SEE it's some kind of alien OBJECT. BRIGHT LIGHTS darting
text: off its sides as it grows near.
text: As the cloudy sand is BLOWN away, we can clearly see it's a
text: pyramid shaped SPACE CRAFT. Landing ARMS extending as it
text: LOWERS itself down over the TOP OF THE PYRAMID.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME 160
text: The room is now SHAKING violently. Frightened, the men grab
text: their weapons. They have no idea what's happening. Quickly
text: they group together.
scene_heading: EXT. PYRAMID - SAME 161
text: The ARMS of the craft LOCK into place as the craft FITS itself
text: onto the peak of the pyramid.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME 162
text: From the IMPACT, the Soldiers are KNOCKED off their feet.
scene_heading: EXT. PYRAMID - SAME 163
text: Once in place, the craft begins to OPEN, UNFOLDING and

scene_heading: INT. STARGATE ROOM - MEDALLION ROOM - SAME - NIGHT 164
text: With the Star Gate seen in the background, we can SEE a thin
text: LASER tracing the outline of the MEDALLION on the floor.
text: Something is happening, igniting.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME 165
text: Their guns pointed in every direction, the men are huddled

speaker_heading: FREEMAN

dialog: What the hell is happening?
scene_heading: INT. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM - SAME 165A
text: In the center of the room we SEE a large SARCOPHAGUS, its
text: side slowly LOWERING, revealing the figure of a MAN who lays
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: TRAVELING P.O.V. - SHAKING - SAME 166
text: Moving swiftly down the dark corridors of the interior of

text: Quickly the others SPIN, taking aim at us.

dialog: 170
dialog: 63.
text: But we keep coming at them. At the same time they FIRE, but

scene_heading: ANUBIS - EXTREME CLOSE UP 167
text: A Jackal headed creature, in our face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NAGADA - NIGHT 168
text: The sand storm continues to surround the village.
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - SAME - NIGHT 169
text: Seated on a stool in the middle of the room, Daniel is beset
text: by the Elderly town's women who fuss over him with wash cloths
text: and combs. Completely uncomfortable, Daniel tries to be
text: polite and endure as much as he can.
text: But when the women begin to wash his ears and nose, Daniel
text: shakes them off.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Okay, okay. Thank you. That's
dialog: enough. Alright.
text: The Elderly women retreat, bowing and giggling as they exit
text: his room. Finally gone, Daniel breathes a sigh of relief.
text: Suddenly he HEARS some WHISPERING. He turns back towards
text: the doorway.
scene_heading: ANGLE DOORWAY - CURTAINS 170
text: The curtains rustle, then part. Sari steps through dressed
text: in a CEREMONIAL ROBE. She walks into the chamber towards
dialog: Daniel.
text: Nervous, Daniel gets to his feet, his heart in his throat.
text: As she makes her way closer to Daniel, she unties her robe
text: letting it FALL to the floor, revealing her beautiful NAKED
text: BODY. She stares at the floor, sadly.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: What..? Uh... no.
text: Daniel rushes over, picking up her robe.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't... that's not necessary.
text: He wraps the robe back around her, covering her. She doesn't
text: understand. She looks at him, scared she's displeased him.
dialog: 171
dialog: 172
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not that I... I mean... you're
dialog: beautiful but... uh...
text: Realizing she can't understand, Daniel gently turns her back
text: towards the entrance, tenderly escorting her. At the curtain
text: he turns to her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. You should go.
text: Her eyes fill with tears. Daniel opens the curtains for her
text: to leave, revealing...
scene_heading: THE TOWN'S ELDERS 171
text: All gathered just outside his chamber, crowding the bridge
text: between the buildings. Daniel stares out at the unexpected
text: ensemble. Kasuf looks over at Sari, sees her tears and speaks
text: angrily to her. Sari is frightened and in trouble. Daniel,
text: realizing this, suddenly SMILES and WAVES to the crowd.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Just wanted to say...
dialog: (for lack of better)
dialog: ...thanks. Thank you very much.
text: Daniel waves and bows as he escorts Sari BACK into his
text: chamber. Quickly he SHUTS the curtains behind him. Now
text: Sari is totally confused. Again she starts to disrobe.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, that's okay.
text: Again, Daniel gently stops her, motioning for her to sit
text: down on the sleeping mat. She does. He crosses the room
text: and sits down a safe distance away.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Looks like you've got a roommate for
dialog: the night.
text: There is a long embarrassing pause as the two sit in awkward
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. O'NEIL'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - SAME 172
text: Brown and Kawalsky sit next to the radio. Brown readjusts

speaker_heading: KAWALSKY

speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Maybe he knows something we don't.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - O'NEIL 173
text: O'Neil' stands by the window, watching the storm. Unseen,
text: Skaara enters through the doorway. Spotting O'Neill's
text: holstered pistol laying on the mattress, Skaara slowly creeps
text: towards the gun. Just as he reaches for it...
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: No! Dangerous.
text: Somehow Skaara understands. Quickly he backs off. O'Neil
text: pulls out a pack of cigarettes, lights one. As the lighter
text: ignites, Skaara jumps to his feet, frightened.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay. It's just a lighter.
text: O'Neil tosses the lighter to Skaara. He lights it over and
text: over again. Skaara takes one of O'Neil's cigarettes out of
text: the pack on the bed, lights it, mimicking O'Neil.
text: O'Neil casts a sidelong glance at the boy. He sits down and
text: leans his head back against the wall. Skaara does the same
text: thing. Beat. O'Neil flicks the ash of his cigarette. Skaara
text: copies his every move.
text: Skaara and O'Neil sit there for a moment. Skaara's starting
text: to feel pretty confident by this point. O'Neil sees this.
text: He takes a deep drag off his cigarette and audibly INHALES,
text: deeply, exhaling a cloud of smoke.
text: Feeling cocky, Skaara imitates O'Neil. The minute the smoke
text: reaches his lungs, his eyes go wide, then fill with tears.
text: He starts COUGHING his guts up.
text: O'Neil suppresses a smile.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - SAME - NIGHT 174

speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: SARI
dialog: Dan-el.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No, er, me. Daniel.
text: Sari gets it, points to Daniel.
speaker_heading: SARI
dialog: Dan-el.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes. Daniel.
text: There's a long pause. Slowly Sari points to herself.
speaker_heading: SARI
dialog: Sari.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Sari, yes.
text: There is another awkward pause.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: We came from the pyramid.
text: She doesn't understand. Daniel kneels down and DRAWS a
text: pyramid in the sand covered floor. Again, Sari only stares
text: at it. Daniel grows frustrated and walks to the window.
text: Sari keeps staring at the drawing. She reaches over and
text: draws something over it.
text: Slowly Daniel turns back, curious to see Sari augmenting the
dialog: drawing.
text: He moves close to see she's drawn a circle and a line above
text: the pyramid; the same symbol Daniel discovered on the tablets.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: That's the sign for Earth! You know
dialog: this symbol?
text: She looks back up at him.
scene_heading: INT. MASTADGE CORRAL - SAME 175
text: With the Mastadges in the background, all the shepherd BOYS
text: are surrounding Skaara who holds O'Neil's lighter for everyone
text: to see, the wind from the storm continuing to HOWL outside.
text: Suddenly Skaara LIGHTS the lighter. The boys JUMP BACK in
dialog: fear.
text: Skaara laughs as the boys re-approach to examine the lighter.
text: Suddenly there is a BANGING SOUND. Skaara turns and sees
text: Daniel's Mastadge, banging his head against the corral door.

dialog: what the Mastadge was reacting to...
scene_heading: SKAARA'S P.O.V. - DANIEL AND SARI 177
text: Moving down the street, disappearing between the buildings.
scene_heading: EXT. NAGADA - SIDE STREET - SAME 178
text: A torch in her hand, Sari leads Daniel over to the end of a
text: small street at the side of the village.
text: Behind a stairwell, she shows Daniel a large boulder leaning
text: against the wall. She tries to PUSH IT. Daniel helps her
text: and together they move it away from the wall revealing a
text: small TUNNEL.
text: Sari checks to see if they've been observed. The coast clear,
text: Sari ducks inside. Daniel follows.
scene_heading: INT. SUBSTRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 179
text: They crawl beneath the structure through the dirt reaching a
text: hidden set of STAIRS leading downward. Sari points down the
text: stairs. Daniel takes the torch and walks down, Sari
dialog: following.
text: Eroded and musty walls surround the stairs. Daniel makes it
text: to the bottom of the stairs that lead directly to a dirt
text: covered WALL. The SYMBOL for Earth engraved in its center.
text: Astonished, Daniel runs his fingers around the surrounding
text: wall. His finger PUSHES THROUGH some dirt, until he's able
text: to dig out the archway surrounding the symbol; he uncovers a
speaker_heading: DOOR.
text: Realizing it's a door, Daniel is able to dig into the door,
text: giving him something to grip. He PULLS with all his might.
text: Slowly the door OPENS.
text: Sari's eyes go wide. Daniel is nervous but excited.
text: Cautiously they make their way through the doorway.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - SAME 180
text: Behind the door we find the long narrow ancient catacombs,
text: obviously built centuries ago. Daniel holds his torch up to
dialog: the walls revealing...
scene_heading: HIEROGLYPHICS AND DRAWINGS 181
text: Covering every bit of wall space, all the way down this narrow
text: passage way. Daniel turns to Sari, stunned. Sari, too, has
text: never seen any of this. She's frightened. Daniel continues
text: down the wall, trying to make sense out of this picture story.
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: 182 DANIEL'S P.O.V. - PICTURE STORY 182
text: AS we move down the wall we see... the now familiar symbol
text: for Earth... then ANIMAL HEADED warriors (Anubis, Horus,
text: Thoth)... taking children... families ripped apart.
text: Daniel and Sari lean close. The images disturbing, harsh.
text: They move the torch down the wall.
text: The next drawings depict... slaves herded together... the
text: warriors brutalizing them... shepherding them across the
text: desert over to... THE STAR GATE.
text: Alongside these pictures, Daniel SEES the first of some
text: hieroglyphic symbols.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: The symbol for slavery... seama!
speaker_heading: SARI
dialog: (correcting)
dialog: Seema?
text: Surprised, he turns to Sari.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (pointing to symbol)
dialog: Semer?
speaker_heading: SARI
dialog: Seema.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Seema!
text: Quickly Daniel rushes over to another symbol, pointing.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Nefer?
text: Sari wrinkles her brow, she doesn't understand. She walks
text: over, close, staring uncomprehendingly at the symbol. Daniel
dialog: tries another pronunciation.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Nefeer?
speaker_heading: SARI
dialog: (correcting)
dialog: Nefaar?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Nefaar! Yes! Teach me to speak.

scene_heading: ANGLE - KAWALSKY AND O'NEIL

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: We've lost radio contact. Get Brown.
dialog: Find Daniel. I want to leave as

speaker_heading: KAWALSKY

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: I'm looking for Jackson... Of course
dialog: they can't understand a word.
text: O'Neil holds up Daniel's jacket.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Jackson, see. Jackson.
text: They don't get it at all. Instead they suddenly all begin
text: to SALUTE. O'Neil is not good at this and he knows it.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Jackson. Uh, like this. Jackson.
text: O'Neil forms circles with his hands and holds them over his
text: eyes imitating GLASSES. The boys copy his movement, holding
text: their cupped hands over their eyes. They all giggle.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: No. I mean...
text: Adding the final touch, O'Neil SNEEZES. Suddenly Skaara
text: REALIZES. He runs over to O'Neil and SNATCHES the jacket
text: away from him. He rushes off with it across the corral.
text: Skaara holds it up to the nose of Daniel's Mastadge. Suddenly
text: the Mastadge REARS UP, ROARING. Quickly Skaara opens the
text: corral gate and the Mastadge RACES out. Coming around the
text: corner, Kawalsky and Brown have to LEAP out of the way as
text: the Mastadge charges past.

scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL:
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - PER-DAWN 189
text: Daniel moves the torch slowly over the wall. To our surprise
text: he says something to Sari in her own language. She responds
dialog: in kind.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (0.S.)
dialog: I thought you couldn't speak their
dialog: language.
text: Daniel SPINS, his torch illuminating O'NEIL who stands before
text: him, Skaara at his side. Startled, Daniel has to catch his
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's ancient Egyptian. I just didn't
dialog: know how to pronounce it. No one
dialog: has heard it spoken in over two
dialog: thousand years.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Jackson, what is all this?
text: Behind him we SEE Kawalsky and Brown roaming through,
text: fascinated by what they see.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: A history of the people who first
dialog: came to this world.
text: Daniel turns back to the tableau on the wall, pointing to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, here, this is Ra, the God these
dialog: people worship. He was a young boy,
dialog: taken by people from distant stars
dialog: who turned him into a God.
text: He points to the drawings of the boy becoming a Pharaoh.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Once a God, Ra betrayed his own
dialog: people, enslaving them to serve his
dialog: masters.
text: Daniel points to a series of drawings of Ra, ruling his
dialog: people.
text: O'Neil suddenly becomes very interested. Slowly we PUSH IN
text: close as we study O'Neil's intense curiosity.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: They taught him how to build the
dialog: great pyramid of Giza. They gave
dialog: him eternal life. They made him

speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KAWALSKY (0.S.)

scene_heading: ANGLE - OTHER CORRIDOR 190

text: awe at something before them...
speaker_heading: ALTAR 191
dialog: Enshrined in sacred writings, this whole section is dedicated
text: to a single cartouche at the wall's center, half buried in
text: the sand. We recognise the cartouche as the same one we saw
text: on the tablets.
text: Daniel rushes over to it, examining, digging out the covered
text: portion of the cartouche. The others crowd in behind him,
text: anxious, tense.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: They must have kept it here in hopes
dialog: that one day the gate to Earth could
dialog: be reopened.
text: These definitely match the signs on the Star Gate. But as
text: Daniel's hand moves down the six main SYMBOLS, we discover
text: the last piece of the cartouche has BROKEN OFF.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Where's the seventh sign?
text: Frantically Daniel digs in the dirt looking for something.
text: Realizing what he is doing, the team drops to the ground,
text: digging. Sari, not understanding, holds the torch.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I got it!
text: He pulls a piece of fractured wall out of the dirt. It FITS
text: in perfectly with the cartouche, but the piece is WORN CLEAR.
text: The SYMBOL IS GONE.
text: Daniel and the soldiers are STUNNED. Their hopes of returning
text: home, dashed. Probably forever. O'Neil gets a determined

scene_heading: ANGLE - TEAM - SAND DUNES - SAME 193

speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, get rid of â€˜em!
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I tried.

speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus Christ!

speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't have to do that!
text: O'Neil simply turns and marches on. Even Kawalsky and Brown

speaker_heading: SKAARA 197

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DUNES - LATER - DAY 198

scene_heading: PYRAMID SPACE CRAFT 200

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Lieutenant, I've got to get to the

speaker_heading: DANIEL

text: Column by column, O'Neil makes his way down the large entrance
text: hall. Clumsily Daniel hauls the rifle behind. As they enter
text: they SEE Feretti's radio, the helmet, assorted equipment.
text: Daniel swallows hard.
text: Behind them, Kawalsky and Brown creep down the opposite row
text: of columns, weapons ready. Just as they pass we see a SHADOW
text: move across the wall behind them.
scene_heading: EXT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - SHEPHERD BOYS - SAME 205
text: The Shepherd boys sneak up the side of the structure. Skaara
text: creeps up a dune over to a small window.
scene_heading: DANIEL AND O'NEIL 206
text: Pressed against a column. O'Neil moves forward, choosing
text: his path. Daniel looks back, something MOVES. He leans the
text: opposite direction just in time to SEE...
speaker_heading: SHADOW 207
text: A huge shadow, human form but with a HAWK-LIKE HEAD. Daniel
text: reacts, turns to O'Neil but O'Neil is GONE. Scared, Daniel
text: grips the rifle tight.
speaker_heading: BROWN 208
text: Brown steps out from behind a column when WHACK, something
text: hits him across the head, SPINNING HIM. As he recovers BLAST,
text: a strange POWER BURST to his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM against
dialog: the post.
speaker_heading: WINDOW - SKAARA 209
text: Peering in through a window we SEE Skaara straining to see
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: SKAARA'S P.0.V. - BROWN 210
text: Writhing in pain, Brown screams as Horus SLAMS the rear of
text: his weapon into him. Skaara's eyes go wide with fear as he
text: retreats to tell the others.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL 211
text: Spins, sees something and LEAPS out of the way as a POWER
text: BURST EXPLODES into the column behind him.
text: Kawalsky JUMPS out FIRING. Out of nowhere his weapon is
text: SMASHED, knocked out of his hand. He spins, his eyes widen
dialog: as he SEES...

dialog: 214
dialog: 215
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: HORUS 212
text: Body of a man, the head, a metallic textured sculpture of a
text: HAWK. He SWINGS his weapon at Kawalsky who grabs hold with
text: all his strength. Kawalsky grapples with Horus who TWISTS
text: his weapon free, then SMASHES it into Kawalsky's chest.
text: Holding his rifle tentatively, Daniel steps out from behind
text: a column just in time to SEE... Kawalsky SAILS across the
text: hallway, SLAMMING into a column, collapsing in a heap. Just
text: then Daniel SEES Horus crossing the hallway, moving in on
dialog: Kawalsky.
text: Daniel is in total shock, his eyes wide with fear. Standing
text: out there, he's a sitting duck. Suddenly a HAND reaches for
text: him and GRABS HIM, yanking him back to safety.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL 213
text: Holds Daniel tight against the wall, leaning close to his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Cover me.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Wha...?
text: O'Neil makes a DASH for the door leading to the StarGate.
text: Daniel gathers his strength and follows, attempting to cover
text: the rear as he runs.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND GALLERY - CONTINUOUS 214
text: A FLARE tumbles towards us, O'Neil rushing up from behind.
text: In the flickering light we see Daniel, stumbling after O'Neil
text: trying to keep his rifle pointed to the rear.
scene_heading: INT. STARGATE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 215
text: The darkness is broken with another FLARE as it rolls towards
text: us. O'Neil rushes through the Medallion room straight over
text: to the wheeled vehicle standing next to the StarGate. Daniel
text: races in, moving over towards O'Neil.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (scolding)
dialog: Get back to the door!
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What about Kawalsky and Brown?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: You heard me, move!

text: his gun into the Grand Gallery.
dialog: 216
dialog: 217
dialog: 78.
text: O'Neil retrieves the electric KEY from his pocket. He turns
text: a dial and a RED LIGHT begins to FLASH.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: I said cover me, Goddamnit!
text: O'Neil takes out the tool and opens the secret compartment
text: of the vehicle only to find it EMPTY. O'Neil is in total
speaker_heading: SHOCK.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's gone!
text: Pissed and scared, Daniel turns back to O'Neil.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What is?
text: Just as Daniel turns a LASER traces the edges of the MEDALLION
text: on the floor. A BEAM appears just as the image of a man
text: MATERIALIZES behind Daniel's back.
text: Fully realized, we see it's ANUBIS, his weapon aimed.
text: O'Neil looks up and SEES Anubis. Slowly he lifts his arms
text: in surrender. Seeing this Daniel SPINS, his rifle shaking
text: in nervous hands.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (suddenly calm)
dialog: Jackson, put it down.
text: Anubis steps into the flickering light of the flare. For
dialog: the first time we can SEE the details of this strange
dialog: creature.
text: Stepping close, he runs his palm beneath his weapon and the
text: barrel SNAPS OPEN ready to fire. Daniel lowers his rifle.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE CRAFT - MEDALLION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 216
text: Like the medallion below, a laser traces the floor,
text: illuminating this dark room. Once surrounding the medallion,
text: SHAPES begin to form. Soon we SEE it's O'Neil, Daniel and
dialog: Anubis.
text: The beam VANISHES and a circular door SLIDES open.
scene_heading: INT. RA'S THRONE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 217
text: As the door opens we find HORUS waiting. He and Anubis lead
text: Daniel and O'Neil into the room. Suddenly a loud SOUND is

scene_heading: EXT. PYRAMID - SPACE CRAFT - TOP SECTION - DAY 218
text: Slowly the top of the pyramid begins to OPEN UP, the planet's
text: three suns behind it. The paneling slides back revealing
text: the palace beneath.
scene_heading: INT. RA'S THRONE CHAMBER - SAME 219
text: They march down the center of this beautiful palace room.
text: Light begins to STREAM IN from the openings above. They
text: reach the far wall of the room and Horus THROWS Daniel to
text: the floor. O'Neil SPINS, ready to fight.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (stage whisper)
dialog: Kneel.
text: Reluctantly O'Neil turns and bows down to his knees. Daniel
text: looks up from the ground and sees A GOLDEN SUN DISK adorning
text: the wall before him.
text: From all around SUNLIGHT pours in, bathing Daniel and O'Neil
text: in bright light. As the light reaches the SUN DISK, the
text: doors in front of them SLIDE OPEN revealing another room.
text: Standing in front of a large set of stairs leading to a
text: platform, we SEE a dozen human CHILDREN, ranging from 9 to
text: 17 years of age, elaborately dressed, huddled together,
text: blocking our view. Slowly they peel away from the center
dialog: revealing...
speaker_heading: PHARAOH KING RA 220
text: Perched on his throne, adorned with jewels and headdress
text: like an ancient Pharaoh, RA looks like a living version of
text: the mask of Tutankhamun, part humanoid, part other worldly.
text: Daniel and O'Neil, who look up at the strange creature before
text: them. There is a long awkward silence as Ra examines them
text: from his perch. Turning away, Ra lifts his hand, pointing
dialog: to Anubis.
speaker_heading: ANUBIS 221
text: touches a switch on the collar of his outfit and suddenly
text: the Jackal head MORPS into the cold but handsome face of a
text: HUMAN, the real man behind the mask.
text: Ra turns towards Horus, who also begins to CHANGE SHAPE.
text: His Hawk mask peeling back to reveal the MAN underneath; a
text: dark skinned North African with joyless eyes.
text: Neither O'Neil nor Daniel can believe their own eyes as these
text: creatures unmask before them. Daniel nervously looks up
text: towards Ra. After a long beat Ra gives a nod to the children.
dialog: 222
dialog: 80.
text: Two young BOYS walk up from behind Ra carrying a tray.
text: O'Neil's DEVICE, stolen from the wheeled vehicle, lays
text: dismantled on the tray. The children place it in front of
dialog: Daniel and O'Neil.
text: Daniel stares at it confused. O'Neil only stares at Ra
text: defiantly. Daniel notices the English words and numbers
text: printed around the device. He turns to O'Neil, bewildered.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: What is that?
text: O'Neil only continues his glare to Ra. Daniel begins to
text: panic, his mind racing.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: That's what you were looking for.
dialog: What you couldn't find...
text: Daniel looks back to Ra who stares down at them, cold.
text: Turning back to the device, Daniel starts to realize what
text: he's looking at.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: ...you were going to destroy this
dialog: place!? Why?
text: Suddenly Ra STANDS. As we PUSH IN we SEE...
scene_heading: RA - CLOSE - SFX 222
text: Suddenly Ra's entire shape begins to MORPH, his image shifting
text: and changing. His golden skin PEELS AWAY as his headdress
text: RETRACTS behind his head, revealing a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
text: MAN/CHILD, RA. Though ten thousand years have passed, he
text: looks but slightly older than when we saw him in the film's
dialog: opening.
text: As Ra is unveiled, Horus and Anubis BOW their heads. Seeing
text: this from the corner of his eye, O'Neil seizes the
text: opportunity. He POPS UP, throwing a shoulder into Anubis'
text: chest, wresting his weapon from him. He SLAMS Anubis with
text: the butt end, knocking him to the floor.
text: In one swift move, he copies the gesture he saw Anubis make
text: and SNAPS the weapon OPEN and FIRES at Horus, catching him
text: in the shoulder, SPINNING HIM to the floor.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: No! Don't! Stop it!
text: But O'Neil TURNS, takes quick aim and FIRES at Ra. Just as
text: the power blast leaves the weapon a CLEAR SHIELD forms around
text: Ra. The power blast is DEFLECTED.
dialog: 223
dialog: 224
dialog: 225
dialog: 226
dialog: 227
dialog: 228
dialog: 81.
text: Horus grabs his weapon, spins. Daniel steps between them,
text: screaming out to them in their language. But, too date, |
text: Horus FIRES. The blast RIPS INTO DANIEL KILLING HIM.
text: second BLAST hits O'Neil in the shoulder, cutting into him.
text: O'Neil hits the floor, writhing in intense pain.
text: Ra steps down from his throne. He walks towards Anubis,
text: retrieving his fallen weapon. For a moment we think he may
text: kill him. Instead he THROWS the weapon at him.
text: Ra walks over to Daniel, staring down at his lifeless body
text: when something catches his eye. Ra kneels down, reaches
text: over and touches the SUN DISK around Daniel's neck.
scene_heading: SUN DISK - NECKLACE - EXTREME CLOSE UP
text: Hanging from Daniel's neck, Ra fingers the golden sun disk
text: examining it.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DUNES - DAY
text: Slowly Daniel's Mastadge appears behind a dune and HOWLS, a
text: single beautiful note of pain.
scene_heading: EXT. BASE CAMP
text: Buried in the sand, an exposed tent flap is PULLED aside and
text: the Shepherd boys SEE Daniel's Mastadge appearing behind
dialog: them.
text: They turn back, digging for more treasure. Skaara uncovers
text: one of the soldier's HELMETS. He shows it to the other boys.
text: Just then a LOUD HUM is heard. The Boys look up to SEE...
scene_heading: GLIDER BAY - SPACE CRAFT
text: The Glider bay OPENS and two GLIDERS shoot out into the sky.
scene_heading: ANGLE - SHEPHERD BOYS
text: The Boys DUCK for cover under the tent as the two Gliders
text: SAIL past, disappearing from view.
scene_heading: INT. HOLDING CELL - SAME
text: A square HOLE in the ceiling OPENS as the bars that cover it
text: recede. Unconscious, O'Neil body DROPS through, landing
text: with a SPLASH into the shallow muddy water of this cell.
text: The cold water reviving him, O'Neil BOLTS up awakened.
text: Suddenly two arms GRAB HIM. Still in shock, O'Neil tries to

scene_heading: EXT. DUNES - LATE AFTERNOON 229

scene_heading: TWO WINGED GLIDERS 230
text: Heading right at them, darting out from over the dunes.
scene_heading: GLIDER P.O.V. - SHEPHERD BOYS 231
text: Sailing overhead we see the small group of boys staring up
text: at us, astounded at what they see. Just as it passes overhead
text: they get a mere glimpse at ANUBIS as he peers down at them.
text: Once gone, the boys race to the top of the dune to see where
text: the Gliders have just left; Nagada, a black plume of smoke
text: rising from the center of the town.
scene_heading: EXT. NAGADA - INSIDE TOWN - THROUGH GATES - LATE AFTERNOON 232
text: The boys approach the front gates, entering the town slowly.
text: From their expressions we SEE they are shocked at what they
dialog: find.
scene_heading: SHEPHERD BOYS' P.0O.V. - DECIMATED STREET - SAME 233
text: People crying, comforting one another. Charred buildings, a
text: small flame being extinguished. Wounded people getting tended
dialog: to. Misery.
text: The boys move slowly down the center of the street, fear and
text: anger in their eyes. Skaara sees Sari crying at the side of
text: the street. He rushes to her.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SARI 234

scene_heading: KASUF - HANGING 235

text: barely conscious. We PUSH into Skaara's troubled face, tears
text: and anger well in his eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM - LATER 236
text: Silent and still, the sarcophagus sits at the back of the
text: room. Slowly we MOVE closer to it just as its sides begin
text: to retract, exposing a FIGURE covered in wet cloth laying
dialog: motionless.
text: As the sarcophagus completes this process the figure suddenly
text: SITS UP, frantically GASPING for air. Coughing, the figure
text: rips off the wet cloth, revealing...
speaker_heading: DANIEL 237
text: Reborn. Daniel struggles to regain normal breathing. Finally
text: he calms down and looks around to see where he is.
scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0.V. - EMPTY ROOM 238
text: Daniel scans the quiet, eerie room. He's startled as he
text: SEES a young seven year old BOY standing in the doorway.
text: Emotionless and completely still, the Boy stares at Daniel.
text: Slowly Daniel gets to his feet, attempting to regain his
text: balance. Once up, the Boy turns and walks out of the room.
text: Daniel is unsure if he should follow. Suddenly the Boy STOPS,
text: turns back, staring at Daniel. Daniel takes a step towards
text: him and the Boy continues.
scene_heading: INT. PALACE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 239
text: Several yards ahead of him, the Boy leads Daniel down this
text: immense and imposing hallway. Daniel follows, disorientated,
text: his eyes scanning the room. He sees a CAT cross his path.
text: Surprised, Daniel continues down and he sees ANOTHER cat,
text: perched on a short flight of stairs. Still walking forward,
text: Daniel turns back towards the Boy, only to find he's GONE.
text: Daniel looks ahead and sees another doorway. Assuming the
text: Boy went through, Daniel cautiously follows.
scene_heading: INT. BATH CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 240
text: Slowly Daniel enters. He pushes his way through thin silk

dialog: 242
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: RA - BATH 241
text: Ra sits in his ornate sunken bath. Daniel watches him for a

text: to the children who come, carrying his long robe.
text: Holding it before him, Ra walks out of the bath, into his

dialog: and speaks.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: I died.
text: Surprised Daniel can speak his language, Ra stops and turns
text: towards him. A subtle smile crosses Ra's lips. He then

scene_heading: INT. RA'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 242
text: Ra leads Daniel across the room past a long marble table.
text: On which are the recovered belongings of the soldiers

text: turns back to Daniel, studies his reaction for a long beat.
dialog: Finally...
speaker_heading: RA
dialog: (subtitled)

speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: RA
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: There can only be one Ra.
text: He hands the Sun Disk back to Daniel.
speaker_heading: RA (CONT'D)
dialog: (subtitled)

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (subtitled)

scene_heading: TWO WINGED GLIDERS

scene_heading: DANIEL AND ANUBIS
text: With his mask in place, Anubis steps through the hanging

text: shocked to discover Daniel still alive. He and the soldiers
text: exchange questioning glances.
text: Daniel avoids eye contact with the soldiers as Anubis leads
text: him next to the empty throne.
text: Sari SEES Daniel. Her expression brightens. She pushes
text: through the crowd to get nearer to the platform.
text: Leaving Daniel's side, Anubis steps to the center of the
text: platform, raising his arms. The entire crowd BOWS DOWN. We
text: see a very bruised Kasuf, helped by the town Elders to his
text: knees in prayer.
text: Anubis looks over to Daniel who reluctantly bows down before
text: the throne. The entire assembly bows and a dozen CHILDREN
text: rush out from behind the fabric, grabbing on to poles,
text: connected to the bottom of the material. The Children peel
text: off to the sides, LIFTING the fabric.
text: As it PARTS we SEE the striking image of RA, SUN GOD as he
text: slowly steps out into the light. Again, we see him with his
text: illusion/mask in place gold skin, elaborate headdress, etc.
text: Ra takes his place on the throne. Once seated, the crowd
text: stands, silently. Anubis stands and offers his weapon to
text: the Pharaoh. Ra accepts it. He turns and offers it to
dialog: Daniel.
text: Anubis puts his hand roughly on Daniel's shoulder. Daniel,
text: knowing what is expected of him, is torn. Slowly he stands

text: He turns back to the faces of the Soldiers as he approaches.
text: Daniel stops a few feet in front of O'Neil who only stares
text: at him, harshly. Daniel turns, looks back to Ra who only

dialog: up...
scene_heading: THE WINGED GLIDERS 249

speaker_heading: ANGLE - SKAARA 250

scene_heading: ONE OF THE SOLDIER'S RIFLES 251
text: Retrieved from the base camp, Skaara holds the gun close to

text: the other side of the ramp and recognizes two OTHER Shepherd
text: boys, waiting.
text: Daniel turns back to O'Neil as he lifts the weapon, COCKING
text: it, ready to FIRE. Suddenly Daniel SPINS, and FIRES the
text: weapon at the top of the ramp.
text: A huge CHUNK of the ramp EXPLODES before the two guards,
text: blocking their view of Daniel.
text: Suddenly Skaara DRAWS the rifle and begins FIRING INTO THE

text: drawing weapons and FIRING.
text: The crowd panics, no one knows which way to run. Pandemonium.
text: Seizing the opportunity, Daniel and O'Neil JUMP off the ramp

text: O'Neil slaps at the side of the Mastadge.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: How do you make this stupid thing go
dialog: faster!
text: Barely holding on, Daniel PULLS himself up and GRABS onto
dialog: the Mastadge's EAR.
text: Again, the Mastadge KICKS UP speed, racing over the dunes.
scene_heading: ANGLE - GLIDER AND DUNES 259
text: Though the Mastadge has picked up speed, he's no match for
text: the Gliders who narrow the gap. The Gliders FIRE a power
text: burst at the Mastadge.
text: Missing, the power burst EXPLODES into the sand, a few feet
text: in front of the Mastadge. Startled, the Mastadge REARS UP
text: and takes off in another direction.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - O'NEIL 260
text: He looks back, seeing the Gliders approach. He looks ahead.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL

dialog: It's no use. When we're over the

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Drop?
speaker_heading: GLIDERS 261
text: Racing towards us. As they look down, they see the Mastadge

scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF DUNE 262
text: Tumbling down the dune, the Mastadge galloping ahead, Daniel
text: and O'Neil roll to a stop. Instantly O'Neil starts to BURY
text: HIMSELF in the sand. Picking up the cue, Daniel copies
text: O'Neil, throwing sand over himself.

text: They find the Mastadge on the other side, but O'Neil and
dialog: Daniel are GONE!
text: The Gliders circle the area, but O'Neil and Daniel are nowhere
text: to be seen. The Gliders circle one more time. Seeing
text: nothing, they turn and head back.
scene_heading: ANGLE - SAND - CLOSE 264
text: Just as the Gliders pass overhead, disappearing over the
text: dune, O'Neil's and Daniel's heads POP OUT of the sand.
text: Quickly O'Neil climbs the dune, watching the Gliders depart
text: as Daniel spits out sand, climbing after him.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You think they'1l come back?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Why should they? In an hour we'll
dialog: be buried alive.
text: Reaching the top of the dune, Daniel turns to see what O'Neil
dialog: is talking about. He SEES...
speaker_heading: A SAND STORM 265

scene_heading: INT. RA'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 268
text: Ra sits, seething with humiliation and anger. Anguished, Ra
text: sits privately when he's suddenly TUGGED by a YOUNG BOY (10

text: Furious at the invasion, Ra SPINS and GLARES at the boy, his

scene_heading: INT. RA'S THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 268A
text: Seething with anger, Ra quickly marches into the room only

speaker_heading: HORUS #1
dialog: (subtitled)

speaker_heading: RA

speaker_heading: HORUS #2
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: We lost them in the sand storm.
dialog: Surely they will be killed.
text: Ra boils, holding in his anger. He stands and walks over to
text: a box of jewelry. Hiding it from the others, Ra takes out a
text: GOLDEN RING AND DISK; the ring fitting over his finger, the
text: attached disk hid in the palm of his hand.
text: Turning back Ra moves slowly towards Horus #2, motioning
text: with his other hand for Horus #2 to stand. He does, sensing
dialog: something is not right.
text: Slowly Horus #1 backs away. The children exchange nervous
dialog: glances.
text: Horus #2 starts to get nervous, looking around the room. He
text: looks back to Ra who only smiles, reassuringly; everything's
text: alright. Horus #2 seems to calm down.
text: Ra lifts his hand as though to gently embrace his face when
text: suddenly he OPENS his palm exposing the DISK. Horus #2's
text: eyes go wide with fear but before he can react.. The disk
text: ACTIVATES. Horus #2 suddenly begins to SHAKE VIOLENTLY, his
text: features begin to DISTORT. He SCREAMS OUT IN PAIN. Ra
text: watches this torture emotionlessly, waiting for his victim
text: to expire. He does.
text: As he drops to the floor, Ra turns to the group of children
text: who stare back at him frightened. Ra motions for the OLDEST

text: They try to shield themselves at the side of the Mastadge,
text: but it does little to help. Movement becomes more and more
text: difficult. Daniel suddenly drops to his knees.
text: The Mastadge turns back and sees Daniel getting buried in
text: the sand and ROARS OUT. O'Neil lifts his arm holding it
text: over his eyes. He, too, drops down, losing consciousness.
text: The harsh winds quickly begin to bury the men in sand.
text: Unaffected by the storm, the Mastadge watches them, unable
dialog: to help.
text: Suddenly through the blurry sands we SEE several SHAPES
text: apparently coming UP FROM THE SAND. The figures GRAB onto

dialog: to SEE...
scene_heading: SKAARA - SHEPHERD BOYS 270

scene_heading: INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 271
text: Through the mouth of a large cave we SEE several FIGURES
text: coming towards us through the sand clouds churning outside.
text: Helping them out of the storm we SEE Skaara and two boys
text: bringing Daniel and O'Neil inside.
text: Once within the protective walls, O'Neil looks up and SEES,
text: the rest of the Shepherd boys wearing the army fatigues,
text: helmets and guns they retrieved from the base camp. Leaning
text: against the wall, the weapon Ra gave Daniel.
text: At the back of the cave he SEES Feretti, getting some aid to
text: a wound. Kawalsky turns, sees O'Neil and rushes over to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: You made it!
text: Sari walks in from the opposite side, looking for Daniel.
text: Daniel begins to cough, only semi-conscious as he's helped

text: Realizing it's her, Daniel smiles.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: the kids)
dialog: What do you think, Colonel? It's not

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Take the guns away from them
dialog: Lieutenant before they hurt

speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: You heard me. Send them home.
text: Daniel looks up, his head clearing.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
text: There's nowhere for them to go.
dialog: They were seen helping us. They'll
dialog: be hunted down and killed.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: We could sure use the help, Sir.
text: O'Neil spins back to Kawalsky, suddenly furious.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: We've already lost four highly trained
dialog: men! Now you hand me a bunch of
dialog: kids?!
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: But, Sir, they saved our lives?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: For what!? To do what?
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: To help us get back home.
text: O'Neil looks at Kawalsky sadly. He turns and walks away.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why don't you tell 'em the truth?
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Truth?
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (to O'Neil)
dialog: Tell them why you planted a nuclear
text: bomb next to the StarGate.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: What's he talking about, Colonel?
text: O'Neil doesn't answer. Finally...
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: (calm)
dialog: My orders were simple. Cross the
dialog: bridge, hold the bridge, and at the
dialog: first sign of danger, destroy the
dialog: bridge.
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Why didn't you tell us?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: It was strictly "need to know."
speaker_heading: KAWALSKY
dialog: Need to know? Need to know? I think
dialog: that's something I'd need to know!
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Do you realize what you've started?
dialog: Tomorrow, when they send off the
dialog: next delivery of quartz, Ra's going
dialog: to send them your Goddamned bomb.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Send who?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Who do you think? Someone put him
dialog: in charge of all this. We're talking
text: about a highly advanced, oppressive
dialog: and hostile culture who use people
dialog: like we use cattle. We were no threat
dialog: to them. They wrote us off thousands
dialog: of years ago. How do you think
dialog: they're going to react when they
dialog: find out what we've become?!
text: O'Neil stands, considering his options. Sari and the Shepherd
text: boys stare at the argument, confused.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Then we'll have to be there before
dialog: they can send it through. We get
dialog: back the device, I can destroy the
dialog: StarGate.
dialog: 272
dialog: 95.
text: Trying to talk some sense to O'Neil, Daniel walks over to
text: him. Frustrated, Daniel gets angry.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Destroying this one gate won't
dialog: accomplish anything! There are bound
dialog: to be more.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: You have a better idea?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We've got to get back home and
text: dismantle the gate on our side.
dialog: Then hope they leave us alone.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Well, thanks to you, we don't have
dialog: that option.
dialog: (turning back to his
dialog: men)
dialog: Lieutenant, we leave this place at

text: O'Neil marches out into another part of the cave. Feretti,
dialog: who's been silent...
speaker_heading: FERETTI
text: Great. A suicide mission.
scene_heading: INT. LOOKOUT CAVE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 272
text: Staring off, O'Neil stands alone in the middle of this cave.
text: Across from him we can see the storm raging outside.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (0.S.)
dialog: You realize, if you go through with
dialog: this, a lot of innocent people will
dialog: be killed.
text: O'Neil doesn't answer, keeping his back to Daniel who stands
text: at the back of the cave.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You were right you know. I only
dialog: cared about saving my reputation.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry I lied.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Doesn't matter anymore.
text: There's a silent moment, but something Daniel has to ask.
speaker_heading: 273
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You knew from the beginning that
dialog: you'd have to destroy the gate, didn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: "Sealed and buried for all time."
dialog: That's how it translated, right? Why
dialog: would they bury it? Think? It was
dialog: a warning.
text: Daniel realizes he's right. How could he have been so blind?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don't understand. If you knew,
dialog: how could you take this assignment?
dialog: You have a family? A son?
text: O'Neil stares off with the same distant look he had on when
dialog: we first saw him.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: I had a family.
text: Realizing, Daniel is moved. He offers...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm sorry. I know what it's like to
dialog: lose someone you love.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: No one should ever have to outlive
dialog: their own child. It just isn't right.
text: Suddenly Skaara appears behind them carrying a bowl of food
text: he holds out for O'Neil.
speaker_heading: SKAARA
dialog: Anaasar?
text: O'Neil doesn't even look at him. He just walks away, over
text: to the edge of the cave, staring out into the night. Skaara,
dialog: afraid he said something wrong turns to Daniel. Daniel can't
text: face him and walks out.
text: Skaara considers a second, sniffs at the food to make sure
text: it's okay, then walks over to O'Neil.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - O'NEIL 273
text: O'Neil sits at the edge of the cave, his mind a million light
text: years away. Skaara walks up alongside him.
speaker_heading: SKAARA
dialog: Anaasar.
dialog: 274
dialog: 275
dialog: 97.
text: Still O'Neil ignores him. Slowly Skaara slides the plate of
text: food in front of O'Neil's face as you would do to a reluctant
text: child. Finally O'Neil turns and sees Skaara's smiling face.
speaker_heading: SKAARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Nakdes Anaasar.
speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Anaasar, right.
text: Uncomfortable, O'Neil reluctantly takes the bowl from Skaara
text: who promptly sits down next to him. O'Neil begins to eat as
text: Skaara smiles proudly.
scene_heading: INT. CORNER OF CAVE - SAME 274
text: Daniel slowly walks back inside, troubled. He turns a corner
text: of the cave where Kawalsky and Feretti are conferring with
text: each other. But as Daniel nears, they suddenly become quiet,
dialog: giving Daniel the "cold shoulder."
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - MAIN ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 275
text: Daniel enters. He sees several of the Shepherd boys
text: surrounding Sari who prepares food for them. As Sari stokes
text: the flames below her cooking pot, Daniel walks up and serves
text: some food to one of the waiting Shepherd boys.
text: The boy stares at Daniel, shocked, then starts to giggle.
text: Even Sari looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What?
text: Even Sari suppresses a laugh, turning away from him.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Why are they laughing?
text: Sari takes the serving bowl from him and walks over to
text: Kawalsky and Feretti, feeding them. The boys continue to
text: chuckle at Daniel's expense. Daniel doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (subtitled; to boys)
dialog: Why do you laugh?
text: This just makes them laugh more. Finally one BOY (#2) turns
text: and answers.
speaker_heading: BOY #2
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Husbands do not do this work.
text: Daniel is completely taken off guard.
speaker_heading: 276

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Husband?
text: Sari walks back over and Daniel turns to her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: He called me your "husband."
text: Suddenly filled with embarrassment, Sari hurries away. Again
text: the boys titter with laughter. Daniel walks over to Sari at
text: the back of the cave.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: What is it?
text: Again, Sari is ashamed. She won't look Daniel in the eye.
text: Skaara enters, sees the boys giggling, peering around the
text: corner of the cave, spying on Daniel and Sari.
scene_heading: SKAARA'S P.O.V. - DANIEL AND SARI 276
text: Very close together, Daniel reaches over, touching Sari's
text: shoulder. Skaara, seeing this, turns and SHOOS the boys
text: away, giving Daniel and Sari some privacy.
speaker_heading: DANIEL AND SARI 277
text: Still avoiding his eyes, Sari finally speaks to Daniel.
speaker_heading: SARI
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: I'm sorry. Don't be angry with me.
dialog: I didn't tell them.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Tell them what?
speaker_heading: SARI
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: That you did not want me.
text: Sari turns away, shamed. Daniel realizes she's referring to
text: when she was brought to him in Nagada.
text: He slowly turns her back towards him. Gently he leans close
text: and kisses her.
text: Their lips part and Sari looks up at Daniel, searching his

text: As Daniel sits up he finds, all the Shepherd boys have taken

text: near the front of the cave.
scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0.V. - SKAARA 279
text: Skaara sits by a dying fire, working on some drawings he
text: scratches into the wall. Curious, Daniel stands and starts

text: Imitating the drawings seen earlier in the catacombs, Skaara
text: chalks up the wall of the cave with primitive sketches.
text: Pleased, Daniel smiles.
scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - SKETCHES - SAME 280
text: A simple set of drawings detailing the rescue in front of

text: Suddenly Daniel's expression changes. Slowly he gets up and
text: moves closer to the sketches.
scene_heading: DANIEL'S P.0.V. - PYRAMID SKETCH 281
text: We slowly PUSH IN to the drawing of the team before the

dialog: side.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: My God. The point of origin.
text: Quickly Daniel moves close to the drawing. He takes the

speaker_heading: DANIEL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: O'NEIL
dialog: Well, what are we waiting for?

dialog: to make a decision; save himself or take a gigantic chance

text: SEE a piece of Sari's dress get CAUGHT outside the cylinder.
text: The cloth is SEVERED. Gently it sails to the floor.
text: We FOLLOW the cloth to the ground. Behind it we SEE the
