speaker_heading: SUPER: 1968
text: On a darkened living room, a huge summer moon spilling silver
text: through a window.
text: We move slowly across the mantelpiece where a pair of candles
text: glow, illuminating family photos. Weddings two, maybe three
text: generations back -- brides in white, their young grooms at
text: their sides, frozen in time. As we pan, we hear two VOICES
text: offscreen: a BOY'S and a GIRL'S.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Stop pushing it. You're not
dialog: supposed to force it. You're
dialog: supposed to just let it happen.
speaker_heading: BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm not pushing it, you're pushing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I am not.
dialog: Silence. Until,
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You're pushing it again.
text: An exasperated sigh.
speaker_heading: BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Well, hurry up. My foot's falling
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Mo-mmm. Larry's pushing it.
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: (from the next
dialog: room)
dialog: Larry, don't push it.
text: And now, we finally pan over to discover two KIDS playing with
text: a Ouija board. For future reference, the players are FAITH
text: (age eleven), and her brother LARRY (ten).
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Wait. I have to write this down.
text: A groan out of him. She grabs a piece of paper and starts
text: scrawling out a series of letters.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Grandma told me everybody has a
dialog: soul mate.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: But most people never find theirs,
dialog: most people settle. I'm never
dialog: gonna settle.
text: She gazes up as the ripe summer moon slips behind a bank of
text: clouds.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: This way I'll know the name of the
dialog: man I'm supposed to wait for.
text: The arrow continues to move around the board, stopping on
text: various letters which she copies down.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yeah, but, what if this guy lived
dialog: a billion, trillion years ago?
dialog: Like, what if he was a cave man,
dialog: and now he's dead?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Don't be stupid, Larry. If he's
dialog: my destiny, then, obviously, he
dialog: has to be alive.
dialog: Another letter.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live
dialog: here? Like, what if he's a
dialog: cannibal in New Guinea or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: If I live here, then he lives here.
dialog: Fate wouldn't make a mistake like
dialog: that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And stop talking. You're gonna
dialog: ruin the spell.
dialog: Another pause. Another letter. Then... Ever the devil's
dialog: advocate,
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Yeah, but... but, Faith, what if
dialog: he does live here, and one day you
text: just walk past him on the street?
dialog: I mean, you don't hear his name,
dialog: you don't get a chance to introduce
dialog: yourselves. You practically bump
dialog: straight into each other, but you
dialog: never even know it?
text: Right in his face,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We'll KNOW.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okaaaaayyyy.
text: The arrow comes slowly to a halt. And she writes down the
text: final letter, as the moon again breaks through the clouds,
text: throwing a bright white beam of light directly onto the name
dialog: which reads:
speaker_heading: FAITH (O.S.)
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Damon Bradley.
text: (she looks up,
dialog: spellbound)
dialog: He's the one.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Goodie. Can I ask about the Series
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT
text: A screaming face. Whirling lights. A local carnival. The
dialog: small-town traveling kind.
text: SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER.
text: Up on the ferris wheel, a bunch of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
text: are distinguishing themselves by hurling water balloons down
text: at carnival-goers. Among the participants is Faith's brother
dialog: Larry.
text: PULL DOWN from them to "MADAME DIVINA'S FORTUNE TELLING
text: BOOTH". "Know Your Fate". Clustered in front of it are a
text: bunch of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS.
dialog: We should recognize Faith as one of them. Another girl,
text: LESLIE, is egging a friend on.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Go on, go on...
dialog: (to the rest)
dialog: She wants to know if she's gonna
dialog: marry Alex.
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: I do not. I'm not gonna marry
dialog: Alex.
dialog: (obviously)
text: He doesn't even have a car.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: But he's got pretty eyes. That
dialog: means your kids would have pretty
dialog: eyes. You can always get a car
dialog: later, but you can't always find
dialog: pretty eyes. You gotta think
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: GIRL #3
dialog: Who cares about pretty eyes,
dialog: Leslie? I'm telling you, stocks,
dialog: bonds, real estate -- that's what
dialog: you wanna look for in a man.
speaker_heading: GIRL #4
dialog: (dismissing)
dialog: Heh...
speaker_heading: GIRL #3
dialog: What then?
speaker_heading: GIRL #4
dialog: (the voice of
dialog: authority)
dialog: Definitely sex.
text: Somebody else pipes up,
speaker_heading: GIRL #5
dialog: My mom told me you gotta want the
dialog: same things out of life. Have the
dialog: same values, be able to
dialog: communicate.
text: They all turn to look blankly at this poor, misguided soul.
speaker_heading: GIRL #5
dialog: I'm just telling you what she said.
text: They're still looking at her.
speaker_heading: GIRL #5
dialog: It's not like I believed her or
dialog: anything...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I think you're all wrong.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: What do you think the most
dialog: important thing is, Faith?
text: There is not a doubt in her mind.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: True love. I believe there's one
dialog: special person out there who's
dialog: meant for each of us. And when
dialog: your eyes meet, it'll be magic and
dialog: you'll both know it instantly.
text: A couple of dissenters roll their eyes.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (turning to another
dialog: friend)
dialog: Don't you think so, Kate?
text: KATE's looking at the ground, trying to sound casual.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know, I guess I never
dialog: really thought about it...
dialog: (in her next
dialog: breath)
dialog: Is Larry here?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (she couldn't care
dialog: less)
dialog: Yeah. He's around somewhere.
text: Up above, Larry takes careful aim, then sends a water balloon
text: torpedoing their way. It hits the ground between them with
text: an enormous SPLAT. They SCREAM.
scene_heading: INT. FORTUNE TELLING BOOTH - NIGHT
text: We move past them, through a beaded window and into the booth
text: where a disheveled older WOMAN, MADAME DIVINA, is paging
text: through a copy of "Scientific American".
text: There's a TAP at the door. She checks her watch. Curses.
text: She shoves the magazine in a drawer, then hoists a bowling
text: ball, the kind with the iridescent swirls in them, onto an
text: opening in the center of the table, carefully positioning it
text: so the three holes aren't visible. She flicks on a flashlight
text: above it. Crystal ball.
text: Back outside, the girl everybody-thinks-is-going-to-marry-Alex
text: is nervous.
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: But what if she tells me something
dialog: bad? I don't want to hear anything
dialog: bad...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: They never tell you anything bad.
dialog: Nobody'd ever go to them if they
dialog: did.
text: The door opens. The WOMAN'S imposing hulk casts a shadow down
text: over them. They look up.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: Who knocked?
text: Like deer in the headlights.
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: (pointing at Kate)
dialog: She did.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (pointing at girl
dialog: #2)
dialog: She did.
dialog: Nobody moves, until,
speaker_heading: FAITH (O.S.)
dialog: I did.
text: Faith looks at her friends, shrugs, then gamely ventures
text: inside past the beads and sits down.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Faith.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: (lighting a candle)
dialog: What do you wanna know, Faith?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Um, just basic destiny stuff, I
dialog: guess. But-- I don't want to hear
dialog: anything bad.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If that's okay.
text: Madame Divina starts laying out a series of tarot cards.
text: Suddenly there's a loud KNOCK at the back door. Faith jumps.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: (dismissing)
dialog: Spirits.
text: She lays down a couple more cards. Then a persistent
text: "PSSSSTTTT", "PSSSSTTT". More BANGING.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: (hollering)
dialog: Harry, I'm outta change.
text: More KNOCKING. Harry is determined. Annoyed, Mme. Divina
text: finally gets up.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: How come I always wind up next door
dialog: to the freak show?
dialog: (as she goes)
dialog: Just because they're midgets does
dialog: that mean they don't have to go
dialog: to the bank like the rest of us?
text: She lumbers to the back of the booth, throws open a back door
text: and looks down.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: What?
text: Inside, Faith is nervously eying the cards. Her friend KATE
text: peeks in through the beads.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (mouthing the words
dialog: and pointing)
dialog: Is that a bowling ball?
text: Faith doesn't understand. Kate mimes a bowling motion,
text: swinging her arm. Faith shrugs. As the woman returns, from
dialog: outside we overhear,
speaker_heading: BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Kate. Larry wants you.
speaker_heading: LARRY (O.S.)
dialog: I do not.
text: Kate grins, ducks out. Mme. Divina sits back down. Closes
text: her eyes. Fingers the ball, entranced.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: Something is coming to me. I'm
dialog: getting... a name.
text: Faith leans forward.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: (straining)
dialog: This name is very important to
dialog: you... Da-- David. No-- no...
text: A faint breeze flutters through the room and the candle starts
dialog: to flicker.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: Damon.
text: Faith's heart skips a beat.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: His name is...
text: (her eyes pop open
dialog: with startling
dialog: intensity)
dialog: Damon Bradley.
dialog: It is, of course, the same name.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: Omigod. Omigod.
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: I have to go.
text: She seizes Faith's hand.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: Just a minute--
text: Faith freezes.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: Your destiny's two dollars.
text: Faith pulls out two bills, drops them on the table. Bolts
text: for the door. But the woman stops her again.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: Hey--
text: She leans in very close and pulls Faith toward her. We should
dialog: sense that this is not part of the act. This is for real.
speaker_heading: FORTUNE TELLER
dialog: The truth is, no matter what the
dialog: cards say, you make your own
dialog: destiny. Don't wait for it to come
dialog: to you. You understand?
text: Faith nods. Still in shock.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Can I be excused now?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SUPER: TWENTY YEARS LATER -- SATURDAY NIGHT
text: We hear pouring rain. But what sounds like rain is actually
text: the shower, as we pull back to find Mitzi Gaynor washing that
text: man right out of her hair. "SOUTH PACIFIC" is on television.
text: We pull back even further to reveal three WOMEN watching.
dialog: A big Saturday night. There's a lot of chocolate on the
dialog: table.
text: The women are: the adult FAITH. Attractive, a little dreamy.
text: The walls of her apartment are adorned with reproductions of
dialog: famous works all featuring a similar theme, Rodin's "The
text: Kiss", Botticelli's "Birth of Venus", etc. Bookshelves are
text: crammed with volumes of poetry. She's absentmindedly pulling
text: the petals off a bouquet of flowers on the table.
text: Also in attendance: KATE, her childhood friend turned
text: housewife and sister-in-law. Kate is a pragmatist. She's
text: clipping coupons out of the newspaper as they watch. And,
text: doing her nails, LESLIE. Big hair. Good heart. Not the
text: sharpest tool in the shed.
text: As the movie cuts to a commercial,
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: I'm just saying I think it would
dialog: be a good idea.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (dubiously)
dialog: Date police...
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Yes. A guy who says he's gonna
dialog: call, then doesn't, ought to get
dialog: slapped with a citation, that's
dialog: all.
text: Faith glances at Kate. They're used to Leslie.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: (blowing on her
dialog: nails)
dialog: Anyway, like I said, I've given
dialog: it a lot of thought and I've
dialog: finally narrowed it down.
dialog: (beat)
text: A heterosexual with a job.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Well, I don't think it's asking
dialog: too much to want to feel it in my
dialog: head and my heart and my body and
dialog: my soul all at the same time, and
dialog: to have that feeling to be mutual.
dialog: Pass the M&Ms please.
text: Her friends groan. They're used to Faith. Kate hands the
text: candy over.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Not as long as you're not hoping
dialog: to find it on planet Earth.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Leslie's right, Faith. You've got
dialog: to start being more practical.
dialog: Do you know what the statistics
dialog: are, the marriage odds for women
dialog: your age?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don't believe in statistics.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're an accountant for cryin'
text: out loud.
text: Faith holds out both palms, gesturing that her point has been
dialog: made.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What about that guy you work with,
dialog: Mike what's-his-name?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: No. He smokes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How about the other one? His
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: Just moved in with his girlfriend.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: How about that guy at the bank?
text: Faith pops another M&M.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Scientologist.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (deflated)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So, you gotta be a little flexible.
dialog: Look at your brother and me.
dialog: Larry's not perfect, neither am
dialog: I. But we work it out. We're not
dialog: unrealistic in our expectations,
dialog: and we have each other.
dialog: (setting down her
dialog: scissors)
dialog: I think you've got the Door Number
dialog: Three Syndrome.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Yeah, I saw that. Like on Let's
dialog: Make A Deal. You've got the Amana
dialog: freezer and you can keep it, or
dialog: risk it on what's behind Door
dialog: Number Three. Which usually turns
text: out to be a donkey.
text: Faith looks at Kate.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don't have an Amana freezer.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's a metaphor. It's women who
dialog: always think there's some unknown
dialog: out there that's going to be better
text: than what's in front of them. And
text: instead wind up with nothing.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Metaphorically, I still don't have
text: an Amana freezer.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I think if you're honest with
dialog: yourself, you'll admit you've had
dialog: a chance at a number of Amana
dialog: appliances in your lifetime.
text: She knows there's probably some ugly truth to this. Luckily,
text: the PHONE RINGS. Faith picks it up.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Hello? Hi, Larry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah, she's here. Hold on.
dialog: (turning to Kate)
dialog: It's your husband.
scene_heading: INT. LARRY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: LARRY, Kate's husband, Faith's brother, is at the kitchen
text: table, munching the last crumbs out of a bag of potato chips
text: and watching television.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Kate, you're still there? I
dialog: thought you'd be on your way home
dialog: by now.
scene_heading: INT. FAITH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You miss me?...
scene_heading: INT. LARRY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Uh, yeah. Sure.
dialog: (gazing forlornly
dialog: into the
dialog: refrigerator)
dialog: Honey, did you forget the guys are
dialog: coming over tonight?
speaker_heading: KATE (ON PHONE)
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (helplessly)
dialog: Well, there's nothing here to eat.
scene_heading: INT. FAITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Over the movie, we hear yelling -- Kate's half of the fight
text: -- in the background. Then the SLAMMING of the receiver.
text: When she comes back into the room, the "Some Enchanted
text: Evening" number is on. Faith is mouthing the words. Kate
text: starts picking up her coupons.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Is everything okay?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (glancing at the
dialog: tv, annoyed)
dialog: You know all the shrinks on Donahue
dialog: say that all those love songs about
text: some enchanted evening are just
text: a cruel hoax that feeds people's
dialog: fantasies.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (a little
dialog: plaintive)
dialog: But somebody wrote those songs.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So, what's your point?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Just that they came out of
dialog: somebody's experience is all.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, Faith. They came out of
dialog: somebody's imagination.
scene_heading: EXT. FAITH'S DOOR - NIGHT
text: Faith walks her friends to the door, opens it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I wish you didn't have to go so
dialog: early.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (still annoyed)
dialog: Yeah, well, Larry and his friends
dialog: are hungry.
dialog: (relenting)
dialog: And I did say I'd try to pick
dialog: something up.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: And I told Ted I'd be home later
dialog: if he wanted to stop by.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I thought you said you thought he
dialog: had a date.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Well, after that.
text: As they talk, a slight GUY, one who might best be described
text: as, well, non-descript, walks by and heads into his apartment.
scene_heading: NON-DESCRIPT GUY
dialog: How's it going?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Pretty well, Dwayne. How about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Can't complain.
text: He closes his door. Kate looks at Faith. Who shakes her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Is he married?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Is he gay?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don't know. I don't think so.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So?...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So, he's not my type.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let me walk you to the elevator.
dialog: They walk.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What's he do?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don't know, Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You don't have any idea?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: He's a podiatrist or something.
speaker_heading: KATE AND LESLIE
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: He's a doctor?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Look, there's no chemistry there,
dialog: okay? There's no... thrill.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: "Thrills"? That's what you're
dialog: waiting for? You know how long
dialog: that lasts? Besides, how do you
dialog: know? Have you ever been out with
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No. He's never asked me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Why don't you ask him?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Why should I ask someone out who
dialog: I don't want to go out with in the
dialog: first place?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: If you've never been out with him,
dialog: how do you know you don't want to
dialog: go out with him?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: (almost more to
dialog: herself)
dialog: I thought he was kinda cute...
text: Faith sighs. Mercifully, the elevator doors finally open.
text: Kate and Leslie get in. As the doors close,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Take a chance, Faith... None of
dialog: us is getting any younger...
scene_heading: INT. FAITH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Faith re-enters her apartment. The answering machine light
text: is blinking. She plays the message back as she gets ready
dialog: for bed.
scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: Hi, honey. It's Mom. I just
dialog: wanted to apologize if I upset you
dialog: at brunch today.
text: To herself in the bathroom mirror,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: If you upset me at brunch today?
scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: (correcting
dialog: herself)
dialog: For upsetting you at brunch today.
dialog: Now, you know I don't think you're
dialog: a failure. And if you never get
dialog: married, that's perfectly fine with
dialog: your father and me.
text: Faith is applying eye cream. She leans in closer, carefully
text: examining the lines around her eyes.
scene_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE
dialog: Of course you're not a freak.
dialog: You're right, plenty of people
dialog: aren't married.
dialog: (trying to be
dialog: supportive)
dialog: The guy who cuts my hair isn't
dialog: married. Hey... maybe you tw--
dialog: (a voice in the
dialog: background)
dialog: He's gay.
dialog: (her mother)
dialog: Oh. Never mind. Anyway, if you
dialog: want to spend the rest of your life
dialog: alone, well, that's your choice.
dialog: And I respect it. I just want you
dialog: to be happy, that's all.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hold on, your Dad wants to say
dialog: something.
dialog: (male voice)
dialog: Good fruit salad today, Faith.
dialog: (Mom takes the
dialog: phone back)
dialog: We'll talk to you soon, sweetie.
text: The machine shuts off. Faith gets into bed. Reaches for the
text: light. Then, remembering something, gets up.
text: There's a daily calendar lying on her dresser. She rips off
text: the top page, crumples it into a ball, drops it into the
dialog: wastebasket.
text: And turns out the light.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: A vast audience of PEOPLE, all clad in ridiculous get-ups.
text: Faith is wearing a chicken suit. Her Mother is there, in an
text: octopus costume. Kate and Larry are Siamese twins. Leslie
text: is dressed as a radish. MONTY HALL steps up to Faith.
speaker_heading: MONTY HALL
dialog: So, which one is it gonna be,
dialog: Faith? Will it be... Door Number
dialog: One?...
text: DWAYNE, the podiatrist, peeks out from between the curtains
text: of Door Number One. Waves. The CROWD goes WILD.
speaker_heading: MONTY HALL
dialog: Door Number Two?...
text: The distinct BRAYING of a DONKEY can be heard emanating from
text: behind Door Number Two.
speaker_heading: MONTY HALL
dialog: Or Door Number Three?...
text: A complete mystery. This one seems to glow.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: (chanting)
dialog: Take Dwayne! Take Dwayne!
text: CAROL MERRILL is running an arm sensuously along Door Number
dialog: One.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Door Number Three?
text: Murmurs of dismay ripple through the crowd. The curtains
text: part. To reveal a shriveled OLD CRONE, covered in cobwebs,
text: who bears an unsettling resemblance to Faith. The crowd BOOS.
scene_heading: INT. FAITH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Faith shoots up in bed, in a cold sweat.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FAITH'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Faith exits her apartment and heads down the hall, carrying
text: a wastebasket. She opens the garbage chute, lifts up the
text: basket, but as she tilts it, her hand slips and a multitude
text: of crumpled little balls, all those days, go spilling out onto
text: the floor. She just stares down at them, on the edge. When,
dialog: O.S.
dialog: You need some help?
text: She looks up. It's Dwayne.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I do...
text: SLOW FADE TO BLACK.
text: It's on a little BRIDE AND GROOM atop a massive wedding cake,
text: rotating to an endless loop of "We've Only Just Begun".
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Okay, it's settled.
text: Pull back to reveal Faith on the other side of the bakery
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: This one, in vanilla. He wants
text: vanilla.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - EVENING
text: Kate and Larry are dressed up. Driving through a
text: thunderstorm.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: This is the last one before the
dialog: wedding, right?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And we didn't have to bring another
dialog: present?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No.
scene_heading: EXT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A party. Champagne corks POP, MUSIC plays, GUESTS circulate.
text: We move around the room, picking up snatches of conversation.
text: Dwayne is leading Faith around by the hand. Thrusting her
text: ring finger into people's faces.
text: She's embarrassedly playing along.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: That's right. Six grand. Can you
dialog: believe what they get for these
dialog: things? I'm telling you, it's
dialog: highway robbery.
text: He pats her ass proprietarily.

text: up to her, offering their congratulations.
scene_heading: ELDERLY RELATIVE
dialog: (sotto, to her
dialog: mother)
dialog: We'd almost given up hope, dear.
text: In another corner,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Not only is it tacky, it's
dialog: exploitation.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's not exploitation. These
dialog: people wanna sell and I wanna buy.
dialog: How are golf clubs exploitation?
dialog: (to a woman nearby)
text: She takes one night class and
text: suddenly she's a socialist.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sociologist. And because.
dialog: (ticking them off)
dialog: Pawn shops are just like
dialog: prostitutes, farm auctions and coal
dialog: miners. They're all for sale, but
dialog: none of 'em would be if they
dialog: weren't desperate for the money.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: We're all desperate for the money,
dialog: doll. That's what made this
dialog: country great.
dialog: (to the woman
dialog: again)
dialog: Back me up on this Candy, am I
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don't call me doll, Larry. I hate
dialog: it when you call me doll.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You used to love it when I called
dialog: you doll.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You said it differently then.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Dwayne's got a captive audience and is holding court near the
text: front door. Faith is across the room, a tray of food in her
text: hands. The DOORBELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: (ignoring it)
dialog: ...I'm not kidding. All over the
dialog: metatarsus. Corns the size of your
dialog: fist-- and this fungus...
dialog: (searching)
dialog: You know the way tuna fish looks
dialog: when it's been in the back of the
dialog: refrigerator for about six months?
dialog: Anyway--
text: His listeners start silently returning their hors d'oeuvres
text: to the serving trays. The doorbell RINGS some more.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: (to Faith)
dialog: Honey, could you get that? I'm
dialog: in the middle of a story here--
text: Faith sets down the tray. Goes to the door. Outside is
dialog: Leslie.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Sorry I'm late. I was waiting for
text: a phone call.
text: Faith welcomes her in, introduces her to some other guests.
text: Larry comes over to congratulate his sister, gives her a kiss.
text: As he walks away,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: He begged me to marry him. I
dialog: didn't even want to marry him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (not unkindly)
dialog: Yes you did.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't
dialog: thought I was in love.
text: Off her look.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He tricked me. He was really fun
dialog: back then. And he was so cute...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How was I supposed to know that
dialog: ten years down the road he'd turn
dialog: out to be an idiot?
text: Dwayne pops his head in.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Hon-ey, picture time.
text: Faith gets up to follow him. As they go, he turns to her,
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: You gonna leave your hair like
dialog: that?
text: Her hair looks exactly as it has all evening. But she's
text: anxiously trying to somehow rearrange it as the FLASH POPS,
text: and the FRAME FREEZES.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOORWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The party's over. They're saying goodnight to the few
text: remaining guests. The door closes one last time. Faith
text: starts cleaning up, picking up plates, etc. Dwayne's standing
text: in the bedroom doorway, unbuttoning his shirt, already getting
text: ready for bed.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: This was really nice.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It was, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: You did a terrific job, honey.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: (putting his arms
dialog: around her)
dialog: And just think... This is only
dialog: the beginning.
text: He kisses her forehead. Releases her. Heads for the bedroom.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Oh, sweetie, you won't forget to
dialog: pick up my cleaning tomorrow, will
dialog: you?
text: She starts to respond, but-- he's already disappeared. A
text: distant roll of thunder rumbles through the room. The
text: candlelight flickers. And the rain descends.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: A sea of white, with a tiny face drowning in it. Massive
text: sleeves, an enormous hoop skirt, tiers of cascading ruffles
text: drenched in acres of white sequins.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I feel like the Good Witch of the
dialog: North.
text: Kate's helping Faith try on her gown and veil.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Come on, it's not so bad.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Look how big it makes me look.
dialog: (she looks down)
dialog: I look like an Alp.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I think it was sweet of him to pick
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I know... It was.
text: Kate positions the veil on her head.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Oh, I don't know. I guess it's
dialog: just not quite the way I always
dialog: thought it was going to be. You
dialog: know, like in the movies.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's the problem. When you're
dialog: a kid you think life is gonna be
dialog: like the movies. Dreams come true,
dialog: the good guys win, people live
dialog: happily ever after... all that
dialog: crap. Turn.
text: She turns. Kate continues adjusting the veil, pinning it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: But one day you wake up and realize
dialog: you've been had. Of course life
dialog: isn't like the movies. That's why
dialog: there are movies.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yeah. I guess you're right.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I really like the wallpaper we
text: picked out for the den.
text: But Kate's just getting warmed up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Let me tell you something about
dialog: love. There are no prince
dialog: charmings, there are no glass
dialog: slippers. Love is hard work.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I know. You're right.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: People have problems, insecurities,
dialog: flaws-- and you have to learn to
dialog: compromise, to overlook, to
dialog: forgive. It's not settling, Faith,
dialog: it's life. Real life.
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I understand, Kate.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you think of this garter?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (careening out of
dialog: control)
dialog: I mean, just how long are you going
dialog: to cling to this childish illusion
dialog: that it's all supposed to be
dialog: perfect? Well, guess what?...
dialog: It isn't. Not for you, not for
dialog: anybody.
text: Kate slams the pins down, scattering them. A long beat of
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Kate, is something the matter?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (shakily, staring
dialog: up at the ceiling)
dialog: Larry brought me flowers last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Is that bad?...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I think he's having an affair.
text: She buries her face in her hands.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: They're sitting down. Faith is handing Kate kleenex.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Okay. Now. Have you talked to
dialog: him about this?
text: Still looking down, Kate mutely shakes her head, "no".
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Have you seen him with someone?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No... I can just tell.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: After all, he is my brother, and
dialog: I know he can be kind of a jerk
dialog: sometimes, but I know him pretty
dialog: well, and I really don't think--
text: The PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Don't move.
text: Faith gets up and tries to head into the kitchen, but the
text: unfortunate combination of the big dress and the small doorway
text: stop her. She tries a variety of approaches before finally
text: turning the hoop skirt on an angle and suspending part of it
text: over her head, enabling her to squeeze through the doorway
text: just far enough to knock the receiver off the hook and grab
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Hello?
text: There's a lot of noise on the other end.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Hello? Is anybody there?
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: (louder, over the
dialog: noise)
dialog: Dwayne Pinsley? I'm trying to
text: reach Dwayne Pinsley.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: He's not in at the moment. Can
dialog: I take a message?
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (trying to wrench
dialog: herself free from
dialog: the doorway)
dialog: This is his fiancee. Who's this?
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: Oh, hi. I'm an old high school
dialog: buddy of Dwayne's. I was in town
dialog: this weekend, was hoping to stop
dialog: by and surprise him. But I've gotta
dialog: catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm
dialog: not gonna be able to make it.
text: Kate, wiping her eyes, mouths "who is it?" Faith shakes her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (wanting to get
dialog: off the phone)
dialog: I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear
dialog: that. Who should I tell him
dialog: called?
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: My name's (lots of noise)
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I can hardly hear you. Could you
dialog: spell that?
text: Kate hands Faith a pencil and the back of an RSVP card. And
text: letter by letter, we watch Faith scrawl out a name which, for
dialog: the second time in the movie, we realize spells "Damon
dialog: Bradley".
text: The receiver clatters to the floor.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (dumbstruck)
dialog: Damon Bradley...
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: Right. Thanks a lot. And
dialog: congratulations. It's not easy
dialog: finding love these days.
text: He's about to hang up. She's shaken out of her stupor. Grabs
text: the phone up off the floor.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: WAIT!! Where are you?
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: I'm at the airport. Why?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try
dialog: to reach you.
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: Well, he'd have to hurry. My
text: flight leaves at four o'clock.
text: She checks her watch. It's 3:15.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (like a shot)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: I'm on my way to Venice. Why?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (anything to keep
dialog: him on the phone)
dialog: Venice? I love Venice. With the
dialog: boats, right?...
speaker_heading: PHONE
dialog: (he's distracted)
dialog: Huh? Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run.
dialog: Tell Dwayne hi. Maybe someday we
dialog: can all get together.
dialog: Click.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: But wait-- Hello? Hello??
text: But there is only a dial tone. She stands there clinging
text: desperately to the receiver. A woman adrift in a life raft
text: who's suddenly seen a ship appear, then disappear back over
dialog: the horizon.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON
text: Faith, still in her wedding gown, is racing to her car. A
text: crazed gleam in her eye. Kate is tagging after her.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It's a miracle.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's a coincidence.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: The woman at my dry cleaners
dialog: believes there's no such thing as
dialog: coincidence.
text: Kate looks at her. So what?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (breathlessly)
dialog: Okay, okay, but don't you think
dialog: it's a weird coincidence? Doesn't
dialog: it seem like somebody's trying to
dialog: tell me something? And not only
dialog: that, take a look at this...
text: Faith pulls a clipped copy of the day's horoscope from her
text: purse. Kate scans the column.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Taurus: "Today can be a fresh start
dialog: and a new beginning."
dialog: (dropping it to
dialog: her side)
dialog: Come on Faith, they all say that.
dialog: In my case it means I'm gonna empty
text: the dishwasher.
text: She snatches back the paper, undeterred.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I just want to get a look at him,
dialog: that's all.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADWAY - AFTERNOON
text: Faith is driving like a maniac, her hoop skirt crammed in over
text: the edge of the dash, blocking the lower half of the
text: windshield.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT - AFTERNOON
text: Faith screeches to a halt in the passenger loading zone,
text: somehow manages to muscle the round hoop into an ellipse, and
text: springs out the door.
text: She mashes herself into one of those glass-partitioned
text: revolving doors, but gets stuck, making a few revolutions
text: before a couple of PASSERS-BY help pry her out on the other
dialog: side.
text: She scans a departure screen for the flight to Venice and
text: buttonholes a SKY CAP. He points to the distance.
text: She hikes up her gown and starts sprinting through the
text: airport, jumping luggage, can-can-ing through the turnstiles,
text: dodging kids, running up the down escalator.
scene_heading: INT. ALITALIA CHECK-IN COUNTER - AFTERNOON
text: Faith flings herself across the counter.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (breathlessly)
dialog: Flight 417. Is it still here?
text: The CLERK gives her the once-over. He hasn't seen this ploy
dialog: in awhile.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: May I see your boarding pass,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I-- I must've misplaced it.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I'm sorry, but without a boarding
dialog: pass we can't let you on the plane.
text: She starts digging through her purse, at the same time slowly
text: inching her way past the little rope they put up to block
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: I'm sure I've got it here
dialog: someplace...
text: He smiles back. And tightens the rope.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Great. Because, like I said, until
dialog: you find it, we can't let you on
dialog: the plane.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (panic rising in
dialog: her voice)
dialog: You don't understand. The man I'm
dialog: supposed to marry is on that plane.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
text: He picks up his phone.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yeah, this is Mario over at
dialog: Alitalia.
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: We've got a 237 on our hands here.
dialog: Uh huh. Yeah. Thanks.
text: He hangs up. The engines can be heard revving outside.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (back to her with
dialog: a plastic smile)
dialog: It'll be just a moment.
text: We see a SECURITY GUARD approaching. The Clerk starts waving
text: him over. Meanwhile, CREW MEMBERS off an arriving flight are
text: entering through a side door. Using her dress as a shield,
text: Faith manages to wedge a foot in it.
text: As the clerk turns to address the guard, she darts out and
text: starts sprinting across the tarmac for the plane-- where
text: they've just finished pulling the portable stairs away from
text: the cabin door.
text: As the plane starts to taxi, the GROUND CONTROLLER waves
text: frantically at her to get out of the way. With an anguished
text: cry, she sinks to the ground as the jet SCREAMS overhead.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT BAR - AFTERNOON
text: CLOSE on a shooter of tequila. A white-gloved hand picks it
dialog: up and downs it. When,
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Okay, where's the nut in the dress?
text: The BARTENDER casts a sympathetic glance towards the end of
text: the bar. Points. She's a pitiful figure, this bride in her
text: torn wedding gown getting bombed all alone.
scene_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: (taking her by the
dialog: arm)
dialog: Look, ma'am, we agreed not to press
dialog: charges. But I'm afraid we're
dialog: gonna have to ask you to leave.
text: The bartender turns to her.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Can you drive? Do you want us to
dialog: call you a cab?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (not at all fine)
dialog: No, thank you. I'm fine.
text: She gets up shakily.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I think we better call you a cab.
dialog: (picking up the
dialog: phone)
dialog: Where is it you want to go?
text: Her eyes drift to the DEPARTURE SCREEN. There's another
text: flight leaving for Venice in one hour. And a sudden light
text: in her eyes.
text: Kate is on the telephone.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: But you're afraid to fly.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Faith is at a pay phone. Feeling no pain.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It was my New Year's resolution
dialog: to overcome it.
speaker_heading: KATE (ON PHONE)
dialog: But it's July.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It's still the new year...
speaker_heading: KATE (ON PHONE)
dialog: What about your job?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I have vacation time coming to me.
speaker_heading: KATE (ON PHONE)
dialog: You don't have a passport.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: That's where you're wrong. I got
dialog: one nine years ago. I just never
dialog: had an opportunity to use it.
speaker_heading: KATE (ON PHONE)
dialog: Because you were afraid to fly.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Would you stop saying that? I need
dialog: you to do me a really big favor.
scene_heading: INT. KATE & LARRY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Does Dwayne know about this?
speaker_heading: FAITH (ON PHONE)
dialog: Of course not. I told him I was
dialog: going to visit a great aunt. And
dialog: don't tell Larry, either.
text: Kate glances disdainfully over at Larry, who's engrossed in
text: the Home Shopping Club in the next room.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How could I tell him? I'm not even
text: speaking to him.
scene_heading: EXT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Kate and Leslie are there. Kate knocks. No answer. She
text: pulls a key from beneath the mat and opens the door.
text: She calls out Dwayne's name. No answer. Nods to Leslie.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Faith, still in her bridal gown, is waiting impatiently at
text: the TWA terminal entrance. Finally, she spots Kate and Leslie
text: in the distance, carrying a suitcase. She rushes to them.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (anxiously to
dialog: Leslie)
dialog: Were you able to find it?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
text: At the very bottom of Dwayne's
dialog: closet.
text: Faith clenches her fist in victory.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: But... there wasn't a regular
text: yearbook picture of him in there.
dialog: He must've been absent that day
dialog: or something.
text: Faith's face falls.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: However, he was in the marching
dialog: band.
text: Faith brightens again, as Leslie pulls a contact lens case
text: from her purse. She unscrews one side, empties the contents
text: into Faith's palm. A fuzzy little image the size of an
text: eraserhead. Damon Bradley, age 17, in the shadow of a tuba.
text: Faith holds the virtually microscopic black and white speck
text: up under her nose, examining it lovingly.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (touched)
dialog: Thanks, Leslie.
text: Then, ever so carefully, places it back into the case, puts
text: the case in her purse, and reaches for her suitcase. Which
text: Kate is still holding onto.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I can't believe we did this. Do
dialog: I have to remind you that your
dialog: wedding is in six days?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Look, I know you think this is
dialog: irresponsible of me, but think how
dialog: much more irresponsible it would
dialog: be to marry the wrong person.
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: FAITH (Cont'd)
dialog: What if Dwayne and I aren't really
dialog: meant to be? Is it fair of me to
dialog: waste his life?
text: Kate reluctantly lets go. Faith starts walking through the
text: terminal, pulling clothes from the suitcase.
text: They follow her into the ladies' room, where Faith changes
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: I think she's right. You shouldn't
dialog: let a chance like this slip by.
dialog: What if he's really The One?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Les-lie, he's not The One. She's
dialog: never even met this man.
dialog: (to Faith)
dialog: You mean to tell me that you've
dialog: spent your whole life waiting for
dialog: somebody with this name--
dialog: (qualifying it)
dialog: this name you got from a Parker
dialog: Brothers game when you were
dialog: eleven--
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, I haven't. And you forgot
dialog: about the fortune teller.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: My God, you have...
text: Faith hands her gown and car keys to Leslie.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Thank you so much.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're just going to fly to Italy
dialog: and start combing the streets?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (pulling a cocktail
dialog: napkin from her
dialog: purse)
dialog: He was on his way to Venice, right?
dialog: I called the tourist bureau and
dialog: I must've called every hotel in
dialog: the city, but I found where he's
dialog: staying.
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: FAITH (Cont'd)
dialog: (giddy)
dialog: And I've made a reservation.
text: Kate shakes her head. They exit out of the restroom and head
text: towards her gate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You don't even know what he looks
dialog: like. You don't speak the
dialog: language. You don't know your way
dialog: around. This is a total stranger,
dialog: in a foreign land.
text: She's starting to get a little caught up in this.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: A foreign land full of millions
dialog: of Italian men... speaking Italian
dialog: with Italian accents and those huge
dialog: brown eyes and that silky olive
dialog: skin...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: How hard can it be? I'll land
dialog: there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll
dialog: introduce myself, and--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Live happily ever after.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Maybe.
text: Off Kate's look,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Look, until today, I had forgotten
dialog: all about this. And chances are
dialog: I'll find out he's not for me and
dialog: I'll come home and marry Dwayne
dialog: and never bring this up again.
dialog: But what if this is the real
dialog: thing, Kate? What if this is the
dialog: real real thing?
text: She steps aboard the escalator.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Wish me luck.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT
text: Leslie is behind the wheel of Faith's car, driving it home.
text: Kate is at the wheel of her station wagon, driving it back
text: home. When at the last opportunity to recircle the airport,
text: Kate suddenly cuts the wheel.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT WAITING AREA - NIGHT
dialog: CLOSE on a Let's Go, Italy guide, an Italian-English
dialog: Dictionary, and a copy of How to Make a Man Fall in Love with
text: You}. Faith is waiting at the gate. She's packing the books
text: into her suitcase when the glitter of her ENGAGEMENT RING
text: catches her eye. She looks around, before furtively sliding
text: it off. She opens the coin purse of her wallet and is placing
text: it inside, when a pair of shoes appear in front of her.
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Will you loan me some clothes?
text: Startled, she looks up. Kate is standing there, holding her
dialog: passport.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I keep it in the glove compartment
dialog: in case of emergencies.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You're coming with me?
text: Kate nods. Faith throws her arms around her.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm not saying I think it's a good
dialog: idea. But if you're going to
dialog: insist on doing this, I don't think
dialog: you should go alone. You need to
dialog: be sensible about it.
text: Their flight is announced. They get up and start walking
text: towards the gate.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You're right. The key is to go
text: about this sensibly. Logically.
text: Rationally.
text: As they go,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Did I tell you I figured out we
dialog: both have the same number of
dialog: letters in our names?
scene_heading: INT. JET - NIGHT
text: As the plane slowly taxis, the FLIGHT ATTENDANTS go through
text: their standard litany of disaster. As usual, everybody is
text: ignoring them. Except for one passenger, who is looking
text: slightly green.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Sure. I'm fine. I don't know why
dialog: I never did this before. I mean,
dialog: what's the big deal?
text: The plane starts picking up speed.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Except for the fact that I could
dialog: lose my job.
text: The landscape is beginning to blur.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I could lose Dwayne.
text: They're rocketing down the runway.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (suddenly clutching
dialog: Kate's arm)
dialog: I'm afraid to fly.
text: The ear-splitting SHRIEK of a jet engine as the plane takes
dialog: off.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARCO POLO AIRPORT, VENICE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The two women enter the terminal. Kate is jet-lagged and a
text: little dazed. Faith is like a kid on Christmas morning.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We're here, we're here, we're here!
dialog: I can't believe we're really here.
text: As they make their way to the baggage claim they're instantly
dialog: subjected to the Italian male's tendency to treat every female
text: in sight as if she were the first woman he'd ever seen in his
text: life. Faith looks around ingenuously,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You know what?... It seems like
dialog: there's a lot more available men
dialog: in Italy.
text: Kate rolls her eyes, grabs Faith by the elbow and steers her
text: out of there.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS, PIAZZALE ROMA - SUNSET
dialog: Our first view of Italy which, visually, is meant to be
text: idealized. A place where the light is always golden, and the
dialog: streets are full of magic and romance. It's not the real
dialog: Italy, it's the Italy of guidebooks. Of memories and
dialog: dreams...
text: They stand at the edge of the docks which lead to the floating
text: city. Faith looks around.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Now what do we do?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: The book said they have boats that
dialog: are like taxis...
speaker_heading: (scans LET'S GO)
dialog: Vaporettos.
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: What's the name of the place we're
dialog: staying again?
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: (cheerfully pulling
dialog: out the cocktail
dialog: napkin)
dialog: It's called... the Gritty Palace.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: "Gritty"? Is this gonna be one
dialog: of those youth hostel dives jammed
dialog: with backpackers who don't believe
dialog: in deodorant?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don't know... Maybe. Think of
dialog: it as an adventure.
text: Faith spots a vaporetto. As they dash towards it, somebody
text: pinches Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ow! What the--
text: She looks behind her. The only person in the immediate
text: vicinity is a NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY, looking innocent. She WHACKS
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Cretin.
text: They step aboard just as the boat takes off, and Faith gazes
text: out into the distance, leaning out across the railing.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Oh, look Kate, look how
dialog: beautiful...
text: And it is... as they sail toward the splendor that is Venice
text: at twilight.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GRAND CANAL - TWILIGHT
text: Magic hour. They float past ancient pallazi, their crumbling
text: facades rejuvenated in the gentle evening light. Gondoliers
text: glide by. Candlelit windows cast shimmering patches of gold
text: down onto the water. It's just like the movies... Eventually
text: the DRIVER calls out,
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: Gritti Palace.
text: Faith can barely contain herself as they pull up alongside
dialog: one of the most elegant and expensive hotels in Venice.
text: Former home to Hemingway and Maugham. Dock lanterns glow,
text: beckoning them into its sumptuous surroundings.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: This is pretty ni-iice...
text: Kate smiles, then realizes,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (grabbing Faith's
dialog: arm)
dialog: This is a Lifestyles hotel.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: "Of the Rich and Famous". Of which
dialog: we are neither. Are you out of
dialog: your mind? We can't afford this.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (looking up at it)
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (folding her arms)
dialog: Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Well, we're here. And more
dialog: importantly, he's here.
dialog: (stepping forward)
dialog: We'll cut back on everything else.
text: She thanks the driver. Pays him. Steps off the boat. Kate
text: doesn't move.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Kate. It's one night.
text: She still doesn't move.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: They take credit cards.
text: She's a statue.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We get frequent flyer miles.
scene_heading: EXT. GRITTI PALACE ENTRANCE - TWILIGHT
text: They enter the elegant lobby of the restored 15th century
dialog: palazzo.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm so glad I got up the nerve to
dialog: do this. All my life, I've waited
dialog: for men to call. Waited for them
dialog: to ask me out. Waited for them
dialog: to make the first move. Well, no
dialog: more of that. I am finally taking
dialog: charge of my own destiny.
text: They arrive at the CONCIERGE's desk.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: You ask what room he's in, okay?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Buona notte.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hello. Reservation for Faith
dialog: Corbett, please.
text: He nods, starts punching something into his computer. Kate
text: pulls something from her purse.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And put it on this.
text: CLOSE on a CREDIT CARD which reads "LAWRENCE CORBETT". Faith
text: looks at her. Kate flashes a wicked smile.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And, could you please tell us what
dialog: room Mr. Bradley is in?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: (politely)
dialog: I'm sorry. Mr. Bradley has already
dialog: checked out.
text: The three cruelest words in existence, "already checked out".
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (disbelieving)
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Mr. Bradley left about a half hour
dialog: ago. He said his plans had changed
dialog: unexpectedly. Would you prefer
dialog: an interior or exterior room?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (dazed)
dialog: He couldn't have checked out-- I
dialog: was supposed to meet him here.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: I'm very sorry. Perhaps you
dialog: misunderstood?
text: He rings for the bellboy.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (trying not to
dialog: panic)
dialog: Are you absolutely sure he's gone?
dialog: Maybe you made a mistake. You
dialog: must've made a mistake. Could you
dialog: check again? Please? Sir?
text: His polite veneer wearing thin, the man pulls a key from the
text: honeycomb of slots behind him.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Room 217. Would you like to go
dialog: up and check under the bed?
text: She doesn't respond. He replaces it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Well, which way did he go?
text: The man stares at her blankly.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Nobody here has any idea which way
dialog: he went?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: (icily)
dialog: Once they pay the bill, we don't
dialog: usually follow them.
text: Kate leans across the counter and grabs him by the collar,
text: pressing her forehead to his.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Maybe you don't understand.
dialog: (like she's
dialog: possessed)
dialog: My friend was supposed to meet him
dialog: here.
text: He starts to wrestle with her. Faith steps in to help pry
text: Kate's fingers from the gentleman's neck.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (to him)
dialog: Excuse us.
text: He's still coughing as Faith leads her away from the desk into
dialog: the lobby.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, he was rude.
text: They sit down.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I can't believe we came all this
text: way and he's gone.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You gave it your best shot. You
dialog: tried.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (a whimper)
dialog: We lost him?...
text: Kate nods sympathetically.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You wait here. I'm gonna go get
dialog: us a room for the night.
text: Devastated, Faith stares vacantly into space.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'll never meet the man of my
dialog: dreams.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to herself as she
dialog: goes)
dialog: You and the other 99% of the women
dialog: in the world.
text: As Kate heads back toward the check-in desk, Faith gets up
text: and approaches the DOORMAN. She pulls the contact lens case
text: from her purse. Unscrews one side and holds it out in front
text: of him. He starts laughing. She darkens. He sobers, rattles
text: something off in Italian, gesturing toward the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF VENICE - NIGHT
text: The two women race along, over bridges, under streetlamps.
text: Faith is holding the case out in front of her sister-in-law.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Just once more, so you'll be sure
dialog: to know what to look for.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Faith, I've seen it already, okay?
dialog: If I spot somebody who's got a head
dialog: that's an eighth of an inch around,
dialog: standing underneath a tuba, I'll
text: recognize him from the photo.
dialog: Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's
dialog: not gonna do me any good.
text: Faith starts stopping people on the street, holding out the
text: case, encouraging them to peer in. Some of them look at her
text: like she's nuts, a few shake their heads, one MAN finally
text: stops. Examines it carefully.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (anxiously)
dialog: Did you see him? Do you recognize
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: (looking up,
dialog: smiling)
dialog: Candid Camera, right?
dialog: (he starts waving)
dialog: Where is it?
text: She snatches it away. Continues on. But the crowd jostles
text: her. She is bumped hard from behind. And the photo goes
text: floating out into St. Mark's Square. Frantically, she gets
text: down on her hands and knees, trying to keep people from
text: trampling it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (without looking
dialog: up)
text: He fell out.
text: Reluctantly, Kate gets down on all fours, too. Faith spots
text: the little face lying about two feet away. She strains to
text: reach out, when a SHOE mashes down on her hand. It lifts back
text: up, taking the photo with it, stuck fast to the sole.
text: Faith struggles to her feet, scooting after the MAN who's
text: moving at a fast clip. She fights her way through the crowd,
text: tracing his footsteps, crouched to make sure it's still there.
text: He's heading toward the edge of the canal. Is about to step
text: aboard a gondola, when Faith stands up and grabs his shoulder
text: from behind. He turns.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (breathlessly)
dialog: Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry, but I
dialog: think there's something that
dialog: belongs to me stuck to the bottom
dialog: of your shoe.
text: Confused, the guy looks down. Faith reaches for his foot.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Do you mind if I just--
text: She takes the shoe, turns it over, twisting the man's leg and
text: knocking him off balance in the process. Sending him toppling
text: into the water.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (peering down from
dialog: above)
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry...
text: But the shoe is still in her hand. She turns it over, and
text: sure enough, the tiny image is still perched there. She licks
text: a finger and triumphantly picks it up like a crumb.
text: Success... Until a big gust of wind comes up, whisking the
text: little likeness into the Grand Canal.
scene_heading: INT. GRITTI PALACE LOBBY - NIGHT
text: A puddle of water is forming on the marble floor.
dialog: O.S.
dialog: It wasn't like I did it on purpose.
text: Faith is dripping. Looking like her world has come to an end.
text: She's holding a phone book, as Kate drops tokens into a pay
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You can't really blame him for
dialog: being upset. It was an Armani
dialog: suit.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Did I or did I not offer to have
dialog: it cleaned?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't think he understood what
dialog: you were saying. What's the
dialog: airport number?
text: A MAID walks by, wheeling a cart. Suddenly, Faith's eyes
dialog: light up.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No...
text: She takes the receiver from Kate's hand, hangs it up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I just got a dial tone--
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: The guy at the desk said he only
dialog: left about a half hour ago, right?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So, maybe his room hasn't been
dialog: cleaned yet. Maybe there's
dialog: something in there that might help
dialog: us. Maybe they'll let us go in
dialog: and take a look around.
text: They both turn to look at the concierge. Look back at each
text: other. Shake their heads. Kate picks up the phone again.
text: Faith takes it from her, hangs it up again. Looks pleadingly
text: at her friend. Beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I am not breaking into anybody's
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: A wad of LIRE changes hands, as a MAID opens the door to room
dialog: 217.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 217 - NIGHT
text: It hasn't been cleaned. In fact, it looks like a cyclone hit
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KATE (O.S.)
dialog: So far, I'd say we're looking for
text: a rich slob.
text: Kate stands with her hands on her hips, surveying the scene.
text: Faith spots a wastebasket in the corner. She runs over to
text: it, picks it up, peers in.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Ah ha!...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What'd you find?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (charmed)
text: A Butterfinger wrapper.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: A rich, possibly fat, slob.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We're not looking to arrest the
dialog: man, Faith, we're trying to locate
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Oh. Right.
text: She drops it. Starts digging through the wastebasket again.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A small pile of garbage spread out on the floor -- an apple
dialog: core, a couple more Butterfinger wrappers, some tissue, an
text: empty shampoo bottle, a soap wrapper. Nothing very helpful.
text: There's only one more crumpled piece of paper yet to be
dialog: examined.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: This our last hope.
text: She says a silent prayer. Unfolds it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We're saved!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (saints be praised)
text: A phone message.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Only--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Only what?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Only, it's in Italian...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON the phone message and a hand holding it.
dialog: O.S.
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: So what is this? He owes you
dialog: money?
text: Pan up to the annoyed Concierge.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No... it's just very important
dialog: that I find him, okay?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Because.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Look, it's very simple. When she
dialog: was eleven years old, she got this
dialog: name--
text: Faith elbows her.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (suddenly choking
dialog: up)
dialog: He's my brother.
text: Kate looks at her.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (holding back
dialog: tears)
dialog: Yes, my long-lost brother. See,
dialog: uh, we were separated when we were
dialog: very young. The last time I saw
dialog: him we were just babies, but I've
dialog: recently found out that he's here
dialog: in Italy. And I'm here trying to
dialog: find him.
dialog: That's the ticket.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You could say I'm sort of looking
dialog: for my other half.
text: She smiles nervously.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And she's going to be married in
dialog: five days, and it would mean so
dialog: much to her if she could find him
text: before her wedding day.
text: Teary-eyed, Faith nods.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: All I ask is that you just call
dialog: this number and ask if they know
dialog: him, if they have any idea where
dialog: we might find him.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: And then you promise you'll go
dialog: away?
text: She nods energetically.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: FINGERS DIALING. As she and Kate wait,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Your brother?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What was I gonna do? Tell him the
dialog: truth?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Ai Monasteri?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Va bene.
text: He's on hold.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: A monastery?
text: Faith is looking stricken.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: It's a store. In Rome.
text: She heaves a sigh of relief. He goes back to the call.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Si. Sto cercando Damon Bradley?...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Si. Si. Grazie. Ciao.
text: Hangs up. They look at him expectantly.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: (handing back the
dialog: message)
dialog: He said he thinks a woman he works
dialog: with knows him. Her name's Anna.
dialog: But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So. How do we get to Rome?
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - SUNRISE
text: Somewhere in Tuscany. Where the landscape looks like one of
text: those old Renaissance paintings. Undulating hills,
text: sun-dappled olive groves, vast vineyards, crumbling
text: farmhouses. They speed into the frame aboard a vespa. Faith
text: is at the handlebars.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (over the wind)
dialog: Couldn't we just have taken a
dialog: train?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: The book said they have a lot of
dialog: rail strikes in Italy.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: This way we're in control.
dialog: Besides, look how pretty this is.
dialog: We're really getting to see the
dialog: countryside.
text: They speed off. And a BUG smacks straight into Kate's mouth.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER. The front wheel of the vespa is rotating very slowly.
text: That's because they're pushing it. In silence, until,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I told you a liter was less than
text: a gallon.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: We would've had enough gas to get
dialog: us there if you hadn't gotten us
dialog: lost. Besides, a kilometer is less
text: than a mile.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Right. So we should've been able
dialog: to cover more of them.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Boy, we sure are seeing the
dialog: countryside, alright.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm hungry.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You know, no offense or anything
dialog: Kate, but I think I'm starting to
dialog: see Larry's side of the story.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Nothing.
text: They plod along again in silence.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (throwing up her
dialog: hands)
dialog: I thought all roads were supposed
dialog: to lead there anyway.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER STILL. They've stopped to rest. The sun is beating
text: down mercilessly.
text: Faith gets up, stands at the side of the road, arm and thumb
dialog: extended.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know that we should be
dialog: accepting any rides from strangers.
text: Faith just looks at her.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You expecting somebody you know?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, you don't have to get snippy
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Sorry.
text: After a beat,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (wounded)
dialog: So, what exactly is Larry's side
dialog: of the story, anyway?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don't know, Kate. I just said
dialog: that. I'm sorry. I'm just on
dialog: edge.
dialog: (gazing into the
dialog: distance)
dialog: I'm afraid we're losing him.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (staring vacantly
dialog: ahead)
dialog: You think he misses me at all?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: 'Course he does.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You know, when Larry and I got
dialog: married, I thought we were so lucky
dialog: we found each other so early.
dialog: People talk about spending their
dialog: lives together, how many of them
dialog: really get to? But maybe I was
dialog: wrong. Maybe sooner or later
text: everything wears out.
text: Faith turns to look at her sister-in-law. She goes over and
text: kneels down next to her.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Remember in junior high, when I
dialog: had that Halloween party? And we
dialog: were playing Twister. And it
text: landed on right-hand-red, and there
dialog: was only one red spot left. You
dialog: reached for it, but you started
dialog: to fall.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: And instead of taking it, Larry
dialog: reached out to catch you. He let
dialog: you win. Larry never let anybody
dialog: win. That's when I knew. He was
dialog: a goner.
text: Kate is idly doodling in the dirt with a twig.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That was a long time ago.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: And you know what I thought then,
dialog: Kate? I thought, I hope someday
dialog: I have somebody who loves me that
dialog: much.
dialog: (a confession)
dialog: I still hope that.
text: Still looking down, Kate smiles ruefully.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That you'll find someone who'll
dialog: let you win at Twister?
text: She looks up, eyes full of doubt. Faith nods solemnly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He went out and bought himself
dialog: men's cologne the other day. Did
dialog: I tell you that?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Larry bought himself cologne?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Polo.
dialog: Uh-oh.
text: Faith puts a consoling arm around her, and they sit there in
text: the Tuscan countryside. In quiet contemplation of the
dialog: capriciousness of life and love.
scene_heading: INT. SQUASH COURT - DAY
text: Dwayne and Larry are playing. Larry's clothes are very
dialog: wrinkled.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So, she just takes off on me. No
dialog: warning. No explanation. Just
dialog: this message on the machine, "I'm
dialog: leaving you. Take the clothes out
dialog: of the dryer." I mean, what'd I
dialog: do?
text: Larry smacks the ball.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: I don't get it. She hasn't seen
dialog: her since she was a kid, now just
dialog: because she's dying, all of the
dialog: sudden she's gotta see her again?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: She's been acting weird lately,
dialog: though. I shoulda seen it coming.
text: Babbling on and on and on about
dialog: "communication". Like I don't know
dialog: how to communicate.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Let's face it. Sooner or later
dialog: we all die.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Exactly.
text: After a beat, Larry stops the ball.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Who's dying?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Your great aunt.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What great aunt?
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD IN TUSCANY - DAY
text: They're walking again, both holding thumbs out now. And their
text: prayers are answered. A bright red FERRARI comes screeching
text: to a halt about ten feet in front of them. They exchange a
text: look. Faith dashes towards it. Peers in the window,
text: converses with the driver a moment, then waves Kate over.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (lugging the
dialog: suitcase)
dialog: You really think this is safe?
text: An interior shot of the car reveals a NUN behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'd say so...
text: Kate takes a look inside,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: God, the Catholic Church is even
dialog: richer than I thought.
text: She climbs in, and the car PEELS OUT.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF ROME - DAY
text: The Ferrari zips into the Eternal City. A wonderland of color
dialog: and history.
text: Baroque fountains spout cool, clear water; kids play soccer
text: in the ruins; lovers kiss in secluded corners; elegantly
text: stylish men and women sip espresso in sidewalk cafes, engaged
dialog: in conversations, flirtations, negotiations. All the world's
text: a stage.
text: They screech to an abrupt halt directly in front of,
scene_heading: SISTER MARGHERITA
dialog: Ai Monasteri.
text: They get out and are still thanking her profusely, standing
text: at the side of the car with suitcase in hand, when there is
text: a whisper from behind,
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Do you believe in love at first
dialog: sight?
text: Faith freezes. Gazes heavenward.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (like an oath)
dialog: Yes.
text: She turns. To discover that God is a practical joker. The
text: guy is talking to Kate. Slicked back hair, ponytail, a lot
text: of leather. He looks awfully young.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm married.
scene_heading: YOUNG ITALIAN STUD
dialog: (good-naturedly)
dialog: I know, I saw your ring. This is
dialog: no problem. I only want for us
dialog: to be friends.
dialog: Uh huh.
scene_heading: YOUNG ITALIAN STUD
dialog: I am Giovanni.
text: He kisses Kate's hand.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: And you are?...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (in spite of
dialog: herself)
dialog: Kate.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: You are looking for a place to
dialog: stay, no, Kate?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No. Well, I don't know. Well,
dialog: maybe. Later.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: This is your most lucky day. My
dialog: family runs a pension not three
dialog: blocks from here.
text: What a coincidence. She looks at Faith. In spite of herself,
text: she's a little charmed, flattered by him. As they continue
text: up the steps,
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: (suggestively)
dialog: I wait here for you.
scene_heading: INT. AI MONASTERI - DAY
text: Inside, a hushed environment, reminiscent of a monastery.
text: The store sells liqueurs, etc. made by monks. Faith
text: approaches the counter, behind which one of those inordinately
text: fashionable Italian WOMEN is positioned.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (almost whispering)
dialog: Hello. Uh, do you speak English?
scene_heading: WOMAN BEHIND COUNTER
dialog: (demure smile)
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Thank God. I'm looking for Anna?
scene_heading: WOMAN BEHIND COUNTER
dialog: I am Anna.
text: Overjoyed, Faith extends a hand.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Anna, I'm Faith. You don't know
dialog: how happy I am to meet you. You
dialog: see, I'm trying to find someone,
dialog: and--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (perusing the
dialog: merchandise)
dialog: Her brother.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Right. My brother.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (sweetness and
dialog: light)
dialog: Your brother. Fratello tuo.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yes. Right. Si. My fratello.
dialog: And, I was thinking that maybe
dialog: someone here, well, you, might know
dialog: him. His name is Damon Bradley?...
text: The woman's eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Damon Bradley.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (more thrilled)
dialog: Yes. You do know him?
text: Anna slams her espresso down on the counter.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: E' un porco!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Excuse me?
text: She starts ranting in Italian. Faith pulls out her dictionary
text: and starts flipping frantically through it. Kate comes over
text: with a handful of little bottles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What did you say to her?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (still flipping)
dialog: I don't know. I just asked her
dialog: if she knew him and all of the
dialog: sudden--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What's she saying?
text: Faith shoots her a look.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wait a minute--
text: Kate rushes to the door,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hey, Giovanni...
text: He comes running. Kate hustles him inside and over to Faith.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to him)
dialog: My friend is looking for her
dialog: brother and she thinks this woman
dialog: knows where he is. Can you tell
dialog: us what she's saying?
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: She's saying he's a-- a--
dialog: (snapping his
dialog: fingers, he can't
dialog: think of the word)
dialog: porco.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: A porco?
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: (then suddenly)
dialog: A pig! A pig!
dialog: (to Faith,
dialog: apologetic)
dialog: She's saying he's a pig.
text: Anna's starting to throw things.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
text: A very large pig.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Ask her if she knows where he is?
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Sa dov'e' lui?
text: She screams for about a minute. He turns to Faith.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Ask her if she knows how I might
dialog: reach him? If she has a telephone
dialog: number?
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Ha un numero di telefono?
text: She yells some more.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: She did, but she...
text: She rips a napkin into shreds.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: ...misplaced it.
text: More yelling.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
text: He thinks she's going to meet him
dialog: at Mezzaluna tonight, but she--
speaker_heading: ANNA
speaker_heading: HAH!
text: She hits her inner elbow with the edge of her other hand, in
text: the Italian version of the finger.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: ...has a prior commitment.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What's mezzaluna?
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
text: A restaurant. In Piazza Navona.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: That's it. That's it. That's all
dialog: I need to know.
dialog: (to her and
dialog: Giovanni)
dialog: Bless you, thank you, thank you.
text: The PROPRIETOR rushes in from the back of the store, makes
text: her apologize to the nice customers.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (grudgingly)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: PROPRIETOR
dialog: (that's better)
dialog: Cosi va bene.
text: As Faith heads toward the door, she yells after her,
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm sorry your brother is a pig!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (with the bottles)
dialog: Who is it I pay for these?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. AI MONASTERI - MOMENTS LATER
text: As they emerge from the shop and head down the stairs, Kate
text: is looking skeptical.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: All that proves is that she wasn't
text: the woman who was meant for him.
text: Faith throws her arms around her in celebration, dancing in
dialog: the street.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: And now we know where he's gonna
dialog: be.
scene_heading: EXT. PENSION - AFTERNOON
text: ANGLE ON a sign, "PENSIONE DIVINO AMORE". Giovanni is helping
text: them carry their things into the hotel. He leads them to
text: their room, opens the door. Faith enters. As Kate follows,
text: he momentarily pulls her aside,
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: (apologetically)
dialog: I must leave town for two days.
dialog: Was unavoidable. But, day after
dialog: tomorrow,
dialog: (with import)
dialog: I return...
text: He places the key in her hand. Holding his own there longer
dialog: than necessary.
scene_heading: INT. PENSIONE ROOM - LATER
text: Faith is in the shower. Kate's got an Italian smorgasbord
text: arrayed before her. Is browsing "How to Make a Man, etc.".
scene_heading: EXT. PENSION - EVENING
text: They're on their way out the door, dressed to the nines. As
text: Kate turns their key in to the desk, Giovanni whispers in her
dialog: ear,
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Forty-eight hours...
text: Nods meaningfully.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA NAVONA - NIGHT
text: They emerge from a cab into a dreamlike landscape, illuminated
text: by the lights Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers and the
text: strolling FIRE-EATERS performing in the piazza. Everything
text: seems to be moving in slow motion.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind
dialog: of nervous.
dialog: (wringing her
dialog: hands)
dialog: God, I hate blind dates. Why
dialog: couldn't we just have arranged
dialog: marriages in America?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're right. At least that way
dialog: you could spend the rest of your
dialog: life blaming your parents instead
dialog: of yourself. Smile.
text: Faith smiles. And they enter the restaurant -- a sea of
text: frescoes, flowers, crystal and silver, all awash in
text: candlelight. "Some Enchanted Evening..."
text: From Faith's POV we see various and sundry men acknowledge
text: or appear oblivious to her expectant face. A smile here, a
text: glance there. He could be any of them. Or none of them.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (through her smile)
dialog: Let's get a drink.
text: They take a seat at the bar. Unbeknownst to them, an
text: extremely handsome MAN at a table on the terrace is eying them
text: intently.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Aren't you going to ask the
dialog: maitre'd if he's here?
dialog: It's all come down to this. A whole lifetime of waiting,
dialog: searching, hoping...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (suddenly chicken)
dialog: I sort of wanted to wait to see
dialog: if maybe he'd notice me first?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You've travelled over six thousand
dialog: miles and now you're gonna play
dialog: hard to get?
text: The MAN from the terrace is getting up. Is coming their way.
text: Kate elbows her. "Some Enchanted Eeeevening"...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: He's a god.
text: He approaches.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: Excuse me, I hope you don't think
dialog: I'm being too forward. I'm here
dialog: waiting for a friend, but I
dialog: couldn't help noticing the two of
dialog: you.
text: Faith is giddily kicking Kate under the table, but no words
text: are coming out. Kate steps in.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We noticed you, too.
dialog: It's really happening.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: I was wondering if you might be
dialog: persuaded to join me--
dialog: It really is...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: We'd love to.
speaker_heading: ADONIS
dialog: (extending a hand)
dialog: Great. I'm Guiseppe Romano.
text: Faith's face falls.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: They're back at the bar by themselves.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So what's in a name? I wanna join
dialog: him. I don't see why we can't join
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I told you. If he sees me here
dialog: with another guy, he's gonna think
dialog: I'm here with another guy. I just
dialog: don't want to send any confusing
dialog: signals.
text: Kate glances back over at him. Waves.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Faith)
dialog: Well, how come we're always looking
dialog: for guys for you?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Because I'm the one who's single.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sulking)
dialog: I never even got to be single.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Sure you did.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Not if you don't count the sixth
dialog: grade.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Okay, okay. You join him. But
dialog: first will you ask if he's here?
text: We watch from a distance as Kate gets up and approaches the
text: MAITRE'D. He gestures towards a booth on the other side of
text: the room. She thanks him and makes a beeline back to the bar.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He's heeeeeerrre...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (nervously looking
dialog: around)
dialog: Oh my God. Where?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: He's sitting in the fourth booth
text: down, on the left hand side, with
text: his back to us. He's wearing a
dialog: navy jacket. If you turn around,
dialog: you can see part of his right
dialog: elbow.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (not moving a
dialog: muscle)
dialog: Is he looking at us?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (glancing over her
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: Nope.
text: Faith tries to peek around without being too obvious. And
text: slips off her bar stool, almost knocking over the drink of
text: the person next to her. She grabs it, awkwardly climbs back
text: onto the stool. Then pulls out a compact and checks out the
dialog: view.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (like she's twelve)
dialog: Oooooo, I can see his sleeve...
text: After a beat.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I guess I should just go over and
dialog: introduce myself, huh?
text: Kate nods. Faith puts the mirror away. Starts to get up.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (sitting back down)
dialog: Who do I say I am?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Moments later. Having gotten her story straight. She gets
text: up again.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Right, right... Okay..
dialog: (suddenly seized
dialog: with self-doubt)
dialog: You don't think he's gonna think
dialog: I'm too aggressive?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Faith. So far you've trailed the
text: man halfway around the globe. At
dialog: this point, I don't think another
dialog: fifteen feet is gonna tip the
dialog: scales.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Right. Okay... It's meant to be
dialog: right?
dialog: (a deep breath)
dialog: This is it.
text: She straightens her skirt. Starts to walk toward him again,
dialog: when,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Faith--
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (turning anxiously)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Good luck.
text: Faith smiles gratefully back at her. Kate motions, "go on"...
text: Then turns back towards Guiseppe. Faith collects herself.
text: A woman with a mission. Begins striding purposefully towards
dialog: him.
text: Focused only on that special arm as, with each step, a little
text: more of it comes into view.
text: Only a few more feet. There is nothing between her and him
text: now but that WAITER with the enormous tray of pasta coming
dialog: from the other direction. But, alas... In a collision worthy
text: of inclusion in the "agony of defeat", the tray and all its
text: contents go sliding down over her. All eyes turn her way,
text: and she stands there, paralyzed in an agonizing moment of dead
text: silence. Then, with an anguished howl, she dashes to the
text: ladies room. Kate gets up and goes rushing in after her.
text: And, back out in the restaurant, a pair of feet get up and
text: step gingerly over the remains of somebody's angel hair pasta.
text: Seconds later, with an enormous wet orange spot on her dress,
text: Faith bursts out of the ladies room. And discovers he's gone.
text: The women bolt out the door, just in time to glimpse a man
text: in a navy jacket disappear down the subway stairs in the
text: distance. In hot pursuit, Faith flings off her heels and
text: sends them flying. One of them BONKS a PASSER-BY, another
text: MAN clad in a white shirt and carrying a navy jacket, on the
text: head. We may get only a brief look at this guy, but it's
text: enough to establish that while he may not be drop-dead
dialog: gorgeous, any woman with any sense wouldn't kick him out of
text: bed for munching saltines either. There's an undeniable
text: warmth in his eyes.
text: But Faith doesn't see him at all, because as he bends down
text: to pick up her shoe, he disappears from sight in the crowd,
text: and she races madly past him. Down the subway stairs, into
text: the tunnel-- and into a mob.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: She battles her way through the throng, hopping up and down
text: to try to get an overview, but there is no sign of him. She
text: dashes from car to car, pounding on windows, calling out his
text: name. Until, in a sudden whoosh, the doors close, and the
text: train speeds off into the night.
text: But she's still running after it. Desperately. Until it
text: finally vanishes around a corner, out of sight. And she sinks
text: to the ground, arms outstretched in the darkness... in vain.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA NAVONA - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON an abandoned shoe. A hand picks it up.
speaker_heading: KATE (O.S.)
dialog: I found one.
text: The two of them are wandering the piazza. Faith puts the shoe
text: back on and, with one bare foot, limps over to a table. Her
text: dress is stained, her nylons are run, a few stray noodles
text: still cling to her hair. Basically, she's a disaster.
text: As they sit down,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (not hearing this)
dialog: Okay, here's what I think. We
dialog: find out what all the subway stops
dialog: for that train are-- the subway
dialog: system's really not that big in
dialog: Rome, we could narrow it down and--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (not believing
dialog: this)
dialog: And then what, Faith?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: And then... we rent a truck, or
dialog: a car, either one, and we set up
text: a loudspeaker, and we drive through
dialog: the surrounding areas, and we page
dialog: him.
text: Simple as that. Kate just stares at her, dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What?... My hair?
dialog: When,
dialog: O.S.
dialog: I like the style. I just don't
dialog: think this color works for me.
text: They look up. It's the STRANGER in white with her other shoe
text: in his hand.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (reaching for it)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: Allow me.
text: He kneels down and places the shoe on her foot. Then gazes
text: up into her eyes.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Thanks very much.
dialog: (back to Kate)
dialog: So what do you think?
text: Kate looks at him. Kind of charmed.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That was really sweet...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I meant about my idea.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I think it's time we got some
dialog: professional help.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (nodding)
text: Like a detective.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No... Like a psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Don't be silly. How's a
dialog: psychiatrist gonna find him?
text: He's still kneeling there.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (to him again)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Now go away. He sits down at a table nearby. Stares over
text: at Faith. She spots an Italian policeman, or CARABINIERE,
text: standing at the edge of the piazza.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm gonna go see what I can find
text: out about speaker rental.
text: She gets up, the STRANGER gets up, as if to follow. She looks
text: at him like he's nuts.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Steps around him to head toward the cop. He sits back down.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: So, what's the story with your
dialog: friend?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (watching her in
dialog: amazement)
dialog: My friend has lost her fucking
dialog: mind...
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: What's she doing?
text: Kate turns to him,
speaker_heading: KATE
text: She's trying to find out where she
text: can rent a loudspeaker.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So she can drive through the
text: streets of Rome paging the man of
dialog: her dreams.
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: No, really. What's she doing?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Really. She thinks he's here.
text: Even though she's never met him.
dialog: Even though she's never laid eyes
text: on him.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: (still not
dialog: believing her)
dialog: Seriously.
text: Kate just looks at him.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: Oh. Well, what's wrong with that?
text: He gazes over at her, gesticulating wildly in the distance.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: Only... if she's never met this
dialog: guy, what makes her think he's
dialog: perfect for her?
dialog: Kate just shakes her head. Don't ask.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: Were they pen pals?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: Is he some kind of celebrity or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: Did he do some anonymous good deed
dialog: for her?
text: An exasperated sigh.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: She got his name off a Ouija board
dialog: when she was eleven.
text: She holds out her palms. What can I tell you?
text: A beat. Then,
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: What is his name?...
text: Faith comes trudging back, in tears.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: He said it would take at least six
dialog: months to get a permit for a
dialog: loudspeaker. And, you have to get
dialog: the Pope to approve it.
text: Defeated, she picks up her purse.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Let's just go.
text: Kate puts her arm around her and they start walking. The
text: STRANGER grabs his jacket off the back of his chair. Tags
dialog: after them.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: (anxiously)
dialog: Will you be staying in Rome long?
text: She doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: Your friend said you were looking
dialog: for someone?
dialog: (at her side)
dialog: Maybe I can help you track him
dialog: down. I speak a little Italian.
dialog: And I have a friend who works at
dialog: the embassy. Maybe we could--
text: She's trying to wave down a TAXI.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Thank you, but I really don't want
dialog: any help.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: What's his name? I'll look into
dialog: it for you. I could give you a
dialog: call.
text: A CAB slows to a stop in front of them.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Look, I appreciate the offer, but--
text: She reaches for the door. He's standing in the way.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: Just tell me his name...
text: She blows her nose noisily.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (to get rid of him)
dialog: Damon Bradley.
text: He stares at her.
speaker_heading: DAMON
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: But, that's-- I'm Damon Bradley...
text: Still wiping her nose, she notices the jacket in his hands,
text: then looks up into his eyes. The wind rustles through the
dialog: trees.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You're...
text: He nods. Amazed.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: And you're the biggest mess I've
dialog: ever seen.
text: She reaches for her hair.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: I find that very attractive.
text: And she faints. Dead away.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Having regained consciousness, Faith is across a candlelit
text: table from him. They're engrossed in conversation. In each
text: others' eyes. Tables around them have all emptied. A waiter
text: in the background is trying to prop his eyes open.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: ...Coming so close and yet just
dialog: missing each other. Do you know
dialog: what I mean?
dialog: Does she know what he means...
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: There's this poem by Rilke, I don't
dialog: remember the whole thing, but it's
dialog: about that. About waiting for that
dialog: person, and wondering if you'll
dialog: ever find them. And the last line
dialog: of it goes, "Who knows? Perhaps
text: the same bird echoed through both
dialog: of us, yesterday--
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: --separate, in the evening..."
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: (slowly,
dialog: spellbound)
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: MONTAGE. To the Beatles' "I Will"
scene_heading: PENSION DIVINO AMORE - Faith hops out Damon's car. He waits.
text: She dashes inside, practically skipping.
text: Moments later, having changed clothes, floats back out and
text: they take off again. Up above, Kate watches wistfully out
text: the window.
text: DRY CLEANERS - Dwayne is there trying to pick up his stuff.
text: The CLERK is holding out a ticket. "You have to have one of
dialog: these."
text: THE FORUM - The sun is coming up over the ruins. Faith and
text: Damon stroll through them. Damon pulls out a "doggie bag".
text: Sets down a little container of pasta for the wild cats that
dialog: roam Rome.
text: McDONALDS - Rome's golden arches. Kate is munching on a Big
text: Mac, and working on a postcard: "Dear Larry,". Somebody
text: cruises by her table, snakes out a hand, reaching for her
text: purse. Without so much as an upward glance, she flicks out
text: a leg and trips him.
scene_heading: CAMPO DEI FIORI MARKET - The enormous outdoor market where
dialog: everything from orchids, to watermelon, to live eels and
text: octopus are in abundant display. Damon buys Faith a gardenia.
text: She puts it in her hair.
text: GIOLITTI - A gelateria. Kate's eating ice cream. Still
text: working on the postcard: "Dear Larry". Nothing more.
text: Finally crumples it up.
text: THE SPANISH STEPS - Faith and Damon are sitting on the edge
text: of the steps watching the street show that is Rome, when a
text: LOCAL approaches with a Polaroid. Selling pictures. They
dialog: pose.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: My hair's kind of a mess, isn't
dialog: it?
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: Your hair... is perfect.
text: He leans in and kisses her. And from this angle, except for
text: the clothes, they look an awful lot like Rodin's version, as
text: the FRAME FREEZES.
text: CLOSE on the photo. She looks up from it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You don't think this is just
dialog: infatuation, do you?
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Oh no.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No.
text: He takes her hand. Both a little unnerved, they walk. Until,
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: But... just to be sure, maybe we
dialog: ought to shatter each other's
text: unrealistic images of perfection.
dialog: You know, each of us admit
dialog: something embarrassing about
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Okay. Good idea. You first.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Me first? Alright, well,
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Something embarrassing, right?
dialog: Something we don't want to admit
dialog: in public.
text: She nods. He thinks a moment. Then,
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: I'm a liberal.
text: She looks at him with amazement.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm a liberal!
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: (disbelieving)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (solemnly)
dialog: My car bumper has never held a
dialog: winning sticker.
text: They gaze deeply at one another.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Well, as long we both know we're
dialog: going into this with our eyes wide
dialog: open...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VIA MARGUTTA - TWILIGHT
text: A lantern-lit street of 18th century facades. A faint breeze
text: stirs the trees above. Strains of opera float out a window.
text: Faith is looking around. Finally, though they're not
dialog: overlooking anything,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You're right. This is a really
text: pretty view.
text: He smiles.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: Not this.
text: He leads her out to the center of the street. Tilts his head
text: back. She follows and they walk, with their necks craned
text: back, like two drunken sailors, like two kids.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: This...
text: And up above, in the houses and apartments lining either side
text: of the street, visible through the unshuttered windows, are
text: gilded ceilings and candlelit vaults of angels. And beyond
text: those, the star-studded, indigo summer sky.
dialog: It's all a matter of how you look
text: at it.
scene_heading: INT. PENSION BAR - NIGHT
text: Kate's down at the bar, talking to the Italian BARTENDER.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So, you're saying you think I
dialog: should call him.
text: He draws a beer.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: He is your husband, no?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes, but... He was having an
dialog: affair.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Si.
text: So what? He picks up a napkin and sets the glass down on it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: The point is, he was sleeping with
text: another woman.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: How much clearer can she make it?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: They were having sex.
text: Finally, it dawns on him.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (nodding gravely)
dialog: She was your sister.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, she wasn't my sister.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: (shaking his head
dialog: in sympathy)
dialog: Your mother.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (another stab)
dialog: Your grandmother?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Look, she wasn't a relative, okay?
dialog: I don't know who she is.
text: Big deal. He rolls his eyes and dismisses it with a wave of
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So, how much longer 'til Giovanni
dialog: gets back?
scene_heading: EXT. THE TREVI FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
text: It's all lit up. And deserted at this late hour. The water
text: glows, ethereal blue. They sit at the edge, bare feet
text: dangling in. Damon picks up one of her shoes.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: I think I'll have it bronzed.
text: She smiles. Then sobers.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: What?...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I feel like I've been wandering
dialog: in the desert for as long as I can
dialog: remember. With nothing but
text: emptiness around me, wind and
text: sun... And suddenly, out of the
text: blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
text: He takes her face in his hands. Solemnly, almost mystically,
text: kisses her eyes... her mouth...
dialog: Until,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: There is one other thing you should
dialog: know about me.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Nothing you could say would change
dialog: the way I feel.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be
dialog: married in two days.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Except possibly that.
text: She gets up. Heavy with guilt.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: And, he's a friend of yours. It's
dialog: Dwayne.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Dwayne?
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: Dwayne Pinsley. From high school.
dialog: That's how I knew you were here.
dialog: When you called, from the airport.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: Oh, right. Dwayne.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're engaged to Dwayne?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (like she's trying
dialog: to explain an
dialog: affair)
dialog: It just happened. I didn't plan
dialog: it. I was alone. And he was...
dialog: there. But now everything's
dialog: changed. I owe it to him to let
dialog: him know. I need to tell him.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: You're sure...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I've never been more sure of
dialog: anything in my life.
text: He smiles.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Let's find a telephone.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: Sure-- But, before you do that,
dialog: since we're putting all our cards
dialog: on the table, I have a confession
dialog: to make, too.
text: She pauses,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Okay.
text: He looks at her worriedly.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Don't be afraid. You can tell me.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: You're sure...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: We found each other, didn't we?
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Yes. We did.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: It's alright... this is our
dialog: destiny.
text: He takes a deep breath.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: Okay. Okay, the thing is... I'm
dialog: not exactly... I mean-- only in
dialog: the most literal sense-- I'm not
dialog: Damon Bradley.
text: The fountain just dropped twenty feet.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (staring straight
dialog: ahead)
dialog: What?
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: My name isn't Damon Bradley. I
dialog: just told you it was Damon Bradley.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (numbly)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's Peter Wright.
text: He heaves a sigh of relief. Draws her to him again.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Boy, am I glad that's over with.
text: She's frozen. He's noticing this. Until she extricates
text: herself from his arms.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I had a feeling this was gonna be
dialog: a problem.
dialog: (to her)
dialog: You're upset, right?
text: She shoots him a look. Starts putting on her shoes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Everything else is true. I swear.
dialog: I am a liberal. I do live in
dialog: Boston. I am a zoologist. I did
dialog: see "Local Hero" fifteen times.
dialog: I am single. I don't believe in
dialog: Scientology and I don't smoke.
dialog: But, okay, I admit it, mea culpa,
dialog: I lied about one little thing.
text: She runs out to the street. Starts waving for a cab.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: One little thing? You call your
dialog: identity one little thing?
text: Following after her,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You've never lied?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: That's not the point.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You said whatever it was you would
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: That was before I found out what
dialog: it was.
text: A taxi approaches.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're leaving?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Wait-- Let's put this in
dialog: perspective. You're going to let
dialog: a few little letters keep us apart?
text: No response. The cab stops.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (grasping at
dialog: straws)
dialog: Look, if the name's that much of
dialog: a problem, why don't you just call
dialog: me that? It'll be my nickname.
text: She opens the taxi door.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (on the brink of
dialog: tears)
dialog: How could you do this to me?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: I'm in love with you.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Oh, come on... What kind of an
dialog: excuse is that?
text: And this time, the door SLAMS in his face.
scene_heading: EXT. PENSION LOBBY - NIGHT
text: The cab pulls up. Faith gets out, drags into the hotel,
text: looking shell-shocked. From the bar, Kate spots her and
text: rushes over.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PENSION BAR - MINUTES LATER
text: Kate and Faith are both at the bar, staring off into the
text: distance. Getting bombed.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah. Sociopaths. They're able
dialog: to figure out what you want them
dialog: to be and then they act like that.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (tearfully)
dialog: But how could he know? He only
dialog: just met me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Men have ways.
text: Kate shakes her head.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What a drag. You finally meet the
dialog: man of your dreams and he turns
text: out to be a pathological liar.
text: Faith wails.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: He's on the telephone.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Still busy? Okay, can I leave
dialog: another message, please?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Alright, the message is, would she
dialog: rather have the wrong guy with the
dialog: right name or the right guy with
dialog: the wrong name?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No-- no, no. They alternate, see?
dialog: It's the wrong guy--
scene_heading: INT. PENSION ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on the receiver, off the hook. Faith is in bed, wide
text: awake, staring mournfully up at the ceiling.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PENSION ROOM - THE FOLLOWING MORNING
text: Kate is on her way out the door. She opens it-- to find Peter
text: outside in the hallway, carrying a bouquet of flowers the size
text: of a refrigerator.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (moving past her)
dialog: I have to talk to her.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: She's not here.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: She went out to check into
dialog: skywriting. I can't believe you
dialog: lied. Is this a genetic thing,
dialog: men will say anything just to get
dialog: laid?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No! That's not fair. That's not
dialog: it at all. Look, something
dialog: somewhere got screwed up. Maybe
dialog: some metaphysical wires got
dialog: crossed. I may not have the right
dialog: name, but I was there. I'm the
dialog: guy. I'm-- skywriting??
text: She eyes him skeptically.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You didn't think this would be a
dialog: problem?
text: He starts pacing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It was an emergency. I only lied
dialog: that night because it was the only
dialog: way I knew to stop her. I knew
dialog: if I didn't, I'd never see her
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Good strategy.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do you know I wasn't even supposed
dialog: to be in Rome? My boss was
dialog: supposed to come to this
dialog: conference, and at the last minute
dialog: he got the measles. The measles.
dialog: Who gets the measles at
dialog: forty-three? So they sent me.
dialog: And I wasn't supposed to be in that
dialog: piazza that night either. I'd gone
dialog: to the movies, only it was sold
dialog: out. So I was wandering around.
dialog: Just wandering... When I got hit
dialog: in the head with this shoe.
text: He gazes out at the Roman skyline,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And then I saw her. And all I know
dialog: is, when I looked in her eyes I
dialog: saw something... light. And life
dialog: and passion and yearning. And
dialog: something else I can't even put
dialog: my finger on, something I'd never
dialog: seen before--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Mania.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Whatever. And I thought, please
dialog: God, give me a sign, give me some
dialog: way to keep this woman from getting
text: into that taxi and disappearing
dialog: from my life forever. And He did.
dialog: She told me the name. Granted,
dialog: it wasn't my name, but it was a
dialog: start.
text: He turns to Kate.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And if that's not destiny, I don't
dialog: know what is.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (touched)
dialog: That's really romantic.
text: She places a consoling hand on his shoulder,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Too bad she hates your guts.
text: Starts leading him toward the door.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's just a name for chrissakes.
dialog: The whole thing is so ludicrous.
dialog: For all she knows, this guy could
dialog: be the biggest loser on the face
dialog: of the planet. He could have a
dialog: criminal record.
dialog: (throwing up his
dialog: hands)
dialog: He could think Ronald Reagan was
dialog: a great president.
text: Kate shrugs.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I mean, realistically, what are
dialog: the odds that this is a terrific
dialog: guy?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: Ten billion to one.
dialog: Beat.
text: There's a KNOCK at the door. She opens it. It's Giovanni
text: -- with a single rose.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Guess who-oooo...
text: He sees Peter and the other flowers.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (quickly)
text: Giovanni, this is Faith's friend,
dialog: Peter.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Oh, hello.
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: I just came by to see if you wanted
dialog: to join me for a drink, but--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'd love to.
text: She heads for the door.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pleading eyes)
dialog: Please. You've got to help me.
text: She considers him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT OF A TEENY TINY PLANE - DAY
text: Faith is strapped into the passenger seat of a miniscule
text: two-seater. White-knuckled. Staring wide-eyed out the window
text: at a faint trail of vapor.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: (over the roar of
dialog: the engine)
dialog: Are you sure people are gonna be
dialog: able to read this?...
text: The pilot nods. The plane goes into a dive. Faith's eyes
text: roll back in her head.
scene_heading: EXT. PENSION TERRACE - DAY
text: Kate and Giovanni are at a table, overlooking the domes of
text: the city, bathed in the honeyed late afternoon light.
text: Giovanni's pointing out the sights. A plane buzzes overhead.
text: Kate looks up. Some faint gibberish is being scattered to
text: the wind. She shakes her head. Giovanni takes her hand.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (a little
dialog: nervously)
dialog: Don't you have to be getting back
dialog: to work?
text: His eyes sparkle.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: It's siesta.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: You see, in America they care for
dialog: work, they live to work. But in
dialog: Italy, they care for food, for
dialog: love, for pleasure...
text: His lips graze her wrist.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: What do the years matter? I've
dialog: known you for centuries...
scene_heading: INT. PENSION LOBBY - AFTERNOON
text: Faith enters. Her hair looking like she stuck her finger in
text: a light socket. She's handed an enormous stack of messages.
text: Peter, Peter, Peter, etc. There are a lot of cross-outs.
text: She forces herself to drop them into the trash on her way up
text: the stairs. Then opens her door and sees the flowers. She
text: fingers one, momentarily softening, then turns resolute. She
text: pulls her suitcase from beneath the bed and is unzipping it
text: when Kate enters, grinning from ear to ear.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hi-iii...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Hi. Where've you been?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sightseeing...
dialog: (sobering as she
dialog: realizes)
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Packing.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Because I've been kidding myself.
dialog: Because I realized you were right
dialog: from the beginning. This whole
dialog: thing was just a wild goose chase.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So, you've had a little bad luck.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: A little bad luck?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that
dialog: means the odds are probably in your
dialog: favor now. This is no time to give
dialog: up.
text: Faith smiles wanly. Starts pulling stuff out of drawers.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Why do they read kids fairy tales
dialog: in the first place? Children are
dialog: very impressionable, you know.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So you're just quitting? Just like
dialog: that?
text: Faith pauses.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I thought you were the one who
dialog: didn't think I should've come in
dialog: the first place.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know, but...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It was a ouija board, remember?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: ...and a fortune teller.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't
dialog: meant to be. I've got forty-eight
dialog: hours. I can still make it home
dialog: in time to marry Dwayne and try
dialog: to forget any of this ever
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What about Peter?...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Peter? Peter was a mistake. An
dialog: imposter.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: The last dead end in a long series
dialog: of dead ends that I am relieved
text: to finally be leaving behind.
dialog: (glancing up)
dialog: May as well start packing, our
dialog: cab's gonna be here in an hour.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Who said I was going?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm just not ready to go home quite
dialog: yet, that's all.
text: There's a tap at the door. Giovanni pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: You ready, Kate? Oh, hi, Faith.
dialog: Did you do something different to
dialog: your hair?
text: Kate shakes her head.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He promised to take me on a tour
dialog: of the fountains...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I don't have to go.
text: Faith looks at the two of them. Realizing.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No. No, you go ahead.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You sure you'll be okay?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm sure. And Kate, thank you for
dialog: coming. Thank you for being such
dialog: a good friend.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (squeezing her
dialog: hand)
dialog: I'll be back before you leave.
text: She and Giovanni exit. Faith picks up the telephone.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Long distance operator, please.
scene_heading: INT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The phone rings. The answering machine picks it up.
speaker_heading: PHONE MACHINE
dialog: "Hi, it's Dwayne. Don't be a heel,
dialog: leave a message."
dialog: Beep.
speaker_heading: DAMON (O.S.)
dialog: Hi, Dwayne. It's me. I'm just
dialog: calling to say I'm on my way home.
scene_heading: INT. PENSION DIVINO AMORE - SUNSET
text: Faith's eyes drift to the window.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: The situation here is looking
dialog: pretty hopeless. I guess she's
dialog: given up.
dialog: (catching herself)
dialog: So, it's Flight number 966. It
dialog: gets in at one tomorrow. I'll see
dialog: you then.
dialog: Click.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF ROME - TWILIGHT
text: Faith is taking the same walk that was so magical the night
text: before. But it's not the same. She takes a few steps, tilts
text: her head back, and-- trips. She's holding her foot in pain
dialog: when,
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Kate told me you were going home.
dialog: Is that true?
text: She looks up, sees Peter. Turns around and starts limping
text: briskly back towards her hotel.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (tagging after her)
dialog: Is it?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: You're limping.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: I know I'm limping. I stubbed my
dialog: toe.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you okay? You want some help?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: NO.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You are leaving, aren't you?
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why can't you just tell me?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: If it's any of your business, yes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: To the foot doctor.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yes.
text: He stops in front of her. Looks her straight in the eye.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why?
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (stepping around
dialog: him)
dialog: Because I know who Dwayne is, and
dialog: he's reliable and stable and wants
dialog: to marry me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (dismissingly)
dialog: He's safe.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So?! Is there something wrong with
dialog: loving somebody who's safe?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (following her)
dialog: Does he love you?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You didn't answer my question.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Why are you asking me this?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Because I'd like to think at least
dialog: one of you feels that way. Does
dialog: he know who you are?
text: He touches her arm. She pulls it away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (utterly serious)
dialog: You stubbed your toe, don't you
dialog: think that's a sign?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's a podiatrist. Pain is your
dialog: body's way of telling you something
dialog: is wrong. Your toe is trying to
dialog: tell you not to do it.
text: She rolls her eyes, continues limping.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There must be something I can do,
dialog: something I can say to make this
dialog: up to you?... Just tell me what
dialog: it is, I'll say it. I'll do it.
dialog: I don't want you to hate me.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (softening, she
dialog: stops)
dialog: Look, Peter, I don't hate you.
dialog: But what we had was an illusion.
dialog: Mutual wishful thinking. We both
dialog: wanted to believe it for awhile,
dialog: but it was all founded on a lie.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So it wasn't real.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What about the oasis in the desert?
dialog: Are you telling me that was a lie?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, that wasn't a lie. That was...
dialog: (almost more to
dialog: herself)
text: a mirage.
text: She looks at him. Then, softly, sadly,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Don't you see?.. We're not the
dialog: ones who are meant to be.
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: You're the man of somebody else's
dialog: dreams.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Because I don't have the right
dialog: name?!
text: She starts walking again.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm going home. I never should've
dialog: come here in the first place and
dialog: I'm going home.
text: He calls after her.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Fine. Okay. Forget me. Leave
dialog: me out of it. But don't go
dialog: throwing your life away on somebody
dialog: you don't love.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (she turns)
dialog: Who says I don't love him?...
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I see. Well then, go home. Get
dialog: married. I hope you'll be very
dialog: happy.
text: And he walks quickly away, disappearing into the shadows.
text: She starts to call after him, but he's already gone.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Faith is waiting in the lobby as a CAB pulls up outside. We
text: watch from a distance as she hugs Kate goodbye. The DRIVER
text: comes in, picks up her bag, and she drags out the door behind
dialog: him.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - NIGHT
text: Faith is staring forlornly out the car window as the driver
text: gets in, turns over the engine. They're pulling away when
text: SOMEONE runs out into the street, arms waving madly.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (running alongside
dialog: the window)
dialog: You can't go.
text: The cab is speeding up.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Because. I know where he is.
text: It SCREECHES to a halt.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Peter's helping her bring her things back inside.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: I went back to that restaurant and
dialog: I spoke with his waiter, just on
dialog: an off chance, you know, and,
dialog: anyway-- he knew the name of the
dialog: guy's hotel. So, I called there,
dialog: they said he left yesterday. But,
dialog: apparently he comes here every
dialog: year, always follows the same
dialog: route. He always goes from here
dialog: down the coast to the Le Sirenuse
dialog: hotel in Positano. I called. And
dialog: they told me he's checked in.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Where's Positano?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's in the south. I've still got
dialog: my rental car. I can get you there
dialog: by morning...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Oh no, I don't think that would
dialog: be a good idea.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look, I know there's no going back
dialog: for us. That's not it. I just
dialog: want to make this up to you. Clear
dialog: my relationship karma. And I know
dialog: the area, I've got some cousins
dialog: down there. Please. Let me do
dialog: this for you. Let this be my gift
dialog: to you.
text: She searches his eyes.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Because-- I want you to be happy.
scene_heading: INT. DWAYNE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The answering machine is recording Faith's message.
speaker_heading: DAMON (O.S.)
dialog: Dwayne, you're still not there?...
dialog: I was really hoping we could talk.
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: DAMON (Cont'd)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wanted to tell you she's made
text: an unexpected recovery, but she's
dialog: a little confused and she needs
dialog: me to stay here one more day. Just
dialog: to be sure.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Kate's in the lobby.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Peter found him?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yes. Isn't that amazing?
text: Kate looks over at him. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Amazing...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: He's down in someplace called
dialog: Positano. Peter says we can make
text: it there by morning.
text: As they head out the door, Peter turns quietly to Kate,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (relishing this)
dialog: He's travelling with his mother...
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: They speed down darkened the highway, Faith and Peter in the
text: front seat, Kate and Giovanni in the back. The wind in their
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The guy at the hotel told me he
dialog: always wears a gold medallion, and
dialog: usually has a book or magazine with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (to herself,
dialog: encouraged)
dialog: He likes to read...
dialog: (to him)
dialog: Did he mention anyone in
dialog: particular?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Uh, I'd rather not say.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'd really rather not say.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Please. I need to know.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (giving in)
dialog: Mickey Spillane.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (a little unnerved)
dialog: Mickey Spillane?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Or Hustler.
text: The car shoots down the road.
scene_heading: EXT. AMALFI COAST - DAWN
text: They drive past sheer cliffs dropping off to silvery rocks,
text: azure seas, transparent depths. Around hairpin turns skirting
text: the Gulf of Salerno, before finally winding into the
text: impossibly beautiful seaside town of Positano. An enchanted
text: land of steep hillsides overgrown with lemon trees, jasmine,
dialog: bouganvilla... cliff hanging villas... emerald and sapphire
text: grottoes... cerulean skies... heaven on earth.
scene_heading: EXT. LE SIRENUSE HOTEL - DAY
text: Another "Lifestyles" hotel. An elegant old villa perched

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Joan Collins stayed here.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (to concierge)
dialog: Is Damon Bradley here?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Si. A la piscina.
text: He gestures towards the terrace.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: He's out by the pool right now.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Right now?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's
text: here with his mother.
text: She checks her hair, starts adjusting it in the reflection
text: of a window. Then peeks around the corner.
text: ANGLE ON a MAN reclining on a lounge chair. We start at the
text: feet which don't quite reach the end of the chair. Move up
text: the legs, past the pot belly, to, sure enough, an enormous
text: gold medallion resting on his chest. A fringe of hair skirts
text: the perimeter of his head -- and his back.
text: A copy of Mickey Spillane's latest rests on a table next to
text: him. He's lying back, eyes closed. This is Damon Bradley.
dialog: This is Him...
text: Peter smiles broadly. Faith's face falls.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's him?!
text: Faith elbows her.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's the guy you've been waiting
dialog: for all these years?
speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (not particularly
dialog: anxious to)
dialog: Of course.
text: She doesn't move.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do you want me to do it?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: NO.
text: She takes a good look. Swallows hard. Reluctantly
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Hi...
text: He doesn't look up. She stands awkwardly over him, looking
text: back at Kate for support.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Uh-hem, excuse me, hello...
text: He cracks one eye, squints up at her.
speaker_heading: MAN AT POOL
dialog: You're in my sun.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (hopping out of
dialog: the way)
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
text: He closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Pardon me, but...
text: He squints up again.
speaker_heading: MAN AT POOL
dialog: What?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (like an idiot)
dialog: Do you have the time?
text: He eyeballs her like she's some sort of curious life form.
speaker_heading: MAN AT POOL
dialog: Do I look like I'm wearing a watch?
text: He doesn't.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, I guess not. I just thought
dialog: maybe--
text: When someone at the edge of the pool calls out,
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Hey, Damon.
text: But the person she's talking to doesn't respond. Instead,
text: somebody else, another MAN who'd been doing laps in the pool,
text: emerges.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: This is no ordinary mortal, this is a living monument to
dialog: mankind. He could've modeled for Michelangelo. Mel Gibson
text: feels like Jo-Jo-the-Dog-Faced-Boy next to this guy. The guys
dialog: in the Calvin Klein ads-- okay, let's say he looks like one
dialog: of those guys.
text: Kate's eyes shift to Peter, who suddenly sobers.
text: Back at the pool, a LITTLE KID is talking to Damon.
speaker_heading: LITTLE KID
dialog: Thanks for letting me borrow this.
text: The kid sets the Spillane tome back on his chair.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: No problem.
text: He gets out and starts toweling off, a halo of sunlight
text: glistening off his tanned, muscular body; reflecting in the
text: deep green pools of his eyes. She grabs hold of a nearby
text: chair as her knees start to give way.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: You're Damon Bradley?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: Oh. My. Goddd.
text: It's now or never. She takes a deep breath. Lets it out.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Excuse me.
text: It's never. She goes running back inside.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (whispering loudly)
dialog: Whatareyoudoing?!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (spinelessly)
dialog: What if he doesn't like me?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It means you're a completely
dialog: worthless excuse for a human being,
dialog: and the fates have all conspired
dialog: to make you miserable.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: My God... you're right.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Faith, I'm kidding.
dialog: (stopping her)
dialog: Is this how you plan to get what
dialog: you want from life? When you
dialog: finally find it, you turn and run
dialog: away from it?
text: She gazes fearfully back out to the terrace.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, if she doesn't wanna meet him,
dialog: she doesn't wanna meet him.
text: Kate glares at him. Takes Faith by the shoulders.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You have overcome everything it
dialog: took to get here. Every obstacle
dialog: to reach this moment. This fateful
dialog: moment. Now, it's in your hands.
text: She points toward the terrace.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Is that what you want?
dialog: Is this a trick question?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Then go get it.
scene_heading: EXT. POOL - MOMENTS LATER
text: He's picking up his things.
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Hi again...
text: He looks up.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (perfectly
dialog: friendly)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (nervously
text: fingering her
dialog: necklace)
dialog: Beautiful place...
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Sure is.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Been here long?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Just since yesterday.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I just got here, too. Not
dialog: yesterday. But, just now. Today.
dialog: Just a few minutes ago.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Yeah, we just got here... I mean,
dialog: I just got here. I'm single.
text: He looks at her. Uh huh.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (chickening out)
dialog: Well, I'll probably be seeing you
dialog: around, then.
text: She starts to skulk away.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (politely)
dialog: I hope so.
text: She pauses, turns,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I was wondering...
dialog: (not looking at
dialog: him)
dialog: Do you have dinner plans?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Tonight?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (her eyes
dialog: tentatively meet
dialog: his)
dialog: Any night.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Well, not exactly...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Would you be willing to have dinner
dialog: with me?
text: A slow smile creeps across his lips. Why not?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (somehow
dialog: maintaining)
dialog: You would? Really?
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Okay. Okay, how about I meet you
text: at the restaurant at the base of
dialog: the stairs at, say, 8:30?
dialog: A smile that would melt Nome in January,
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: I'll look forward to it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (backing away)
dialog: Okay. Good. See you then, then.
text: She's about to trip over a chaise lounge.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Aren't you going to tell me who
dialog: you are?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (stepping forward)
dialog: Oh, Faith. My name's Faith.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (extending a hand)
dialog: It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
text: He takes her hand. Kisses it. Peter rolls his eyes.
text: She turns around and dashes back inside. We hear an
text: ear-splitting SHRIEK of excitement come from inside the hotel.
text: Damon smiles to himself.
scene_heading: EXT. POSITANO - DAY
text: The jet-setters have Sardinia, this is a resort with bohemian
text: roots and small town charm. A barber sets his chair in the
text: street outside his shop. A workman is polishing the bronze
text: mermaid out in front of "Siren Travel".
text: "Two Gentlemen from Verona" is being performed at the
text: community theatre. Housewives open shutters, shopkeepers
text: sweep storefronts of fruit stands, pottery and linen shops.
text: Men carry armloads of flowers, boxes of lemons and gleaming
text: fish to market. Children play at the edge of the sea.
dialog: Mayberry in Italy.
text: Kate and Giovanni are down at the beach, frolicking in the
dialog: water.
text: And Faith is strolling through town, floating on air. She
text: spots a dress in a clothing store window.
scene_heading: INT. CLOTHING SHOP - DAY
text: Faith emerges from a dressing room in something summery and
text: flowing. She looks beautiful.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - SUNSET
text: A jar of green goo. Faith's plastering one of those green
text: clay masks to her face. Her dress is hanging on the door.
text: She's got rollers in her hair. She and Kate are getting ready
dialog: for dinner.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Did you see his eyes? I've never
dialog: seen eyes that green. And he was
dialog: so nice. Did you see how nice he
dialog: was? He was really nice.
text: There's a KNOCK at the door. She freezes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I thought you were meeting him
dialog: there?
text: Panicking, Faith dashes to the bathroom, starts frantically
text: rinsing off the mask.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: That's what I thought.
text: Kate opens the door. It's Peter.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, it's you.
dialog: (to Faith)
dialog: It's only Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sorry...
text: Relieved, Faith steps out from behind the bathroom door, still
text: wiping green stuff off her face.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Hi, Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi.
text: An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Come on in.
text: He does.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So. You found him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You found him. I don't know how
dialog: to thank you.
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, it looks like we both lucked
dialog: out. I just met somebody myself.
dialog: Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (a little
dialog: surprised)
dialog: Oh. That's nice.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: And she's a knock-out, too.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Well, good. Good for you.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Anyway, that's why I came by. I
dialog: need to fix this button. Do you
dialog: have a needle and thread?
text: This is pretty transparent, but she politely plays along.
text: As she starts looking through her stuff, he starts idly
text: fingering their toiletries. Smells her perfume, etc.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So, you're going to dinner?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where are you going? Just-- out
dialog: of curiosity...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Just to that place down at the
text: bottom of the stairs. Nothing
dialog: fancy.
text: She hands him the needle and thread.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, thanks.
dialog: (really trying)
dialog: Well, have a good time.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: You too.
text: As he exits,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey--
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nice dress.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (gracious and
dialog: indebted)
dialog: Thank you, Peter. Thank you so
dialog: much.
text: He nods and leaves. She looks at Kate.
text: Faith emerges from her room and starts down the steep hillside
text: stairs that lead to the village. Lights along the shore are
text: beginning to glitter; a warm breeze flows in like silk. It's
dialog: the sort of moment and sort of place where all dreams seem
text: within reach.
text: Down below she can see him waiting for her outside the
text: restaurant door. She pauses a moment to take it all in. He
text: looks up and sees her. Blows a kiss up to her. She
text: practically swoons.
text: As she arrives at the foot of the stairs, he takes her hand,
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: You look like a goddess.
scene_heading: INT. BUCA DI BACCO RESTAURANT - TWILIGHT
text: A open-air place, overlooking the sea. Waves crash.
text: Moonlight glistens on the water. Guitarists stroll by,
text: singing sentimental Neopolitan ballads. It's all almost too
text: good to be true. They're led to a table and he pulls out her
text: chair. The perfect gentleman. A WAITER comes over to welcome
dialog: them. Asks if they'd like a drink.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (to Faith)
dialog: Wine?
text: She's a little giddy.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (to the waiter)
dialog: Brunello di Montalcino, '85,
dialog: please.
text: Back to her.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: You know, I noticed you out at the
dialog: pool even before we spoke. I could
dialog: sense the chemistry between us.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (a little
dialog: flustered)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (bedroom eyes)
dialog: Really...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: The WAITER arrives with the wine. Pours. She raises a glass.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Well, to-- new friends.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: And more...
text: They toast.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So, I guess you're probably
dialog: wondering why I asked you to
dialog: dinner...
text: He sets down his glass.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Not really. Happens to me all the
dialog: time.
text: An awkward laugh. It probably does. Damon picks up his menu,
text: scans the prices.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Well, fuck me.
text: She must be hearing things.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: (clearing his
dialog: throat)
dialog: Prices are a little steep here,
dialog: aren't they?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Don't worry about it. You're my
dialog: guest.
text: She picks up her menu.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What looks good?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (perusing it)
dialog: Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds
dialog: good...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You like shrimp? I like shrimp.
dialog: Small world.
text: They're still pondering their options when another COUPLE
text: stroll in and are led to the table directly next to theirs.
text: It's Peter and his date, FRANCESCA. And this time he was
text: telling the truth. She's stunning. All suntanned legs and
text: skintight spandex. Beaming, he pulls out her chair. Faith
text: just stares at him. As he moves around the table to sit down,
text: his eye catches hers.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: What?...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We were hungry.
text: She turns her back on him.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (looking up from
dialog: his menu)
dialog: So what do you think?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Uh, the scampi sounds good to me,
dialog: too.
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Damon. There you are.
text: An ELEPHANT OF A WOMAN approaches, Damon waves her over.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (to Faith)
dialog: I didn't think you'd mind...
text: She proceeds to plant herself at their table.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Faith, this is my mother.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Oh, hello.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Mommy, this is Faith.
text: Trying to conceal her surprise, Faith politely extends a hand.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Nice to meet you, Mrs. Bradley.
text: Peter drops his napkin, leans over towards Faith to retrieve
dialog: it,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (whispering into
dialog: her ear)
dialog: "Mommy"?
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER. Their food has arrived. Francesca is rubbing Peter's
text: leg under the table. Faith is trying to ignore this.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So, you say you've been to Italy
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: A few times. It's kind of an
dialog: annual tradi--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to Damon)
dialog: Pardon me, but could we borrow your
dialog: salt?
text: Faith glares at him.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Sure.
text: He hands it over.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You were saying...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (to Damon)
dialog: Boy, that looks tasty. What is
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: (chewing)
dialog: Scampi.
scene_heading: DAMON'S MOTHER
dialog: Damon. Not with your mouth full.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Scampi, huh? I love scampi. I
dialog: practically always get it in these
dialog: seafood places. Is that good
dialog: scampi?
text: Damon nods. Swallows.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: You want to try some?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (pleased with
dialog: himself)
dialog: Sure. I'll trade you some of my
dialog: pasta.
text: They start cheerily exchanging portions.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER STILL. The candles have burnt low. The plates are
text: being cleared. Francesca and Peter are feeding each other
text: dessert. Giggling. Damon snaps his fingers at a waiter.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: El checko, por favor.
text: Annoyed, the WAITER totals up their tab and starts to hand
text: it to him. Damon motions towards Faith. She takes it, starts
text: pulling out lire as he and his mother get up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Say, I saw where they had motor
text: boats for rent down in the harbor.
dialog: Why don't we all go for an evening
dialog: cruise around the bay?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don't know if that's such a--
scene_heading: DAMON AND HIS MOTHER
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: Great idea!
text: Faith is still counting as Damon and his mother, Peter and
text: Francesca all head for the door. She finally finishes,
text: hurries to her feet to catch up with Peter,
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (at his side)
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I just wanted to keep an eye on
dialog: you. The guy's a total stranger,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So were you.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Besides, no hard feelings. You
dialog: found somebody. I found somebody.
dialog: I thought we could double.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOM TERRACE - EVENING
text: Kate and Giovanni are dining outside on the vine-covered
dialog: terrace.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: This is back when I was in school,
dialog: you take those tests, you know?
dialog: They said I should go into physical
dialog: therapy.
dialog: (he takes a bite)
dialog: Or wood-working.
text: She looks confused.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: (simply)
dialog: I'm good with my hands.
text: The phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hold that thought.
text: Kate goes inside to pick it up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Faith at a pay phone outside the restaurant.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Kate. Thank God you're there.
dialog: I need help.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh huh... Okay, we'll be there.
dialog: How is he, anyway?
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Faith glances over at Damon -- as he pinches a woman walking
dialog: by.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: It's still a little too early to
dialog: say...
scene_heading: EXT. A BOAT IN THE TYRRHENIAN SEA - NIGHT
text: Kate and Giovanni are here. Damon's mother is in the corner.
text: Snoring. Damon is pontificating on global policy to Peter.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Irregardless of the politics. It's
dialog: time we stopped dicking around.
dialog: I'm telling you, nuculear is the
dialog: only way out.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But don't you think that's a little
dialog: short-sighted?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sotto, to Faith)
dialog: Not only is he a momma's boy and
text: a fascist, he says "nuculear" and
dialog: "irregardless".
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No one's perfect, Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And he is living proof.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, I think maybe you've been
dialog: right. I think I may have been
dialog: too critical in the past.
text: Damon BELCHES loudly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Faith, if I may say so, you picked
dialog: a helluva time to come to this
dialog: realization.
speaker_heading: HIM (O.S.)
dialog: Human rights, shmuman rights.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (hope springs
dialog: eternal)
dialog: Maybe I can change him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I thought this was supposed to be
dialog: the one guy in the world you
dialog: wouldn't need to change.
text: They stare over at him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Or maybe it'll turn him back into
dialog: a toad.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER. Francesca is idly running her fingers through Peter's
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Well, what about books? You like
dialog: Hemingway? You gotta love
dialog: Hemingway.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The Sun Also Rises. For Whom the
dialog: Bell Tolls. The Old Man and the--
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: He's alright. For a closet homo.
text: Faith's jaw muscles tighten slightly as she tries to take this
dialog: in stride.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: How about music? You like
dialog: classical?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The Boston Pops. Season tickets.
text: Damon yawns.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Well, how about those old romantic
dialog: movies with those great stars, huh?
dialog: Like Audrey Hepburn.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Actually, I think I prefer
dialog: Katherine Hepburn.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Audrey was cool.
text: Finally. She smiles. Damon SPITS noisily over the side.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Too bad she didn't have any tits.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Kate is listing things. Faith and Damon are nodding their
text: heads, yes and no. Never in unison.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Baseball. Carmelcorn. Organized
dialog: religion. Sting. Grape-flavored
dialog: candy. The Marx Brothers. Long
text: foreplay. Gardening. Drum solos.
dialog: Dogs. Mai tais.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Kate, checking her list.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Amazing. With the exception of
dialog: fruitcake, which, let's be honest,
dialog: everybody hates,
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: you two have absolutely nothing
dialog: whatsoever in common.
dialog: (re-checking her
dialog: list)
dialog: That's got to be almost
dialog: statistically impossible.
text: Francesca and Peter are up towards the bow of the boat,
text: cavorting, hanging on each other. Faith is facing them, with
text: her back to Damon.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (not wanting to
dialog: look)
dialog: What's he doing now?
text: Kate peers over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: He's tearing the wings off a moth
text: and making it walk around.
text: Faith buries her head in her hands.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Faith is standing at the railing alone, gazing out at the open
text: ocean. When she feels someone sidling up next to her.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: So, what are we waiting for?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: Let's face it. You want me.
text: He places a hand on her breast. She lets out a blood-curdling
text: SCREAM. Peter comes running to her rescue. Hauls off and
text: decks him.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - NIGHT
text: Peter and Giovanni are forcibly dragging Damon off the boat,
text: down the dock. Still onboard, she and Kate watch them go,
text: in a daze.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (numbly)
dialog: He's a jerk.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes. He is.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I spent my whole life waiting for
dialog: a creep.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I came all the way to Italy in
text: search of a weasel.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (still watching
dialog: them go)
dialog: When you could've found one in
dialog: America.
text: Francesca steps past them off the boat.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Do not feel bad. He was scum.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDING - NIGHT
text: After the men are out of earshot, we see Peter pull this guy
text: aside. And surreptitiously hand him an envelope.
speaker_heading: HIM
dialog: You didn't think that last bit with
dialog: the bugs was a little over the top?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not at all. You were perfect.
text: Handing him another envelope.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And thank Mrs. Walker, too.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Faith and Kate are still there, unloading a groggy Mrs.
text: Bradley. She goes tottering down the dock, as Peter returns.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (sympathetically)
dialog: I guess he turned out to be kind
dialog: of a loser, huh?
text: She sighs, nods.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I feel like the world's biggest
dialog: idiot.
text: He finishes securing the boat.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why should you be embarrassed?
dialog: He was the jerk.
text: She doesn't believe this, but appreciates the gesture.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: In spite of the way it all turned
dialog: out, though, I want you to know
dialog: how much I appreciate your helping
dialog: me find him. I would always have
dialog: wondered what might have been.
text: He pauses.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Well, was the least I could do.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, it was more than that. It was
dialog: very generous of you. It was very
dialog: kind.
text: His eyes meet hers. From the landing, Francesca calls after
text: him impatiently.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: I better go.
text: Faith's eyes shift between the two of them.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Sure. I understand.
text: He touches her shoulder.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Promise me you won't leave without
text: saying goodbye.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No. Course not.
text: And with that, he gets up, steps off the boat and heads down
text: the pier with Francesca clinging to him. She watches them
dialog: walk away.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So. I guess I've got a wedding
dialog: to go to.
text: Faith steps off the boat and walks down the pier, a solitary
text: figure, who finally disappears in the mist.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Faith is packing. She picks up her "Let's Go Italy" guide,
text: and the polaroid of her and Peter falls out. "The Kiss".
text: She sighs. Tucks it back inside the book. She picks up her
text: wallet, opens the coin purse, reaches in to pull out her
text: ENGAGEMENT RING. As she does, something else falls to the
text: floor. Dwayne's DRY CLEANING TICKET. She stares down at it.
text: Then takes the ring, places it back in her wallet. And picks
text: up the telephone.
scene_heading: INT. HER MOTHER'S HOME - DAY
text: Her mother is sobbing hysterically. Larry is there. Dwayne
text: is there. Leslie is there. Leslie's eyes meet Dwayne's
text: meaningfully.
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: Kate and Giovanni are walking down the pier, hand in hand.
text: He stops her, leans her up against the railing, and plants
text: a massive kiss on her. After she's managed to catch her
dialog: breath,
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Giovanni, I want to thank you.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: I thank you.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, you don't understand. It's
dialog: been wonderful meeting you. But...
dialog: I have a husband. I have two kids
dialog: at camp. I have a life I have to
dialog: go back to.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: You don't have to go if you don't
dialog: want to...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: But I do want to.
text: He realizes where this isn't going. Tries another tack.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: You think I'm just one of those
dialog: Italian Casanovas. The guys who
dialog: try to seduce every woman who comes
text: their way. Who prey on unhappily
dialog: married women. Who lure
dialog: unsuspecting--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Giovanni.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That's exactly what you are.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Is it that obvious?
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thank you for making me feel
dialog: wanted.
text: She turns, and heads up the stairs. Alone. After a beat,
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Kate.
text: She looks back down,
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: It was my pleasure.
text: And he starts down the street. Passes an outdoor cafe. With
text: an attractive woman in it. ANGLE ON the WOMAN.
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Do you believe in love at first
dialog: sight?...
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Faith is in bed. In the darkness. The door opens.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Kate is that you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I didn't expect you back so soon.
text: Kate closes the door.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, I realized, if you're getting
dialog: married, you're gonna be needing
dialog: the maid of honor, right?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Actually, no. There's not going
dialog: to be a wedding.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well... I ought to be getting home
dialog: anyway. The kids'll be back from
text: camp soon. The house is probably
text: a mess.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: And Larry?...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What about Larry?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I don't know. I've just been
dialog: thinking... maybe this destiny
dialog: thing is more of a do-it-yourself
dialog: operation. Maybe the things that
dialog: are meant to be are the things we
dialog: want badly enough to fight for.
text: The room is quiet. You can hear the waves in the distance.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Maybe...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
text: It's a glorious morning. Birds chirp. The sea shimmers in
text: the distance. Faith is standing outside a hotel room door.
text: She takes a deep breath. Knocks. It opens. Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Hi. Are you... busy?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you're leaving?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No. I just came by to apologize.
text: He looks at her questioningly.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It seems like ever since I found
dialog: out about this guy, this name, I've
dialog: been kind of crazy. Like I was
dialog: on drugs or something.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know the feeling.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yeah... Well, anyway, I also
dialog: wanted to tell you, I'm not getting
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You aren't?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No. I mean yes, I'm not. I
dialog: decided to call it off. Well,
dialog: actually, it was kind of mutual.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well. Congratulations.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, since I have a few more days
dialog: of vacation left, I was wondering
dialog: if maybe you'd want to do something
dialog: sometime. I mean, you know, if
dialog: you don't have... other plans.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you asking me out?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yes. I am.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (gently)
dialog: In that case... no...
text: She looks down at the ground. Nods.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't have other plans.
text: She looks back up.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Kate goes to the desk for her key. The concierge hands it
text: to her, along with something else. An envelope.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: From an admirer...
text: She hesitantly opens it. Inside is a college catalogue. A
text: note: "Please turn to page 51". Puzzled, she opens it to
text: page 51. The Sociology section. A class is circled:
dialog: "Trans-gender Modes of Communication in Post-Modern Society".
text: And another note in the margin: "You want to take it with me?"
text: LARRY steps into view from around a corner. She looks up.
text: Tears in her eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STEPS - DAY
text: Peter and Faith are overlooking the sea, towards Capri.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You can't come to Southern Italy
text: and not see the Blue Grotto.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I just need to run up and get my
dialog: bathing suit.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay. I'll meet you at the dock
dialog: in ten minutes.
text: As she dashes off,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hurry...
scene_heading: EXT. POSITANO VILLAGE - DAY
text: Faith is on her way back to her room. She passes the
text: community playhouse where two teenage kids are up on ladders,
text: suspending a banner across the stairs announcing a new play:
text: "The Odyssey". One kid accidentally drops his end, and it
text: goes fluttering down across her path. Faith stops to retrieve
text: it and is handing it back up to him when she glances at the
text: window where the eight-by-tens of the play's stars are being
text: changed. The new star of the show is noneother than Damon
text: Bradley. Only his name isn't Damon Bradley. It's LEONARD
text: GILINSKY. She stares at the photo. And suddenly has trouble
dialog: breathing.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DAY
text: Peter is waiting at the dock. Checks his watch.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: Faith is packing. Furiously hurling stuff into a suitcase.
text: Peter shows up at the door.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is something the matter?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: GET OUT!!
text: Backing behind it,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I'd call that a yes.
text: (peeking around
dialog: the corner)
dialog: Do I get a hint?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You want a hint? I'll give you
dialog: a hint. You are the lowest, most
text: despicable, most reprehensible form
dialog: of reptilian swine--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There's no such thing.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Reptilian swine. There's no such
dialog: thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Who cares?! You hired an actor??
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
dialog: (a nervous beat)
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No one had to tell me. He's
text: starring in the local play.
text: A bead of sweat rolls down his neck.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You did, didn't you? You got
dialog: somebody to pretend to be him?
dialog: Tell me the truth. For once.
text: He takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Alright. The truth is... I thought
dialog: we had something here.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I can't believe you did that!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And I can't believe you are so
dialog: stubborn and so blind as to let
dialog: some stranger, some phantom you've
dialog: never even met destroy it.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (turning on him)
dialog: You're the reason I never met him.
dialog: You knew it was the thing I most
dialog: wanted in life and you sabotaged
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I sabotaged it? You're the one
dialog: who lost him, remember?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Well, I might've found him again
dialog: if I hadn't left Rome to make this
dialog: pointless trip down here with you.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: As I recall, you were on your way
dialog: home. And I didn't want you to
dialog: go so, yes, I told you a little
dialog: white lie.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: A "little white lie"? A "little
dialog: white lie"?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What would you call it?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I would call it-- unforgivable.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't you think you're overreacting
dialog: just a little here? We're talking
dialog: about love, okay? Let's be
dialog: rational.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Rational?! Love is not rational!
dialog: Are you crazy?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (throwing up his
dialog: hands)
dialog: Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven
dialog: me crazy. No one in their right
dialog: mind would go to this much trouble
dialog: to win over someone as insane as
dialog: you. Did it ever, even for one
dialog: second, occur to you how much work
dialog: it was to set all this up? How
dialog: many arrangements had to be made?
dialog: How many players had to be
dialog: coordinated?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Gee, I'm flattered. What an
text: incredibly romantic gesture.
dialog: Cancel the roses, I've decided to
text: lie to her instead.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Very funny.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, it isn't. I called off my
dialog: wedding all because of you.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (touched)
dialog: Really?...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (realizing this
dialog: herself for the
dialog: first time)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Then,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And this is the thanks I get. I
dialog: did you a favor. You never wanted
dialog: to marry that joker in the first
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: That's not the point.
dialog: (realizing she's
dialog: just given herself
dialog: away)
dialog: And what if I had wanted to?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: If you had wanted to, you'd have
dialog: gone home.
text: Then, more calmly,
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Look, I just thought if you finally
dialog: got rid of this obsession with this
dialog: name, if you could get it out of
dialog: your system once and for all, then
dialog: maybe you'd be able to stop waiting
dialog: and open your heart to someone
dialog: real. Granted, ideally, me. I
dialog: didn't do it to hurt you. I did
dialog: it for you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I did it for us...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: There is no us.
text: His eyes harden.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, that's right. There's only
text: him. Mr. Perfect Imaginary Man.
dialog: You know, I gave you more credit
dialog: than you deserved. The truth is,
dialog: you're in love with the fantasy.
dialog: You're afraid of something real.
text: And he storms out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
text: CLOSE ON a pile of cornball souvenirs. A little gondola.
text: A little colosseum. The little liqueur bottles.
text: Kate and Larry are at a table. She's been collecting things
dialog: for him all along the way.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Are you kidding? All that stuff
dialog: was for you, Kate. It just seemed
dialog: like you were mad at me, so I
dialog: thought maybe if I-- I hate Polo...
text: Kate smiles. In love with him all over again.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: There's just one thing I still
dialog: don't understand.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I don't have a great aunt in Italy.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Peter, carrying his suitcase, turns in his key to the
text: concierge. Signs his bill. And resignedly exits out the door.
text: ANGLE on the mermaid out in front of "SIREN TRAVEL". Inside,
text: Faith is waiting in line. She steps up to the window. On
text: the other side of the counter is Damon. That is, is Leonard.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: You...
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: (a little uneasy)
dialog: Hi there...
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Before you start picking your nose,
dialog: I know he put you up to it.
text: He looks disappointed.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: It was the moth stuff that gave
dialog: it away, didn't it?
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I knew that was too much.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: No, you gave a very convincing
dialog: performance. And you'll be pleased
dialog: to know that your eight-by-ten
text: glossy is now on display at the
text: local playhouse.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: My picture's up?
text: He conveys this to a co-worker in Italian. They exchange
text: high-fives.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: (glumly)
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: So, this is what you do? I mean
dialog: when you're not playing other
dialog: parts?
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: I take it things didn't work out
dialog: between the two of you?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: That's a shame.
text: She shrugs. Heh.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Yeah, well... Anyway, I'm here to
dialog: pick up my ticket. TWA, Flight
dialog: 877.
text: He starts punching it into his computer.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Is this your first trip here?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: It's an amazing place, don't you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Amazing.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Smoking or non-smoking?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Non.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Please.
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Lots of history. For example, did
dialog: you know, according to legend, this
dialog: coastline used to harbor Sirens?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Hm.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Beautiful women who could lure men
dialog: to their destruction with their
dialog: singing. Nobody's ever really seen
dialog: them and lived to tell about it.
dialog: But, I don't know. An awful lot
dialog: of ships wrecked on those rocks.
text: He shrugs. Hands her her ticket.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Well. Have a good trip.
text: She nods. Distant. And we stay on her face.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Peter places his suitcase in the car. Gets in. Tosses
text: something out the window. A dead gardenia.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Kate and Larry. Larry starts choking on his Campari.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Damon Bradley? That's why you're
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What? You know him?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (chuckling
dialog: nervously)
dialog: It was just a joke. I was pushing
dialog: the arrow. I wanted to get to the
dialog: next question. I wanted to find
dialog: out who was gonna win the Series.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Are you saying you just made the
dialog: whole thing up? The guy never even
dialog: existed?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: He existed. He was some kid I knew
dialog: from Little League.
dialog: (musing)
dialog: He was a real jerk.
text: (he looks up at
dialog: her)
dialog: You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Went to high school with him.
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: what about the fortune teller?
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CARNIVAL NIGHT - NIGHT
text: Twenty years ago. A young Faith is sitting across from the
text: fortune teller. There's a pounding at the back door.
text: This time we stay with Madame Divina, following her as she
text: gets up, marches to the back of the booth and throws open the
text: door. Standing there is Larry. He whispers something in her
text: ear as he hands her a five dollar bill.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I thought she'd get a kick out of
dialog: it.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It was a harmless little prank.
dialog: Who in the world would've thought
dialog: she'd spend her life waiting for
dialog: this guy?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Larry, you've got to tell her.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I can't tell her. She's called
dialog: off her wedding. She'll never
dialog: speak to me again.
text: He looks up pleadingly.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You tell her.
text: Faith bounding up the steps. She races to Peter's room.
text: Pounds on the door. No answer.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
text: Faith dashes to the desk, runs into Kate and Larry.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Larry! What are you doing here?
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Mom sent you.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: No.
text: He puts an arm around Kate.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I came after the woman I love.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He missed me.
text: Faith smiles. He puts his other arm around her.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: The two women I love. How are you,
dialog: Faith?
text: She's a little surprised by this outpouring of affection.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm fine.
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Have you seen Peter?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He's gone. He told me what
dialog: happened. He just left for the
dialog: airport.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Larry, did you rent a car?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yeah--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Faith. Larry has something he
dialog: wants to tell you about Damon
dialog: Bradley.
text: Larry is violently shaking his head "no". Kate jabs him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'll leave you two alone.
text: She exits the room. Stranding him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Faith, this guy you think is Mr.
dialog: Right, he's... not what you think--
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Don't worry, it's a long story,
dialog: but I know who he is. I know where
dialog: to find him.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: But, Faith--
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Please, Larry. I have to hurry.
text: She spots the keys lying on the table. Grabs them, bolts for
text: the door.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'll bring it back as soon as I
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: But Faith--
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: What?...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (chickening out)
text: It's the red Fiat.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kate and Faith's room.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: She what?!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: She said she knew where to find
dialog: him, and then she grabbed my car
dialog: keys, and--
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And you didn't tell her?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: She didn't give me a chance.
text: Kate pins him with her eyes.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, you never know...
dialog: (lamely)
dialog: Maybe they'll hit it off...
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY OF THE LE SIRENUSE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What do you mean we have to stop
text: her before she does something
dialog: crazy?
scene_heading: EXT. AMALFI DRIVE - DAY

speaker_heading: TAXI follows.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF ROME - DAY
text: Faith speeds through the tangled web of Roman traffic. Kate
text: and Larry in close pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. ROME AIRPORT - DAY
text: Faith screeches to a halt in the passenger loading zone.
text: Dashes inside. Scans the DEPARTURE SCREEN for a flight to
scene_heading: BOSTON. Finds it: AMERICAN AIRLINES, GATE NUMBER 7, "ON
text: TIME", at 5:00. She checks her watch. It's 4:57. She starts
text: racing down the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. JET - DAY
text: Aboard the plane, Peter is settling into his seat.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT CORRIDOR - DAY
text: A vending machine. SOMEBODY at it with his back to us pushes
text: the Butterfinger button. The "SOLD OUT" light blinks on.
text: A FIST starts banging on machine. Faith sprints by.
dialog: Oblivious.
scene_heading: INT. GATE 7 - DAY
text: Faith rushes to GATE #7. Slaps something down on the desk
text: in front of the CLERK.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Boarding pass.
text: Blows past him. He sticks out an arm.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I'm afraid you're too late, m'am.
text: She stops. Breathing hard. Uncomprehending. He looks at
dialog: the pass.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: And this isn't for this airline,
dialog: either.
text: Faith turns to the window to see the portable stairs once
text: again being pulled away from the cabin door. Deja vu. She
text: notices a side door. Only this time there are MEN with
text: MACHINE GUNS standing guard directly outside it. This, after
dialog: all, is Rome.
text: With her hands pressed plaintively against the glass, she
text: watches as the plane taxis away from the gate toward the
text: runway, to join the LINE-UP of other PLANES waiting for
dialog: take-off clearance. This jet, which we'll call "Peter's" jet,
text: is fifth in line.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL ENTRANCE - DAY
text: Kate and Larry come barrelling in.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT GIFT SHOP - DAY
text: Faith is buying one of those little portable Igloo ICE CHESTS.
text: With an "I Italy" logo. And an enormous roll of MASKING
speaker_heading: TAPE.
text: A JET takes off. Peter's jet moves up a notch. Three to go.
scene_heading: INT. GATE NUMBER 7 - DAY
text: CLOSE ON the ICE CHEST. With a lot of tape wrapped around
text: it. And large lettering, "MEDICAL EMERGENCY" "DO NOT OPEN."
text: And a little red cross. It looks pretty tacky.
dialog: O.S.
dialog: A heart transplant?!
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: That's right. She's been waiting
dialog: a long time.
text: The clerk picks up the ice chest, starts trying to examine
text: it. Faith stops him.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
dialog: Hearts are very fragile.
text: Somebody else comes up. A SECURITY GUARD. He and the clerk
text: start conversing Italian.
scene_heading: OUT THE WINDOW --
text: Faith sees another jet take off. Two to go.
speaker_heading: INSIDE --
text: Faith is anxiously looking from one authority to the to other,
text: vainly trying to follow their conversation. Finally the guard
text: turns to her,
speaker_heading: CARABINIERE
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I'm the cardiologist.
text: The Clerk eyes the ice chest suspiciously.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You didn't have that with you
dialog: before.
dialog: (to the guard,
dialog: pointing to the
dialog: chest)
dialog: Prima non l'aveva con se.
speaker_heading: FAITH
text: It was late in arriving.
dialog: (with import)
dialog: But it's here now.
speaker_heading: CARABINIERE
dialog: Do you have any I.D.?
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: Look, I've given you my credit
dialog: card, my passport number. I've
text: paid for the flight. Now, while
dialog: you two sit here cross-examining
dialog: me, someone's future is hanging
text: in the balance.
text: OUT ON THE RUNWAY --
text: The last jet in front of Peter's is given clearance. It races
text: down the runway and disappears into the sky. And Peter's jet
text: taxis into position. ENGINES REVVING furiously.
speaker_heading: INSIDE --
text: A whole flock of AIRPORT PERSONNEL are now conferring. A
text: crowd of other ONLOOKERS have gathered. A few of them start
text: mumbling opinions.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: It's a heart, for godssakes. You
dialog: guys are Italian. Don't you get
dialog: it? It's the greatest gift one
dialog: human being can give another. Are
dialog: you telling me you're going to
dialog: stand there and deny her the chance
dialog: of a lifetime?
text: A GUY in the crowd with a "Dianetics" book in one hand and
text: a cigarette in the other, tosses in his two cents,
speaker_heading: ONLOOKER
dialog: Let the nut go...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JET - DAY
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm afraid
dialog: we've got a temporary delay. We

text: Passengers groan. The engines wind down, and the plane taxis
text: off the runway, back toward the terminal.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY - DAY
text: The portable stairs are being wheeled back toward the cabin
text: door. Faith is waiting inside. Triumphant. When,
speaker_heading: LOUDSPEAKER
dialog: Damon Bradley. Signore Damon
dialog: Bradley. E pregato di recarsi
dialog: all'ufficio informazione.
text: For a moment, for just a fraction of a second, she hesitates.
speaker_heading: LOUDSPEAKER
dialog: Damon Bradley. Mr. Damon Bradley,
dialog: please meet your party at the
dialog: information booth.
text: Then we see the decision has been made. Ice chest in hand,
text: she strides confidently out the door toward the plane, without
text: a backward glance.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT INFORMATION BOOTH - DAY
text: Kate and Larry are waiting there.
dialog: O.S.
dialog: Larry Corbett?
dialog: Larry turns,
text: It's the smoker with the "Dianetics" volume.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: I thought that was you.
dialog: (he extends a hand)
dialog: Damon Bradley. Remember me?
text: He calls to a woman nearby,
speaker_heading: DAMON BRADLEY
dialog: Honey...
dialog: (to Larry)
dialog: This is my wife, Arlene.
dialog: (to her)
dialog: Larry and I played in Little League
dialog: together.
scene_heading: INT. JET - DAY
text: Faith walks up the steps and through the cabin door. She
text: spots Peter seated about halfway back. But he doesn't see
text: her. He's staring blankly out the window. She makes her way
text: to the open seat next to him. He looks up. Does a double
dialog: take.
speaker_heading: FAITH
dialog: I brought you something. Something
dialog: I didn't want you to leave without.
text: She sits down. Hands him the ice chest. Puzzled, he opens
text: the cover. Inside is a little chocolate heart. He takes it
text: out, looks at it.
