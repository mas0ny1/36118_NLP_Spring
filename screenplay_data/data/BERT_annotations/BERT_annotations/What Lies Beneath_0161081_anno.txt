scene_heading: WHAT LIES BENEATH
dialog: by
dialog: Clark Gregg
dialog: June 14, 1999
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Moving through a murky haze. Dark blues and greens, shafts
text: of prismed purple. A pale shard appears in the distance.
text: Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera.
text: We're UNDERWATER. Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens
text: into focus. It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water,
text: arms floating lazily at her side. The face is obscured by
text: flowing hair. All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING
text: GREEN EYES, which blink closed...
speaker_heading: MORPH TO:
text: ...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from
text: water. CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in
text: her bathtub. She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the
text: kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side,
text: reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being
dialog: pulled.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: A HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound.
text: A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER. Claire
text: starts to come into focus. The dryer stops. She presses the
text: red G.F.I. button on the socket. ZAP! A big blue spark
text: shoots out. Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer
text: starts whirring again.
text: She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook. She
text: regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant-
text: looking woman around forty.
text: Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR
text: above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek,
text: as if confirming her existence.
scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Claire, now dressed, presses her face against a door,
text: listening for the sounds of stirring from within. Silence.
text: She quietly pushes open the door.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - DAY
text: Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a
text: window, then pulls the curtains to reveal:
text: A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE. It couldn't be more picturesque. A
text: 24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE
text: LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake.
text: The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE
text: still shrouded by covers.
text: Claire sits beside the sleeping form. She scans the room
text: briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a
text: tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.
text: She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same
text: face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped
text: hair and tiny nose ring. Claire leans over and inhales the
text: sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN. She places her
text: hand on a cheek. The girl's eyelids flutter softly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Morning, beauty.
text: Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Let's go. Or we'll never leave on time.
text: From out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: I'm totally ready.
text: Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Come on, I'll make you some waffles,
dialog: maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the
dialog: mall.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Caitlin...
text: Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Mother...
text: Claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from
text: the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box.
text: Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: You're such a morning person.
text: Claire turns at the door.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the
dialog: plastic.
text: She starts to leave. Caitlin calls out.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN (O.S.)
dialog: Blueberries!
text: Claire smiles as she closes the door behind her.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Claire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks. When
text: she stands, something catches her eye out a window. She
text: gazes down, transfixed.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Through a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG
text: COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door.
text: Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an
text: unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood
text: of their huge old Buick. She tries to get a glimpse of the
text: woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD.
text: A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist. She lets out a
text: small gasp as a hand closes on her breast. It's Claire's
text: husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck.
text: He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks
text: beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him
text: look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the
text: prominent academic that he is. Claire, however, can't take
text: her eyes off the scene below.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: They at it again?
text: Claire nods.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Christ, that's twice in...When did they
dialog: move in?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I think three...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Three weeks.
text: She continues to gaze downward. The man leans over the hood,
text: murmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Norman
text: the scene is entirely silent.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What's their name?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures.
dialog: They're all psychotic.
text: Outside, Mr. Feur turns and walks toward his house. Norman
text: begins, once again, to nuzzle Claire. Her eyes close, but
text: then she gently demurs.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: She's awake.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet.
text: She turns to him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't want to be either.
text: He smiles. A really good smile. The lips and tongue on his
text: faded T-shirt mark him as a 'Stones fan.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: When's she out of here?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Norman Spencer.
text: Norman gives up. He busses her cheek.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (moving toward the stairs)
dialog: Alright. I can't take the rejection. I'm
dialog: going to class.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Claire, I have to show up for the--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's Saturday.
text: Norman stops.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I knew that. You think I didn't know
dialog: that?
text: She smiles at him. After a beat:
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's today?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (wistfully)
dialog: Yep.
text: They share a warm, poignant look. He turns and moves down
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (calling over his shoulder)
dialog: We're going to have to leave by three if
dialog: we want to beat the traffic.
text: Claire returns her gaze to the scene below as Mr. Feur says
text: something ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Claire?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (absently)
text: Three o'clock.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Mrs. Feur drops her face into her hands.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
text: Claire peruses her "to do" list as Caitlin munches a panini.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...and I still think we should get you
text: some mittens.
text: Caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly.
text: The bond between them is palpable.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Do you have a scarf?
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Hey.
text: Claire looks up from her little pad of paper.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
text: It's only two hours away.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: I'll come back all the time.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Of course you will.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: I'm just saying, you're going to be
dialog: fine.
text: Claire smiles.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sweetheart, I've known this day was
dialog: coming for a long time. I've got your
text: father and the garden and the new house.
dialog: You really don't have to worry.
text: Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some
text: concern. Claire takes her hand.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Really.
text: She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace. Her
text: eyes close.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN (V.O.)
dialog: Mother...
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY
text: Claire's frozen in the hug.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mom.
text: Her eyes open. Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on
text: the college campus. The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: I have'ta go.
text: After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip. Caitlin
text: glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed
text: this overt display of maternal affection.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: I'll call you.
text: Claire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her
text: daughter's hand. It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Come home anytime.
text: Caitlin looks at Norman.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Really gonna leave me, huh?
text: She nods. They share a tender look.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Be good.
text: She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist. A bit
text: overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of
text: Caitlin's head. After a moment, she steps back...
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Bye.
text: ...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old
text: Columbia dorm. A banner is draped across its portals which
dialog: reads:
text: "WELCOME CLASS OF '04."
text: Claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly
text: shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps. Her
text: eyes are shining. Norman wraps an arm around her waist as
text: she daps at a tear with a Kleenex.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I almost made it.
text: They turn and head for the car. Claire sneaks one last look
text: over her shoulder.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Caitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton
text: nightgown. Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes.
text: She gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him
text: and starts reading. After a moment:
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Whatcha reading?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (reading the cover, sexy voice)
dialog: Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic
dialog: organisms.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (slight smile)
dialog: How is it?
text: Claire snuggles up.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Excellent. Couple of Swedish sailor cells
text: just gang divided a virginal cheerleader
dialog: cell.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (lost in his book)
dialog: Nice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Almost done.
text: She pulls slightly away.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: If you have to work...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: No, no. I'm just about...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There.
text: He places his book on the bedside table and turns to her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's okay if you're not.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I am, really.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's just she's been the focus for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Not the focus.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You know what I mean.
text: Claire thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: To tell you the truth...I'm
dialog: excited.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You are...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: To get my life back. To have some time
dialog: for myself. Some time for us.
text: He caresses her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You did a great job. She's a good kid.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We did.
text: There's a weighty pause.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's just us now.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I know.
text: He kisses her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Tired?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wanna fool around?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yup.
text: They start to kiss. It's slow and a bit methodical in the
text: manner of long time lovers. Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN
text: WAILING can be heard. They stop.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Did you...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Shhh.
text: They listen. The sounds start to become louder. It is
text: clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and
dialog: savage love making.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Jesus.
text: He walks over and closes the window. It doesn't help.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I guess they're making up.
text: The woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What is he doing to her?
text: They lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: And we moved out here for the quiet.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Mmm.
text: Beat. The mood has passed.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Maybe we should just...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm finished at three. No. Squash with
dialog: Stan.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: After that.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'll be there.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Love you.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Night.
text: They lie together in the darkness as the Feurs finally
dialog: climax.
scene_heading: INT. CAITLIN'S ROOM - DAY
text: Claire pushes open the door to Caitlin's room carrying an
text: armful of FOLDED LAUNDRY. She moves quickly to the bureau,
text: not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINY
text: BLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer. She's
text: just about to close it, when something catches her eye.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old
text: JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer.
text: Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of
text: Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,
text: STUFFED ANIMALS.
text: She brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in
text: the smells. She stares down at the word "Juilliard."
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
text: "JUILLIARD"...now it's on the same T-shirt only Claire's
text: wearing it and she's much younger. It's an old photograph in
text: an album. Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot, his
text: arm draped around her waist. A CELLO CASE stands beside her.
text: Claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and
text: sees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE. She gazes at
dialog: other photos.
text: -- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux
text: with a very wide bow-tie.
text: -- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING. A
text: tiny Caitlin rests on her hip.
text: Claire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - DAY
text: Her face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the
text: immaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN.
text: The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE. She collapses
text: into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside. Suddenly,
text: she hears something coming from next door.
text: She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound. It
text: is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING. Claire makes
text: her way over to the fence. The women's sobbing becomes more
text: plaintive and fevered.
text: She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence
text: and tries to peer through the crack. All she can make out is
text: A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking. Claire gathers
text: her nerve and calls out...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hello...
text: There's no reaction.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Mrs. Feur?
text: The sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering. The blue
text: shape vanishes from view.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Wait a minute. I just want--
text: Something bumps against the fence. Claire draws back. She
text: hears heavy breathing.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: (sniffling)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer. From
dialog: next door. Is everything--
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: You're the flower lady.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Um...yes.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: I've seen you. From the window.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Is everything alright?
text: Claire leans closer to the tiny crack. She sees a fleshy
text: blur and what might be part of an eye. There's no response,
dialog: just the breathing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: I'm not...
text: She seems on the verge of losing it again.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I
dialog: can't breath...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Who? Your husband?
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid
dialog: of...
text: She trails off.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What? What are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: I can't, no, no, I can't...
text: Claire edges closer to the crack.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Tell me. Please.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: That I'll just...that one day I'll
dialog: just...disappear.
text: Beat. Claire's taken aback by this admission.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Tell me. I can help you.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: How? How can you help me? With your
dialog: flowers and your perfect life...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's not...It's not like that.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: I've never even met you.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I know. And I'm sorry. I've been consumed
dialog: with...my daughter left...for school.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: This fence...it's so...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm sorry. It's for the flowers. Why
dialog: don't you...
text: Tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into
text: the Feur's driveway.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: Oh God. He's back. I'm sorry. Please
dialog: forget that I...I don't know what I'm
dialog: saying. Please...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Wait! Don't go...
text: Claire listens to the sound of NAKED FOOTSTEPS, followed by a
text: LARGE FRONT DOOR swinging shut. A CAR DOOR swings open and a
text: MAN'S SHOES follow down the path.
text: Claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence
text: as the door closes a second time. She sits there for a
text: moment listening, but all is quiet.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (V.O.)
dialog: She sounded terrified.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire and Norman eat dinner. A rainstorm pelts the windows.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Of him I think.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Did she say that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: More or less.
text: Norman chews.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Honey, they're young. They're probably
text: newlyweds.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm telling you. There was something in
dialog: her voice...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Remember how we were?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Not like this. We were never like this.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want to go over there. After dinner, we
dialog: can--
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: To make sure she's all right.
text: Norman puts down his fork.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Claire, honey, we are not going to march
dialog: next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: That's not what I'm sug--
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: ...when tonight they'll probably be
dialog: keeping us awake.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But what if something happens?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Claire...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'd never be able to live with mysel--
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: Nothing's going to happen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Besides, I have to work tonight. The
dialog: conference is in less than two weeks.
dialog: I've got to stay focused on that for just
dialog: a little longer.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's what I've been working for.
text: She glances down at her untouched plate.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I just wish you could have heard her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych
dialog: department, see what I can find out.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Promise?
text: He gives her a "Didn't I just say so" look. She smiles.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'll make you some coffee.
text: She reaches for his plate to clear it. Norman grabs her hand
text: and kisses it.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Norman snores softly. Claire is awakened by the continuing
text: STORM. She pads out to Norman's turreted library. Rain
text: pelts the glass. Her face is briefly illuminated by the
scene_heading: LIGHTHOUSE BEAM.
text: She hears the sound of a DOOR CLOSING and moves to get a
text: better view of the Feur's. Nothing but blackness. Just as
text: she's turning to go back to bed. A LIGHTNING FLASH lights up
text: the night. Claire's eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: In the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, in
text: shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the
text: open trunk of his car.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (in a hoarse whisper)
dialog: Norman!
text: He's dead to the world. She calls to him again.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Norman, you have to look at this!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Mmnph.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hurry...
text: Another flash illuminates...Norman at her side.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Look!
text: ...an EMPTY DRIVEWAY, then blackness.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What is it? What's the matter?
text: She stares down into the darkness.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Nothing. There was...I thought I saw
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Is it gone?
text: THE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway. She nods.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Come on, let's go back to bed.
text: Yet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at the
dialog: window.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING
text: Claire sets up a camera and tripod. She steps back and aims
text: her camera. She glances up at a large upstairs window at the
text: FEUR'S HOUSE. One side of the curtain seems to be pulled
text: open, but no one's there.
text: Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera. The
text: morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL
text: PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house.
text: She glances back at the Feur's window. The CURTAIN IS NOW
speaker_heading: CLOSED.
text: She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.
text: When this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers
text: across the fence. She can barely see over, but glimpses:
text: A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway. Just then, a car
text: pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her
dialog: perch.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Claire walks out to find her best friend, JODY, pretty, in
text: her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hey there.
text: Jody hugs her.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: How you holding up?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Good. I'm good.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why does everyone find that so
dialog: surprising?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: (are you kidding?)
dialog: Cause...your...only daughter just went
dialog: away to school...who you were incredibly
dialog: close with aaand I'd be tripping...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, I'm a little tender.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Well good. So you're human.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And so far my day has consisted of taking
dialog: pictures of my roses for the garden club.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Wow. Got here just in time.
dialog: (reaching into her bag)
dialog: I brought you this.
text: She proffers several homemade tea bags.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Kambucha mushroom tea...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody--
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: It soothes heart-ache and promotes
dialog: psychic wellness. Sela suggested I bring--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're discussing me with your psychic?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: She's not a psychic. Just a very
text: enlightened spirit.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Thanks, but I'm fine.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: (pressing it into her hand)
dialog: So you'll have some later.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Notice anything...different?
text: Claire gives her friend the once over, then notices the mint
text: Karman-Ghia behind her.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh my god. You bought it.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's niiice.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband,
dialog: get a car. Think it'll help me pick up
dialog: dudes?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Listen, I've gotta run. I just thought
dialog: I'd stop by and see if you want to take
dialog: the boat out, say Thursday morning?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You got it.
text: Jody grins.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: See you then.
text: Jody drives off. Claire walks down the driveway to her front
text: door and sees Mr. Feur staring at her from a window. She
text: starts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut.
text: Claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the
text: doorknob. She stops. A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard from
text: within. Claire quietly opens the door and moves into:
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - DAY
text: Claire stops inside the door. Now it sounds like WHISPERING.
text: Two voices, tense, impassioned. It seems to be coming from
text: Norman's study. She gathers her nerve, then bursts into the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY
text: But the whispering has suddenly stopped.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hello?
text: The lovely circular room is completely empty. She looks
text: around, puzzled. Cooper, the family's aging lab, casually
text: ambles over.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to Cooper)
dialog: Please tell me you heard that.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: Claire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at
text: the water's edge. Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who
text: bolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK. Claire gazes at the
text: LIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance.
text: Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water.
text: Claire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the dark
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Cooper...what do you see?
text: She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.
text: After a moment, she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly in
text: the reflection of her face. Cooper rumbles a low growl. The
text: shape seems to be gaining definition.
speaker_heading: RRRING!
text: Claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her
text: sweater and pulls out a cordless phone.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (V.O.)
dialog: (on the other end)
dialog: I'm stuck here for another couple of
dialog: hours.
text: Claire's smile fades.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Unless you need me to come home...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, no. It's fine.
text: Claire slowly leans out over the water to check her
dialog: reflection...
speaker_heading: NORMAN (V.O.)
dialog: You sure?
text: ...but the shape is gone.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Claire?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Huh? Absolutely. Take your time.
text: She clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.
scene_heading: INT. WORK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire sits in a small workroom at a computer. She focuses
text: intently on the screen.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: It's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE. She flips the last card and
text: an animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of
text: musical notes, parades across the screen.
speaker_heading: QUEEN OF HEARTS
dialog: (on computer)
dialog: You lost! Off with your head!
text: Claire hits "New Game" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber
text: solitaire is dealt. She suddenly has a thought and
text: disappears into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: She glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of
text: red wine. She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves
dialog: into:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: She dials a number. LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (straining to be heard)
dialog: Hello? I'm looking for Caitlin Spencer.
dialog: She's in 314...Well, could you check?
text: She plugs one ear.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh. Well, just tell her that her mother
dialog: called. Her mother. Thank you. Excuse
dialog: me, how can you study with that?
text: The noise abruptly stops. Claire clicks off the phone and
text: replaces it in the sweater pocket. She tunes the stereo to a
text: classical music station.
scene_heading: INT. WORK ROOM - NIGHT
text: She walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then
text: hears a different set of musical notes from the computer.
text: She stares at the screen, stunned.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: The game has been finished. Cards with faces swarm
text: chaotically across the screen with the message: YOU WIN!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh. Kay.
text: Without warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past
text: several stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish
dialog: rock and roll.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jesus...
text: She bolts around a corner to the stereo. The music is
text: chaotic and deafening. She finds Cooper growling at...no
text: one. She turns off the stereo. Cooper suddenly bolts down
text: the hall. She follows him.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - NIGHT
text: The foyer's empty, but the front door is open. Claire
text: nervously walks out and looks around.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Cooper!
speaker_heading: POV - THE GARDEN
text: No sign of the dog.
text: Claire turns to go back inside. When she touches the
text: doorknob, she hears the whispering again. A fleeting shadow
text: draws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly
dialog: into the study.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hello...?!
text: The whispering stops.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S LAB - NIGHT
text: Claire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRAD
text: STUDENTS. At school he's a very different man; pressed shirt
text: and tie, hair neatly brushed back. They're preforming some
text: unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness.
text: She stops by the door to watch him.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: ...and then what...Courtney?
text: An intense ASIAN GIRL answers.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: We administer the Halothane.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Dosage?
text: She glances at her notes.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Three point five cc's.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Excellent. Properties? Andrew from
dialog: downtown...
text: Andrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent,
dialog: which when administered in aerosol form
text: temporarily renders the subject immobile.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Nothing but net.
text: He measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an
text: apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Prudence here's an old friend.
text: He moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to
text: Courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus. The sheep
text: suddenly goes completely still. Norman moves around and
text: begins a brief procedure.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I try to stay on her good side because I
dialog: owe her my career and most of our grant
dialog: money. Why else?
text: He completes the procedure. They look at him blankly.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Always do unto others as you'd have
dialog: others do unto your ewe.
text: Groans, laughter. He stops Claire.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That'll do it. Write this up for Tuesday!
text: Andrew and Amy tend to Prudence, the rest leave. Claire
text: moves over to him. They kiss. Norman packs notes and some
text: of the chemicals into a LEATHER CASE.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (warm)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: There were some noises. I didn't want to
dialog: disturb you.
text: She watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led
text: out of the room.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What do you mean? Some noises where?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: In the house. I was scared.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Did you call the police?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you
dialog: back in the morning.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Of course.
text: He takes her arm.
scene_heading: INT. THE FOYER - NIGHT
text: Norman pushes open the front door. Cooper pads over, wagging
text: his tail. They walk together past the stereo into...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: ...the living room. All is quiet. They move into...
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: It's undisturbed. Norman checks the window locks.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It was there. This angry music all by
dialog: itself. And I heard whispering.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What kind of whispering?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know. Just...whispering.
text: He nods as Cooper appears.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What'd you see, Coop?
text: The dog stares blankly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to Cooper)
dialog: Tell him!
text: Norman smiles.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Norman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm gonna have the police check on the
dialog: house.
text: Claire leans against the window sill.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh great, "Can you look in on my wife,
dialog: she's hearing voices?" Wait'll that gets
dialog: around.
text: He walks over to her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I've got the conference next week. I want
dialog: you to feel safe.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how
dialog: was your day?
text: He goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box
text: in his dresser.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Think I may have cracked it.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Really?
text: She produces a match and lights it. They sit on the bed.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I think so. Maybe.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You are so brilliant.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman
dialog: Spencer...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You know what that does to me.
text: She takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: Ohmigod. You'll never believe...I saw
dialog: Schumway...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: He's here giving some arcane spiel for
dialog: the physics department, so Bob Shine
dialog: introduces us...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Wow.
text: He nods, Claire passes the joint back.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: And he says...you'll fucking love this,
dialog: he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great
dialog: admirer of your work..."
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well, that's nice.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: "...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Oh, no...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: "...of Perpetual Distances."
dialog: (beat)
text: Everybody's checking their shoelaces.
dialog: Pins drop. "I'm afraid you've mistaken
dialog: me," I say...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: That's...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: "...for my father."
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Didn't know he was dead, every stinking
text: paper on the globe.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's just mean.
dialog: (indicating joint)
dialog: Oh. Jody wanted to know if I could get
dialog: her some.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (quickly glancing over)
dialog: Did you tell her?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What? No. No.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You didn't?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Norman, you are so funny about that. No,
dialog: I didn't.
text: He takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Cause that would be really--
text: She lays back on the bed. Sounds of flushing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I didn't.
text: He reappears without the joint.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Sorry. You understand.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Did you call about the Feurs?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a
dialog: sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Huh.
text: Claire ponders this. Norman turns off the light and joins
text: her on the bed. He kisses her knee.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more.
text: Then starts working his way up her thigh.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: And speak up.
text: Claire smiles.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in
text: position. After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow
text: to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound.
text: Claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a
text: beautiful and melancholy piece of music. She's very, very
text: good. Eyes closed. Her body begins to sway slightly as her
text: left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck.
text: She reaches a difficult transition and falters. She seems
text: almost surprised. She attacks the transition again, and
text: again falters. Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet
text: again, this time failing completely.
text: She sits back in the chair, despondent. Almost as an
text: afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings. At the
text: end of the tone, something catches her ear. She can just
text: make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone.
text: She sits up and plays a different note, then another. Each
text: time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct. Finally
text: she plays a sharp, higher pitched note. The voice echoes
text: with a distinct, unsettling shriek.
speaker_heading: CRASH!
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - DUSK
text: Claire walks in and sees:
text: INSERT-- Lying on the floor...A FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH
text: OF NORMAN AND CLAIRE.
text: The caption announces that he's being promoted to the
text: "distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS." Through the
text: spiderwebbed glass, Norman can be seen shaking hands with an
text: older academic, hugging a smiling Claire to his side.
text: Claire kneels down to gather the picture. A single shard of
text: glass is missing. She finds it a foot away by a distinctive
text: knot in the wood floor.
text: She notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass, but when
text: she moves it, it's gone. She places the pieces of broken
text: glass on the frame and stands.
text: Out of the window directly in front of her sees: Mr. Feur,
text: removing a DIRT COVERED SHOVEL from his trunk. She glances
text: down at the picture, then back up at Mr. Feur, who carries
text: the shovel around back.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh no...
text: Claire wraps up the broken picture. She hears a car door
text: slam and glances out the window in time to see Mr. Feur
text: driving off.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - DAY
text: A stiff autumn breeze. Claire stands at the fence.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Mrs. Feur?
text: She looks through the tiny crack. Nothing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you there?
dialog: Silence.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FEUR'S - DAY
text: Claire glances down as she walks past THE FURROW. She looks
text: up at the house, which seems quite placid, then slowly heads
dialog: around back.
scene_heading: EXT. FEUR'S BACK PORCH - DAY
text: She takes in the lake view from the large porch. The wind is
text: really blowing. Her eye catches on something. Propped
text: against the back door...
scene_heading: THE SOIL COVERED SHOVEL
text: Claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it,
text: then knocks at the back door. There's no answer. She knocks
text: again. Nothing. She's turning to go, then the door swings
text: open. The smile fades from Claire's face.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: The immense MR. FEUR filling the doorway.
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Um...
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: I'm running late here. I just came back
dialog: for my briefcase.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Right. Well, I wanted to stop by to
dialog: welcome you to the uh, to the
dialog: neighborhood. I'm Claire Spencer. From
text: next door.
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: This really isn't a good time.
text: He starts to close the door.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well maybe your wife...
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: (growing cold)
dialog: She isn't here.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: When...when will she be back?
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh-kay...
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: I have to go.
text: Slam. And Claire is staring at a closed door.
speaker_heading: JODY (V.O.)
dialog: What do you mean she's gone?
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: Claire and Jody knife slowly through the water in the
text: Spencer's sailboat heading back toward the dock, the OLD
text: LIGHTHOUSE, the BRIDE in the background.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She's not there. I haven't seen her since
dialog: that morning. Well, I mean, I've never
dialog: actually seen her, but I'm telling you,
dialog: she's disappeared.
text: Jody finishes securing a line. The breeze is mild, so they
dialog: just cruise with the wind.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What are you saying?
text: Claire just looks at her.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You think he killed her?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know. When you say it, it sounds
dialog: crazy. But what else could it all be?
text: Jody shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I mean, he's so kind of grim and
dialog: daunting, and she sounded terrified of
dialog: something.
text: Claire glances over at Jody.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (laughing to herself)
dialog: Listen to me. I sound like some middle-
text: aged Nancy Drew.
text: Jody regards her. After a beat:
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Know what I think?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Seance.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody, no...
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Telling you...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...no...no...no...
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Please. That's all I need.
text: Jody shrugs, "Have it your way." Beat.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Hey, look.
text: CLAIRE'S HOUSE across the lake.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: So pretty.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: A FIGURE in the turreted window of Norman's study.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Someone's there.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: In the window. Norman's at work.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I don't...
text: Claire looks over at Jody.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: There. In the study. Don't you see--
text: She looks again-- nothing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Wow. I'm losing it.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: No, you're not.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But a presence in your house is not
dialog: something to be taken lightly.
text: Claire stares back at the house.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Claire walks in and sets down some packages. She opens one
text: and pulls out new toothpaste and...AN ENVELOPE-- the kind
text: your pictures come back in. She absently leafs through them,
text: then freezes. She gapes at one of the shots.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh boy...
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS - NIGHT
text: Claire turns off the lights and crouches down. She raises a
text: pair of BINOCULARS.
speaker_heading: POV - BINOCULARS
text: Claire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house...past
text: their car parked in front until she finds A LIGHT ON
speaker_heading: DOWNSTAIRS.
text: The tall, powerfully built Mr. Feur walks into the room and
text: sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for
text: one. He eats a TV dinner, slowly chewing and staring
text: straight ahead. He sips from a can of beer.
text: Just then...A HAND GRABS CLAIRE'S ARM. She lets out a
text: screech and turns to see Norman standing beside her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What are you doing?
text: She glances back out the window and sees Mr. Feur standing
text: at the window, paging the curtain. She squats down, pulling
text: Norman with her.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (shrill whisper)
dialog: Get down! He'll see.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (also whispers)
dialog: What's going on, Claire?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Shhhh.
text: She peers over the sill in time to see Mr. Feur turning away
text: from the window. She takes Norman by the hand and leads him
dialog: downstairs.
scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: She leads Norman in.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (still whispering)
dialog: Why am I...
dialog: (full voice)
dialog: Why am I whispering in my own house?
text: Claire turns.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He killed her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He did. She's in the picture. I went
text: over to look and she's gone. The table
dialog: was set for one.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: And that means he murdered his wife?
dialog: This is getting ridic--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, no, no, no. The soil on the shovel,
dialog: his shovel...that's clay. It's not from
dialog: here, believe me, I...
text: (frustrated, she grabs the
dialog: photos)
dialog: All right, look at this.
text: She triumphantly thrusts one before him. Norman looks at it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Our house.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. Look! In the window.
text: The ROSES. She points out a HAZY FIGURE in the TURRETED
text: WINDOW of the study. Norman takes it over to the light.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: It's a flare.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: A flare?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: From the sun. It's a reflection on the
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's her! I'm telling you. She whispered
text: and turned on the music. She's trying to
dialog: contact me!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (making sure he's got it)
dialog: It's a ghost.
text: Norman shakes his head. He looks again at the picture, does
text: a quick calculation.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You took this in the morning, didn't you?
text: She nods slightly.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: When the sun would be exactly right.
dialog: She's got him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Then why isn't it in any of the other
dialog: pictures?
text: She thrusts the batch at him. He peruses the other few shots
dialog: of the garden.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: A cloud passed. Or it's a bounce off the
dialog: lake. See?
text: She looks. He might not be wrong.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Where is she then?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: She could be out. She could be sick in
dialog: bed for all we know.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay. Okay. I'll bet there's...Look at
dialog: this.
text: She leads him out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. WORK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire stares at the computer screen triumphantly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What am I looking at?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (indicating completed solitaire
dialog: game)
dialog: I didn't do that.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Who did? Mrs. Feur?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Maybe. Point is...not me.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Right. And why is she here? If he killed
dialog: her, why doesn't she haunt him?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She was lonely, I talked to her. Norman,
dialog: I know how it looks, but--
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Claire, listen to me. I know you're under
dialog: some strain. But there's no such thing as
dialog: ghosts. They don't exist. Our neighbor
dialog: did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why
dialog: aren't you dressed?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Dressed?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: Dinner. With Stan and his new girl.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What do you mean? Claire, we talked about
dialog: it. You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our
dialog: first date since...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (she seems confused)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: ...since Caitlin. You don't remember
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Tonight?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yes, tonight. We're going to be--
text: She looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Fashionably five minutes late.
text: She bolts up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT
text: They drive across the bridge.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (concerned, exasperated)
dialog: When you do this, I swear...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...Don't get all...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: ...like it never even happened...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
text: He pulls out a cell phone and punches in a number.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Restaurant. Let them know we're running
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Five minutes?
text: The phone flashes..."NO SERVICE."
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're not at the center.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I know I'm not at the center of the
dialog: bridge.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We're going to be fine.
text: They near the far side of the bridge. Norman looks down at
text: the cell phone, which now reads, "ROAM." He presses a
dialog: button.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: There we go.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well, that's a relief.
text: He shoots her a look.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: A cozy, candlelit Italian place in town. Claire and Norman
text: arrive at the table. STAN rises. The chair next to him is
text: empty. He kisses her cheek.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hi Stan. Sorry we're late.
dialog: (too earnest)
dialog: It was my fault.
text: She greets Stan, a friendly looking man in his forties.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We just got here.
text: Claire flashes a semi-playful look back at Norman.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Where's the new squeeze?
text: A VOICE speaks out from behind her.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Here I am.
text: Claire turns to find A TALL, ELEGANT BRUNETTE standing behind
text: her. The woman's face registers some shock.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'd like you to meet...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Elena?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Ohmigod...
text: The two women embrace, then beam at each other.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: This is...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to Norman)
dialog: We know each other.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Hope so.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Post meal. Several empty wine bottle decorate the table.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: We had this Finnish conductor, Aki, Laki,
dialog: something. He had these ridiculous bangs.
text: And he'd sweep them off with his baton
dialog: every minute or so, and it drove us
dialog: insane, remember?
text: Claire nods.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: He looked like one of the Monkees.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Anyway, Claire slept with him...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I didn't sleep with him.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: ...just so she could cut them off.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He was so pissed.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I came in from my room...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (interjecting)
dialog: We were suite mates.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: And there's this brilliant conductor in
text: purple briefs with no bangs cursing his
dialog: ass off in Finnish.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh God...
text: They dissolve into giggles. Norman and Stan smile.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (to Stan)
dialog: I made an honest woman out of her.
text: Elena puts her hand on Claire's.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (to Stan)
dialog: You should have heard her play.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: We both auditioned for the Philharmonic.
text: One cello position open.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Do we have to?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I
text: stood in the hallway and listened to her
dialog: audition...and I cried.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She's making this up.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I'm not. Couldn't pick up my cello for
dialog: weeks.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What happened?
text: Elena looks at Claire, then smiles.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: She got it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Turned it down.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I met a dashing young grad student after a
dialog: recital one night...
text: Claire puts her arm around Norman.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...and three months later I was married.
text: He squeezes her hand.
scene_heading: INT. WORK ROOM - DAY
text: Claire walks into the work room with the portable phone to
text: her ear and a cup of Jody's special tea. She sniffs it and
text: makes a face as she turns on the computer. After several
text: rings a GIRL picks up on the other end.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Caitlin?
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Can you hang up? I'm trying to make a
dialog: call.
text: The line goes dead. Claire hits redial and gets...a BUSY
text: SIGNAL. She clicks the phone off as the computer boots up.
text: Claire puts the phone down and starts a game of Alice's
text: Solitaire. She turns a card and waits.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Gee, that's tricky. Sure could use some
dialog: help.
text: She waits, the cursor blinks benignly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Come on...
dialog: Nothing happens.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAY
text: She walks into the room and notices STEAM wafting from the
text: cracked bathroom door.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: Claire enters the steamy bathroom. The tub is nearly
text: overflowing with water. She squats down to drain the tub.
text: She stops, feeling watched, then slowly peers behind her...no
text: one's there. Claire reaches toward the water to yank the
text: plug's chain, then freezes. In the bathwater's still
dialog: reflection she see:
text: A PRETTY YOUNG BLOND standing beside her. Startled, she pops
text: up and slams into the SHOWER HEAD.
text: Claire collapses over the side of the tub, her head dipping
text: underwater. A small cloud of red surrounds her. Moments
text: later, an arm wraps around her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Blurry shapes.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Claire...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: CLAIRE'S POV - A FACE sharpens into focus hovering above
dialog: her...Norman.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Claire sits on the bed. Norman dabs the blood from a tiny
text: cut on the back of her head.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't need a shrink.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Harvey says he's amazing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Norman...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What can it hurt to talk to someone?
text: She goes to her dresser and gets a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and
text: starts to open it. Norman gently places a hand on her arm.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Please.
text: She shoots him a look...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You promised.
text: ...and puts the pills down.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Claire, she's been a huge part of your
dialog: life for seventeen years. If you weren't
text: thrown off balance by this, then
dialog: something would be wrong.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I never said I wasn't upset. Of course
dialog: I'm upset. I miss her terribly. But I
dialog: know what I saw and what I heard...and it
dialog: wasn't some "symptom" of something...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I never said...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...and I don't think I'm some lonely,
text: middle-aged woman cracking up.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Are you lonely?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No! And I don't need a psychiatrist!
scene_heading: INT. DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in
text: her lap, arms crossed.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON (O.S.)
dialog: (a smooth, mellifluous
dialog: baritone)
dialog: Who's idea was it?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Mine. His. We both...thought...
text: She trails off. Camera slowly pulls back to reveal, DR.
text: TIMOTHY DRAYTON, a stocky, light skinned black man in his
text: late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I didn't want to come.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Then why did you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Because he was worried about me.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Your husband?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full
dialog: of prozac so he can live out his life in
dialog: peace.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Do you really think so?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No.
text: There's a pause.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Why is he worried?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Because, I don't know, because
dialog: sometimes...sometimes I forget
dialog: things...and ever since Caitlin left,
dialog: ever since my daughter left for school,
dialog: there've been...I fainted and...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why is this so hard?
text: Dr. Drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red
text: FIREBALLS next to his chair. He proffers it to Claire.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Fireball?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're joking.
text: He shakes his head. She shrugs, then grabs one and pops it
text: into her mouth.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: It's hard because I'm a complete stranger
dialog: and what we're talking about is
dialog: incredibly personal. Besides, the first
dialog: time most people come here, a part of
dialog: them is wondering if I'm gonna think
dialog: they're crazy.
text: She sucks on the fireball and slowly nods.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Don't worry, I'm required to have at
dialog: least three sessions in order to commit.
text: Her eyes get a little wider.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Now that's a joke.
text: She manages an unsteady smile.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: I have some training at helping people
dialog: through the stressful moments in life,
dialog: one of which you may or may not be
dialog: experiencing. If you want to get some
dialog: stuff off your chest, great. If not...
text: He smiles and shrugs, "no problem." She stares at him for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (re: fireball)
dialog: These are good.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Mm-hmm.
text: She studies him for a moment.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: There's a ghost in my house.
text: He nods slightly, as if she's told him, "I have some
text: anxiety." Claire goes on.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She finished my solitaire game and turned
text: on the radio...she likes rock and roll.
text: Angry rock and roll.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: How do you know it's a she?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: I saw her in the water. Beside me. She
text: was filling the bathtub.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: What does she look like?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Pretty. She's a blond.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Do you have any idea who she is?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What do you think I should do?
text: He thinks for a moment, then:
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Try to contact her.
text: Claire nearly swallows her fireball.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Try to communicate with her somehow.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You think that'll help?
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Can't hurt. And I think it's important
dialog: you find out what she wants.
text: Claire ponders this for a moment, then looks back up at him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are you humoring me?
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Nope.
text: She seems satisfied by his sincerity.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: I don't know. My aunt used to use my
text: uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
text: He stands. Claire nods, then stands. She smiles too.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Is this time okay?
text: He nods.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire walks in carrying a half-empty bottle of wine. She
text: looks over at Jody, who turns off the lights. Jody then
text: strikes a match and lights a LARGE CANDLE. She unveils her
scene_heading: carved ANTIQUE OUIJA BOARD.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Sit down here.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (nervous, jokey)
dialog: Are we hoping the ghost is going to
dialog: have to pee?
text: Jody turns to her, deadly serious.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Isn't this where you saw her?
text: Claire's smile fades. She nods.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Then this is where she'll be.
text: They sit cross legged, the board between them.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Place your fingers on the planchette.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: The planchette?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: This.
text: Jody indicates the wooden pointing device. Each woman grasps
text: an edge.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: (in a low voice)
dialog: We wish to commune with the spirit of
dialog: Mrs. Feur.
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: What's her first name?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know.
text: Jody closes her eyes. Claire follows suit.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I call forth the entity that is haunting
dialog: this house.
text: They look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Mrs. Feur?
text: There's still no movement.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Nothing's happening.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Shhh.
text: Jody focuses intently.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Reveal yourself to us.
text: A long moment passes. It's starting to seem like a bust.
text: Suddenly, THE CANDLE FLARES. Even Jody seems startled.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: (to the spirit)
dialog: Who...who are you?
text: At first, nothing happens. Then, slowly, the planchette
text: starts to move across the board.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are you doing that?
text: Jody shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm not doing that.
text: The planchette comes to rest on the letter "M." Moments
text: later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on
dialog: "E."
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: M-E...
text: It starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space
text: between "E" and "F." The planchette stops on "F." Jody
text: removes her fingers from the device.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Mef? What's Mef?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: It's initials. F is Feur. It's her.
text: Suddenly, the CANDLE starts flickering strangely and THE
text: PLANCHETTE SLIDES JERKILY ON ITS OWN...M-E-F, M-E-F...
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Shit...
text: Jody stumbles backwards, gasping.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Did you see that?
text: Claire leans in.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to ghost)
dialog: What happened to you?
text: The CANDLE GOES OUT.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Oh God...
text: Jody bolts. Claire follows.
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Claire catches up to the completely spooked Jody outside the
text: work room. She holds onto her arm.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I have to go.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody, wait.
text: Cooper's growling in the work room. They look in.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Claire, this is...this is...
text: Claire, transfixed, walks in.
scene_heading: INT. WORK ROOM - NIGHT
text: She stares at the computer screen, which is being filled with
text: letters at an amazing speed.
text: MEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEFMEF...
text: She hears the front door swing open.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody!
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - NIGHT
text: Claire arrives at the open front door in time to see the
text: Karman-Ghia tearing out of the driveway. She turns and goes
text: back into the house.
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: She edges into...
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: The picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot. She
text: drops to her knees over the picture. This time THE GLASS IS
text: SHATTERED. When she picks out the remaining shards, the
text: newspaper photo slides out. Claire glances at the benign
text: news stories on the back.
text: She looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack
text: in the floor boards by the knot.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: The piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like A COPPER
text: COIN in the crack. It's too big to be a penny.
text: She tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but
text: recoils. A tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which
text: she pops into her mouth.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Still sucking on her finger, Claire walks in and begins to
text: clean up the remains of the seance. She bends down to pick
text: up the Ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub
text: is again full to the brink of overflowing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What do you want?!
text: Claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply.
text: There is only silence. She reaches in to pull the plug,
text: nearly scalding her hand. When she turns for a hand towel
text: she finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror:
dialog: "YOU KNOW"
text: She draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.
scene_heading: EXT. LAB BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Norman nods to a SECURITY GUARD as he leaves a darkened
text: university building. He sees Claire standing at the foot of
dialog: the steps.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What are you doing out here?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He killed her. I'm not crazy. He killed
dialog: her and--
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: This is the Feur thing?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes. And he's going to get away with it.
text: Norman's momentarily speechless.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: How do you know this?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We had a seance.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Who did?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody and I. And she was there, Norman,
dialog: she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: How did you--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody brought a Ouija board and we
dialog: summoned her.
text: He regards her for a moment.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Are you angry at me?
text: This stops Claire in her tracks.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What are you...? No.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You know what I've got at stake with this
dialog: paper. You know that. I can't help but
dialog: think that you're doing this now to hurt
dialog: me, or to sabotage me somehow.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sabotage?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Ever since the accident I've been
dialog: worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: The accident...?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: But then you've been so much better...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Norman, this isn't about you. This is
dialog: something that's happening to me. It's
dialog: not to get even...and it's not some
text: warped bid for attention. Some strange
dialog: things are happening in our house,
dialog: whether you believe in them or not...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Sweetheart--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in
dialog: what's happening. I don't want to, but I
dialog: do. I guess I was foolish enough to think
dialog: that would be enough for you.
text: She turns on a heel and walks toward her car.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT
text: Norman catches up to her as a LARGE CROWD is filing out of
text: the concert hall next door.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You're overreacting.
text: She turns on him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Don't tell me how to react!
text: Norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Keep your voice down.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I will NOT.
text: Some of the bystanders stop to watch.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (still loud)
dialog: Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm losing my
dialog: mind...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Claire, please...
text: Claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her
dialog: intensity.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...But what if I'm not? What if she died
text: in terror and betrayal and some part of
dialog: her can't move on while that's
dialog: unresolved. Can't you just...
text: Something behind him catches her eye. She trails off.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Wow...
text: Claire walks past him toward the parking lot.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Claire, please...
text: There's a dangerous energy to her walk. People step out of
dialog: the way.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Claire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's
text: after. MR. FEUR steps out from behind the open trunk of his
dialog: old Buick.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (walking up)
dialog: You!
text: He looks up at her.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You think you're smart, don't you? You
dialog: think you got away clean. Well, I know
dialog: you killed her. You drowned her in the
text: bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and
dialog: I'm gonna find her, you murdering
dialog: sonofabitch.
text: Mr. Feur stares, dazed, through the tirade. Norman arrives
text: at her side.
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: Give me that shit. Your wife.
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: I didn't kill my wife.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (to Mr. Feur)
dialog: I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (over Norman)
dialog: Then where is she?
text: He stares at both Spencers for a moment. Then calls past
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: MR. FEUR
dialog: Honey...
text: Claire and Norman turn. A BLOND WOMAN backs out of the
text: passenger seat. She turns. IT'S NOT THE FACE CLAIRE HAS
text: SEEN. Claire looks sucker punched.
scene_heading: INT. DR. DRAYTON'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Claire sits back in the chair. She looks drained. A soft
text: rain taps against the windows.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And his face...it seemed so gentle, and I
dialog: knew...in that second I knew that I'd
dialog: imagined the whole thing.
text: Dr. Drayton takes this in. She seems genuinely frightened.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What's happening to me?
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Well, that's what we're here for.
text: He watches her calmly, some empathy on his face.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Whether you imagined it or not, you
dialog: actually saw and heard things that
dialog: frightened you...that gave you reason for
dialog: concern.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes, but...
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Your friend saw them.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Isn't there something called group
dialog: hysteria?
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: You think you influenced her?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Maybe. I don't know. I just know that
dialog: when all this was happening, I felt, some
dialog: part of me felt...alive. Like somebody
dialog: needed me. And the more I reached out to,
dialog: it, the fuller it became.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: You're saying you willed these events to
dialog: happen?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know, I'm very confused right
dialog: now.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Did you ever find out what it wanted?
dialog: Claire remembers.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She said, "You know." That I know.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Guess.
text: Claire ponders this.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I felt...pain. That she'd been hurt by
dialog: someone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is great. I'm trying to intuit the
dialog: emotions of a figment of my--
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Have you been hurt?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Me? No. Well, in the accident I was
dialog: injured, but...
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: You were in an accident?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Last year. I drove my car up a tree.
dialog: Nothing serious, this...
dialog: (she indicates her scar)
dialog: ...a minor concussion. But the car looked
dialog: bad. It could have been bad. I think it
dialog: scared the hell out of Norman.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: How's your marriage?
text: Claire's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Listen, don't hold back.
text: Dr. Drayton smiles kindly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well, he's been amazing throughout this
dialog: whole thing. Patient and caring...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his
dialog: work, and...it's a very important time
dialog: right now with all that. But,
dialog: sometimes...I mean with everybody, right?
dialog: Sometimes it's like...
text: She trails off.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That he doesn't...see me, or, you know,
dialog: that I'm...that's something's wrong...with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: That can't feel good.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what
dialog: you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry,
dialog: but that's not it. My marriage is fine.
dialog: I've had some kind of "empty-nest"
dialog: episode where I saw some things that
dialog: weren't there. Let's deal with that. I'm
dialog: willing to deal with that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I just don't want to go conjuring
dialog: problems where none exist.
text: Claire finishes her tirade. Dr. Drayton lets her settle for
dialog: a moment.
speaker_heading: DR. DRAYTON
dialog: Fair enough. But you should know that I'm
dialog: far less concerned with whether things
dialog: you saw "existed," than I am with why you
dialog: saw them.
text: She takes in the ramifications of that.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - DAY
text: Claire's carrying some cuttings into the house. She hears a
text: knock at the gate, walks over and opens it to discover...Mrs.
dialog: Feur. The real one.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: I wanted to apologize.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: For scaring you like I did. When I
dialog: thought about what that must have seemed
dialog: like that day...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And then you weren't there.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: Right. I'm sorry.
text: There's an awkward pause.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Would you like some iced tea?
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: Very much.
text: Claire leads her toward the house.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - DAY
text: Claire pours Mrs. Feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher.
text: She's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: Your house is so beautiful.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: And these roses. They're much prettier
text: up close.
text: She regards Mrs. Feur for a moment. She seems skittish and
dialog: shy.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I...there's something I have to ask
dialog: you.
text: Mrs. Feur waits.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That day...at the fence. You seemed
dialog: terrified. I don't think I was imagining
dialog: that.
text: There's a pause. Mrs. Feur looks down into her lap.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Of what? What were you so afraid of?
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: You're going to think I'm crazy or
dialog: something.
text: A tiny smile.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Not this week.
text: She looks away for a moment, then looks back at Claire.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: Love.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: Have you ever felt so completely consumed
dialog: by a feeling for someone that you
dialog: couldn't breathe? That the time together
dialog: is so passionate and consuming that you
dialog: felt physical pain when they would leave?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Um...sure.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a
dialog: metaphor, that's...And I panicked. I
dialog: never dreamed anyone would hear me back
dialog: there...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's
dialog: in Boston. He brought my things up and
dialog: pleaded with me to come home.
text: Claire is mesmerized.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: You must think I'm pathetic.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. No, I don't.
speaker_heading: MRS. FEUR
dialog: I'm sorry that I frightened you like
dialog: that. But I was so touched by your
dialog: concern. I've been lonely here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Perhaps we could be friends.
text: Claire stares at this strange, passionate woman.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I would like that.
text: Mrs. Feur smiles at her.
scene_heading: INT. VOLVO - NIGHT
text: Claire pulls up in front of a large NEW YORK HOTEL.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (on a cell phone)
dialog: ...I'm pulling up, Yuri. I'll see you for
dialog: dinner.
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: Sure you won't stay?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, it's fine. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (tempting her)
dialog: Really big bed.
text: She smiles and shakes her head. Norman kisses her goodbye,
text: then grabs his bag from the backseat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Do I have everything?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Call ya later.
text: He starts to walk into the hotel.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (O.S.)
dialog: And you glad you married me?
text: He turns. She's standing next to the car.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are you glad? I'm glad.
text: Norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: You know I am.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Good.
text: (She gazes at him, then
dialog: softly)
dialog: You sat in front...I saw you there...
text: Norman takes his cue.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You were lost in the music...eyes
dialog: closed...your chest heaving...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I felt you...looking through me...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: We walked all night...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You told me that I was...
text: He gently cups her chin in his hand.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...that you were everything I'd ever
dialog: dreamed of.
text: She smiles, kisses him warmly, then gets in the car.
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - NIGHT
text: Claire stands outside Caitlin's Columbia dorm, watching young
dialog: lives in motion.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Claire walks past a number of doors. Music booms out of one,
text: shards of a conversation out of another. Finally, she
text: arrives at a door that says "Fur is murder." She smiles to
text: herself and knocks. There's no answer.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: She's out.
text: Claire turns to find an attractive YOUNG MAN standing at her
dialog: elbow.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
text: They're playing at CBGB's down on Bowery.
dialog: Probably won't be back for awhile. You
dialog: her mom?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes. Who was playing?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Bitch. Caitlin's band.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Caitlin's band?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Yeah. They're really good. I would have
dialog: gone, but I have a paper.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I'm not just saying that because
dialog: you're a mother.
text: Claire nods slightly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Thank you.
text: She walks down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. CBGB'S - NIGHT
text: Claire moves past a huge, BLACK SKINHEAD DOORMAN into an
text: entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club. She looks out
text: over the MOB OF SEETHING YOUNG PEOPLE, swaying to a pulsing
text: power-pop band. PUNKS and CLUB KIDS push past her as they
text: move into the throng. She looks up and her face changes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: A shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a
text: jangly, but surprisingly melodic song. Her eyes race across
text: the faces of a BUTCH FEMALE DRUMMER, an emaciated
text: GUITARIST/SINGER and stop on the BASS PLAYER...Caitlin. She
text: rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, EYES
text: CLOSED, SWAYING TO THE MUSIC.
text: Claire is transfixed, her face a mix of pride and sadness.
text: The song ends and Caitlin's eyes open. She smiles for a
text: moment, then the smile fades as she spots Claire. Panicked,
text: Claire ducks behind a pillar.
scene_heading: EXT. CBGB'S - NIGHT
text: The last groups of YOUNG PEOPLE file out of the club. A
text: couple of them glance at Claire, who seems very out of place
text: standing on the Bowery late at night.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Mom?
text: She turns to see Caitlin standing before her, a bass guitar
text: case on a strap over her shoulder. There's an awkward pause.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That was very good.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you.
dialog: But it never felt right.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why?
text: Caitlin stares at the ground.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: I didn't want to bring up memories. I
dialog: didn't want to do anything that might
dialog: make you regret your choices.
text: Claire winces silently.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Besides, Dad would have freaked.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, he wouldn't.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: I think playing in a band called "Bitch"
dialog: might put a dent in the whole "perfect
dialog: family" thing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Yes it is. Can we please not do that?
dialog: Please? Cause it is.
text: Claire doesn't disagree.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He loves you very much. He just--
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: I know he does.
text: Beat. Claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Are you mad at me?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Listen to me. The one thing in life that
dialog: I definitely don't regret...is the choice.
dialog: I made to be your mother.
text: They hug. For a moment, Claire's got her little girl back.
text: Her eyes well up.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I miss you.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: So much.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: It got so bad your father almost had to
dialog: put me away.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I started seeing things.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: A ghost?
text: Beat. Claire stares at her daughter.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: No. But once I heard...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
text: Someone crying. A girl.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I thought I was crazy.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Then we both are.
text: Caitlin nods.
scene_heading: INT. PRESIDENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: ...a large cocktail party. The house is crowded with
scene_heading: PROFESSORS, ADMINISTRATORS, and their SPOUSES. PRESIDENT
text: TEMPLETON, a frosty-haired, avuncular chap, greets them with
text: his WIFE, a sharp looking woman in her late fifties.
speaker_heading: TEMPLETON
dialog: There they are.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You remember my wife, Claire.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: (shaking hands)
dialog: Of course. You must be so proud.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I am.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: (to Norman)
text: Everyone's very anxious to shake hands
dialog: with our newest academic celebrity.
text: She takes their coats. Dean Templeton leads them in.
speaker_heading: TEMPLETON
dialog: Must've been some paper. Your father
dialog: would be very proud.
text: This seems to strike a nerve.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Claire notices this and squeezes his hand. Templeton leads
text: Norman into a large living room which is filled with
text: colleagues. Several of them turn and begin clapping. Others
dialog: follow suit.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO - NIGHT
text: Claire stands at a small bar.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: White wine please.
text: She scans the party and spots the Feurs deep in some intimate
text: conversation with each other. She's speaking about something
text: astonishing. He's rapt.
text: Claire locates Norman in a corner listening as some AGED
text: ALUMNUS holds forth. He sees her and mouths, "I'm sorry."
text: He points to his watch and flashes five fingers. She smiles
text: and nods.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Guess I'm not much of a medium.
text: She turns to see Jody.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody...
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I think so
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus,
dialog: Claire...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's alright.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I mess around with this stuff, but I
dialog: never thought anything would happen.
text: Claire looks uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Does Norman know?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody, she's alive.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her.
dialog: She's really sweet.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Then what was it?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Nothing. It wasn't anything. I've been
text: on edge lately. Maybe since the accident.
dialog: And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Something was there. You saw it.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Did I?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a
dialog: guy, this Pakistani guy down in
dialog: Hartford...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hartford?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: And he's the real thing. Specializes in
dialog: cases like this, like yours.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. Jody, listen to me. You have to
dialog: listen to me. This is not something that
dialog: I can do right now. Whatever it was,
dialog: it's gone. I need it to be gone now.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: But Claire--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Please.
text: Jody recognizes her fragility.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Okay. Okay.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call
dialog: you.
text: Jody nods as Claire walks off.
scene_heading: INT. POWDER ROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire stands in the spacious powder room, checking her
text: makeup in the mirror. Mrs. Templeton enters from the
dialog: bathroom.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: How're you holding up?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Just fine. It's a lovely party.
text: The two women fix their makeup side-by-side in the mirror.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: Norman was telling me the dream house is
dialog: finally finished.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Almost.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: Wonderful. It's good to see you two doing
dialog: so well.
text: Claire looks confused.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm sorry?
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: I know how hard it can be sometimes.
text: Claire turns to her.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Uh-huh. What can be?
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: Well, I don't think I've seen you since
text: the reception at Dean Ackerman's last
dialog: year.
text: Claire's still in the dark.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: For the Dupont Chair.
dialog: (off Claire's look)
dialog: I swear. I'm becoming the nosy old lady I
dialog: used to run from at Amherst.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. I'm just not sure what you mean.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: There was just...some tension. You were
dialog: upset. I remember being concerned.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: At the party.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: Toward the end. You remember?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (recovering)
dialog: Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you
dialog: know...We're fine.
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: Well, I'm glad. Pardon my intrusiveness,
dialog: but we do have to stick together you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Who's that?
scene_heading: MRS. TEMPLETON
dialog: The wives.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Right.
text: Mrs. Templeton leaves. Claire looks into the mirror.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (V.O.)
dialog: What was it about?
scene_heading: EXT. TEMPLETON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Claire and Norman walk toward the car.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You don't remember?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: When she said it, there was something
dialog: familiar...but no.
text: He looks at her for a moment.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You dropped a glass.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: A cheap wine glass from the caterers. You
dialog: started crying. I tried to comfort you...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (something's triggered)
text: In the living room...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You shoved me away and ran out to the
dialog: patio. I took you home.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But why? I can't understand how I could
dialog: just completely--
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It was maybe a week after the accident.
dialog: We were moving. It was a hard time.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But I don't remember.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What's wrong with me?
text: He stops, takes her shoulders gently.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: Nothing. Nothing at all. It's been a
dialog: hard year. But you're better now. And
dialog: things are really looking up for us. So
dialog: let's try to enjoy that.
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Please?
text: She thinks for a beat.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes. Yes. That's what I want.
text: She takes his hand and kisses it.
scene_heading: EXT. CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Claire walks up to the door. When she touches the knob she
text: hears...the WHISPERING. She opens the door and moves into:
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - DAY
text: The same intense whispered exchange. She glances into the
text: mirror and sees...SHAPES MOVING, BODIES, A FLASH OF SILVER.
text: She turns the corner and again...NO ONE'S THERE.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY
text: She walks in and stands before:
text: The repaired photograph of herself and Norman...at the party
text: for the DUPONT CHAIR.
text: She takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then
text: SMASHES IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK. She extricates the
text: picture from the broken glass. The caption reads:
dialog: "Dr. Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont
dialog: Chair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman."
text: She stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over
text: and scans the stories on the back. One tells of a hotly
text: contested city council race, another contains details of a
text: large alumni donation to the university.
text: She notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't
text: noticed before. It's only a small portion of one column, but
text: it seems to detail the search for A MISSING GIRL.
scene_heading: INT. WORK ROOM - DAY
text: Claire, online, logs onto a missing persons website. She
text: narrows her search to NEW ENGLAND. A screen pops up with a
text: list of names. She scrolls down the list until she
scene_heading: finds...FRANK, MADISON ELIZABETH.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: M-E-F...
text: Claire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a
text: blurry cyber photo fills the screen. Slowly, higher
text: resolution moves down the image.
dialog: IT'S THE GHOST.
text: Under the photo is the legend:
scene_heading: "DISAPPEARED - OCTOBER 22, 1998"
text: Claire stares at the familiar face, then shakily hits PRINT.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Claire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: ...she was practically a townie. Grew up
dialog: in Bradford.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And she was never found?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Nah. She was a live wire. Had this old
text: Mustang Fastback. It's gone too. Most of
text: her friends think she's tooling around
dialog: Mexico somewhere. Police downgraded her
text: to a runaway.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Thank you, Mr...
text: She glances at the byline on the back of the newspaper photo.
speaker_heading: INSERT
dialog: "by Neil McCann"
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...McCann.
text: She hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Norman is unpacking NOTES and CHEMICALS from his LEATHER BAG.
text: Claire walks in.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Remember this?
text: She places the printout on his desk. He takes a long look at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Is this that girl from last year?
text: Claire nods.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Did you know her?
text: Norman looks again.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I may have seen her on campus.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Not personally.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (solemnly)
dialog: It's her. This is the woman who I've
dialog: seen.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yes. The ghost.
text: Norman leaves the hung frame and walks over to a window.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's
dialog: not...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (quietly overlapping)
dialog: Stop...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...I'm positive this time...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...Please stop...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's Madison Fra--
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: STOP IT!
text: Claire falls silent, Norman turns from the window.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Claire, I've tried to be there. I know
dialog: you're going through something that I
dialog: can't understand...but it's enough.
text: Claire looks down.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Do you want to go see someone? Together?
dialog: Should we call Dr. Drayton?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Well then what? Claire, what? Tell me
dialog: what I can do.
text: Long pause. Claire looks up, then timidly holds out the
dialog: printout.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's her.
text: Norman's jaw tightens.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't want to make you angry. But she's
dialog: here. And I don't know why...
text: He silently walks out of the room. Claire stares down at the
text: face in the photo.
scene_heading: EXT. MADISON FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Claire parks in front of a small, clapboard house in a
text: neighborhood that is decidedly less upscale than her own.
text: She gets out and tentatively walks up to the tiny porch.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - DAY
text: Claire rings the bell. A DRAWN LOOKING WOMAN in her early
text: fifties answers the door.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Mrs. Frank?
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: You know where she is?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, I don't.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Please leave me alone.
text: She starts to close the door. Claire leans forward.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She's my friend.
text: The woman stops.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Was. We were...acquainted. I've been
dialog: away for awhile. When I came back...
text: She studies Claire.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Claire.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: She never mentioned you.
text: Claire doesn't know what to say to this.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Then again, she didn't say much about her
dialog: college friends.
text: She gives Claire the once over.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: I'm watchin' my shows.
text: She motions Claire in.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room. Mrs.
text: Frank serves up a mug of coffee. A soap plays silently on an
dialog: old 19" RCA.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Just plain old coffee. None of that mocha
dialog: nonsense.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's fine.
text: She sizes Claire up.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: You look a little old for a student.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm not. We...we met at a party.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Sounds about right. Never understood how
dialog: a girl that wild got all A's. Sure didn't
dialog: get it from me. They wanted to put her in
dialog: a special school for the gifted when she
dialog: was young. Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She never mentioned her father.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Well she wouldn't. He left when she was
dialog: twelve. Never spoke about him after that.
text: There's a silence. Mrs. Frank stares at the TV.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Don't need the sound. You can pretty much
dialog: tell what's happening by the faces. Turn
dialog: it up sometimes, though. Feels like
dialog: someone's here.
text: Claire doesn't know what to say. Mrs. Frank turns to her.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: It's like that. Doesn't seem real. No
dialog: note. Nothing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Cops say she'll be back. I just wanna
dialog: know what happened.
text: Claire stares at this tough, tragic woman.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Wanna see her room?
text: Claire nods.
scene_heading: INT. MADISON'S ROOM - DAY
text: Claire enters the room. Her face freezes.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: SEVERAL POSTERS FOR ALTERNATIVE AND METAL BANDS, side by side
text: with ACADEMIC PLAQUES AND AWARDS.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Full scholarships. Princeton too. She
dialog: wanted to stay close.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You must have been very proud.
text: She nods. Claire moves along looking at pictures. Some with
text: different men, others with rough looking friends. Claire
text: stops at a picture tucked into a mirror.
speaker_heading: INSERT
text: Madison singing at a recital of some kind. She's lovely,
text: with striking GREEN EYES. Around her neck is a distinctive
text: SILVER NECKLACE, with a perfectly wrought, SILVER ROSEBUD.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
text: Such a pretty voice. Surprised she didn't
dialog: major in music.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's the last picture.
text: A phone rings in the hallway.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: S'cuse me.
text: Claire's eye is pulled past the picture into the mirror, the
text: reflection of something pinned to the edge of a bulletin
text: board. She turns and moves over to:
text: A SHORT BLOND BRAID. She reaches out to touch it. Claire
text: hears footsteps. Mrs. Frank leans back into the room.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: They're calling me in to work.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I should be going anyway.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - DAY
text: Mrs. Frank walks Claire out.
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Of course.
text: Claire walks to her car. She turns and calls out:
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What was her major?
speaker_heading: MRS. FRANK
dialog: Biology. She wanted to be a doctor.
text: Claire stands, frozen, as Mrs. Frank disappears into the
dialog: little house.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire shuts the blinds, then places the large candle on the
text: floor, then places the MISSING GIRL PRINTOUT at the base of
text: the candle. On top if it, she places THE BRAID.
text: Then Claire lights the candle, puts the braid on the picture,
text: and hunches over it, whispering intensely:
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I need to know the truth.
text: She waits a beat. Nothing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Madison, please...help me.
text: Nothing happens. She looks around at the seance props.
text: She stands and places her hands on the sink. She glances at
text: herself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What am I doing?
text: Suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly. When
text: she looks back into the mirror, her eyes are a DEEP GREEN.
text: She hears the front door open downstairs.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Hello...Anybody home?!
text: A strange smile creeps across her face.
scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: POV - Gliding down the stairs and into...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The refrigerator door is open. Norman is leaning over. Only
text: his ass protrudes.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Norman closes the refrigerator door and sees Claire standing
text: before him, stripped down to a skirt and slip top. There's a
dialog: different physicality to her movements...a different rhythm
text: to her speech.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hello, Dr. Spencer.
text: Norman smiles.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Mrs. Spencer.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Forbidden fruit...
dialog: She takes the apple...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Got a problem with that...
text: ...then takes a ravenous bite and walks out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY
text: Norman finds Claire seated on his desk, her legs spread.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I take it your not mad at me.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Wouldn't go that far.
text: She grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the
text: apple to his mouth. Norman tentatively takes a bite. She
text: mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: Okay...
text: When he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs
text: down his chin. Claire leans forward and licks it off.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What's gotten into you?
text: She just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him. It
text: looks like she's eating his lips. Norman's getting hot. She
text: bites down on a lip.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It's too rough.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Since when?
text: Something about this response frightens him. Claire yanks
text: Norman's belt open. He steps back, tripping over his
text: castered desk chair. She's on top of him in a flash, sitting
text: astride him. She speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't like this, this...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: (pinning his hands above his
dialog: head)
dialog: Why don't you shut up and fuck me,
dialog: Professor.
text: She grinds up against him. Suddenly, something pulls her eye
text: to the hallway.
text: POV - The COAT RACK MIRROR, now from inside the study. In
text: it's reflection: ANOTHER CLAIRE, shorter hair, stunned
text: expression. Where she's standing...it's DAYTIME.
text: Claire leans over him until they're nose-to-nose.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (tense whisper)
dialog: I think she's starting to suspect
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (through clenched teeth)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (leaning down)
dialog: Your wife...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: STOP IT!
text: Norman shoves her off of him onto the floor. He stands,
text: breathless.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
text: In a moment, it's Claire again, stunned and trembling against
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to herself, remembering)
dialog: "You know..."
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (rattled)
dialog: What?
text: She looks up.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I was there.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Claire--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (flooding back to her)
dialog: I came to work in the garden and I saw
dialog: you with her...in my house.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Oh God...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I snuck back to my car, trying to
dialog: convince myself it never happened. And
dialog: when I woke up in the hospital...somehow
dialog: it hadn't. Until now.
text: He just stares at her, his face anguished.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: It was last year. We were having
dialog: troubles.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: So you fucked a student?!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (reaching for her)
dialog: That's not what I'm sayi--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (pulling back)
dialog: DON'T touch me. Just get away from me.
dialog: Go!
text: He's frozen.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I SAID GET OUT!
text: Norman doesn't move. He's never seen her like this.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Fine...
text: She bolts toward the living room. He follows her.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: She grabs her coat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (welling up)
dialog: Claire, please don't...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What did you think I would do? Jesus
dialog: Christ! I gave up my life and my music...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I never asked you to quit!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...Oh BULLSHIT. You had to topple perfect
dialog: Daddy and that meant perfect wife,
dialog: perfect family...
text: He follows her as she searches for her purse and keys.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: THAT'S NOT TRUE! You wanted to quit! And
dialog: then when you did, you hated me for it...
dialog: so you gave it all to her.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: To Caitlin!!
text: She wheels on him with fury.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Leave her out of this!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: And then out of nowhere, some bright
dialog: young woman found me attractive...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Stop...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: ...would do anything just to be around
dialog: me. And I slipped. God help me, I
dialog: slipped.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm not going to listen to this.
text: Claire goes to leave, Norman blocks her path.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I tried to break it off!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You should have tried harder.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Claire...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (seething)
dialog: Get out of my way.
text: She brushes past him.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - NIGHT
text: He catches up, beside himself.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: PLEASE DON'T GO!
text: Claire's nearly disarmed by this rare emotional outburst.
text: She turns at the door and looks back.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You made it impossible for me to be
dialog: someone you could be in love with.
text: She leaves.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Norman, rumpled and unshaven, is passed out on the couch, a
text: half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table. He
text: awakens to find Claire sitting across from him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I want you to answer one question.
text: He waits.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Did you have anything to do with her
dialog: disappearance?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yes.
text: Claire goes pale.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: She was damaged and unstable. The more I
dialog: tried to distance myself, the more
text: desperate she became. Finally, she showed
text: up at the new house...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How did she know where it was?
text: He stares off. The reality sinks in for Claire.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Our dream house.
text: Norman can hardly look at her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: She was out of control. She said she was
dialog: going to kill herself...or you. I never
dialog: thought she'd go through with any of it,
dialog: but then she was gone...
text: He trails off.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She did it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: We don't know that for sure.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Of course she did, Norman. What else
dialog: could it be?
text: The enormity of this hits Norman. His head drops into his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Oh God, what have I done? How could I
dialog: have let this into our lives?
text: He looks up at her, teary.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know.
text: She gets up and walks out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. JODY'S STUDIO - DAY
text: An old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished
text: oil paintings. Jody brings Claire some tea.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...and everything I have, everything I
dialog: thought my life was...Christ when I think
dialog: of all the lies...
text: Jody looks down.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Jody what?
text: Jody looks up, tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh God...you knew.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I was down in Adamant...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Adamant?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Artsy little village down seven. There's
dialog: a guy there who sells my work. I had just
dialog: dropped off some paintings and as I got
dialog: in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this
dialog: little cafe.
text: Claire waits for her to continue.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I started to walk over...but he wasn't
text: alone. A blond. I only caught a glimpse.
dialog: She was young.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I should have said something right away.
dialog: But I didn't.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Partly because I didn't want to hurt
dialog: you...but partly...partly because I was
dialog: relieved.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Relieved?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I had just been left by Richard. I was
dialog: bitter and miserable and for some fucked
dialog: up reason, it made me feel better that
dialog: your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
text: Claire nods.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: By the time I finally got up the nerve to
dialog: tell you, Stan called from the hospital
dialog: and it was too late.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of
dialog: Valium in your system?
text: Claire walks over to a window.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I got there first. Stan covered up the
dialog: pills and I had it out with Norman. He
dialog: seemed desperate not to lose you. He
dialog: promised to handle it. And we all let it
dialog: drop away.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: All of us.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I'm a terrible friend.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No.
text: Claire turns.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How could I expect you to tell me
dialog: something that I wouldn't even tell
dialog: myself?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: If she was dangerous before--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You don't know that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If it's your belief that gives her form,
dialog: then you've got to shut her out. Somehow
dialog: you have to break the connection.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. She wanted me to know the truth. Now
dialog: that I do...I think she's at peace.
text: Jody isn't as sure.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Claire walks in. She notices the clock on the range is dark.
text: She flips on a light. Nothing happens. Worried, she heads
dialog: upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Claire enters. The bed is empty. The shower is running in
dialog: the bathroom.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Norman?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
text: ANGLE - CLAIRE...her face a mask of terror.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh God...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: The BATHTUB, with the shower curtain drawn around it, the
text: water blasting. Norman's limp hand pokes through the
text: curtain. AN ELECTRIC CORD leads from the mirror socket into
dialog: the tub.
text: Claire races over and rips the plug from the wall. She tears
text: the SHOWER CURTAIN AWAY to find A BLUISH NORMAN lying,
text: unconscious in the tub.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, no. Please no...
text: She hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a
dialog: heartbeat.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Norman!! Wake up! Please!
text: Claire shakes him to no effect.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh God...NORMAN!
text: She slaps him on the face...once, then twice. He suddenly
text: sucks in a gulp of air, begins struggling and dazedly returns
dialog: to life.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's me...it's me...
text: Sobbing, she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to
text: pull him upright. She discovered HER BLOWDRYER in the tub
text: and hurls it across the room.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Claire sits beside Norman on the bed as two E.M.T.'s, an OLD
text: GUY and a HEAVY WOMAN pack up. Stan's on the phone, Jody off
text: to one side.
speaker_heading: HEAVY WOMAN
dialog: Vitals are good. I'd take it easy for a
dialog: couple of days.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Thanks.
text: The E.M.T.'s leave as Stan hangs up.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: They'll take you for a CAT scan tomorrow
dialog: if you're feeling dizzy at all.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That won't be necessary.
text: He glances at Claire as he walks Stan out.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Not unless there's a miracle drug for
dialog: clumsiness.
text: They leave.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Jody, she tried to kill him.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I can't believe this is happening.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: We need help. Please let me call the
dialog: medium.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That could take days. I need to do
dialog: something now. Don't you see? She wants
dialog: us dead.
text: Jody thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Alight, alright. Stay calm. You opened
dialog: this door. There's got to be a way that
dialog: you can close it.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just
dialog: making this up...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MADISON'S SMILING FACE
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DAY
text: Claire's staring down at the PRINTOUT. She's kneeling at the
text: edge of the dock. From her pocket she produces THE BLOND
text: BRAID and a piece of TWINE. She wraps the braid up in the
text: printout with a rock and secures it with the twine.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sorry. Better or worse, he's mine.
text: She tosses the little parcel into the dark water. Bubbles
text: stream up. In the bubbles, Claire sees...THE PALE SHAPE,
text: which slowly becomes THE DROWNED GIRL, staring up from
text: beneath the dark water.
text: Claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed. Madison
text: reaches up toward the surface. As the bubble diminish, she
text: seems to be FADING AWAY. When she's gone, Claire reaches out
text: toward the water. When her finger touches the surface...
text: WHOOSH! She's sucked down into the water.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM - DAY
text: Norman glances out of the window in time to see a splash off
text: the dock. He races out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
text: Claire struggles furiously as the unseen attacker drags her
text: deeper into the murky depths.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DAY
text: Norman sprints toward the dock.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
text: As he oxygen begins to run out, Claire screams desperately as
text: her hand plunges into the muddy bottom.
text: Suddenly, she's released. She yanks her hand free, the silt
text: swirls revealing...a COPPER COLORED GLINT in the mud.
text: NORMAN'S HAND grasps Claire's ankle and pulls her upwards.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - DAY
text: Norman helps Claire, coughing, onto the dock. They hold each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Are you okay?
text: She nods, catching her breath.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: We have to get out of here.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's alright.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: She's gone.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She can't be here without me.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: How can you be sure?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know, but I am. She was there and
dialog: then she was gone. I felt it.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Claire...
text: She stares into the still water.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: It's over.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire in bed with a blanket wrapped around her. Norman
text: walks in with some steaming mulled cider. He stokes the
text: blazing fire. He sits on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I know it's going to take awhile before
dialog: things are back...until they're better
dialog: than before. But you've given us a chance
dialog: to make a fresh start. And I'm going to
dialog: spend the rest of my life making you glad
dialog: that you did.
text: The gaze at each other. Tentatively, she places a hand on
dialog: his.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN - DAY
text: Claire, dressed in a warm sweater, finishes wrapping her
text: rosebushes for the winter. She picks up a basket of clipped
text: flowers and heads inside.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - DAY
text: She turns the doorknob and listens for the whispering. All
text: is quiet.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - DAY
text: She looks into the mirror and sees only the study and the
text: lake behind it.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY
text: Claire places the roses in a vase on Norman's desk, and in
text: doing so, accidentally knocks it over.
text: With a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the
text: wooden floor. The stream has flowed over to the knot and
text: dripped into the crack. Claire stares down at THE STRANGE
scene_heading: COPPER COIN.
text: She grabs a letter opener from Norman's desk and pries the
text: coin out. It's actually a SMALL BRASS KEY, the head of which
text: is THREE INTERLOCKING CIRCLES. She stares at it for a
text: moment, then places it in her pocket.
scene_heading: EXT. SAILBOAT - DUSK
text: Claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset. The leaves
text: on the surrounding hills are stunning. Norman appears beside
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Last sail of the year.
text: She gazes out.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: The leaves...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Incredible. We should take a drive before
dialog: they're gone. Spend the night at some
text: cozy little bed and breakfast.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Look for antiques...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yep. There's some great places nearby.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (a reflex)
dialog: Adamant.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Little village down seven. Supposed to be
dialog: charming.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Do you know it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Don't think so.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
text: He wraps an arm around her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Whatever you'd like.
text: She leans against him, staring out.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Jody and Claire return from a walk. Norman has the boat on
text: the trailer and is securing a tarp over it. They stop under
text: a tree.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Did he say that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Jody he was lying.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: What if he was? Do you think he wanted to
dialog: bring that up again just when you're
dialog: trying to make a new start?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: JODY
text: He's trying to put it behind him, Claire.
dialog: You should too.
text: Norman smiles and waves. They wave back as they arrive at
dialog: the Karman-Ghia.
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: You've got a beautiful life. And even
dialog: with this, it's always been clear that he
dialog: loves you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've come to think that's all that really
dialog: matters.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Trust me, Claire. You hear something...
dialog: change the subject. You find something...
dialog: get rid of it, throw it in the lake.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know what happened. The rest is only
dialog: details. And no one's ever glad they got
dialog: a hold of those. If you want to put this
dialog: back together...just let it go.
text: Jody drives off. Claire walks over to Norman. She hugs him
dialog: tightly.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm cooking you dinner.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You don't have to do that.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Fine. I'll do the shopping.
text: They kiss. She heads to the Volvo.
scene_heading: INT. VOLVO - DAY
text: Claire is approaching a country market. She spots a little
text: sign with an arrow:
text: ADAMANT - 11 mi.
text: She hesitates for a moment, then take the turn.
scene_heading: EXT. ADAMANT - DAY
text: Claire stands on a street in the quaint little village. She
text: looks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables. A
text: friendly old HIPPIE WOMAN walks out of a store. She watches
text: Claire gazing around.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE WOMAN
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't really know.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE WOMAN
dialog: Know what you mean.
text: She ambles off across the street. Claire watches her go.
text: Then notices a sign hung out above a little shop. THREE
text: INTERLOCKED CIRCLES. She walks toward it.
scene_heading: EXT. SHOP - DAY
text: Claire stands in front of the store window. A sign in the
text: window identifies it as "The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought
text: jewelry and gifts." Claire tries to open the door, but sees
text: a closed sign.
text: She steps back out to the window and looks in. On display
text: are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios.
text: Suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an
speaker_heading: intricate ROSEBUD.
text: Her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display
text: where she spots, a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST. Protruding
text: from its lock...THE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES. Claire looks like
text: she's been punched.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire glances over at the soundly sleeping Norman. She
text: gingerly slides out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Claire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album,
text: tracking the years of their life. Her hands tremble.
text: Finally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches
text: behind the photo and produces...THE KEY.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - NIGHT
text: Claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the
text: dock. An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path.
text: She stops and stares out at the moonlit lake.
text: She holds out a fist. Her fingers unfold and in her palm
text: lies THE KEY. She holds the key out over the water and
text: stands there, frozen. The lighthouse beam sweeps past her
dialog: once...then again.
text: Claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest,
text: then carefully places it on the dock. She very deliberately
text: takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the
text: dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps
text: off the dock.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: AN ANGUISHED CRY from downstairs. Norman bolts upright in
dialog: bed.
scene_heading: INT. NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit
text: room. He pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting
text: closed on his desk. He looks around, sees the room is empty
text: and walks over to it.
text: The mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is
dialog: engraved: To N.C.S. with love always, M.E.F.
text: He pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside.
text: THE LIGHTS SWITCH ON.
text: Claire stands in the doorway, holding out the SILVER ROSEBUD
speaker_heading: NECKLACE.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Looking for this?
text: Norman stares at her dumbly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She's out there isn't she? She's in the
dialog: lake.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Okay. Don't...you don't understand what
dialog: this is.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING
dialog: NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (nearly hysterical)
dialog: I did NOT! I did not kill anyone. Jesus.
dialog: Claire, listen to me. I walked in and she
dialog: was lying there dead. I swear to you. On
dialog: my life! She took pills and she killed
dialog: herself in our house to destroy me! To
dialog: destroy us! If I hadn't stopped by here
dialog: before school, the painters would have--
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: IT'S TRUE. That's...you have to believe
dialog: me! Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!
dialog: (beat, fighting tears)
dialog: I did what I had to, Claire. She was
dialog: gone. There was nothing I could do for
dialog: her. I did...I put her in the lake. I
text: rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I've lived with that image ever since.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I couldn't just stand there while
dialog: everything-- my career, us,
dialog: everything, just washed away. Don't you
dialog: see, Claire? She's doing this! This is
dialog: exactly what she wants you to think!
text: Claire's lip is quivering with confusion.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know what's true anymore.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But that girl must be brought up. Now do
dialog: you want to call the police? Or should I?
text: Norman stares at the phone. He's a wreck.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Fine. I can't live with it anymore.
text: He takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: This is Dr. Norman Spencer. No, it's not
dialog: an emergency.
text: He looks at Claire.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I have some information about a missing
dialog: girl, Madison Frank...Yes. Could you send
dialog: an officer? Fifteen Willoughby, about a
dialog: mile before the bridge...Thank you.
text: He hangs up. Long silence. They look at each other.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You did the right thing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm going to get cleaned up.
text: He walks out. Claire walks over and stands before the box.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire walks into the bedroom. The shower can be heard
text: through the bathroom door, which is partially ajar. Steam
text: drifts out through the crack.
text: She stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her
text: weary, distraught countenance in the mirror. She glances
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: The necklace still in her hand.
text: She looks up again into the mirror. Her face goes strangely
text: blank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto
text: her neck.
text: Suddenly, she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on the
text: bed for a long moment. She walks over, picks up the phone
text: and looks at it.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: The redial button.
text: She stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button. Two
dialog: rings, then:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Directory assistance...
text: Claire's eyes widen in terror. She clicks off the phone,
text: and, taking it with her, starts moving toward the door to the
text: hall. She keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom. She
text: quietly pulls open the hallway door.
text: Suddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.
text: Claire shoves Norman's hand away and runs past him down the
dialog: hall.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: She's nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to
text: falter. She tumbles over, dropping the phone, which clatters
text: down the stairs before her.
text: Claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
text: Norman can be seen calmly following her, waiting for the
text: Halothane to take its full effect. Finally, she freezes.
text: Norman picks up the phone and stands over her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: God, how did we come to this?
text: He picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her
text: slowly up the stairs.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The ghost stuff, that was impressive.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: Ceiling, shapes...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I figure you saw her that day in the
dialog: house and just gradually intuited the
dialog: whole damn thing. That would be pretty
text: astonishing. A passive-aggressive
dialog: masterpiece.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: And into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Wasn't until the shower that I realized
dialog: you actually believed it. Nearly froze to
dialog: death waiting for you. Thought the
dialog: circuit breaker would kick back over and
dialog: I'd be toast.
text: ...then she's lowered into the tub.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The crazy thing is...I have never for one
dialog: moment stopped loving you.
text: He actually wipes a tear from his eye. He kisses her lips.
text: We can feel her revulsion. His face over her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Don't worry about Caitlin. I'm sure in
dialog: some tragic way this'll bring us closer
dialog: together.
text: He turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line of
text: vision. Sound of a number being dialed.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, it's Norman. Listen, we had a huge
dialog: blowout, so I'm going down to sleep at
dialog: the lab. I guess you're out, but...
dialog: maybe...if you wouldn't mind stopping by
dialog: to check on her in the morning?
text: She glances down and sees on the edge of the tub...a
text: prescription bottle of VALIUM with her name on the label.
text: Her eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (O.S.)
dialog: It's just...Jody, it's bad. I've never
dialog: seen her like this...
text: (he trails off, choking up)
dialog: I don't really know what to do anymore.
text: Norman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light house
text: beacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: If anything ever happened to her, I'd...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anyway, thanks.
text: Claire, mute, glances frantically around. One of her fingers
text: begins to flutter.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (tearfully)
dialog: I'm so sorry.
text: The tub is rapidly filling. He checks his watch, then
text: reaches for the Valium. As much from will as the drug
text: beginning to fade, Claire lets out a garbled cry.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (sloppy, guttural)
dialog: Mmmuh...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Shhhh.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (slurry)
dialog: Mauduh...
text: Norman stops.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
speaker_heading: MADISON!
text: Norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief
dialog: in the ghost.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That's a little much, don't you think?
text: He sees the necklace on her neck.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Oops. Can't have that.
text: He puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around
text: Claire's neck to remove the necklace. When his hands close
text: on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.
speaker_heading: NORMAN'S POV
text: His arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE.
text: Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS
text: SHOWER NOZZLE. He staggers out of the bathroom before
text: collapsing with a thud. The water finally rises above
text: Claire's nostrils.
text: Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and
text: yank it free. The water slowly descends.
text: When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally
text: clears the descending water. She chokes in great gulps of
dialog: air.
text: The drug is finally wearing off. Claire sits up. Norman's
text: unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway. She
text: turns off the water and stands unsteadily.
text: She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little
text: antenna protruding from under Norman. She delicately pulls
text: the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's
text: been broken by his fall. She drops it and walks quietly out
dialog: of the room.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT
text: Claire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - NIGHT
text: She fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door, then looks
text: at the cell phone's recharging cradle. It's empty.
text: She spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles
text: through the pockets. She finds the phone, and flips it open
text: to see if it's working. A drop of something splats on the
text: phone. Then another. It's blood.
text: She looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring
text: down from the landing.
text: She reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in
text: her hand make it difficult to open. Norman hurls himself
text: over the banister. THUD!
text: A BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards. Claire slams into the
text: corner by the armoir. Norman advances on her. At the last
text: moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles
text: over on Norman.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
text: Claire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S
text: PICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.
text: She starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in
dialog: the bed...nobody there.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP - NIGHT
text: The truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over. She stares
text: at the door for signs of Norman.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Come on...come on...
text: ...and VROOM, the truck roars to life. Claire spews gravel
text: as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway,
text: constantly watching the door.
text: When she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks
text: into the rear view mirror. The boat momentarily blocks the
text: open door, then clears. Still nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
text: Claire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP - NIGHT
text: Shivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the
text: ancient heater. She turns onto THE BRIDGE.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: The PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Claire through the windshield. Her face striped by the
text: reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across
text: the windshield. She flips open the cell phone and punches in
text: 911. It blinks: "NO SERVICE."
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Shit.
text: She glances into the rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: A stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping
text: in the breeze.
text: Claire desperately punches the "talk" button again..."NO
text: SERVICE." She's past the center of the bridge. She looks
text: again: "ROAM." Claire punches the talk button again.
speaker_heading: SMASH!
text: A TRAILER CRANK punches through the window. Norman's arm
text: follows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim
text: visage pressed against the glass.
text: She squashes down the accelerator.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: The trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the
text: pickup. Claire chokes, then blacks out.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: The Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling
text: over bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP.
text: The truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled
text: through the rear window and into the passenger side
text: dashboard.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER
text: Claire is unconscious in the driver's seat, a trickle of
text: blood runs from her nose. Norman stirs briefly as Claire
text: groggily comes to. She hears the hissing of the smashed
text: radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the
text: floor of the cab.
text: She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and
text: realizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND
text: TRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into
dialog: the water.
text: Before she can get the door open, the truck is half
text: submerged. She frantically manages to lower her window
text: halfway and starts to pull herself out.
text: Her ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks
text: onto her ankle and yanks her inside. Norman pulls her down
text: until they're face to face.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Norman...NO...
text: She yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late...the
text: submerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp.
text: The truck is nearly submerged.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: Norman, please...
text: The water is up to the windows. Norman shakes his head
text: slowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Think of Caitlin...
text: Water sprays in through the hole in the rear window and
text: momentarily blinds Norman. Claire jerks free and scrambles
text: out of the driver's side window as the truck sinks.
text: Just as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop. She
text: looks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand
text: clamped onto her ankle.
text: There is a wrenching metallic creak. The truck lurches
text: downward...then silence. IT DOESN'T SINK. The boat buoys it
text: like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake.
text: The headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater
text: drop off. Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not
text: letting go.
text: Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer.
text: It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights
dialog: reveal...
scene_heading: MADISON'S SUBMERGED MUSTANG
speaker_heading: SMASH!
text: When the front of the pickup lands on the hood of the car,
text: the Mustang's windshield shatters. A PALE SHAPE FLOATS
speaker_heading: UPWARD.
text: Norman is suddenly entangled by something. He tries to brush
text: it free but comes face-to-face with MADISON'S GHASTLY,
text: DECOMPOSED FACE. The last of his air bellows out of him in a
text: scream as he releases Claire's ankle.
text: His dead staring face separates from Madison's as the truck
text: slowly tilts back and sinks to the bottom.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAWN
text: Claire breaks the surface with a huge intake of air.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER - DAWN
text: The sound of a furious cello solo.
scene_heading: COLD STARING EYES
text: Norman, half out of the truck, arms floating.
text: Follow his eyes to THE PALE CORPSE, drifting above, tethered
text: to the Mustang by an old seat belt around her ankle.
text: Move through the murky water toward the corpse's clothed
text: back. As she twists into view...
text: MORPHS INTO: MADISON'S PALE BEAUTIFUL FACE...at peace.
text: Camera drifts, moves upward and breaks the surface as the
text: distant lights of EMERGENCY VEHICLES approach.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: FINGERS
text: ...filled with moist earth. A hand tosses the clump of dirt
dialog: onto...
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
speaker_heading: A CASKET
text: Widen to reveal Claire, dressed in black, stepping away from
text: the grave. A tiny arm snakes around her waist. She glances
text: down to see Caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother
text: tightly. Claire takes a last look into the grave.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Rest in peace.
scene_heading: THE GRAVESTONE - MADISON ELIZABETH FRANK
text: Mother and daughter turn and step back. Next to them, also
text: in black, is MRS. FRANK.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: FINGERS
text: Racing across the neck of a cello. The solo continues and
text: now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped Claire
dialog: before.
scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL
scene_heading: INT. A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Claire, her hair short and sexy, eyes tightly shut, brow
text: beaded with sweat. The piece builds to a dark, passionate
text: crescendo.
text: Her eyes remain shut for a moment, then flutter open.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S POV
text: A New York apartment, the glimmering skyline visible through
text: a large window. Cooper gazes up attentively.
text: Claire sips a glass of wine, her face unsmiling, but serene.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
