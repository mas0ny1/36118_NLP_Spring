scene_heading: EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK
text: Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the
text: oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country --
text: a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy
text: clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.
text: CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a
text: fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting
text: from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and
text: louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.
text: CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a
text: man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is
text: upon us, flashing by with a roar.
text: Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the
text: embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the
text: thick underbrush alongside the tracks.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- BODY
text: It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS
text: AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the
text: train fades off until there is silence once more.
text: TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash.

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY
text: A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side
text: overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck --
text: tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.
text: One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.
text: She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite
dialog: activity -- eating.
text: Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS
text: CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining,
text: black and ugly in the sunlight.
text: REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.
text: The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun
text: shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight
text: into REGGIE's face.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks
text: at him sternly.
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: (in for trouble)
dialog: Oh, la.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Don't tell me you didn't know it was
dialog: loaded.
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Sylvie!
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early
text: thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join
scene_heading: REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Isn't there something constructive
dialog: he can do -- like start an avalanche?
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
speaker_heading: (to JEAN-LOUIS)
dialog: Va jouer, mon ange.
text: JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so
text: lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of
text: cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: When you start to eat like this
dialog: something is the matter.
text: No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as
text: REGGIE continues eating.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: Ça alors! From Charles?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: He's the only husband I've got. I
dialog: tried to make it work, I really have --
dialog: but --
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know how to explain it. I'm
dialog: just too miserable.
text: REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards
text: the devastated table before following.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: It is infuriating that your
dialog: unhappiness does not turn to fat!
scene_heading: INT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY
text: A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow-
text: covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows
text: beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their
text: conversation continuing.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: But why do you want a divorce?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Because I don't love him.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: But that is no reason to get a
dialog: divorce!
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY
text: An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-
text: worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear,
text: their conversation continuing.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: With a rich husband and this year's
dialog: clothes you will not find it difficult
dialog: to make some new friends.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (sitting)
dialog: I admit I moved to Paris because I
dialog: was tired of American Provincial,
dialog: 
dialog: but that doesn't mean I'm ready for
dialog: French Traditional. I loathe the
dialog: idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if
dialog: only Charles had been honest with me --
dialog: that's all I ask of anybody -- the
dialog: simple truth. But with him, everything
dialog: is secrecy and lies. He's hiding
dialog: something -- something frightening --
dialog: something terrible -- and evil.
text: She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over
text: her. She wheels, terrified.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK
text: A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the
text: face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this
text: particular mask stare down at REGGIE.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Does this belong to you?
text: CAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly
text: by the man in the mask.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Including REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too
text: terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA,
text: takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, forgive me.
speaker_heading: (indicating JEAN-LOUIS)
dialog: Is this yours?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
speaker_heading: (indicating SYLVIE)
dialog: It's hers. Where'd you find him,
dialog: robbing a bank?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: He was throwing snowballs at Baron
dialog: Rothschild.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: We don't know each other, do we?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Why, do you think we're going to?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't know -- how would I know?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm afraid I already know a great
text: many people. Until one of them dies
dialog: I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Yes, of course. But you will let me
dialog: know if anyone goes on the critical
dialog: list
dialog: (he starts off)
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Quitter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (turning)
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You give up awfully easy, don't you?
text: Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation
dialog: and rises.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a
dialog: walk. I have never seen a Rothschild
dialog: before.
text: SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy
text: squirts PETER with his pistol.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (drying)
dialog: Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (moving)
dialog: Sorry. Which view would you like?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: The one you're blocking. This is the
dialog: last chance I have -- I'm flying
dialog: back to Paris this afternoon. What's
dialog: your name?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Peter Joshua.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm Regina Lampert.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is there a Mr. Lampert?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Good for you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Please, not on my account.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No, you see, I don't really love
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, you're honest, anyway.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it --
dialog: dishonesty infuriates me. Like when
dialog: you go into a drugstore.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm not sure I --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well, you go in and you ask for some
dialog: toothpaste -- the small size -- and
dialog: the man brings you the large size.
dialog: You tell him you wanted the small
dialog: size but he says the large size is
dialog: the small size. I always thought the
dialog: large size was the largest size, but
dialog: he says that the family size, the
dialog: economy size and the giant size are
dialog: all larger than the large size --
dialog: that the large size is the smallest
dialog: size there is.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh. I guess.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes, but we're divorced.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: That wasn't a proposal -- I was just
dialog: curious.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is your husband with you?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me.
dialog: First it was separate rooms -- now
dialog: we're trying it with cities. What do
dialog: people call you -- Pete?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Mr. Joshua.
dialog: (turning to go)
dialog: Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Now you're angry.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I'm not -- I've got some packing
dialog: to do. I'm also going back to Paris
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who
dialog: said: "When strangers do meet they
dialog: should erelong see one another again"?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Shakespeare never said that.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's terrible -- you just made it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are
dialog: you going to call me?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you in the book?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Charles is.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Is there only one Charles Lampert?
speaker_heading: DELETED
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
text: Her face clouding.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Lord, I hope so.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENUE FOCH -- LAMPERT APARTMENT HOUSE -- DAY
text: The Arc de Triomphe at the far end of the Avenue. CAMERA
text: PANS to pick up a TAXI as it pulls up before the handsome
text: building. Inside are REGGIE, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- TAXI -- LAMPERT APARTMENT HOUSE
text: As REGGIE climbs out and the DRIVER begins unloading her
text: suitcases.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks.
text: (She turns toward the
dialog: house)
text: JEAN-LOUIS sticks his head out of the taxi window.
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: When you get your divorce will you
dialog: be going back to America?
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- THE TAXI
text: REGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: He knows everything.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
speaker_heading: (to JEAN-LOUIS)
dialog: Don't you want me to stay?
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: Yes, of course -- but if you went
dialog: back and wrote me a letter --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: -- you could have the stamps. I'll
dialog: get you some here, okay?
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: Okay.
text: REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver, who carries
text: her cases. She presses the button that electrically opens
text: the front door.
speaker_heading: DELETED
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY
text: As the elevator rises REGGIE gets out, followed by the driver.
text: He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (handing him a tip)
dialog: Merci.
text: The driver leaves. She goes to the door and presses the
text: minuterie, the button that turns on the time-light, and the
text: lights come on. Then she rings the doorbell. There is no
text: answer. She rings again. Still nothing. Sighing, she digs
text: out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. At this
text: moment the minuterie expires, plunging the scene into
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE
dialog: Wonderful.
text: She finds the button and the light goes on again. She inserts
text: the key and turns it.
scene_heading: INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- ENTRANCE HALL -- DAY
text: CLOSE SHOT -- DOOR as it opens and REGGIE steps into the
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT.
text: She stops, her expression changing.
speaker_heading: REVERSE SHOT
text: From REGGIE's p.o.v. as CAMERA PANS the entrance hall. It is
dialog: bare -- no furniture, no rug, no pictures, no nothing.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE
text: She stares for a moment, then goes back out into the landing.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY
text: As REGGIE steps back outside. She looks at the nameplate
text: beside the door.
speaker_heading: INSERT NAMEPLATE
text: It reads "MR. AND MRS. CHARLES LAMPERT."
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY
text: REGGIE looks at the plate in disbelief, then turns and hurries
text: back into the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DAY
text: As REGGIE hurries into the entrance hall.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Honorine -- !
dialog: No answer.
text: Now, CAMERA FOLLOWING, she goes into the Salon. It is also
text: empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's
text: original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still
text: in the wall.
text: She rushes now, going into the bedroom, CAMERA FOLLOWING
text: crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom,
text: too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and
text: throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain.
text: She pulls open the drawers -- nothing!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Charles -- !
text: She turns, and running now, goes through another door to the
text: library, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The rows of shelves are as empty
text: as the rest of the apartment. She begins to turn in a circle,
text: looking for something, anything. In a panic she turns and
text: runs out, colliding suddenly with a MAN whom she (and we)
text: have not noticed until the moment of impact.
text: REGGIE screams.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- INSPECTOR GRANDPIERRE
text: A heavy-set man of no particular age with tobacco-colored
text: hair, and thick glasses.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Madame Charles Lampert?
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Including REGGIE, in a state of near-shock.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre
dialog: of the Police Judiciaire. Would you
dialog: be so kind as to come with me, please?
scene_heading: INT. MORGUE -- DAY
text: We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too-
text: familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE -- OVERHEAD
text: Looking straight down at the tops of REGGIE's, GRANDPIERRE's
text: and an ATTENDANT's head and smack into the open drawer.
text: GRANDPIERRE lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and
text: reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.
text: He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then
text: moves to the other end to uncover the head. As the sheet
dialog: starts to lift:
speaker_heading: REVERSE SHOT
text: REGGIE as she looks down into the CAMERA. She closes her
text: eyes for a moment, then looks again.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Well, Madame -- ?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You are positive?
text: She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: You loved him?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm very cold.
text: GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT.
text: CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the
text: wall. BLACKNESS comes with a loud clang and continues while
text: the echo dies.
scene_heading: INT. GRANDPIERRE'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: CLOSE SHOT -- DESK DRAWER (FROM ABOVE) as it is pulled open.
text: A photograph of Charles Lampert lies face up in the drawer.
text: A hand reaches in and pulls it out.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Including GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE,
text: sitting across from him. The office is as bare as most
text: policemen's offices. GRANDPIERRE studies the photo.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: We discovered your husband's body
text: lying next to the tracks of the Paris-
dialog: Bourdeaux railroad line. He was
dialog: dressed only in his pajamas. Do you
dialog: know of any reason why he might have
dialog: wished to leave France?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Leave?
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Your husband possessed a ticket of
dialog: passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed
dialog: from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this
dialog: morning at seven.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: I'm very confused.
text: She starts to rummage through her bag. GRANDPIERRE shoves a
text: package of French cigarettes across the desk to her. But she
text: pulls a package of nuts out of her bag. She begins separating
text: the shells with her thumb nail and eating the nuts, depositing
text: the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an
dialog: instant.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: He was American?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Swiss.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Oh. Swiss. His profession?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: He didn't have one.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: He was a wealthy man?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know. I suppose so.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: About how wealthy would you say?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Where did he keep his money?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Besides yourself, who is his nearest
dialog: relation?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment
dialog: absurde!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: It is all right.
text: GRANDPIERRE sighs, puts down his pencil and pushes a button
text: on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it
text: into his mouth.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Is it all right?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I wish you wouldn't.
text: He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into
text: the drawer, closing it fiercely. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN sticks
text: his head in the door.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Les effets de Lampert.
text: The POLICEMAN leaves and closes the door.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: On Wednesday last your husband sold
text: the entire contents of the apartment
dialog: at public auction. Furniture,
dialog: clothing, kitchenware -- everything.
text: The gallery, in complying with his
dialog: wishes, paid him in cash. One million
dialog: two hundred and fifty thousand New
dialog: Francs. In dollars, a quarter of a
dialog: million. The authorities in Bordeaux
dialog: have searched his compartment on the
dialog: train. They have searched it
dialog: thoroughly. They did not find
dialog: $250,000, Madame.
text: He opens the desk drawer, puts the cigar back in his mouth
text: and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk-
text: top before he remembers REGGIE's request. He puts it back in
text: the drawer again. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters
text: again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits
text: on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into
dialog: the basket.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: These few things are all that was
text: found in the train compartment. There
dialog: was no other baggage. Your husband
dialog: must have been in a great hurry.
text: He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk,
text: identifying each item as he does.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: One wallet containing four thousand
dialog: francs -- one agenda --
dialog: (pausing, he opens
dialog: the notebook)
dialog: -- his last notation was made
dialog: yesterday -- Thursday --
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs-
dialog: Elysées"
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Why there?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Obviously.
dialog: (returning to the
dialog: items in the basket)
dialog: One ticket of passage to South America --
text: one letter, stamped but unsealed,
dialog: addressed to you --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (lighting up)
dialog: A letter? May I see it?
text: GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as
text: she reads it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "My dear Regina: I hope you are
dialog: enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be
dialog: so lovely this time of year. The
dialog: days pass very slowly and I hope to
dialog: see you soon. As always, Charles.
dialog: P.S. Your dentist called yesterday.
dialog: Your appointment has been changed."
text: (she looks up, puzzled)
dialog: Not very much, is it?
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: We took the liberty of calling your
dialog: dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we
dialog: would learn something.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Yes. Your appointment has been
dialog: changed.
text: (he smiles at his
dialog: little joke, then
dialog: returns to the basket)
dialog: One key to your apartment -- one
dialog: comb -- one fountain pen -- one
dialog: toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder
dialog: (he looks up)
dialog: -- that is all.
text: He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts
text: to put the things back into the basket while he speaks:
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: If you will sign this list you may
dialog: take the things with you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Is that all? Can I go now?
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: One more question. Is this your
dialog: husband's passport?
text: He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport
text: which he hands to her.
scene_heading: INSERT -- PASSPORT
text: The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it
text: to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in GRANDPIERRE's
text: photo. Under it is the name: "CHARLES LAMPERT."
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Of course it is.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: And this?
text: He hands her another passport.
scene_heading: INSERT -- SECOND PASSPORT
text: The cover is American. When it is opened, we see the identical
text: picture, but the name under it reads: "CHARLES VOSS."
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: And this? And this?
text: He hands her, one at a time, two more passports.
scene_heading: INSERT -- THIRD AND FOURTH PASSPORTS
text: One is Italian which, when opened, shows the same photo with
text: the name "CARLO FABRI." The other is Venezuelan, the same
text: photo, and the name "CARLOS MORENO."
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Have you nothing to say, Madame?
text: REGGIE looks down at the four passports, then back to
scene_heading: GRANDPIERRE.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (hopefully)
dialog: It's all right if you want to smoke
dialog: your cigar now.
scene_heading: INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DUSK
text: The house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late
text: afternoon light coming from outside. REGGIE stands by a
text: window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby.
text: Suddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING.
scene_heading: CLOSER SHOT -- REGGIE
text: As her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. There is a
text: moment of silence, then FOOTSTEPS are heard, coming closer.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As PETER enters.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted
dialog: to tell you how sorry I am -- and to
dialog: find out if there was anything I
dialog: could do.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: How did you find out?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's in all the afternoon papers.
dialog: I'm very sorry.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Thank you.
text: A silence.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I rang the bell but I don't think
dialog: it's working.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
text: He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and
text: flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more
dialog: times.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: They must have turned off the
dialog: electricity.
text: She shakes her head. PETER looks around.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where did everything go?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Charles sold it all -- at auction.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Do you know what you're going to do?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Try and get my old job back at UNESCO,
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm a simultaneous translator --
dialog: like Sylvie, only she's English to
dialog: French -- I'm French to English.
dialog: That's what I did before I married
dialog: Charles. The police probably think I
dialog: killed him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Instant divorce you mean?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Something like that. But I'm sorry
dialog: it ended like this -- tossed off a
text: train like a sack of third-class
dialog: mail.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (Taking her hand)
dialog: Come on. You can't stay here.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know where to go.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We'll find you a hotel.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady
dialog: of leisure anymore.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Something modest but clean -- and
dialog: near enough to UNESCO so you can
dialog: take a cab when it rains -- okay?
text: She nods. He picks up the airlines bag and they start out.
text: REGGIE stops at the door and looks back.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I loved this room -- but Charles
dialog: never saw it -- only what was in it.
dialog: All those exquisite things --
dialog: (looking around)

text: CLOSE SHOT of a phonograph. A hand appears, starts the record
text: on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning.
text: An instant later ORGAN MUSIC starts with a roar.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY
text: CLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a
text: bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open.
text: Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie
text: the remnants of Charles Lampert.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE
text: The INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his
text: hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing
text: row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large,
text: dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row,
text: REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they
text: are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at
text: the empty room. They speak in whispers.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It's not exactly what I'd call a
text: large turn-out.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: Didn't Charles have any friends?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.
speaker_heading: (indicating GRANDPIERRE)
dialog: If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't
dialog: even have him.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: At least he knows how to behave at
dialog: funerals.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE
text: His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands --
text: he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: Have you no idea who could have done
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Until two days ago all I really knew
dialog: about Charles was his name -- now it
dialog: turns out I didn't even know that.
text: The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of
text: daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR
text: The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the
text: bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes
text: the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in
text: his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard
text: bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE
text: As he watches GIDEON.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
text: As she watches him.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- THE BIER
text: GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at
text: LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid
text: succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle
text: from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.
text: He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to
text: sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to
dialog: sit somewhere else.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: Do you know him?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I've never seen him before.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: He must have known Charles pretty
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: How can you tell?
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
text: He's allergic to him.
text: SYLVIE turns and glances at GIDEON. Again, the sound of the
text: DOOR opening interrupts them. They turn to look.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR
text: Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against
text: the outside brightness. When he closes the door we can see
text: "TEX" PENTHOLLOW, a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair,
text: a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his
text: forties. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a
text: bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs
text: from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.
text: He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING
text: him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at
text: the others present.
scene_heading: TRAVELING SHOT -- TEX'S P.O.V.
text: MOVING down the aisle. GRANDPIERRE's face, then GIDEON's,
text: then REGGIE's and SYLVIE's -- all staring at CAMERA.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- THE BIER
text: As TEX arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying
text: on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the
text: coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his
text: lapel and throws it into the open box.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- TEX
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (heavy Texas accent)
dialog: Ariva durchy, Charlie.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: As TEX turns away from the coffin and approaches REGGIE and
text: SYLVIE, addressing the latter -- after having first reached
text: for his hat which he discovers he isn't wearing.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Miz Lampert, ma'am...
text: SYLVIE points to REGGIE. Unruffled, TEX starts over.
text: addressing REGGIE this time.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Miz Lampert, ma'am...
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Charlie had no call to handling it
dialog: this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't understa--
text: But TEX has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat.
text: When he spots GIDEON, the two men stare at each other.
text: Finally, TEX chooses a seat away from him and sits.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR
text: It flies open, this time with a bang, and the large MAN who
text: appears almost fills the frame.
scene_heading: CLOSER SHOT -- TEX
text: As the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid-snore.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- THE DOOR
text: Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight --
text: tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight
text: back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which
text: meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the
text: first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his
text: hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle.
text: Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops
text: before the coffin and stares into it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE
text: As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to
text: dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard
text: at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand
text: from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel,
text: picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down,
text: into the coffin.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND
text: The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly
text: but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's
text: hands. There is no reaction.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE
text: He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then
text: finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks
text: back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after
dialog: him.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
text: Having watched SCOBIE exit. Suddenly a hand falls on her
text: shoulder. She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of
dialog: fright.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Featuring a funeral ATTENDANT, a cadaverous type (aren't
text: they all) with a black cut-away coat and an over-solicitous,
text: unctuous manner. He is eternally bent at the waist, in a
text: sort of half bow. He offers REGGIE a letter which she takes.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Merci, Monsieur.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Pas du tout, madame, pardon -- pardon --
dialog: pardon.
text: He backs off and is gone. REGGIE looks at the letter, back
text: and front, then starts to open it.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: Who is it from?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: The American Embassy.
text: She pulls out the letter and starts to read it.
scene_heading: INSERT -- THE LETTER
text: It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message
dialog: reads:
dialog: "Dear Mrs. Lampert: Please drop by my office tomorrow at
dialog: noon-thirty. I am anxious to discuss the matter of your late
dialog: husband's death. Sincerely, (signed) H. Bartholomew."
scene_heading: TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE
text: SYLVIE has been reading over REGGIE's shoulder.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: What is it about?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know. But if this is a sample
dialog: of American diplomacy I'm buying a
dialog: fallout shelter.
scene_heading: EXT. THE AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY
text: The fine old building in the Rue Gabriel.
speaker_heading: DELETED
scene_heading: INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY
text: As REGGIE leaves the elevator two young DIPLOMATIC TYPES
text: step in, immersed in conversation.
speaker_heading: 1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE
dialog: I bluffed the Old Man out of the
text: last pot -- with a pair of deuces.
speaker_heading: 2ND DIPLOMATIC TYPE
dialog: What's so depressing about that?
speaker_heading: 1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE
dialog: If I can do it, what are the Russians
dialog: doing to him?
text: The elevator door closes on them. REGGIE reacts to this and
text: starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- DOOR
scene_heading: It is marked "307-A H. BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE checks the
text: letter, then opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY
text: The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk
text: is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for
text: somebody, notices that the door to the private office is
text: slightly ajar.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Hello -- ?
dialog: (there is no answer)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: (from the private
dialog: office)
dialog: Is there anything wrong, Miss
dialog: Tompkins?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here.
text: BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale
text: grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than
dialog: his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes
text: him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy
text: tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause
text: him to push them back in place every so often with a quick
dialog: automatic motion.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: I'm sorry -- my secretary must have
dialog: gone to lunch. You are -- ?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite
dialog: late.
text: He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do
dialog: so.
scene_heading: INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY
text: A small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three
text: kids on the desk. BARTHOLOMEW indicates a chair, then goes
text: behind his desk and sits. A can of lighter fluid stands open
text: on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert --
dialog: it's a stubborn little devil.
text: He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and
dialog: hankie.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Dry-cleaningwise, things are all
dialog: fouled up. I had a good man -- an
dialog: excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu,
dialog: but H.Q. asked us to use the plant
dialog: here in the building -- to ease the
text: gold outflow.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you
dialog: know who I am?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?
dialog: (going back to the
dialog: tie)
dialog: Last time I sent out a tie only the
dialog: spot came back.
text: He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his
dialog: tie.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Voilà! As they say.
text: He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the
text: hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket.
text: He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches
text: wrapped in waxpaper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of
text: mustard, a bottle of red wine and two Dixie cups.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Have some, please. I've got...
dialog: (checking)
dialog: ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken
dialog: and -- liverwurst.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No thanks.
text: He uncorks the wine, fills a cup and begins eating.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs.
dialog: Lampert?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't suppose it's an airline, is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You mean spies and things like that?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Only we call them agents.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: We? You mean you're --?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't
dialog: think that you people were supposed
dialog: to admit --
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert --
dialog: I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey --
dialog: trying to run a bureau of overworked
dialog: men with under-allocated funds.
dialog: Congress seems to think that all a
dialog: spy needs --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Agent.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Yes -- That all he needs is a code
text: book and a cyanide pill and he's in
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What's all this got to do with me,
dialog: Mr. Bartholomew?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: (his mouth full)
dialog: Your husband was wanted by the U. S.
dialog: government.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: May I have a sandwich, please?
text: He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: To be more specific, he was wanted
dialog: by this agency.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (eating)
dialog: So that was it.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Yes. We knew him, of course, by his
dialog: real name.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (almost choking)
dialog: His -- real -- ?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Voss -- Charles Voss. All right,
dialog: Mrs. Voss --
dialog: (taking a photo from
dialog: his desk)
dialog: -- I'd like you to look at this
dialog: photograph, please -- by the way,
dialog: you saw this one, didn't you?
dialog: (indicating the kids
dialog: on the desk)
dialog: Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Very sweet.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Aren't they? Now look at this one,
dialog: Mrs. Voss, and --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Stop calling me that! Lampert's the
dialog: name on the marriage license.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Yes -- and tell me if you recognize
dialog: anyone. Just a moment. Have a good
dialog: look.
text: He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which
text: he gives her.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- PHOTO
text: FOUR MEN, all in army uniform, sitting behind a table. The
text: glass is held over the first, magnifying the face.
scene_heading: CLOSER SHOT -- PHOTO
text: It's a photo of a young CHARLES LAMPERT.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: It's Charles!
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Very good.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: He looks so young -- when was this
dialog: taken?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: 1944. The next face, please.
text: The glass and CAMERA move to the next man -- a young TEX.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: It's the man who came to the funeral
dialog: yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a
text: tall man in a corduroy suit and string
dialog: tie.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Does the name Tex Penthollow mean
dialog: anything to you?
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Next, please.
text: The glass and CAMERA move to the third face -- a young GIDEON.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Yes -- and he was there, too -- a
dialog: little fatter now -- and less hair --
dialog: but it's the same one.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs.
dialog: Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: The last one, please.
text: The glass and CAMERA move to the fourth face -- a young
speaker_heading: SCOBIE.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: That's a face you don't forget -- he
dialog: was there too --
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Herman Scobie. And you've never seen
dialog: him before, either?
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: No, thank heaven.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: (a pause, regarding
dialog: her)
dialog: Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a
dialog: great deal of danger.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: You're Charles Voss's wife -- now
dialog: that he's dead you're their only
dialog: lead.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying
dialog: to frighten me you're doing a really
dialog: first-rate job!
dialog: (she takes another
dialog: sandwich)
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert --
dialog: it's your only chance.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Gladly, only I don't know what you
dialog: want! You haven't told me.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs.
dialog: Lampert -- the money. The $250,000
dialog: Charles Voss received from the
dialog: auction. Those three men want it,
dialog: too -- they want it very badly.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see
dialog: you try and convince them of that!
dialog: (drying his eyes)
dialog: Oh, dear.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Then whose is it? His or theirs?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Ours.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
text: (she looks at him for
dialog: a moment)
dialog: Oh, I see.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: And I'm afraid we want it back.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But I don't have it.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: That's impossible. You're the only
dialog: one who could have it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the
dialog: truth.
text: BARTHOLOMEW is silent for a moment, thinking.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: I believe you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Thanks very much.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Oh, you've got the money all right --
dialog: you just don't know you've got it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter
dialog: of a million dollars, believe me,
dialog: I'd know it.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've
dialog: got it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You mean it's just lying around
dialog: someplace -- all that cash?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Or a safe deposit key, a certified
dialog: check, a baggage claim -- you look
dialog: for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite
dialog: sure you'll find it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look
dialog: just as hard and as fast as you can.
dialog: You may not have a great deal of
dialog: time. Those men know you have it
dialog: just as surely as we do. You won't
dialog: be safe until the money's in our
dialog: hands. Is that clear?
text: REGGIE nods. He writes something on a pad of paper and tears
text: it off, handing it to her.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Here's where you're to call me --
dialog: day or night. It's a direct line to
dialog: both my office and my apartment.
dialog: Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and
dialog: please don't tell anyone about coming
dialog: to see me. It could prove fatal for
dialog: them as well as yourself.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Wait a minute -- you think those
dialog: three men killed Charles, don't you?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: We've no proof, of course, but we
dialog: rather think so, yes.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well, there you are! Charles had the
dialog: money with him -- so whoever killed
dialog: him has it -- they have it!
text: BARTHOLOMEW shakes his head.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: Because they're still here.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid
dialog: you're in a great deal of danger.
dialog: Remember what happened to Charles.

scene_heading: VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN

scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE
text: Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are

text: He stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin
text: dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional
text: smile as he speaks into a mike.
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good
dialog: evening ladies and gentlemen, guten
dialog: Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce
dialog: soir, comme tous les soirs,
dialog: l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep
dialog: Club, c'est vous! Venez, mesdames et
dialog: messieurs, step right up, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine
dialog: Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e
dialog: signori -- avanti!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER
text: At their table. REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What was all that?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Fun and games. Evidently we're the
dialog: floorshow.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You mean you and me?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No, everyone. Come on -- avanti,
dialog: avanti!
text: She rises and pulls him along.
speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE
text: Including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it,
text: laughing self-consciously and looking around.
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: Écoutez bien -- les règles sont tres
dialog: simples -- the rules are very easy --
dialog: deux équipes -- two teams -- each
dialog: with one orange -- une orange --
dialog: eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia --
text: held under the chin, like so --
dialog: (does it)
dialog: comme ça -- and passed to the player
dialog: behind you -- sans vous servir de
dialog: vos mains -- using nothing but the
dialog: chin -- no hands -- and keeping the
dialog: orange at all costs from touching
dialog: the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et
dialog: Messieurs -- begin, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen -- signore e signori,
dialog: comminciate!
text: The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons
text: to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man.
text: REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.
text: Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one
text: under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man
text: at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the
text: game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women
text: behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under
text: their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using
dialog: their hands.
dialog: (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's
text: partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against
text: the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly
text: enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next
text: in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest
dialog: miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of
dialog: human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-
dialog: ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the
dialog: orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can
text: only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide
text: from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on
text: the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve
text: it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity
dialog: which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even
dialog: new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be
dialog: a torment for total strangers and/or the English).
scene_heading: VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME
text: Some of the couples in various states of confusion,
dialog: entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally,
dialog: hilarious.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL
text: It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but
text: quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an
text: abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the
text: twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber
dialog: the game but increase his worldly experience.
text: The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to
text: move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success
text: difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange
text: starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after
dialog: it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
text: She is enjoying it thoroughly.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL
text: Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson,
text: PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilà, grips the orange
text: under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations
text: from members of his TEAM.
text: Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: En garde.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Lay on, MacDuff.
text: They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all
text: possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers
dialog: seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they
dialog: are too good despite themselves and the transfer is
text: accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.
text: REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin,
text: turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an
text: embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON,
text: the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in
text: BARTHOLOMEW's photo.
text: REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.
text: Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly
text: in REGGIE's ear.
scene_heading: CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON
text: Her eyes show her fright as he whispers:
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Mrs. Lampert --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Tell me what?
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert --
dialog: you do know that, don't you?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know anything.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you
dialog: could wake up dead.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Leave me alone -- !
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's
dialog: news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
speaker_heading: REGGIE (SHOUTING)
dialog: Stop it!
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE'S AND GIDEON'S FEET
text: As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON
text: He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he
text: merely closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well
text: as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Reggie -- what's the trouble?
text: REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance.
text: She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly,
text: under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him
dialog: for a moment.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
text: He -- he was stepping on my foot.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON
text: Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling
text: down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Forgive me -- it was quite
dialog: unintentional, I'm sure.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (starting off)
dialog: Wait for me -- I won't be long.
text: She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a
text: flight of stairs.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- PETER
text: Watching her go, a concerned look on his face.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT
text: A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's-
text: women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door.
text: The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes
text: down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light
text: and closing the door after her.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
text: REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops
text: it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one
text: given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on
text: it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (into 'phone)
dialog: Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie
dialog: Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew:
dialog: I've seen one of the
dialog: (she stops)
dialog: Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me?
text: She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her
text: coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me,
dialog: Regina Lam...
text: Suddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to
text: look, slamming the receiver down as she does.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
text: TEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo),
text: the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the
text: doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in
text: his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the
text: door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Howdy, Miz Lampert.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Wha -- what do you want?
text: TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No -- no, I'm don't.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd
dialog: better give it to me, Miz Lampert --
dialog: cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
text: He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the
text: burning match in his hand afterward.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know what --
text: TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the
text: booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What are you doing?
text: TEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She
dialog: beats this one out too.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Stop that!
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
text: He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with
text: it. She shrinks back.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: It could get a whole lot worse.
text: Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he
text: punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE
text: is too busy beating them out to do anything else.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an'
dialog: if you don't give it to me your life
dialog: ain't gonna be worth the paper it's
dialog: printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin',
dialog: Miz Lampert?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Please stop -- please!
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: You think on it real careful-like,
dialog: Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
text: As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You're insane, absolutely insane!
text: She looks up, then blinks her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. 'PHONE BOOTH OVER REGGIE'S SHOULDER
text: There is no one there. REGGIE rises and steps out of the
dialog: booth.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT
text: As REGGIE looks around. There is no one there.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH
text: As REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into
text: the slot. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back
text: into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her
text: mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her
dialog: eyes.
text: Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time
dialog: it is PETER.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What are you doing in here?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (a sigh of relief)
text: Having a nervous breakdown.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT
text: REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You haven't said a word since we
dialog: left the club -- what happened back
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to
dialog: tell you or not.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't think I follow you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: He said if I told anybody it could
dialog: prove fatal for them as well as me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who said?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: That's what I'm not supposed to say.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Stop this nonsense! If you're in
dialog: some sort of trouble I want to know
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I wasn't --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Yes, you were -- you called it
dialog: nonsense. Being murdered in cold
dialog: blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it
dialog: happens to you sometime.
text: She goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT
text: CLERK greets them sleepily.
speaker_heading: NIGHT CLERK
dialog: Bonsoir.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s'il vous
dialog: plait.
text: The NIGHT CLERK gets the key off a hook and hands it to
speaker_heading: REGGIE.
speaker_heading: NIGHT CLERK
dialog: Bonne nuit.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
speaker_heading: (to PETER)
dialog: Would you mind seeing me to the door?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Of course not.
text: They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
text: As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat
text: cramped, forcing them to stand close together.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: This is quite a place for making
dialog: friends, isn't it?
text: He presses the button and the elevator starts to rise.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You said this afternoon that your
dialog: husband was mixed up in something.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (busy examining the
text: cleft in his chin)
dialog: How do you shave in there?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What was what?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What your husband was mixed up in.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Look, I know it's asking you to
dialog: stretch your imagination, but can't
dialog: you pretend for a moment that I'm a
dialog: woman and that you're a --
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't you know I could already be
dialog: arrested for transporting a minor
dialog: above the first floor?
text: The elevator stops.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We're here.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: On the street where you live.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: How about once more around the park?
text: He reaches across her and opens the door.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Out.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT
text: As REGGIE leaves the elevator, followed by PETER. They walk
text: to her door. There is a moment of silence as she looks at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (imitating PETER)
dialog: Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a
dialog: nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it
dialog: is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one,
dialog: all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll
dialog: behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby,
dialog: I never make promises I can't keep.'
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How would you like a spanking?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: How would you like a punch in the
dialog: nose? Stop treating me like a child.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Then stop acting like one. If you're
dialog: really in some kind of trouble, I'd
dialog: like to hear about it. Otherwise,
dialog: it's late, I'm tired and I'm going
text: home to bed.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Do you know what's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Nothing. Good night.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Good night.
text: He turns and leaves. She smiles slightly, then turns and
text: puts the key into the door and opens it.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Featuring the door. REGGIE enters, then stops abruptly, the
text: doorknob still in her hand.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is
text: HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat.
text: He starts slowly advancing toward REGGIE.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Where is it, lady -- where've you
dialog: got it?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: I don't know -- I don't know! I don't --
text: She stops as she sees something.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND
text: Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself,
text: then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: I want it -- give it to me -- it's
dialog: mine!
text: The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly,
text: turns and flies out.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Peter -- ! Peter -- !
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT
text: As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal
text: hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and
text: splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified
text: with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding
dialog: claw.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: A man -- he tried to kill me!
text: Pulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the
text: outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using
text: all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go,
text: making sure to hold it that way as he steps in.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled
text: SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but
text: he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away,
text: sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over,
text: head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he
text: disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door
text: and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free.
text: He then rushes to the open window and climbs out.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT
text: REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly
text: looks into the room.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (entering cautiously)
dialog: Peter -- ?
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Peter! Where are you?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Showing the disarranged room, empty of people. Then, slowly
text: PETER's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily.
text: REGGIE rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Peter -- are you all right?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I think I sprained my pride.
dialog: (He looks around)
dialog: Where'd he go?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't
dialog: see him.
text: PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks
text: out. He then turns back.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Lock the door and the window -- and
dialog: don't let anyone in except me. I'll
dialog: be back in a minute.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Be careful, Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (one leg over the
dialog: sill)
dialog: You took the words right out of my
dialog: mouth.
text: He climbs out.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT
text: Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony,
text: consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between
text: it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears
text: and looks down over the railing.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL SIDEWALK (FROM ABOVE) -- NIGHT
text: SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it
dialog: is too far to jump.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY
text: He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on
text: one side, but there are two or three on the other.
text: PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one
text: hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- PETER'S HAND
text: As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short
dialog: of touching it.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- PETER
text: As he straightens up and prepares to jump.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT
text: From the GROUND. PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- PETER
text: As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony. He sees
text: a light coming through the window and looks in.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh!
text: PETER leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing
text: on his way to the next balcony. As he does, the following
dialog: exchange is heard (in British English).
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: What is it now, Pamela?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: It happened again, Henry -- another
text: strange man peered in the window at
dialog: me and then went away.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Bad luck, Pamela.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT
text: From the GROUND as PETER jumps to the next balcony.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- PETER
text: As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a
text: light coming from this window, too. PETER looks in.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- WINDOW -- OVER PETER'S SHOULDER
text: Inside the room are GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of
text: a heated discussion.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: That was a dumb move, Herman -- a
dialog: dumb move.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: And then some. If you'd only told us
dialog: you was goin' to her room we could've
dialog: kept 'em busy --
scene_heading: INT. GIDEON'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: -- but sneakin' in there on your own
dialog: that-a-way, why, man, you was bound
dialog: to get yore tokus kicked. I mean,
dialog: what'd you think he'd do -- walk up
dialog: 'n' shake you by that hand o' yores?
speaker_heading: PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: That's right, Herman -- you didn't
dialog: leave me much choice.
text: They all turn toward the window.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: As PETER climbs in through the window and joins them.
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (to SCOBIE)
dialog: I didn't hurt you, did I?
text: SCOBIE shakes his head and turns away.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Never mind that -- did you get the
dialog: money?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How could I with the three Marx
dialog: Brothers breathing down my neck? You
dialog: said you'd let me handle it alone --
dialog: ! The girl trusts me. If she's got
dialog: it, I'll find out about it. But you've
dialog: got to leave me alone.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
speaker_heading: (to GIDEON and TEX)
dialog: We took all the chances. The money
dialog: belongs to us, not him!
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman --
dialog: don't forget he done us a little ol'
dialog: favor.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Yeah? What's that?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: He took care of Charlie for us.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
speaker_heading: (to PETER)
dialog: We appreciate it, really we do.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: But who asked him? Three shares are
dialog: enough -- I'd say he's out!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A third of nothing is nothing, Herman.
dialog: Make up your minds -- she's waiting
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: I don't see how another twenty-four
dialog: hours could hurt.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Shoot no, not after all these years.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Then he gets it out of your share,
dialog: not mine! Not mine!
text: SCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it.
text: GIDEON begins sneezing, takes a bottle of pills from his
text: pocket and swallows two white tablets.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: I suggest you get about your business --
text: nothing soothes Herman like success.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: That's right -- it's like ticklin' a
text: alligator's belly.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who's got the room next to hers?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Me. How come?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Get another one, will you? I'm going
dialog: to need it.
text: PETER starts for the door.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: If you do find the money -- you won't
dialog: forget t' tell us about it, will
dialog: you, fella?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (turning at the door)
dialog: Don't worry.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Oh, I ain't worryin' -- but see this
dialog: pudgy little fella here?
speaker_heading: (indicating GIDEON)
dialog: He worries -- an' he's even meaner'n
dialog: I am.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As she waits anxiously, smoking a cigarette. There is a KNOCK
text: at the door.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: It's me. Peter.
text: REGGIE unlocks the door and opens it. PETER enters and she
text: closes the door again --
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There was no trace of him. All right,
dialog: Reggie -- suppose you tell me what
dialog: this is all about.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: There are three men -- he's one of
dialog: them -- they think I have something
dialog: that belongs to them.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: A quarter of a million dollars.
text: PETER is silent for a moment.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: That's all.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, it isn't -- where's the money?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know. Those men killed
dialog: Charles to get it. But he must not
dialog: have had it with him on the train.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So they think he left it with you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --
dialog: (tears welling)
dialog: And if I don't find it --
dialog: (wailing)
dialog: Those men going to kill me.
text: She falls in his arms to be comforted.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, they won't -- I won't let them.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: Please help me, Peter -- you're the
dialog: only one I can trust.

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Peter, you've got to promise me

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: the French Underground --
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Yes. The five men. They were, of
dialog: course, your husband, Charles, the
text: three men who showed up at his funeral
dialog: yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But
dialog: something went wrong and they were
text: unable to locate their contact. It
dialog: must have been at that point that
dialog: they decided to steal the money.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Steal it how?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: By burying it, and then reporting
dialog: that the Germans had captured it.
dialog: All they had to do was come back
dialog: after the war, dig it up and split
dialog: it five ways -- a quarter of a million
dialog: dollars with no questions asked.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (fascinated)
dialog: May I have a cigarette, please?
text: BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at
text: it and rips off the filter tip. He winces.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I hate these things -- it's like
text: drinking coffee through a veil.
text: She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches
text: and lights it.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Everything went smoothly enough until
dialog: after the gold was buried -- then,
dialog: before they could get out, they were
text: ambushed by a German patrol. A machine
text: gun separated Scobie from his right
dialog: hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full
text: in the stomach.
text: REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the
text: filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: What's wrong with that one?
text: He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically
text: brand-new in the ashtray.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened
dialog: then?
text: She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly
text: examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Have you any idea what these things
dialog: cost over here?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew --
dialog: what happened then?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Scobie was able to travel, but Carson
dialog: Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
text: The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: La soupe, c'est pour qui?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew.
text: The WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: Carson was dying so they were forced
text: to leave him. They finally got back
dialog: to the base, made their report, and
dialog: waited for the war to end. Only
dialog: Charles couldn't wait quite as long
text: as the others. He beat them back to
dialog: the gold, took everything for himself
dialog: and disappeared. It's taken Gideon,
dialog: Tex and Scobie all this time to catch
text: up with him again.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But if they stole all that money --
dialog: why can't you arrest them?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: We know what happened from the bits
dialog: and pieces we were able to paste
dialog: together -- but we still have no
dialog: proof.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But what has all this got to do with
dialog: the C.I.O.?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an
dialog: extension of the wartime O.S.S. It
dialog: was our money and we want it back.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but
dialog: nothing you've told me has changed
dialog: my mind. I still intend leaving Paris --
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.
dialog: You'd better consider what happened
dialog: to your husband when he tried to
dialog: leave. Those men won't be very far
dialog: away -- no matter where you go. In
dialog: fact, I don't even see any point in
dialog: your changing hotels. Please help
dialog: us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is
dialog: counting on you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well, if I'm going to die, I might
dialog: as well do it for my country.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: That's the spirit.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh, stop it. What do you want me to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: We're anxious to know who this man
dialog: is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Maybe he really is Dyle. He could
dialog: still be alive.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: No, Mrs. Lampert.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But no one actually saw him die.
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is
dialog: registered with the War Department
dialog: in Washington.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh. Then who's this one?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW
dialog: I don't know -- but I think you'd
dialog: better find out, don't you?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Me? Why me?
speaker_heading: BARTHOLOMEW

dialog: It's the only name I've got. How
dialog: about you?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: No cat and mouse -- you've got me.
dialog: What do you want to know?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Why you lied to me.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I had to -- for all I knew you could
dialog: have been in on the whole thing.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well, you know now, so please tell
dialog: me who you are.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
text: Carson Dyle is dead.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Yes, he is. He was my brother.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Your --
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: The army thinks he was killed in
dialog: action by the Germans, but I think
dialog: they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie --
dialog: and your husband -- because he
dialog: wouldn't go along with their scheme
dialog: to steal the gold. I think he
dialog: threatened to turn them in and they
dialog: killed him. I'm trying to prove it.
dialog: They think I'm working with them.
dialog: But I'm not, and that's the truth.
dialog: I'm on your side, Reggie -- please
dialog: believe that.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: How can I? You lied to me -- the way
dialog: Charles did -- and after promising
dialog: you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe
dialog: you, Peter... oh, but I can't call
dialog: you that anymore, can I? It will
dialog: take me a while to get used to your
dialog: new name -- which I don't even know
dialog: yet. What is it?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Aren't you going to tell me?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hello -- ?
text: She opens the door of the cabin and starts out.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- PHONE CABINS
text: As REGGIE steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the
text: others. They are all occupied except one and she looks inside
dialog: it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- EMPTY CABIN
text: The receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE
text: As she looks at it, confused.
scene_heading: INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- DAY
text: DYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator,
text: SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: If you do anything funny, or try to
dialog: talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle --
dialog: here and now. Okay?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: You'll wreck your raincoat.
text: The self-service elevator doors open, one or two PASSENGERS
text: come out and DYLE and SCOBIE enter. A young GIRL starts in
dialog: after them.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Next car, please.
text: He reaches out and presses the top button with his metal
text: hand. The doors close.
speaker_heading: DELETED
scene_heading: INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: As SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks
text: around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall.
text: He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door,
text: which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs,
text: leading up to a second floor.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Okay -- turn around.
text: DYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing
text: at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes
text: to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him.
text: Finding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE
text: removes it. During the following conversation he will shake
text: open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out
text: onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE.
text: Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Sit down.
text: Shrugging, DYLE sits on the third step.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
text: We wait -- with our mouths shut.
scene_heading: INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- NIGHT
text: The last EMPLOYEES leave the building as the WATCHMAN locks
text: the front door after them.
scene_heading: INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT
text: In the semi-darkness, DYLE is still sitting on the third
text: step, SCOBIE still facing him with a gun.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: How long do you intend -- ?
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: I said with the mouth shut.
text: DYLE yawns wide.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Okay -- up there.
text: DYLE gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by
text: SCOBIE. DYLE stops at the door.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Do I knock or something?
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Open it.
text: DYLE opens the door. The stairs continue up.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Keep going.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: The view had better be worth it.
scene_heading: EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
text: A spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights
text: beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of
text: roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into
text: a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely
text: separated oval-shaped dormer windows.
text: Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven
dialog: stories.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Very pretty. Now what?
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which
dialog: is more than you'd give me. Where's
dialog: the money?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Is that why you dragged me all the
dialog: way up here -- to ask me that? She
dialog: has it -- you know that.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: And I say maybe you both have it!
dialog: One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Supposing I did have it -- which I
dialog: don't -- do you really think I'd
dialog: hand it over?
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: You're out, Dyle -- right now!
text: SCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Step back.
text: DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a
text: sheer drop to the street.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Back where?
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: That's the idea.
text: Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand
text: with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.
text: Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the
text: jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around
text: DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.
text: Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and,
text: unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of
text: the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE
text: suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold
text: is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his
text: back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound
text: extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.
text: Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and
text: leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple
text: with one another, each trying to break free and reach for
dialog: the gun.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS
text: Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE
text: The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are
text: beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to
text: stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by
text: both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold
text: him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain,
text: continues to inch forward toward the gun.
text: Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining
text: him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his
text: momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof,
text: where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the
text: slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW
text: As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching
text: sound and causing sparks to fly.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE
text: As he slides over the edge and disappears.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- DYLE
text: As he watches, hypnotized.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- ROOF EDGE
text: There appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN
text: FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the
text: rain gutter at the very edge.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- DYLE
text: Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of
text: the level part of the roof.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Herman?
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE
text: As he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Yeah?
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- DYLE
text: He finds it hard to believe.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: How are you doing?
speaker_heading: SCOBIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: How do you think?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: If you get bored, try writing 'Love
dialog: thy neighbor' a hundred times on the
text: side of the building.
text: DYLE turns and leaves going down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT
text: The HOTEL MANAGER is busy taping a piece of cardboard over
text: the hole ripped in REGGIE's door by SCOBIE's metal hand the
text: night before. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own
text: door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE "takes" the look.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I didn't do it.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
text: The next time madame forgets her
dialog: key, there is another one at the
dialog: desk.
text: DYLE smiles, then enters his room.
scene_heading: INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: He closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat,
text: wincing.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: REGGIE, smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears DYLE moving
text: about in his room. She goes to the connecting door, unlocks
text: her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his
text: side and knocks.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Is that you?
scene_heading: INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: DYLE goes to the door, throws back the bolt and opens the
text: door. REGGIE enters.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Didn't anyone ever tell you it's
dialog: impolite to --
dialog: (seeing his injured
dialog: back)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I met a man with sharp nails.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Scobie?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I left him hanging around the American
dialog: Express.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Come on -- I've got something that
text: stings like crazy.
text: She leads him into her room.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As REGGIE and DYLE enter from his room. She leads him to the
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Take off your shirt and lie down.
text: As REGGIE goes to the bathroom, DYLE takes off his torn shirt,
text: revealing a torn and bloody T-shirt. He lies face downwards
text: on the bed. REGGIE returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape,
text: scissors, and disinfectant. She sits next to him and lifts
text: up his T-shirt to examine the wound.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (wincing)
dialog: Listen -- all I really want is an
dialog: estimate.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It's not so bad. You may not be able
dialog: to lie on your back for a few days --
dialog: but, then, you can lie from any
dialog: position, can't you?
text: She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning
text: the wound. He winces.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Does it hurt?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
text: She continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging
text: it while they talk.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Would you like to see my passport?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Your passport! What kind of a proof
dialog: is that?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Would you like to see where I was
dialog: tattooed?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Okay, I'll drive you around there
dialog: some day.
dialog: (his back stinging)
dialog: Ouch!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Ha ha. You could at least tell me
dialog: what your first name is these days.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Alexander.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Yes, but we're divorced.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I thought that was Peter Joshua.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I'm no easier to live with than he
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (finishing the bandage)
dialog: There -- you're a new man.
text: As they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes
text: into his own room. REGGIE remains on the bed, watching him
text: through the open door as he puts on a fresh T-shirt and shirt.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the
dialog: truth, but I had to find out your
dialog: part in all this.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Alex -- how can you tell if someone
dialog: is lying or not?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: You can't.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: There must be some way.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: There's an old riddle about two tribes
dialog: of Indians -- the Whitefeet always
dialog: tell the truth and the Blackfeet
dialog: always lie. So one day you meet an
dialog: Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful
dialog: Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He
dialog: tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot,
dialog: but which one is he?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Why couldn't you just look at his
dialog: feet?
speaker_heading: DYLE
text: Because he's wearing moccasins.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh. Well, then he's a truthful
dialog: Whitefoot, of course.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Why not a lying Blackfoot?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Which one are you?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (entering, smiling)
dialog: Whitefoot, of course.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Come here.
text: He goes to the bed.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Sit down.
text: He sits.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I hope it turns out you're a
dialog: Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very
text: happy hanging around the tepee.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Reggie -- listen to me --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly
dialog: talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm not fifteen.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Well, there's your trouble right
dialog: there -- you're too old for me.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Why can't you be serious?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: There, you said it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Said what?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Serious. When a man gets to be my
dialog: age that's the last word he ever
dialog: wants to hear. I don't want to be
dialog: serious -- and I especially don't
dialog: want you to be.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll
dialog: just sit around all day long being
dialog: frivolous -- how about that?
text: She starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (pulling back)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Cutting it out.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Who told you to do that?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: But I'm not through complaining yet.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (She starts kissing
dialog: him again)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I think I love you, Alex --
text: She kisses him on the mouth. The phone rings. He tries to
text: talk as she continues kissing him.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: The phone's ringing --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Whoever it is won't give up -- and
dialog: neither will I.
text: The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him.
text: Finally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the
text: phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths
text: and mumbles into it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Sorry -- I was just -- uh -- nibbling
dialog: on something.
scene_heading: INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: TEX speaks into the phone.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Miz Lampert, my buddies 'n me, we'd
dialog: oblige it mighty highly if you could
text: mosey on across the hall 'n chew the
dialog: fat with us for a spell.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: DYLE is watching her.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Can you give me one good reason why
dialog: I should?
scene_heading: INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout
dialog: seven or eight years old. Th' little
dialog: tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie --
dialog: ain't that cute?
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: She covers the phone and turns to DYLE in alarm.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: They've got Jean-Louis!
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: That sounds like their problem.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: I'll be right there.
scene_heading: INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: We'll be waitin' in room forty-seven,
dialog: Miz Lampert -- so you just wiggle on
dialog: over.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As REGGIE hangs up.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What day is it?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Tuesday.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie
dialog: works late Tuesday nights -- she
dialog: always leaves him with me. They
dialog: wouldn't do anything to a little
dialog: boy, would they?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I don't know -- it depends on whether
dialog: or not they've already eaten.
scene_heading: INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT -- JEAN-LOUIS. He looks around, uncertainly, first
text: one way, then the other. CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him sitting
text: on SCOBIE's knee, the large man holding him with his good
text: hand, the metal one in his pocket. TEX sits next to them
text: while GIDEON nervously paces the floor. When GIDEON begins
text: sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket
text: and downs one or two, swallowing some water.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Hey, Tex -- move the kid to the other
dialog: knee or something, will you? My leg's
dialog: going to sleep.
text: TEX lifts JEAN-LOUIS and puts him down on SCOBIE's other
dialog: knee.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Upsy-daisy.
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: Are you a real cowboy?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Sure am.
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: Then where is your gun?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (taking out his gun)
dialog: Right here -- see?
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Will you put that thing away!
text: A KNOCK at the door. GIDEON goes to open it. REGGIE and DYLE
text: enter. She sees JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Jean-Louis!
text: She snatches him off SCOBIE's lap.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Howdy, Miz Lampert.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
speaker_heading: (glaring at DYLE)
dialog: Who invited you?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing,
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'd better call Sylvie -- she must
dialog: be frantic.
text: She starts for the door with JEAN-LOUIS. GIDEON blocks her
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: I'm afraid that will have to wait,
dialog: Mrs. Lampert.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But his mother --
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: She isn't going to be anybody's mother
dialog: unless you answer some questions.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: This ain't no game,
dialog: Miz Lampert.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: We want that money -- now!
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (forcefully)
dialog: Be quiet, all of you!
text: The THREE MEN look at him, surprised by his tone.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: And stop threatening that boy. He
dialog: doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert
dialog: doesn't either.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Then who does?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I don't know, Herman -- maybe you
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (to TEX)
dialog: Or you --
speaker_heading: (to GIDEON)
dialog: Or you --
scene_heading: GIDEON, TEX &amp; SCOBIE
dialog: (together)
dialog: That's the most ridiculous -- !
dialog: You gone loco?
dialog: Listen to the man!
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Slowly. Suppose one of you found
dialog: Charles here in Paris, followed him,
text: cornered him on the train, threw him
text: out the window and took the money.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: That's a crock! If one of us did
dialog: that he wouldn't hang around here
dialog: waiting for the other two to wise
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: But he'd have to. If he left he'd be
dialog: admitting his guilt -- and the others
dialog: would know what happened. Whoever it
dialog: is has to wait here, pretending to
dialog: look for the money, waiting for the
dialog: rest of us to give up and go home.
dialog: That's when he'll be safe and not a
dialog: minute before.
text: A pause as the THREE MEN look at one another.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Up till now we always figured she
dialog: had the money -- but you know so
dialog: much about it, maybe you've got it.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Then what am I doing here? You didn't
dialog: know anything about me -- I'm the
dialog: only one who could have taken it and
dialog: kept right on going.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: He's just tryin' to throw us off!
dialog: They've got it, I tell you! Why don't
dialog: we search their rooms?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (exchanging looks
speaker_heading: with REGGIE)
dialog: It's all right with us --
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (rising)
dialog: What are we wastin' time for? Let's
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: And while we're waiting, we might as
dialog: well go through yours.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: Not my room!
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: What's wrong, Herman -- have you got
dialog: something to hide?
dialog: (a pause, then smiling)
dialog: Then I take it there are no
dialog: objections.
text: The THREE MEN look at one another unhappily.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: We'd better exchange keys. Here's
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: SCOBIE
dialog: I'll take that.
text: He takes DYLE's key and gives DYLE his. GIDEON goes to REGGIE,
text: takes her key and gives her his own.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Mine's in the door. Ariva durchy,
dialog: y'all.
text: The THREE MEN file out. DYLE and REGGIE exchange looks.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets
dialog: your vote?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (handing her the boy)
dialog: He's all yours. I'll do Tex and
dialog: Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you --
dialog: and make sure you bolt the door from
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to
dialog: have a treasure hunt.
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: (joining them)
dialog: Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will
dialog: I win a prize?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
speaker_heading: (to DYLE)
dialog: What should we give him?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: How about $25,000? Or do you think
dialog: it would spoil him?
text: She smiles, takes JEAN-LOUIS' hand and leaves. DYLE turns to
text: survey TEX's room.
text: He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and
text: the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the
text: desk and opens the drawers -- also empty. The bureau is next --
text: he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are
text: completely empty. Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens
text: it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare.
text: Then, CAMERA PANNING DOWN, he sees the only thing he's found
text: so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- AIRLINES BAG. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
text: GIDEON, staring down at it as it lies on the table in the
text: center of the room.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: (eyes on the bag)
dialog: Tex?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Including TEX, busy going through the bureau. He looks up,
text: then joins GIDEON.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: What's that?
text: GIDEON empties the contents of the bag on the table, then
text: starts examining the various items. He opens the wallet.
scene_heading: INSERT - WALLET
text: Inside, the initials "C.L." are printed in gold.
speaker_heading: TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Charlie's stuff?
speaker_heading: GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Looks like it.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- TEX &amp; GIDEON
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Mebbe we'd better call Herman.
text: GIDEON has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter,
text: removing it from the envelope and reading it.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: What for? If it's not here, why bother
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: And if it is?
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Why bother him?
text: A broad grin from TEX. They continue going through the items

speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: There sure ain't nothin' here worth

speaker_heading: GIDEON

speaker_heading: TEX

dialog: You think that mebbe we're fishin'

speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Meaning what?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: You don't s'pose one o' us has it,
dialog: like the man said -- I mean, that'd
dialog: be pretty distasteful -- us bein'

speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: (very sincerely)

speaker_heading: TEX

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: -- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly.
dialog: Just hurry up and get here.
text: She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Come on, now -- if you wanted to
dialog: hide something, where would you put
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: I know. I would bury it in the garden.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Swell -- only this man doesn't have

speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (Afterthought)
dialog: Neither do I.
dialog: (Seeing something)
dialog: Voilà!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Voilà what?
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Up there! I would put it up there!
text: REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top
text: of the high armoire.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You know something, cookie? Why not?
text: Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands
text: on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything,
text: by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand
text: over the top and grope around blindly.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I hope I don't find any little hairy
dialog: things living up here -- wait! There
dialog: is something! If I can just -- yes,
dialog: I'm getting it -- a case of some
dialog: sort -- it's heavy.
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: (jumping up and down)
dialog: I found it! I found it!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: If you think you're getting credit
dialog: for this, you're crazy.
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: (ecstatic)
dialog: We won! We won!
text: REGGIE has finally managed to pull down the case -- a
text: rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone
text: case. As he climbs off the chair, JEAN-LOUIS suddenly runs
text: to the door, unbolts it and runs into the hall, CAMERA PANNING
dialog: with him.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - THIRD LANDING - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: We found it! We found it!
text: DYLE is the first one to appear, coming out of GIDEON's room.
text: TEX has also appeared from REGGIE's room, followed by GIDEON.
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: We found it!
text: The THREE MEN rush by JEAN-LOUIS and squeeze simultaneously
text: into SCOBIE's room.
scene_heading: INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As DYLE, TEX and GIDEON enter, REGGIE is placing the little
text: straight black chair to its original position. There is no
text: sign of the black case.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: What do you mean, no?
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: The kid said --
speaker_heading: JEAN-LOUIS
dialog: (pointing atop the
dialog: armoire)
dialog: Up there! It is up there!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No, Jean-Louis.
text: TEX grabs the chair and moves it to the armoire, climbing up
text: on it and grabbing the bag.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It's nothing, I tell you!
text: He brings it to the table as DYLE and GIDEON crowd around
text: him, anxious to see.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOTS (PANNING)
text: The ring of faces, one at a time. TEX, his jaw muscles working
text: feverishly; DYLE, his eyes unblinking, a slight smile on his
text: lips; GIDEON, his mouth open greedily.
speaker_heading: GROUP SHOT
text: As TEX finally springs the latches and opens the lid.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- CASE

dialog: Jumpin' frejoles -- it's Herman's

speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE

speaker_heading: REGGIE

dialog: What is the matter?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT
scene_heading: DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON, followed by REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS

scene_heading: INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: DYLE, TEX and GIDEON stand in the center of the room, looking
text: around. REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS wait in the open doorway. The
text: room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no
text: sign of SCOBIE. The sound of running water can be heard coming
text: from behind the closed door to the bathroom and DYLE is the
text: first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under
text: the door.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Reggie -- you and the boy better
dialog: wait here.
scene_heading: INT. BATH -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: GIDEON

speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (considering the
dialog: situation)
dialog: The police aren't going to like this

speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: (helpful)
dialog: We could dry him off and take him
text: down the hall to his own room.
dialog: (looking at the body)
text: He really doesn't look so bad.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: We could put him to bed 'n let one
dialog: o' them fem-de-chambers find him in
dialog: the mornin'.
text: DYLE and GIDEON look at one another.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Poor ol' Herman -- him 'n good luck

scene_heading: INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- DAY

speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE

speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: A man drowned in his bed --
dialog: impossible! And in his pajamas --
dialog: the second one in his pajamas --
dialog: c'est trop bête! Stop lying to me --
dialog: (Tapping the side of
dialog: his nose)
dialog: this nose tells me when you are lying --
dialog: it is never mistaken, not in twenty-
dialog: three years -- this nose will make
dialog: me commissaire of police.
dialog: (Tapping his fingers
dialog: on his desk)
dialog: Mr. Dyle or Mr. Joshua -- which is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Dyle.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: And yet you registered in Megeve as
dialog: Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against
dialog: the law to register under an assumed
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: No, I didn't.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It's done in America all the time.
text: GRANDPIERRE raps for silence on his desk. During the pause,
text: he looks into each face in turn.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: None of you will be permitted to
dialog: leave Paris -- until this matter is
dialog: cleared up. Only I warn you -- I
dialog: will be watching. We use the
dialog: guillotine in this country -- I have
dialog: always suspected that the blade coming
dialog: down causes no more than a slight

scene_heading: EXT. QUAI MONTEBELLO -- LATE AFTERNOON (TRAVELING)
text: REGGIE and DYLE walking along the quai, next to the Seine,

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Or Tex?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You're a big help. Can I have one of
dialog: those?
text: They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the
text: Pont au Double. DYLE shrugs.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
speaker_heading: (to the VENDOR)
dialog: Vanille-chocolat.
text: During the following, the VENDOR makes a double-decker cone
text: and hands it to REGGIE. DYLE pays and they resume their walk --
text: all with no break in the dialogue.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I think Tex did it.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Because I really suspect Gideon --
dialog: and it is always the person you don't
dialog: suspect.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Do women think it's feminine to be
dialog: so illogical -- or can't they help
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What's so illogical about that?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: A) It's always the person you don't
dialog: suspect; B) that means you think
dialog: it's Tex because you really suspect
dialog: Gideon; therefore C) if you think
dialog: it's Tex, it has to be someone else --
dialog: Gideon.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Women. You know, I can't help feeling
dialog: rather sorry for Scobie.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: Wouldn't it be nice if we were like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: What -- like Scobie?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way
dialog: he danced down there next to the
dialog: river in 'American in Paris' --
dialog: without a care in the world? This is
dialog: good, want some?
text: She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough
text: force to dislodge the ice-cream. It lands right next to his
text: lapel, over his outside breast pocket.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: I'd love some, thanks.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks
text: inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees. REGGIE
text: still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it.
text: Seeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: No sense messing up the streets.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Alex --
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm scared.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Don't worry, I'm not going to hit
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't
dialog: think of any reason why he was killed.
text: They resume walking.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Maybe somebody felt that four shares
dialog: were too many --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What makes you think that this
dialog: somebody will be satisfied with three?
dialog: He wants it all, Alex -- that means
dialog: we're in his way, too.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Yes, I know.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: First your brother, then Charles,
dialog: now Scobie -- we've got to do
dialog: something! Any minute now we could
dialog: be assassinated! Would you do anything
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: What? Assassinate somebody?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No --

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Got you.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Did you ever hear the story of the

speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (warning)
text: Reggie -- open the door.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: This is a ludicrous situation. There

speaker_heading: DYLE

speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (has she gone too
dialog: far?)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Have you ever heard of anyone taking

dialog: (to himself)
dialog: What a nut.
text: Shoes off, DYLE starts for the bathroom, humming.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I usually sing a medley of old

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Shut the door!
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I don't think I know that one.
text: Testing the water with his hand, he now steps in fully

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What on earth are you doing?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- DYLE

speaker_heading: REGGIE

text: As he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Every day. The manufacturer recommends

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't believe it.
text: He opens his coat and reads a label inside.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: "Wearing this suit during washing
dialog: will help protect its shape."
text: He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail-
text: brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band. He holds up his

dialog: the b.g.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word
dialog: in twenty minutes.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I keep thinking about Charles and
dialog: Scobie -- and the one who's going to
dialog: be next -- me?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Nothing's going to happen to you
dialog: while I'm around -- I want you to
dialog: believe that.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: How can I believe it when you don't
dialog: even know who the killer is? I've
dialog: got that right, haven't I? You don't
dialog: know who did it.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: No -- not yet.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But then if we sit back and wait,
dialog: the field should start narrowing
dialog: down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left
dialog: alive at the end will pretty well
dialog: have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't
dialog: you say so?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Are you trying to say that I might
dialog: have killed Charles and Scobie?
text: She doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: What do I have to do to satisfy you --

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: It's a start, anyway.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: I don't understand you at all -- one
dialog: minute you're chasing me around the

dialog: accusing me of murder.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE

dialog: Will you listen?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (looking at the river)
dialog: I can't very well leave without a

speaker_heading: DYLE

speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Why don't you shut up!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well!
speaker_heading: DYLE

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: After I graduated college I was all
dialog: set to go into my father business.
dialog: Umbrella frames -- that's what he
dialog: made. It was a sensible business, I
dialog: suppose, but I didn't have the sense
dialog: to be interested in anything sensible.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I suppose all this is leading
dialog: somewhere?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: It led me away from umbrella frames,
dialog: for one thing. But that left me
dialog: without any honest means of support.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: When a man has no profession except
dialog: the one he loathes, what's left? I
dialog: began looking for people with more
dialog: money than they'd ever need --
dialog: including some they'd barely miss.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: You mean, you're a thief?
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd
dialog: have chosen, but I suppose it captures
dialog: the spirit of the thing.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Well, I can't really blame you --
dialog: not now.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But I do believe it -- that's what I
dialog: don't believe. So it's goodbye
dialog: Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter
dialog: Joshua.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you

dialog: who I'm talking to any more.
speaker_heading: DYLE
dialog: (now called ADAM)
dialog: The man's the same, even if the name
dialog: isn't.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No -- he's not the same. Alexander
dialog: Dyle was interested in clearing up
dialog: his brother's death. Adam Canfield
dialog: is a crook. And with all the
dialog: advantages you've got -- brains,
dialog: charm, education, a handsome face --
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh, come on!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: -- there has to be a darn good reason
dialog: for living the way you do. I want to
dialog: know what it is.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's simple. I like what I do -- I
dialog: enjoy doing it. There aren't many
dialog: men who love their work as much as I
dialog: do. Look around some time.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, but --
speaker_heading: ADAM AND REGGIE
dialog: (together)
dialog: -- we're divorced.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Right. Now go eat your dinner.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (miserably)
dialog: I could eat a horse.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (looking at all the
dialog: food)
dialog: I think that's what you ordered.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Don't you dare to be civil with me!
dialog: All this time you were leading me on --
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How was I leading you on?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: All that marvelous rejection -- you
dialog: knew I couldn't resist it. Now it
dialog: turns out you were only interested
dialog: in the money.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: REGGIE (HURT)
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What would you like me to say --
text: that a pretty girl with an outrageous
dialog: manner means more to an old pro like
dialog: me than a quarter of a million
dialog: dollars?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No -- I guess not.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Don't you know I'm having a tough
dialog: time keeping my eyes off of you?
text: REGGIE reacts in surprise.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh, you should see your face.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (taking her hand,
dialog: nicely)
dialog: It's lovely.
text: She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
text: The lights go out.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Adam!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's all right -- look.
scene_heading: EXT. SEINE BÂTEAU MOUCHE -- NIGHT
text: A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now
text: begins sweeping the river banks. On benches by the water's
text: edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly
text: and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of
text: mutual affection. Some are embarrassed, some are amused and
text: some (the most intimate) damn annoyed. One even shakes his
text: fist at the light.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM
text: Who, like everyone else, leave the table and stand together
text: at the rail watching.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You don't look so bad in this light.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Why do you think I brought you here?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (indicating the lovers)
dialog: I thought maybe you wanted me to see
dialog: the kind of work the competition was
dialog: turning out.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Pretty good, huh? I taught them
dialog: everything they do.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oh? Did they do that sort of thing
dialog: way back in your day?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How do you think I got here?
text: She rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction
text: is to look at her.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No. The doctor said it would be bad
dialog: for my -- thermostat.
text: She kisses him again. He responds a little better.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: When you come on, you really come
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well -- come on.
text: She starts to kiss him again, but he stops her.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I know why you're not taken -- no
dialog: one can catch up with you.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Relax -- you're gaining.
speaker_heading: DELETED
scene_heading: INT. GIDEON'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: MED. SHOT -- GIDEON. As he sits bolt upright in bed, startled.
text: The room is dark and the phone is ringing. He switches on
text: the lamp, looks at the clock (it reads 3:30) and shakes his
text: head before picking up the receiver.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Huh? You must be crazy -- it's three-
dialog: thirty in the morning -- you mean
dialog: now? -- all right -- I'll be down
dialog: in a minute.
text: He hangs up, swings his feet out of bed and spears his
text: slippers, reaching for his robe at the same time. Then he
text: shuffles sleepily to the door.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT
text: As GIDEON comes out of his room and goes to the elevator.
text: The cage is there. He opens the door and enters.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
text: GIDEON closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The
text: cage starts down. GIDEON begins sneezing. Suddenly the
text: elevator stops between floors and the lights go out.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Hey! Turn on the lights!
text: Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts
text: moving down again. GIDEON shakes his head and leans back,
text: whistling again. The cage comes to his floor and starts past
text: it. Seeing this, GIDEON looks confused.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT
text: The NIGHT PORTER is asleep behind the desk. The elevator,
text: GIDEON inside, keeps coming down. It passes the lobby level
text: and keeps right on going, toward the basement.
speaker_heading: GIDEON
dialog: Hey! How do you stop this thing?
text: The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is
text: a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes
text: that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely
text: awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking
text: horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He
text: presses the call button and the motor starts.
text: An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER
text: opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES
text: PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor
text: of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a
text: puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no
text: strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. He is now doubly apoplectic.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
text: Three of them -- all in their pajamas!
dialog: C'est ridicule! What is it, some new
dialog: American fad?
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal REGGIE and ADAM, in their
dialog: bathrobes.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: And now your friend -- the one from
dialog: Texas -- he has disappeared -- checked
dialog: out -- pouf! into thin air! Where is
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Madame?
text: REGGIE shrugs.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Tell me, Mr. Dyle -- where were you
dialog: at three-thirty?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: In my room, asleep.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: And you, Mrs. Lampert?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I was, too.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: In Mr. Dyle's room?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: No -- in my room.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: (pause, lighting cigar)
dialog: It stands to reason you are telling
dialog: the truth -- for why would you invent
dialog: such a ridiculous story?
text: REGGIE and ADAM exchange looks.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: And if I were you, I would not stay
dialog: in my pajamas. Good night.
text: GRANDPIERRE turns and leaves. REGGIE and ADAM start down the
text: hall toward their own rooms.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That wraps it up -- Tex has the money.
dialog: Go back to bed -- I'll let you know
dialog: when I've found him.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You're going to look for him -- now?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: If the police find him first they're
dialog: not very likely to turn over a quarter
dialog: of a million dollars to us, are they?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Adam --
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: There's no time -- I'll call you in
dialog: the morning.
text: ADAM disappears into his own room.
scene_heading: INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: As ADAM enters, going to the closet to remove his suit.
text: The phone rings. He answers it.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes?
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT -- TEX. As he speaks on the phone.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my
dialog: mama didn't raise no stupid children.
dialog: I know who's got the money 'n I ain't
dialog: disappearing till I got my share --
dialog: 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot
dialog: bigger ev'ry day.
scene_heading: INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Where are you, ol' buddy?
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I'll tell you what, fella -- you
dialog: want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round --

dialog: you.
dialog: (hangs up)
scene_heading: INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: ADAM, before hanging up, reflects on TEX's words, then looks
text: behind him. Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts
text: for REGGIE's door.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: REGGIE slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Open up.
text: She undoes the bolt and opens the door. ADAM enters.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I think we were wrong about Tex having
dialog: the money.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I just heard from him -- he's still
dialog: hungry. That means killing Gideon
dialog: didn't get it for him -- so he's
dialog: narrowed it down to us. You've got
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Where's that airlines bag?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Lord, you're stubborn.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I sure am. Get it.
text: She goes to the closet and gets the bag.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Charles must have had the money with
text: him on the train, and Tex missed it.
text: He takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's
dialog: been through that bag. Somebody would
dialog: have seen it.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Let's look anyway.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Lord, you're stubborn.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only
dialog: we could see it. We're looking at it
dialog: right now.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- BED WITH CHARLES' BELONGINGS
speaker_heading: ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Something on that bed is worth a
dialog: quarter of a million dollars.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, but what?
speaker_heading: ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know -- I just don't know.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM
text: As ADAM begins to examine the items one by one.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Electric razor -- comb -- steamship
dialog: ticket -- fountain pen -- four
dialog: passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --
dialog: (He goes through the
dialog: wallet, finds nothing)
dialog: key -- what about that?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: To the apartment -- it matches mine
dialog: perfectly.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The letter --
text: He takes it out of the envelope and takes out his glasses
text: before reading it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'll bet you don't really need those.
text: He hands her the glasses and she looks through them.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You need them.
dialog: (She hands them back)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (reading the letter)
text: It still doesn't make sense, but it
dialog: isn't worth any quarter of a million
dialog: either. Have we forgotten anything?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: The tooth powder. Wait a minute --
dialog: could you recognize heroin just by
dialog: tasting it?
text: He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it. REGGIE
text: watches expectantly.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Go to bed. You've got to be at work
dialog: in the morning. There's nothing more
dialog: we can do tonight.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I love you, Adam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Yes, you told me.
speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: ITALIAN DELEGATE
dialog: -- di conseguenza, il Governo Italiano
dialog: è decisamente a favore per
dialog: l'incoraggiamento, in accordo con le
dialog: tradizioni etniche rispettive delle

dialog: e questo è molto importante per il

scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY
text: REGGIE, wearing her headset, is talking with SYLVIE.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I hope Jean-Louis understands about
dialog: last night -- it's just not safe for
dialog: him to be around me right now.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: Don't be silly -- he would not do
text: anything. He is not yet old enough
dialog: to be interested in girls. He says
dialog: collecting stamps is much more
text: satisfying to a man of his age.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Hold it -- Italy just finished.
dialog: They're recognizing Great Britain.
speaker_heading: SYLVIE
dialog: Oh la vache!
text: SYLVIE jumps up and rushes next door into her booth, shutting

scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
text: The BRITISH DELEGATE rises to speak, continuing through the
text: next scene.
speaker_heading: BRITISH DELEGATE
dialog: Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my
dialog: distinguished colleague from Italy.
dialog: Her Majesty's delegation has listened
dialog: with great patience to the Southern
dialog: European position on this problem,
dialog: and while we find it charmingly
dialog: stated, we cannot possibly agree
dialog: with its content. In 1937, in the
dialog: British colonies of Kenya, Uganda
dialog: and Tanganyika -- and, if I'm not
dialog: mistaken, more or less in Somaliland --
dialog: a programme of crop rotation was
dialog: instituted vis-à-vis arable land
dialog: which had never before known the
text: plough, beginning before the soil
dialog: was able to know the sort of fatigue
text: now plaguing most of Western Europe.
dialog: In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's
dialog: Government -- at that time His
dialog: Majesty's Government -- was able to
dialog: properly assay the situation. We
dialog: therefore oppose the resolution.
scene_heading: INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY
text: The door from the hall opens and ADAM enters.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Reggie -- I think I've found --
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: are you on?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: No, it's all right. What's wrong,
dialog: Adam?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Nothing's wrong. I think I found
dialog: something. I was snooping around
dialog: Tex's room and I found this in the
dialog: waste basket. I've stuck it back
dialog: together.
text: He hands her a paper.
scene_heading: INSERT -- POLICE RECEIPT
text: The one GRANDPIERRE gave REGGIE. It has been torn in half
text: and scotch-taped back together.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: It's the receipt Inspector Grandpierre
dialog: gave me -- for Charles's things. I
dialog: don't see how that's going to --
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You didn't look. Last night, when we
dialog: went through the airlines bag,
dialog: something was missing. See -- ?
dialog: (showing her the list)
dialog: "One agenda." It wasn't there.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You're right. I remember Grandpierre
text: looking through it. But there was
dialog: nothing in it -- at least, nothing
dialog: that the police thought was very
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Can you remember anything at all?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Grandpierre asked me about an
dialog: appointment Charles had -- on the
dialog: day he was killed.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: With whom? Where?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I think it only said where -- but I
dialog: can't --
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Think, Reggie, you've got to think --
dialog: it may be what we're looking for.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: That money's not ours, Adam -- if we
dialog: keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's
dialog: no law against stealing stolen money.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Of course there is!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: There is? Well, I can't say I think
dialog: very much of a silly law like that.
dialog: Think, Reggie -- please think --
dialog: what was written in Charles' notebook?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Well -- it was a place -- a street
dialog: corner, I think. But I don't --
dialog: (hearing something
text: through her earpiece)
dialog: Hold it. I'm on.

speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (quietly)

scene_heading: INSERT -- STAMPS

scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE, FÉLIX, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know

speaker_heading: FÉLIX
dialog: I know them as one knows his own
dialog: face, even though I have never seen
dialog: them. This yellow one -- a Swedish
dialog: four shilling -- called 'De Gula
dialog: Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: How much is it worth?
speaker_heading: FÉLIX
text: The money is unimportant.
speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Do you mind if I sit down?
dialog: (she sits)
dialog: What about the blue one?
speaker_heading: FÉLIX
dialog: It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and
dialog: there are only seven left. In 1894
dialog: the owner of one was murdered by a
dialog: rival collector who was obsessed to
dialog: own it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What's its value today?
speaker_heading: FÉLIX

dialog: 1856. Not so rare as the others --
dialog: $30,000 perhaps.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: And the last one?
speaker_heading: FÉLIX
dialog: The best for the last -- le chef-
dialog: d'oeuvre de la collection. The
dialog: masterpiece. It is the most valuable
dialog: stamp in the world. It is called
dialog: 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed
dialog: by hand on colored paper in 1852 and
dialog: marked with the initials of the
dialog: printer.
dialog: (looking at it through
dialog: the glass)
text: Today it has a value of $100,000.

speaker_heading: REGGIE

dialog: You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps

speaker_heading: FÉLIX

speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: REGGIE

text: The smaller court at the Comédie-Française end of the Palais
text: gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double
text: peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from
text: each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each --
text: in all, eighty columns. The only person in sight is the man
text: we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the
text: columns, looking at his watch impatiently.
text: Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs
text: into the court. She spots "BARTHOLOMEW" and fishes in her
text: bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me!
text: ADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the
text: near end of the colonnade as he spots "BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE,
text: still running, is halfway between the two men. "BARTHOLOMEW"
text: draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked
dialog: in among the columns.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Reggie -- stop! That's Carson Dyle!
text: This news hits REGGIE hard and she stops, in alarm.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Carson -- ?
text: She looks at "BARTHOLOMEW," then back at ADAM, who has drawn
text: his own gun.
text: (NOTE: Both "BARTHOLOMEW" and ADAM are in among the stone
text: columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of
text: each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps
text: in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to).
scene_heading: "BARTHOLOMEW"
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: We all know Carson Dyle is dead,
dialog: Mrs. Lampert.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's Carson Dyle, I tell you!
scene_heading: "BARTHOLOMEW"
dialog: You're not going to believe him,
dialog: Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic.
dialog: He's trying to trick you again.
text: REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Tex recognized him -- that's why he
dialog: said Dyle. If you give him those
dialog: stamps, he'll kill you too!
text: REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM.
scene_heading: "BARTHOLOMEW"
dialog: Mrs. Lampert -- if I'm who he said,
dialog: what's preventing me from killing
dialog: you right now?
text: REGGIE stops, turns back to "BARTHOLOMEW."
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Because he'd have to come out to get
dialog: the stamps -- he knows he'd never
dialog: make it.
scene_heading: "BARTHOLOMEW"
dialog: What's the matter with you, Mrs.
dialog: Lampert? Are you going to believe
dialog: every lie he tells you? He wants the
dialog: money for himself -- that's all he's
dialog: ever wanted.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (to ADAM, explaining)
dialog: He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen
text: him at the Embassy.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
scene_heading: "BARTHOLOMEW"
dialog: That's right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm a
dialog: dead man -- look at me.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know who anybody is any more!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Reggie -- listen to me!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You lied to me so many times --
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Reggie -- trust me once more --
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Can I really believe you this time,
dialog: Adam?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: There's not a reason on earth why
dialog: you should.
text: She looks toward ADAM for a moment, then back to
text: "BARTHOLOMEW", then slowly starts toward ADAM.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: All right, Adam.
scene_heading: "BARTHOLOMEW"
dialog: Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or
dialog: I'll kill you.
text: REGGIE stops in alarm.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It won't get you the stamps, Dyle --
dialog: You'll have to come out to get them,
dialog: and I'm not likely to miss at this
dialog: range.
scene_heading: "BARTHOLOMEW"
speaker_heading: (now called CARSON)
dialog: Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of
dialog: bullets to kill me. They left me
dialog: there with five of them in my legs
dialog: and my stomach -- they knew I was
dialog: still alive but they left me. I spent
dialog: ten months in a German camp -- with
dialog: nothing to stop the pain and no food --
dialog: they were willing to take all these
dialog: chances for the money, but not for
dialog: me. They deserved to die!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- ADAM
text: During the following, he looks around, looking for some way
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: But I didn't have anything to do
dialog: with --
speaker_heading: CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You've got the money. It belongs to
dialog: me now! Please believe me, Mrs.
dialog: Lampert -- I'll kill you -- a little
dialog: more blood won't matter.
text: During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns,
text: creeping cautiously across the open space between the two
text: colonnades and finally, behind the second.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND CARSON
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I'll give you five to make up your
dialog: mind, Mrs. Lampert.
text: She has seen ADAM's move from her angle, but doesn't know
dialog: quite what to do.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Wait, please! I need some time to
dialog: think!
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: One --
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- ADAM
text: As he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his
text: gun ready, trying to get an angle on CARSON.
speaker_heading: CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: -- two --
text: Suddenly ADAM stops -- he has caught sight of CARSON through
dialog: the columns. But he will have a difficult shot.
speaker_heading: CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: -- three --
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON
speaker_heading: CARSON

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Adam -- please!
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- ADAM
text: As he aims carefully and fires.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- COLUMN
text: As the bullet creases it.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON
text: As the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving
text: him unharmed. He wheels.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- ADAM
text: With CARSON in the b.g., who fires at him. ADAM ducks behind
text: the column as the bullet hits it and screams off.
text: Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE
text: Seeing CARSON otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward
text: the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her.
text: (Beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming
dialog: schedule of presentations.)
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door,
text: turns and fires at her. But he is too late -- she is safely
text: inside. CARSON looks quickly back toward ADAM, then takes
text: off after REGGIE.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- ADAM
text: Over his shoulder we see a broken picture of CARSON running
text: toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns.
text: ADAM tries to get a shot at him, but can't.
text: Finally he runs after him.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT
text: As CARSON enters and slams the door behind him, locking it.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE DOOR -- NIGHT
text: ADAM arriving at the door, bangs on it, then looks around,
text: frustrated. Several yards away he sees a short stairway
text: leading down to a door below the street level. He runs to
text: it, tries the door and enters.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- ORCHESTRA -- NIGHT
text: As CARSON enters the auditorium and looks around.
speaker_heading: CARSON'S P.O.V.
text: As the CAMERA SWEEPS the magnificent old theatre -- boxes,
text: seats, stage, but there is no sign of REGGIE.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As CARSON walks up the aisle checking between the rows of
dialog: seats.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- TRAPROOM -- NIGHT
text: A large room, lit by a single bare bulb, under the stage.
text: ADAM appears, moving cautiously, gun ready. He creeps along
text: next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic
text: pieces which fill the room.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT
text: As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the
text: footlights, looking for REGGIE. At mid-stage, CAMERA PANS
text: DOWN to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box.
text: Inside, huddling down, is a terrified REGGIE, holding her
text: breath as she watches him.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As CARSON moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board
text: and throws on all the switches. The stage is bathed in light.
text: He returns to the stage.
scene_heading: INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT
text: ADAM is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage
text: over his head -- and hearing them now. He looks around and
text: sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up. He goes to it,
text: and, starting up, finds a door. He tries the knob -- the
text: door is locked.
scene_heading: INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT
text: REGGIE, cringing back from the bright light, notices the
text: doorknob turning. It makes a slight clicking sound.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT
text: CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery,
text: hears the doorknob and turns suddenly.
speaker_heading: CARSON'S P.O.V.
text: We catch a quick glimpse of REGGIE as she ducks down out of
text: sight. Too late.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: All right, Mrs. Lampert. The game's
dialog: over. Come out of there.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: REGGIE does not appear.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: I don't want to kill you, Mrs. Lampert --
dialog: but I will --
scene_heading: INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT
text: ADAM comes down the stairs from the prompter's box and looks
text: up at the ceiling.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- CEILING
text: It is divided into thirty-six square sections, each numbered
text: and lettered -- from 1A to 6F. They are trapdoors.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- ADAM
text: He looks from the ceiling to a row of levers on one wall.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- LEVERS
text: Thirty-six of them, numbered and lettered to correspond to
dialog: the traps.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT
text: As CARSON takes a few steps towards the prompter's box, his
dialog: gun ready.
speaker_heading: CARSON
dialog: Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert -- ?
scene_heading: INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT
text: REGGIE huddled inside.
scene_heading: INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT
text: ADAM is listening carefully, trying to figure out where CARSON
text: is standing, watching the ceiling.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP
text: It is marked C-4.
speaker_heading: CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I won't wait much longer, Mrs. Lampert
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- ADAM
text: As he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked C-
text: 4. He is about to pull it.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT
text: CARSON takes a few more steps forward.
scene_heading: INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT
text: ADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He
text: lets his held breath escape. He looks back at the ceiling.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP
text: The one marked C-4. As CARSON's voice is heard, CAMERA MOVES
text: to the next trap, marked D-4.
speaker_heading: CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert --
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- ADAM
text: He looks at the lever marked D-4. He is perspiring heavily.
text: Now he slowly reaches for the lever.
scene_heading: INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT
text: CARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when
text: suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through
text: out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- PROMPTER'S BOX
text: As REGGIE slowly peers out.
speaker_heading: REGGIE'S P.O.V.
text: The empty stage, without being able to see the open trap
dialog: from this low angle.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- REGGIE
text: As she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap
text: now, runs to it, looking down through it.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT -- OPEN TRAP
text: FROM ABOVE, over REGGIE's head. She can see CARSON sprawled
text: on the floor below, face down and dead. ADAM stands beside
text: the body, looking up at REGGIE and smiling.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As GRANDPIERRE and his TWO ASSISTANTS, guns drawn, walk onto
text: the stage from the wings. They go to the open trap and look
text: down at ADAM.
speaker_heading: GRANDPIERRE
dialog: Mr. Dyle -- you are under arrest for
dialog: the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman
dialog: Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold
dialog: Gideon, and whoever that is down
dialog: there.
text: ADAM is surprised, then shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Reggie -- you'd better tell him. He
dialog: wouldn't dare hit a girl.
scene_heading: EXT. RUE DE RIVOLI -- NIGHT
text: As a TAXI rolls by the arcades, CAMERA PANNING with it.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI -- NIGHT (PROCESS)
text: REGGIE and ADAM in the rear of the cab. REGGIE has one of
text: her feet in her hand, shoe off, rubbing it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You didn't have to chase me so hard --
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Here, give it to me.
text: He starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers
dialog: him the other one.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: That one's done -- start on this
dialog: one.
text: He takes the foot and begins rubbing it.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I'm sorry I thought you were the
dialog: murderer, Adam -- how did I know
dialog: that he was as big a liar as you
dialog: are?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: And that's all the gratitude I get
dialog: for saving your hide.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: The truth, now -- was it my hide --
dialog: or the stamps?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What a terrible thing to say. How
dialog: could you even think that?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: All right, prove it to me -- tell me
dialog: to go to the Embassy first thing in
dialog: the morning and turn in those stamps.
text: ADAM says nothing.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: I said, tell me to go to the --
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I heard you, I heard you.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Then say it.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Reggie -- listen to me --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What makes you think they're even
dialog: interested? It's only a quarter of a
dialog: million -- it'll cost more than that
dialog: to fix up their bookkeeping. As a
dialog: taxpayer --
scene_heading: EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY -- MAIN ENTRANCE -- DAY
text: As REGGIE and ADAM approach the MARINE in full-dress uniform
text: always on guard at the Embassy.
speaker_heading: REGGIE

dialog: Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay
dialog: taxes. Excuse me, soldier --
speaker_heading: MARINE
dialog: Marine, ma'am.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Forgive me. Whom would I see regarding
dialog: the return of stolen Government money?
speaker_heading: MARINE
dialog: You might try the Treasury Department,
dialog: ma'am -- Room 216, second floor, Mr.
dialog: Cruikshank.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Cruikshank, 216. Thank you, Marine.
scene_heading: INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Do you mind if I wait out here? The

scene_heading: INT. EMBASSY TREASURY OFFICE -- DAY
text: A SECRETARY sits behind a desk. She looks up as REGGIE enters.
speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: SECRETARY

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE

text: REGGIE stares at him, unbelievingly, then looks around,
text: confused. By way of explanation he indicates the door to the
dialog: hall.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (blowing up)
dialog: Well, of all the mean, rotten,
dialog: contemptible, crooked --
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: Crooked? I should think you'd be
dialog: glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You couldn't even be honest about
dialog: being dishonest. Why didn't you say
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: We're not allowed to tell. May I
dialog: have the stamps, please?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (reaching into her
dialog: bag)
dialog: Here --
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle
dialog: get an office in here, anyway?
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: When did you see him -- what time, I
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Around one.
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: The lunch hour. He probably worked
text: it out in advance. He found an office
dialog: that was usually left open and just
dialog: moved in for the time you were here.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Then how do I know this is your
dialog: office?
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: (picking up the phone)
dialog: Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to
dialog: Bartholomew at Security recommending
dialog: that --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Bartholomew?
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: -- recommending that all Embassy
dialog: offices be locked during the lunch
dialog: hour.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
text: Starting with his own.
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: (hanging up)
dialog: Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What's your first name today?
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: Brian.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve
dialog: me right if I got stuck with that
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: Who asked you to get stuck with any
dialog: of them?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But you're -- divorced?
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: (crestfallen)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: My mother -- she lives in Detroit.
dialog: Come on now -- give me those stamps.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Only if you can prove to me that

speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: How about if next week some time I
dialog: put it on a marriage license -- that
dialog: ought to --
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Quit stalling -- I want to see some
dialog: identification -- now!
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: I wouldn't lie on a thing like that --
dialog: I could go to jail.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You'd lie about anything.
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: Well, maybe we'd better forget about
dialog: it, then.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You can't prove it, can you? You're
dialog: still trying to --
dialog: (the coin drops into
dialog: the slot)
dialog: marriage license! Did you say -- ?
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: I didn't say anything. Will you give
dialog: me those stamps?
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: You did too say it -- I heard you.
dialog: Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex --
dialog: er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have
dialog: lots of boys -- we can name them all
dialog: after you.
speaker_heading: CRUIKSHANK
dialog: Before we start on that, do you mind
