scene_heading: --------------------------------------------------------------
text: Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love. A
text: MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed. He is a frail-looking
text: man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair. On top of
dialog: him is a much younger WOMAN. Although her back is to us, we
text: catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
dialog: to side. We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.
text: She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched
text: back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts. She reaches
text: down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him
text: deeper inside her. They move together -- faster -- and faster.
text: The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK. As it does we see what
text: we are watching is on a TELEVISION.
text: Further back still. We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS
text: standing before the television watching the act.
text: The CAMERA begins to pan around the room. Rain streaks down
text: the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside. A VIDEO
text: CAMERA is set up on a tripod. More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,
text: looking, dusting, talking.
dialog: We continue to PAN. We can now see it is the same room on the
text: tape. ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet
text: covering his lower torso. His face is ashen, mouth open, his
text: dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare. The last instant of
text: his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
text: LIGHTNING fills the night sky. THUNDER BOOMS overhead. The
text: wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
text: The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES. At the
text: end is a cul-de-sac. Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
text: their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
text: A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway. JOHN CARDENAS steps
text: out into the rain. He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
text: with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
text: He does not run through the rain -- he walks.
text: DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
text: homicide detective runs out to meet him.
dialog: 2
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Is it Marsh?
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face. It lasts an
dialog: instant, then it's gone.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
dialog: rain?
text: Cardenas doesn't move. He ignores the question.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Who found him?
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: His Secretary. Joanne Braslow.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: She was here?
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: No. She stopped by to pick up some
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Show me.
text: Reese starts for the house. Cardenas looks up into the night
text: sky. A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT
text: Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of
dialog: Marsh in bed.
text: Cardenas enters followed by Reese. He moves through the
dialog: FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS. Anything Cardenas feels about the
text: gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
dialog: indifference.
text: Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER
text: TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man. Cardenas looks down at the
text: body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a
text: portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: How long?
dialog: 3
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: About three hours.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Cause?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: Not sure. I'll have everything you
dialog: need tomorrow.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Take a look at this.
text: Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it. On
text: top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
text: spray. Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL
speaker_heading: AIDES.
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: This guy was into some kinky shit.
text: Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of
dialog: the room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair. Her eyes are tired -- red from
text: crying. She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come
dialog: more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right
text: cosmetics. She has a corporate look to her.
text: Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney
dialog: John Cardenas. You arrived at what
dialog: time tonight?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: A little after eleven.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Why did you come by?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I had some papers to pick up.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I assume his girlfriend.
dialog: 4
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Her name?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Rebecca Lawson.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: You wouldn't know her address, would
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: No -- but I can get it for you.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, CITY HALL BUILDING - DAY
text: Cardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy.
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: Marsh wasn't alone. We found traces
dialog: of sperm on the sheets. The
dialog: toxicology report says there were
text: high levels of cocaine in his blood.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What'd he die of?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: The official cause of death was a
dialog: cardiac arrest.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: The official cause?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: That's what my report will read.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: But there's more?
text: They reach a door and stop.
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: It's speculative at this point.
dialog: Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.
dialog: His heart attack was induced by
dialog: excessive aerobic activity -- in
dialog: conjunction with the drug.
text: McCurdy enters the room. Cardenas thinks for a moment, then
dialog: follows.
dialog: 5
scene_heading: INT. CARDENAS' OFFICE - DAY
text: Spacious and sparsely furnished. The walls are empty. No
dialog: commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
text: office. Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who
text: is already seated next to Reese and Troxell.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: (to McCurdy)
dialog: What are you saying, Henry? That his
dialog: girlfriend fucked him to death?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: Yes.
text: A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face. He walks over to
text: the window and stares outside. Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait
text: as he thinks. A beat. Cardenas turns back to the room.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What can we prove?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: We know Marsh had a head cold. We
dialog: found cocaine mixed with water in a
dialog: nasal spray container on the
dialog: nightstand. The coke would contract
dialog: the nasal membrane the same as any
dialog: decongestant, but for a much shorter
dialog: time. He'd keep using more and more
dialog: -- never knowing what he was taking.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Any prints on the nasal spray?
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: What if he did know what was in it?
dialog: A lot of users put it in nasal spray
dialog: bottles so they can use it in public.
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: Cocaine is the last thing a man in
dialog: his condition would want.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the
dialog: scene?
dialog: 6
speaker_heading: REESE
text: A man across the street from Marsh
dialog: saw her drive up about four thirty
dialog: Sunday afternoon. And her prints are
dialog: all over the place.
text: Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall. He
text: gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one.
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: Marsh's Cardiologist told me that
dialog: after Marsh was diagnosed with heart
dialog: disease he quit smoking, quit
dialog: drinking and started exercising every
dialog: day. Does that sound like a guy
dialog: who'd start shoveling cocaine up his
dialog: nose?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What did he say about Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: He can remember at least one occasion
dialog: -- and the receptionist can recall
dialog: two times when she accompanied Marsh
dialog: to the office.
text: Cardenas throws another dart at the board.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: So she knew about his heart?
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: Had to. I also interviewed three
dialog: women who were in past relationships
dialog: with Marsh. There's no evidence that
dialog: he had anything but straight sex
dialog: prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What about the will?
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: That's the best part. She gets it
dialog: all -- everything.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING
text: Gray clouds hang over head. A light drizzle falls. A GROUP of
text: MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave.
text: In the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITY
speaker_heading: GUARDS.
dialog: 7
text: A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS,
text: her face hidden behind a hat and veil. RAYMOND SATTLER, a
text: tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
text: her. He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE. The
text: service concludes. Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
text: offer her their condolences. Joanne Braslow is there. She
text: does not go over to Rebecca.
text: CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.
text: Cardenas watches and waits. He steps forward as Sattler leads
dialog: the woman by.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Miss Lawson?
text: The Woman stops. Her back is to Cardenas.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.
text: REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
text: around. She is in her late twenties. A deep pain fills her
text: face -- controlled, but evident. Her eyes are tired -- heavy
text: from crying -- but no tears show now. This is a woman whose
text: grief is private and not displayed for others. Although
text: emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful. So
dialog: beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide
dialog: how impressed he is.
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: I don't think that this is the time,
dialog: or the place.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: I just wanted to introduce myself and
dialog: inform Miss Lawson that there will be
dialog: an inquiry.
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: An inquiry into what?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: For starters I'd like to know why she
dialog: left the house and didn't report the
dialog: death?
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: Because he wasn't dead when she left,
dialog: and even if he was, not reporting a
dialog: natural death in a timely fashion
dialog: isn't a crime.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did I say it was a natural death?
dialog: 8
text: Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes. Rebecca stares at him
text: genuinely shocked by his accusation. Cardenas nods and walks
text: away. In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with
dialog: hostility.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Large and homey. A fire roars in the fireplace. FRANK DULANEY
text: sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK. He is mid-
dialog: thirties, powerful, self-assured.
text: SHARON DULANEY enters. She is an attractive woman in her early
text: thirties. She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his
text: PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You're on vacation, remember? You're
dialog: supposed to be relaxing.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I am relaxing.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (pushing the papers
dialog: aside)
dialog: This is not relaxing.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (playing along)
dialog: And I suppose you're going to show me
dialog: how to relax?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: If you want me to.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm always open to learning new
dialog: things.
text: She kisses him -- soft, gentle kisses. Dulaney puts his arms
text: around her and kisses her harder.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm beginning to see what you mean.
dialog: Why don't we go upstairs and work on
dialog: the advanced course?
dialog: 9
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I can't. I've got to finish a
dialog: counter offer on the Bergman
dialog: property.
text: The moment is passing by. A trace of frustration shows on
text: Dulaney's face -- this is obviously not a new occurrence.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Can't it wait?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
text: The moment is gone. Dulaney forces an understanding smile. He
text: looks towards the door and sees his EIGHT YEAR OLD SON,
speaker_heading: MICHAEL.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Hey, Slugger. Ready for bed?
text: Michael walks over to this parents.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Uh huh.
text: The PHONE RINGS. Dulaney answers it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?...
dialog: Well, I was sort of planning on...
dialog: Alright... Okay, goodbye.
dialog: (hangs up; to Sharon)
dialog: That was Sattler. He thinks the
dialog: D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca
dialog: Lawson. He wants me in the office
dialog: tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: We're supposed to go to the lake.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I know. What can I do? He is the
dialog: boss.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: He could let you have your vacation.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Dad -- is it true what they're saying
dialog: about that Miss Lawson Lady?
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What are they saying?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The kids at school say she humped Mr.
dialog: Marsh to death.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Hey, you know better than that. What
dialog: did I teach you to say when someone
dialog: is accused of doing something?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She allegedly humped him to death?
text: Dulaney grins. Sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I swear -- the both of you.
dialog: (to Dulaney)
dialog: Some example you set.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (imitating her)
dialog: Some example you set.
text: He makes a funny face at Michael who LAUGHS and makes one back.
text: Dulaney grabs him and starts TICKLING him. Michael SCREAMS
text: with LAUGHTER as he tries to tickle him back. Dulaney then
text: starts TICKLING SHARON -- Michael helps him. Sharon ROARS with
text: LAUGHTER and falls to the floor. The three of them roll around
text: LAUGHING hysterically.
scene_heading: INT. SATTLER'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee. Dulaney sits
text: across from him.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man.
dialog: A trial like this is going to put
text: Cardenas in the spot-light.
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: We've already got press arriving from
dialog: over the country and she hasn't even
dialog: been charged yet.
dialog: Cardenas wants to see her in his
dialog: office tomorrow at ten. I'd like you
dialog: to go with her.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm supposed to be on vacation.
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: I know -- but she wants you to
dialog: represent her if Cardenas files.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: Because I told her you were the best
dialog: criminal attorney we have.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Raymond, I'm the only criminal
dialog: attorney you have.
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Well, I guess that makes you the
dialog: best.
dialog: (candidly)
dialog: Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit
dialog: three million dollars. As executors
dialog: of the estate and her attorneys that
dialog: could generate a lot of legal fees
dialog: for us. All I'm asking you to do is
dialog: talk to her.
text: Dulaney thinks about it for a moment.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Alright, I'll talk to her
speaker_heading: SATTLER
text: She's waiting in the conference room.
text: Dulaney stands and walks towards the door.
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for
dialog: almost twenty years -- or thought I
dialog: did. What do you think would make a
dialog: man in his condition do the things he
dialog: did?
text: Dulaney stops at the door and looks back.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I think the question is: What is it
dialog: about her that made him want to do
dialog: it?
dialog: 12
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a
text: CIGARETTE. Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her
text: hair. She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that
text: clings to every curve of her body.
text: Dulaney enters the room. When he sees her he can't help but
text: stare. Rebecca notes his gaze.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.
text: She raises the cigarette to her lips. Dulaney notices despite
text: her outward composure her hand is shaking.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Are you going to represent me?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: There are no charges against you. I'm
dialog: here to decide if I'm going to
dialog: represent you should that occur.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you kill him?
text: Rebecca appears hurt by the question.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You don't waste any time, do you?
text: Dulaney doesn't answer. He studies her -- his eyes probing
dialog: hers.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Do you think I did it?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I don't know. That's why I'm asking
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You must have some feeling. Some
text: immediate impression. A young,
text: attractive woman, involved with an
dialog: older man who leaves her everything
dialog: in his will. And the things that
dialog: went on in that house. Such wild
dialog: sex. What kind of picture does that
dialog: paint?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Not a very good one I'm afraid.
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: And that's exactly what the jury will
dialog: see when they look at me. That's why
dialog: I need a very good lawyer, Mr.
dialog: Dulaney.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You're assuming the District Attorney
dialog: is going to file charges.
text: Rebecca's anxiety begins to surface. She feigns a weak smile.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: He'll file. He's an ambitious man.
dialog: Ambitious men build their careers on
dialog: the bodies of others.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You still haven't answered my
dialog: question.
text: She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering. She
text: looks at Dulaney. Displaying emotions is not something that
text: comes easily. Tears well up in her eyes.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (emotionally)
dialog: I loved him. A big part of my life
dialog: has been torn away from me, Mr.
dialog: Dulaney. A part I can never get back
dialog: -- and on top of that people are
dialog: saying that I am somehow responsible
dialog: for it. They've taken everything
dialog: that is good and caring about two
dialog: people in love and made it dirty.
text: A single tear streams down her check. She knows what he wants
text: to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No -- I didn't kill him.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Cardenas walks down the hall, sipping a cup of coffee. Troxell
text: walks towards him excitedly. They walk together.
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: I think I'm going to make your day.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: How?
dialog: 14
text: Troxell points to an Office. Through the glass partition we
text: can see a MAN sitting at a table. ALAN PALEY is a well-groomed
text: man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good.
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: I've got this guy in my office.
dialog: Doctor Alan Paley. Wait until you
dialog: hear what he has to say.
text: Cardenas and Troxell enters the room. Cardenas shakes hands
text: with Paley and listens with great interest as he starts to
dialog: talk.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Dulaney and Sharon are in bed. Dulaney reads some PAPERS.
text: Sharon finishes reading her MAGAZINE. She puts it on the
text: nightstand and looks at Dulaney.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: How can Cardenas possibly think he
dialog: can build a case against two
dialog: consenting adults?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: He must have something or he wouldn't
dialog: be pressing so hard.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: If he files are you going to take the
dialog: case?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I don't know yet. I want to hear
dialog: what she says at her statement
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What's she like?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Attractive. Bright. Distant.
dialog: Charming when she wants to be.
text: Dulaney's description seems to bother her.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: She sounds like quite a woman.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (joking)
dialog: Yeah -- but can she cook?
text: Sharon hits him on the arm playfully.
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: The whole thing gives me the creeps.
dialog: I mean -- what if she really humped
dialog: him to death?
text: Dulaney grins at her choice of words.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Humped
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I can think of worse ways to go--
text: Dulaney rolls over, gathering her up in his arms.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: --and speaking of humping.
text: He reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the LIGHTS.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY HALL BUILDING MORNING
text: As Dulaney and Rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by
text: a CROWD of REPORTERS. Dulaney puts his arm around Rebecca and
text: ushers her through the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. CARDENAS' OFFICE - MORNING
text: Dulaney and Rebecca sit on one side of a table. Reese stands.
text: Cardenas sits at his desk.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I didn't know that Andrew was dead
dialog: until Mr. Sattler called me at home
dialog: that night.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: We have a witness who saw you go into
dialog: the house at four thirty.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: She's not denying she was there.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Did you have sex?
dialog: 16
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: What time did you leave?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Six thirty -- and he was very much
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did you use it the night Marsh died?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No. I haven't done it in years.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Did Marsh use it?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No -- never.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: It had to get there somehow.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It didn't get there from me.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart
dialog: condition?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his
dialog: nurse have told us that you
dialog: accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office
dialog: on at least two occasions.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That's correct -- but Andrew never
dialog: told me he had a heart condition. He
dialog: said he had a heart arrhythmia and it
dialog: was nothing serious.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: He never mentioned his heart disease?
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: She just said that.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Why do you think he lied to you?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: That's something only Marsh would
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: I think Miss Lawson knew it too. I
dialog: think she slipped him the coke and he
dialog: popped his cork giving her the high-
dialog: hard-one.
text: Dulaney's anger shows. He stands.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: That's it. My client doesn't have to
dialog: take this crap from you.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Sit down, Frank.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No. Miss Lawson came in here
dialog: voluntarily to answer your questions.
dialog: She doesn't have to sit here and be
dialog: insulted. So, either you charge her
dialog: now or we're leaving.
text: A beat. Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes. Cardenas shrugs his
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Fine.
text: Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up. She stands and they
text: walk to the door. Reese looks at Cardenas. Cardenas nods.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest
dialog: for the murder of Andrew Marsh.
text: Rebecca is stunned -- frightened. She looks at Dulaney in
text: disbelief. Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily. Reese removes
text: his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: You have the right to remain silent.
dialog: If you give up--
dialog: 18
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: (to Reese)
dialog: I don't think the handcuffs will be
dialog: necessary. You can finish giving
dialog: Miss Lawson her rights outside.
text: Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door. She
text: looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes
text: welling with tears.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Frank!
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'll have you out in a few hours.
text: Reese ushers her through the door. A beat. Dulaney and
text: Cardenas are left alone. Cardenas starts fishing through a can
text: of NUTS, carefully extracting the cashews. Dulaney continues
dialog: to stand.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Lookin' to make the papers, John?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Marsh left her close to three million
dialog: dollars in his will. That's motive.
dialog: She admits to being there the night
dialog: of his death. That's opportunity --
dialog: and her fingerprints are on the nasal
dialog: spray bottle.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You can't show intent.
text: Cardenas looks at Dulaney wryly. He knows that Dulaney is
text: trying to discover his game plan. Cardenas looks into his can
text: of nuts and fishes for another cashew.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Can you?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Take your pole out of the water,
dialog: Frank. The fish ain't biting today.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You're bluffing. John, it's me,
dialog: remember? I've known you since your
dialog: name was Juan Carlos.
dialog: Cardenas doesn't appreciate Dulaney mentioning his real name.
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: C'mon -- think about it. If she was
dialog: going to kill Marsh why leave the
dialog: nasal spray bottle there for the
dialog: police to find?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: She planned this. She wanted us to
dialog: find the nasal spray.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Why would she want that?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Because she's clever. Because she
dialog: knows that even if we didn't find it
dialog: we'd have suspicions as to why a man
dialog: in Marsh's condition would use
dialog: cocaine.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions
dialog: aren't enough for a conviction.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's
dialog: nasal membranes showed no sign of
dialog: prior cocaine use. Without the nasal
dialog: spray we would have still treated it
dialog: as a poisoning. We would have looked
dialog: for motive and the trail would have
dialog: still led back to her.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I don't buy it and neither will a
dialog: jury.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: We're going all the way on this one,
dialog: Frank. Tell your client she has
dialog: until the prelim to cop a plea for
dialog: murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'll tell her but she won't take it.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Then she's not as smart as I thought
dialog: she was. You've seen her in the
dialog: depositions. Tell me you don't have
dialog: any doubts?
dialog: 20
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: She's innocent.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Aren't they all?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yeah. Well -- we'll let the
text: blindfolded lady with the scales
dialog: decide that.
text: Dulaney gets up slowly and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. CITY JAIL, BOOKING COUNTER - AFTERNOON
text: Dulaney waits at the counter. A barred door slides open and
text: Rebecca is led out by a WOMAN JAILER. Even in these
text: surroundings she maintains her composure. She walks to the
text: counter and waits silently.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY HALL BUILDING - AFTERNOON
text: As Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled by
text: REPORTERS, screaming questions, asking them to verify Rebecca's
text: arrest. Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in tow.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER - AFTERNOON
text: Gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain. Tall birch trees
text: line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn
text: is approaching. Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging path
dialog: cut along the bank.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I want you to know right now that the
dialog: trial's going to be nasty. Your sex
dialog: life is going to be dragged through
dialog: the mud. They're going to say that
dialog: you enticed Marsh -- led him down a
dialog: dark path.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Andrew hardly needed leading. He was
dialog: a very passionate man. He was eager
dialog: to explore. I gave him what he
dialog: wanted. We fulfilled each others
dialog: needs.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: This is a very small town -- people
dialog: here have very straight views on sex.
dialog: 21
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm used to being on the outside
dialog: looking in. The same men who will
dialog: publicly profess their moral outrage
dialog: for my sexual tastes are the same
dialog: ones who privately rest their sweaty
dialog: little hands on my legs and talk
dialog: about weekend trips together.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Those same men will be sitting on the
dialog: jury.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I am who I am. I can't deny it,
dialog: anymore than you can deny who you
dialog: are. I like sex different -- I like
dialog: it wild. That's not a crime.
dialog: (emotional)
dialog: I loved Andrew. We made love
dialog: together. We made it differently,
dialog: but we still made love. It was our
dialog: way. It was private -- and now the
dialog: whole world wants to look in through
dialog: the pretense of justice. If I was
dialog: some middle-aged divorcee who screwed
dialog: him once a week do you think this
dialog: would be happening to me?
text: She stops walking and stares out over the River.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Have you ever seen animals make love,
dialog: Mr. Dulaney? They have such passion
dialog: -- such savage emotion. They
text: struggle, and snarl, and claw, but
dialog: neither hurts the other. Not really.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No pain, no gain?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: We're not animals.
text: As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated.
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Of course we are. Our primal urges
dialog: are still there -- but we've taken
dialog: sex and intellectualized it, refined
dialog: it down to its most essential
dialog: components. It's bland, easy,
dialog: mechanical. There's great passion in
dialog: the struggle -- such craving in
dialog: denial. Do you know what it's like
dialog: to yearn for something? I'm not
dialog: talking about wanting, or needing.
dialog: I'm talking about an urge so deep
dialog: that your skin burns and every cell
dialog: in your body pulses with desire?
text: Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's
text: uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: I think we're getting a little off
dialog: the subject here.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I thought the subject was sex?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: As it pertains to you -- not me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you always know you had
dialog: different... tastes?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't know if it's something I can
dialog: explain to you.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Because -- it's beyond intellect.
dialog: It's emotion. It's passion. It has
dialog: to be experienced -- it can't be
dialog: imagined.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Try.
text: Rebecca thinks for a moment.
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: When I was growing up we had a
dialog: strawberry patch in our backyard. So
dialog: did this family down the road. I
dialog: used to sneak in their yard and steal
dialog: their strawberries. It wasn't easy.
dialog: The stone walls were high and I'd
dialog: scrape my knees as I climbed over.
dialog: On the other side were wild rose
dialog: bushes. The thorns would dig into my
dialog: legs and cut my thighs as I lowered
dialog: myself down.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: If you had what you wanted at home
dialog: why did you sneak into their yard?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Because -- somehow the fruit always
dialog: tasted that much sweeter because of
dialog: the pain it took to get to it.
text: Dulaney appears lost in her words. This isn't lost on Rebecca.
text: She walks off. Dulaney stares after her intrigued.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING
text: A light rain falls outside. Dulaney picks at his food. He
text: stares out the window. He seems oblivious to the conversation
dialog: between Sharon and Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Albert's got the stomach flu.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's too bad.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, it's not. Now I get to pitch.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Michael, you shouldn't be happy when
text: someone else isn't feeling well.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Not even if they're a dork?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Not even if they're a dork. You
dialog: should go by and see how he's
dialog: feeling.
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No way. Jerry Milner stopped by and
text: Albert puked right in front of him.
text: Sharon tries to suppress a grin.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Don't use language like that at the
dialog: dinner table.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sorry.
text: Sharon looks at Dulaney. He is still staring out the window,
text: deep in thought.
scene_heading: INT. DEN - EVENING
text: Dulaney is at his desk, looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of Marsh and the
text: bedroom. Sharon enters.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Frank -- I know you're busy, but
dialog: Michael asked me after dinner if you
dialog: were angry with him. He wanted to
dialog: know why you weren't talking to him.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'll talk to him later.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why don't you talk to him now?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Because I go to trial in seven weeks.
dialog: I've got a lot of preparing to do.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (angry)
dialog: No one's asking you not to work. I
dialog: just think you could make some time
dialog: for your son.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Michael lies on his bed, doing his homework. The door opens
text: and Dulaney enters and sits beside him.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm sorry if it looks like I'm not
dialog: paying attention to you lately.
dialog: 25
text: Michael looks at Dulaney somewhat confused. Dulaney tries to
dialog: explain it another way.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know how it is sometimes when
dialog: you're out playing ball with your
dialog: friends? How you're really
dialog: concentrating on what you're doing --
dialog: and you lose track of time and you
dialog: come home late and Mom yells at you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Well, that's kind of how I am right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Is Mom yelling at you too?
text: Dulaney grins.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yeah -- a little.
text: Dulaney leans over and hugs Michael.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I love you too, Dad.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: CHARLIE BIGGS is a tall, wiry black man. Street-wise, but
text: basically good humored. He is tossing a NERF BALL through a
text: basketball hoop mounted on the wall as Dulaney enters.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: How you doin' Mister D?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the
dialog: Marsh case?
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real
dialog: dog and pony show going on up there -
dialog: - I'll tell you, sometimes white
dialog: people are a real puzzle to me. I
dialog: mean, did this old guy really think
dialog: he was gonna be able to keep up with
dialog: a sweet little number like that?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: It could've happened to anyone.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: (ghetto accent)
dialog: I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever
dialog: heard of no brother dying from
dialog: gettin' too much pussy.
text: Dulaney grins in spite of himself.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: We have to find out who else would
dialog: profit from Marsh's death -- and who
dialog: knew enough about his personal life
dialog: to know that putting cocaine in the
dialog: nasal spray would be fatal.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: So -- where do we start?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I want you to hit all the dealers in
dialog: town. Give them a list of people
dialog: close to Marsh and see if any of them
dialog: use. Then I want you to check out a
text: Doctor Alan Paley. He lives up in
dialog: Roseburg.
text: Dulaney's SECRETARY'S VOICE crackles over the intercom.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (VO)
dialog: Mister Dulaney, I have Rebecca Lawson
dialog: on one.
text: Dulaney picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Hi... No, I don't... One o'clock is
dialog: fine... Alright La Brasa... Bye.
text: Dulaney hangs up. Biggs is staring at him with a grin.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: La Brasa?
dialog: 27
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: I'm taking a client to lunch. Where
dialog: should I go, Taco Bell?
text: Biggs tosses the ball to Dulaney, then raises his hands
text: indicating he is backing off. He leaves. Dulaney shoots from
dialog: his desk. SWOOSH!
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Dimly lit. Dark wood and leather. Dulaney sits at a table
text: with Rebecca. She removes a CIGARETTE and holds it, waiting
text: for Dulaney to light it. Dulaney fumbles through his pockets
text: and removes a book of MATCHES. He lights one. Rebecca doesn't
text: lean forward to meet him. He must go to her. She looks into
text: his eyes as she cups her hand over his. A beat. She lights
text: the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and
text: blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling. SHE DOES NOT BLOW
text: OUT THE MATCH OR REMOVE HER HAND FROM DULANEY'S. She watches
text: him as it burns down towards his fingers. After a long moment
text: she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How'd you meet Marsh?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I was at a cocktail party. Very
dialog: trendy. Andrew was in Chicago on
dialog: business. He had broken his wrist
dialog: the week before and was wearing it in
text: a sling. He looked so helpless.
text: A FOURSOME a few tables away are staring at her. Rebecca sees
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: -- And then?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We started talking. In fact, we
dialog: talked until four in the morning. We
dialog: discovered we shared a lot of the
dialog: same interests. After that we were
dialog: together all the time until he left.
dialog: He used to call me every night after
dialog: he came back. Then after a few weeks
dialog: he invited me to come visit him.
dialog: I've never left.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Why didn't you live together?
dialog: 28
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Andrew was worried about how it would
dialog: look.
text: A COUPLE in a booth are looking at Rebecca and whispering.
text: Rebecca and Dulaney notice them.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Can we get out of here?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Sure. Where to?
text: Rebecca stands up. She doesn't answer. She just walks off.
scene_heading: EXT. REBECCA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Dulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's. They get out.
text: Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: This is your house.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (walking towards the
dialog: door)
dialog: I know.
text: Dulaney stops.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I don't think this is a good idea.
text: Rebecca stops and turns towards him.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Because, I'm your attorney. I
dialog: shouldn't be going to your house.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Is it against the law?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No -- it just doesn't look right.
text: Rebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street
text: to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No one's looking.
dialog: 29
text: She walks to her front door and opens it. She enters, leaving
text: the door open. Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Dulaney enters. Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room.
text: Her back is to Dulaney, but she knows he is there. Dulaney
text: looks around the room. He stares at a group of PHOTOGRAPHS on
text: the wall. On the other WALL is a GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN.
scene_heading: DULANEY'S POV - OF THE WALL
text: filled with EROTIC PAINTINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS -- sensual but not
dialog: vulgar.
text: Rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies
dialog: the artwork.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I think the photographer's probably a
dialog: voyeur.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm the photographer.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Oh -- Well, they're different.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That's not an answer.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: It's not my taste.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (seductively)
dialog: Tastes can change.
text: Rebecca looks up to the top of a high cabinet. Sitting on top
text: of the cabinet is a WHITE PERSIAN CAT.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: There you are.
text: She stands on her tip toes as she reaches up. Dulaney watches
text: her -- the arch of her back -- the hem of her skirt rising up
text: her legs. She lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and
text: sits down. The slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs.
text: Dulaney's eyes trace along them. Rebecca notes his gaze.
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What are you thinking?
text: Dulaney looks up quickly.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Not true. Shall I tell you what you
dialog: were thinking? You were wondering if
dialog: I was wearing anything under my
dialog: skirt.
text: The fact that he doesn't protest confirms that she is right.
text: She runs her finger lightly along her thighs.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I am.
text: Dulaney walks to the window and stares out. Rebecca seems
text: amused. She puts the cat down and walks over to him.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sorry. I wasn't trying to embarrass
dialog: you.
text: He slowly turns towards her.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yes you were.
text: Dulaney stares at her for a moment, then places his briefcase
text: on the table and opens it.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON STRAWBERRIES - NIGHT
text: A fork digs into a large strawberry. PULL BACK as we follow
text: the strawberry into Sharon's mouth.
text: Dulaney sits across from Sharon. His eyes are on the
dialog: strawberries. His mind is someplace else -- and it isn't hard
dialog: to guess where.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: --he said it might be too expensive
dialog: to add another room. He suggested we
dialog: might convert the garage into a guest
dialog: room. He's going to check with the
dialog: contractor and let me know. I'll let
dialog: you know how much and we can decide.
dialog: Alright?
dialog: 31
text: Dulaney looks up slowly. It is not so much that he has heard
dialog: the question -- it is more that he is aware that Sharon has
text: stopped talking. A beat. Sharon isn't sure he has heard her.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Is that alright, Frank?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yeah -- fine. Excuse me. I'll be
dialog: right back.
text: He stands and leaves the table.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT, HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Dulaney walks to a PAY PHONE near the bathrooms. He thinks for
text: a moment, then dials a number. Rebecca answers.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (VO)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Hi. It's Frank.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (VO)
dialog: Hi, Frank.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: I just wanted to see if my secretary
dialog: called to confirm your appointment
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (VO)
dialog: Yes -- she did.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Great. I'll see you at the office at
dialog: nine.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (VO)
dialog: No -- not at the office. I've got a
dialog: better idea.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN, KLAMATH LAKE - AFTERNOON
text: An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake. Dulaney and
text: Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I figured if we have to talk all day
dialog: we might as well do it someplace
dialog: nice.
dialog: 32
dialog: (looks at the cabin)
dialog: Isn't it beautiful?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Andrew loved this old cabin.
dialog: (fondly remembering)
dialog: He always dreamed about moving to
dialog: Tahiti -- living in a hut and
dialog: becoming a beach-bum.
dialog: (a sad smile)
dialog: I could never imagine myself doing
dialog: that -- but somehow when he talked
dialog: about it, he made it sound so alive -
dialog: - so wonderful. Soft ocean breezes
dialog: and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the
dialog: world and it's problems behind. I
dialog: wish he'd had a chance to do it.
text: Her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant
dialog: memory.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (snapping out of it)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: It's okay.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK
text: Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore. A soft wind blows
dialog: through her hair.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Tell me about Doctor Paley?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I hardly know him. He wanted me and
dialog: he couldn't have me.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: It's going to be hard to convince a
dialog: jury that he's testifying against you
dialog: in a murder trial because you blew
dialog: him off.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: It won't be that hard.
dialog: 33
text: She walks off.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN - DUSK
text: Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Did you always want to be a lawyer?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No -- I wanted to be a professional
dialog: hockey player.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That seems so far away from who you
dialog: are now. What happened?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I broke my ankle skating. That ended
dialog: that dream.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't
dialog: it? To let go of what you want?
text: Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light
text: of the setting sun. Their eyes meet. He starts to lean in
text: towards her -- then stops. He gets up and walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Rebecca's car pulls up in front. Dulaney gets out.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm going to put the car away. You
dialog: can let yourself in. There's a key
text: under the flower pot.
text: Rebecca drives to the rear of the building. Dulaney walks to
text: the door. He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens
text: the door and goes inside.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DOWN THE STREET
text: Detective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house. He
text: glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad.
dialog: 34
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: Rebecca walks over to the STEREO and turns on the CASSETTE
text: PLAYER. The room fills with soft, sexy MUSIC. Dulaney stands
text: in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yes -- it would be nice.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What would?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You and me -- making love.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Is that what you think I was
dialog: thinking?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No -- that's what I know you were
dialog: thinking.
text: Before Dulaney can start to protest she continues. She slowly
text: walks behind him. Dulaney stares straight ahead.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: How often do you make love to your
dialog: wife, Frank? Once a week? Sometimes
dialog: twice? There once was passion,
dialog: wasn't there? But now it's bland,
dialog: predictable. Tell me, when you do it
dialog: -- do you always think of her? Or do
dialog: you wonder what it would be like to
dialog: be with someone else? Someone wild.
dialog: Someone who would force you to lose
dialog: control.
text: Her words strip his thoughts bare. He is vulnerable.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There's nothing wrong in admitting
dialog: that you want me, Frank.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You take a lot for granted.
text: Dulaney starts for the door. Rebecca's cool exterior fades,
text: giving way to her vulnerable side.
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Please stay, Frank. I don't want to
dialog: be alone. I don't expect anything
dialog: from you -- no demands -- no
dialog: complications. I just need to feel
dialog: close to someone.
text: Dulaney turns back towards her. A beat. He thinks for a
text: moment, then walks back into the room. Rebecca smiles warmly,
dialog: invitingly.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'll be back in a minute. Help
dialog: yourself to a drink.
text: She disappears down the hall. Dulaney stands were he is,
text: wondering what he is doing there. He walks over to the BAR and
text: pours a SCOTCH. He looks down the hall.
speaker_heading: HIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOM
text: The bedroom door is open. The room is DARK -- Lit only by the
text: moon. Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head.
text: MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her. She runs her
text: hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her
text: round, full breasts. She stops for a moment -- and we sense
text: she knows Dulaney is watching her.
text: Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized. He knows he should turn
text: away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look.
text: One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing
text: her sheer, white panties. She bends forward slightly and
text: slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of
dialog: them.
text: We can see the desire on Dulaney's face. He looks away. The
text: conflict inside him grows. He looks back.
text: Rebecca walks into the hall. She is barefoot -- wearing a
text: long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's. If she wasn't
text: aware he was watching her before -- she is now. It doesn't
text: seem to bother her. She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes
dialog: inviting his.
text: Dulaney moves towards her. They meet in the middle of the
text: room. She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can
text: smell her. She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to
text: bring his lips to hers. The longing overcomes him. He kisses
text: her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs
text: him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back. She bites
dialog: his lip.
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: My way.
text: Dulaney ignores her. He tries to kiss her again. She turns
text: her head away.
text: She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door.
text: Dulaney follows. He tries the door -- it's locked. He starts
text: to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room.
text: He starts to leave -- stops. He looks at the bedroom door.
text: His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him. He moves
text: quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination. He
text: breaks the door open with his shoulder.
text: Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting
text: for him. He moves to her. She can see the fire in his eyes.
text: He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --
text: feeding his craving for her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: My way.
text: He is lost within her now and doesn't hear her. She pulls his
text: hair, jerking his head back. Her eyes command him to follow
dialog: her demand.
text: Something in him snaps -- a new door opens. He pushes her back
text: onto the DRESSING CABINET. He kisses her, running his hand up
text: her thighs, hiking up her dress. She wraps her legs around his
text: waist. They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and
text: bottles to the floor. He lifts her -- carries her to the bed -
text: - lays her down and rips her dress from her body. Their
text: passion is unleased. They grope and claw for one another
text: hungrily. She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the
text: shoulder. His face tenses from the pain, but he MOANS with
dialog: pleasure.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Dark. Sharon is asleep. The door opens and Dulaney enters
text: quietly. He walks towards the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Dulaney splashes a handful of water across his face. He
text: unbuttons his shirt and takes it off -- wincing as he does. He
text: turns his back to the mirror. Several deep FINGERNAIL SCRAPES
text: are dug into his back. He looks at himself in the mirror.
dialog: 37
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, LAW OFFICES - MORNING
text: Dulaney and Biggs walk down the hall to a water cooler. Biggs
text: pours himself a glass.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Before you ask there's nothing new on
dialog: the coke.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You've got to get me something I can
dialog: use, Charlie.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: I'm trying.
text: Sattler walks over with another MAN. He ignores Biggs.
speaker_heading: SATTLER
dialog: Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from
dialog: the L.A. Times. He'd like to ask you
dialog: a few questions.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: It's an incredible story going on
dialog: here.
dialog: (as if quoting a
dialog: headline)
dialog: Woman accused of using sex to kill
dialog: lover.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: I'll say -- it's gonna give a whole
dialog: new meaning to the state nickname.
text: Biggs LAUGHS and walks off. Sattler glares at him. Dulaney
dialog: smirks.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What's the state nickname?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: The Beaver State.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
text: Rows of new Town Houses line the street. Dulaney drives up and
text: walks towards the front door of one of them. He KNOCKS.
text: JOANNE BRASLOW answers. She stares at Dulaney innocently.
dialog: 38
scene_heading: INT. JOANNE'S TOWN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Sparsely decorated. Very trendy. High tech furniture and
text: designer lights. Joanne sits on the couch -- Dulaney on one of
text: the chairs. There is COFFEE on the table.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years.
dialog: He was a good man -- until she came
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What changed?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: He did. Look, I know you can lead a
dialog: horse to water but you can't make him
dialog: drink -- but you hold a pail of water
text: in front of an old horse for long
dialog: enough -- and well...
text: Joanne stops as emotion fills her. Her eyes well with tears.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You don't really believe what the
dialog: district attorney is saying about
dialog: Miss Lawson, do you?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I don't know. It's incredible to
dialog: think that anyone could be capable of
dialog: doing that -- but if anyone could it
dialog: would be Rebecca.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I take it you don't like Miss Lawson
dialog: very much?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I really don't know her that well.
dialog: We would say hello to each other when
dialog: I would come to the house, but that
dialog: was about it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: If you don't know her that well what
dialog: makes you think she's capable of
dialog: murder?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but
dialog: he was thirty years older than her.
dialog: Where's the attraction to sleep with
dialog: someone like that -- to have the kind
dialog: of sex they had.
dialog: 39
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How do you know what kind of sex they
dialog: had?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole
dialog: if that's what you're thinking. I'd
dialog: come to house sometimes to pick up
dialog: papers or speak to Andrew. I'd find
text: their little toys all over the place.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What about Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes -- cocaine.
text: Dulaney is shocked by this.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I was at the house one morning -- I
dialog: thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with
dialog: Mr. Marsh. When I went into the
dialog: guest bathroom she was standing in
dialog: front of the mirror pouring this
text: white powder out of a vial.
text: Dulaney looks like he's been kicked in the stomach.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Is something wrong.
text: A beat. Dulaney looks at her slowly.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What? No -- nothing. Thank you for
dialog: your time.
text: He gets up and walks to the door. Joanne stands and stares
text: after him with a trace of a grin.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Rebecca opens the front door and Dulaney barges into the room.
dialog: 40
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You lied to me!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I just left Joanne Braslow. She told
dialog: me she saw you doing cocaine at
dialog: Marsh's house!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: She's mistaken.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (Yelling)
dialog: That's not good enough, Goddamit!
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It isn't true. You have to believe
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No, I don't have to believe you. The
dialog: jury has to believe you and answers
dialog: like he's lying or she's mistaken
dialog: aren't going to convince them.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't use cocaine anymore. If she
dialog: says she saw me doing it she's lying.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Why would she lie?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I don't know, Frank -- but don't you
dialog: think that's something we should find
dialog: out?
text: Dulaney is confused, struggling to decide if he believes her.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, DULANEY HOUSE - DAY
text: Sharon is getting a load of washing ready. She picks up one of
text: Dulaney's tee shirts and notices several thin stripes of BLOOD
text: near the shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: RAIN falls. Dulaney enters the room to find Michael on the
text: PHONE. Dulaney appears nervous -- anxious.
dialog: 41
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Michael -- get off the phone.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Because I'm expecting a call.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: -- But it's Sunday.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: I know what day it is! Get off the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (hurt; into phone)
dialog: I gotta go. I'll call you later.
text: Michael hangs up and leaves the room. Dulaney stares at the
text: phone -- struggling against himself. He picks it up and dials.
speaker_heading: REBECCA'S VOICE
dialog: This is Rebecca Lawson. I'm not in
dialog: right now. So if you please leave a
dialog: message--
text: Dulaney slams down the phone. He checks his watch.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Dulaney wears another tee shirt as he sleeps. Sharon is awake,
text: staring up at the ceiling. A beat. She rolls over and
text: carefully lifts up Dulaney's tee shirt. She sees the scratches
text: on his back. She does not wake him. She just lays there, deep
dialog: in thought.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, COURTHOUSE - MORNING
text: Rebecca walks down the hall. In the b.g. we see Dulaney
text: walking quickly to join her.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I called you all weekend. Where were
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I went out on the boat.
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Alone?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - MORNING
text: The gallery is crowded with REPORTERS and SPECTATORS. Dulaney
text: sits beside Rebecca at the defense table. Cardenas stands
dialog: before the jury.
text: Dulaney and Cardenas are seated at their respective tables.
text: Rebecca sits beside Dulaney. She is wearing a beautiful, well
text: tailored dress. She looks beautiful and has surprisingly made
text: no attempt to down-play her looks.
text: JUDGE BURNHAM, a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits behind
dialog: the bench. He is strong-willed -- tough but fair. There is a
text: rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: This trial by its very nature is
dialog: explosive. The press is going to
dialog: have a field day and I will not
dialog: tolerate any activity in my courtroom
dialog: that will fuel it.
dialog: (to Dulaney and
dialog: Cardenas)
dialog: Both of you are going to be delving
dialog: into very personal aspects of peoples
dialog: lives. I warn you now. When you do
dialog: so -- if you cannot establish a clear
dialog: line of relevancy early on in your
dialog: examinations I will stop you. Is
dialog: that clear?
text: Dulaney and Cardenas both nod.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mr. Cardenas.
text: Cardenas stands and walks towards the JURY.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: (points to Rebecca)
dialog: You all can see the defendant,
dialog: Rebecca Lawson. But as this trial
dialog: proceeds you will see that she is not
dialog: only the defendant -- she is the
dialog: murder weapon itself.
dialog: 43
dialog: (stops and thinks for
dialog: a moment)
dialog: Is that possible? Can a person
dialog: actually be a weapon? The answer is
dialog: yes. If I hit you and you die -- I
dialog: am the cause of your death. But can
dialog: sex be called a weapon? Yes. And
dialog: what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson
dialog: made of it. The State will prove
dialog: that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh
dialog: -- that she put increasing sexual
text: demands on him while she secretly
dialog: administered cocaine. All the while
dialog: knowing that he had a severe heart
dialog: condition.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She is a beautiful woman -- but when
dialog: this trial is over you will see her
dialog: no differently than a gun, or a knife
dialog: or any other instrument used as a
dialog: weapon. She is a killer. And the
dialog: worst kind -- one who disguised
dialog: herself as a loving partner.
text: Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mr. Dulaney?
text: Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I know what you're thinking -- and
dialog: it's a mistake. You look at Miss
dialog: Lawson and you see a beautiful woman
dialog: who was involved with an older man --
dialog: and you think she looks like the
dialog: type. She could've done it. And
dialog: that's exactly what the District
dialog: Attorney wants you to think. Yes,
dialog: she is beautiful. So what? Does
dialog: that make her a killer? Of course
dialog: not. This case is not about
dialog: appearances. It's about facts.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you
dialog: will see that there are very few
dialog: facts -- that the bulk of the States
dialog: evidence is circumstantial. I'm
dialog: confident that by the conclusion of
dialog: this trial you will not just have a
dialog: reasonable doubt. You will have no
dialog: doubt at all -- that Rebecca Lawson
dialog: is innocent of the charges against
dialog: her.
dialog: 44
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER - DAY
text: McCurdy is on the witness stand. Cardenas stands before him.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of
dialog: death?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
text: A massive cardiac arrest.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What was Mr. Marsh's physical
dialog: condition prior to his death?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: Very poor. He was suffering from
dialog: severe arterial disease.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Was the heart attack the result of
dialog: natural causes?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What induced it?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: We found a high concentration of
dialog: cocaine in his blood.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: I don't think so. The membrane in
dialog: his nasal passage didn't show any
dialog: sign of long time usage.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Then how did it get into his body?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: We found a bottle of Dristan nasal
dialog: spray on the nightstand. It was
text: filled with water and cocaine. Mr.
dialog: Marsh had a head cold at the time of
dialog: his death. I believe he wasn't aware
dialog: that he was ingesting cocaine.
dialog: 45
text: Cardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG. He
text: brings it over to McCurdy.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Is this the bottle that was found on
dialog: the nightstand?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: (examines it)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Your Honor, the State enters this
dialog: evidence as exhibit A.
dialog: (to McCurdy)
dialog: Were any fingerprints found on the
dialog: bottle?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb
dialog: print of Miss Lawson's.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to
dialog: someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: Increase his heart rate.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: -- And if he were in the midst of
dialog: making love while under the influence
dialog: of cocaine?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: It would be an added stress to his
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What would be the effect if someone
dialog: secretly administered cocaine to Mr.
dialog: Marsh and then induced him to make
dialog: love?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: It would be the same as shooting a
text: gun at him.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.
dialog: (to Dulaney)
dialog: Your witness.
dialog: 46
text: Rebecca looks at Dulaney for his opinion of McCurdy's
text: testimony. Dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he
text: stands up and approaches McCurdy.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Can you say with any certainty that
dialog: Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine
dialog: himself?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: No -- but it seems highly unlikely
dialog: that a man in his condition would use
dialog: cocaine.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: That's your opinion, Doctor -- but
dialog: I'm asking you if there is any
dialog: scientific test that can tell who
dialog: actually put the cocaine into the
dialog: Dristan bottle?
speaker_heading: MCCURDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER - DAY
text: Cardenas stands before DOCTOR TRAMMEL, a thin, pasty-faced man
dialog: in his fifties.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Doctor Trammel, when did you first
dialog: diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart
dialog: disease?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
dialog: About a year and half ago.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle
dialog: after that?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
dialog: Yes -- he stopped smoking and
dialog: drinking and exercised regularly.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: He did everything he could to take
dialog: care of his heart?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 47
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
dialog: Marsh to your office?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Just one last question. What does
dialog: the sign on your office door say?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
text: Doctor Steven Trammel. Cardiologist.
text: Cardenas walks back to his seat, signaling his examination of
text: the witness is over. Dulaney stands.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to
dialog: Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's
dialog: condition?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he
dialog: had spoken to Miss Lawson about his
dialog: illness?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
dialog: Marsh inside during his examinations?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Then you have no way of knowing what
dialog: Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the
dialog: reasons for his visits?
speaker_heading: DR. TRAMMEL
dialog: No. No, I don't.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

speaker_heading: CARDENAS

dialog: secretary?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Six years.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS

speaker_heading: JOANNE

speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What about Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Tell the court about that, please.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I opened the bathroom door one day
dialog: and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine
dialog: out of a vial.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before
dialog: his death?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: How did he look?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
text: Horrible. He was tired and pale.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What did Mr. Marsh say?
dialog: 49
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: He was worried. He said that she was
dialog: acting stranger and stranger. He
dialog: said that if this kept up she was
dialog: going to kill him. That his heart
dialog: couldn't take it.
text: There is an audible BUZZ from the crowd. For the first time
text: Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with

speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (to Dulaney)
dialog: Your witness.
text: Cardenas sits down. Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards
dialog: Joanne.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How do you know it was cocaine that
dialog: Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: What other kind of white powder do
dialog: people keep in a vial?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Do you remember the date when you saw
dialog: Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes--
dialog: (thinks a moment)
dialog: It was on a Friday. I remember
dialog: because I was going to visit my
dialog: sister for her birthday. It would be
dialog: October twenty-eighth.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Could you repeat the last part of
dialog: what Mr. Marsh said to you the day
dialog: before his death?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: He said that if it kept up she was
dialog: going to kill him. That his heart
dialog: couldn't take it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that
dialog: Miss Lawson felt bored here and was
dialog: thinking about going back to Chicago
dialog: for awhile?
dialog: 50
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes -- he mentioned it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: So, the woman he loved passionately
dialog: was thinking about leaving. That
dialog: must cause tremendous anxiety.
dialog: Sleepless nights. Incredible stress.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: So, isn't it possible that he was
dialog: confiding in you about the pain he
dialog: was feeling about losing what might
dialog: be his last chance for love? That
dialog: what he really was saying was that
dialog: the uncertainty of her leaving was
dialog: driving him crazy and if it didn't
dialog: stop it was going to kill him. That
dialog: if she did leave his heart couldn't
dialog: take it.
text: THE JURY waits anxiously for her answer.
text: Joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks. She appears
dialog: confused.
speaker_heading: JOANNE

speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Well, think about it. Isn't it

speaker_heading: REBECCA

text: her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around.
text: Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of
text: her car. She takes one of the shoes and hits the PARKING LOT
text: OVERHEAD LIGHT FIXTURE. The BULB breaks sending the area in
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: She steps down and kisses him again. For a moment he tries to
dialog: resist.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I want you inside me.
text: His desire fills him. He pushes her back onto the hood of her

text: and unbuttons his pants.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The room is dimly lit. Dulaney is in bed. He appears to be

text: and carrying a tea service on a tray. He places it on the bed
text: and sits beside him.
speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: REBECCA

dialog: touch me. No one can. I've thought
dialog: it all out.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (sits up; very
dialog: concerned)
dialog: What does that mean? You've been
dialog: thinking about the case? Or you
dialog: thought everything out before you
dialog: killed Marsh?
text: The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face. She looks
text: away from him. A beat. Dulaney thinks. He feels bad for
dialog: asking such a question.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: (she doesn't look at
dialog: him)
dialog: Rebecca -- I'm sorry. Really.
text: He takes her hand. She slowly looks at him and smiles. She
text: points to the tea service.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Sugar or honey?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Honey.
text: She lifts a PLASTIC BOTTLE of HONEY and starts to pour it into
text: a cup. She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney, then parts
text: her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her
text: thigh. She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently
text: pulls him forward. He kisses her knee and slowly runs his
text: tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards. She
text: arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from the
dialog: pleasure of his touch.

text: Doctor Paley stands and walks towards the witness stand.
scene_heading: CARDENAS AND PALEY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Paley has been sworn in. Cardenas examines him.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: At a dinner party -- about eight
dialog: months ago.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did you ever see her again after
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: Yes -- several times.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What eventually happened to your
dialog: relationship with Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: We stopped seeing each other.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: Well -- I realized that she wasn't
dialog: interested in me. She was just
dialog: trying to get information out of me.
dialog: 54
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What kind of information?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: She said that she was working on a
dialog: novel and she wanted to know what
dialog: kinds of drugs would be harmful to
dialog: someone with a bad heart.
text: WHISPERS from the crowd fill the room.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did you suggest any?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: Yes -- Insulin and others.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What did she say?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: She said that those weren't any good
dialog: -- because their use would be
dialog: detected and the police would know
dialog: the victim had been poisoned. She
dialog: wanted to know if there was a drug
dialog: that would induce a heart attack but
dialog: could also be used to enhance a
dialog: sexual high.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: -- And what did you suggest?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: Cocaine.
text: More GASPS from the crowd. Rebecca's remains calm, but her
text: eyes glare at Paley hatefully.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: (to Dulaney)
dialog: Your witness.
text: Cardenas sits down. Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Dr. Paley, where were you the last
dialog: time you saw Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: We had dinner at a restaurant.
dialog: 55
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Isn't it true that later that night
dialog: you tried to force yourself on Miss
dialog: Lawson in the parking lot?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You didn't grab her and try to kiss
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: If necessary I can bring in the valet
dialog: parking attendant and two customers
dialog: who witnessed the occurrence.
text: Paley thinks for a moment. He is nervous.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: Well -- as I remember it, we had an
dialog: argument.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: And the argument was about the fact
dialog: that you wanted to be romantically
dialog: involved and she did not.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: And after that didn't you
dialog: continuously harass Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: No.
text: Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER from a
dialog: cardboard box.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss
dialog: Lawson's answering machine. I would
dialog: like to play it now.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Objection. Your Honor, we don't know
dialog: where this tape is from. Who made it
dialog: -- or under what circumstances it was
dialog: made.
dialog: 56
text: Dulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the bench.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: These are reports from two
dialog: independent audio labs. They each
dialog: state that the voices were recorded
dialog: over the phone and that no
dialog: alterations have been made.
dialog: Judge Burnham studies the paper.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: I'll allow it.
text: Dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the PLAY BUTTON. We
dialog: HEAR a BEEP, then...
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY'S VOICE
dialog: Rebecca -- I know you're there,
dialog: Godammit. Answer the phone, you
dialog: bitch! You can't treat me like this!
text: We HEAR a PHONE slam down. Another BEEP.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY'S VOICE
dialog: You want to play games with me? Who
dialog: the fuck do you think you are? Okay -
dialog: - we'll play. You'll be sorry.
text: Dulaney stops the machine. He takes a dramatic pause, letting
text: the words on the tape sink in.
text: Cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration.
text: Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (quoting)
dialog: You'll be sorry?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: I was angry.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You're still angry, aren't you?
dialog: Isn't it true that your whole story
dialog: is nothing more than a vindictive
dialog: attempt on your behalf to get back at
dialog: Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: No -- she asked me about cocaine.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I suggest it never happened.
dialog: 57
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: You can suggest anything you want.
dialog: It happened.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No further questions.
text: Dr. Paley's temper explodes. He is a loose cannon.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: I may have been infatuated with her -
dialog: - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: That's all Dr. Paley.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: RAIN FALLS, streaking along the bedroom windows. CANDLES light
text: the room. Dulaney and Rebecca are on the bed. She sits on top
text: of him, writhing back and forth -- lost in the rhythm of their
dialog: love making.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON DULANEY - LATER
text: He is asleep, laying on his back -- the sheets pulled up to his
text: waist. LIGHTNING FLASHES outside -- a CLAP of THUNDER follows.
text: He stirs and wakes up.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Rebecca, who is standing
text: over him in a sexy silk ROBE. Dulaney starts to sit up but
text: something restrains him. He is HANDCUFFED to the BRASS HEAD
speaker_heading: BOARD.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What the... What are you doing?
text: She sits next to him -- looks at him fondly -- gently strokes
text: his face with her hand.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Rebecca -- take these off.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Tonight we open new doors.
dialog: 58
text: She slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach -- to his
text: chest. Dulaney follows it with his eyes. Rebecca picks up a
text: LARGE CANDLE on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back and
text: forth over his chest.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What are you going you doing?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Are you scared?
text: He doesn't answer. He doesn't have to. She can see the fear
text: in his eyes. She tilts the candle -- a stream of WAX pours out
text: on his chest. Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on
text: the bed, his hands straining against his restraints.
text: She smiles -- a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a
text: thin trail of LITTLE BEADS that moves down his chest towards
text: his stomach. Dulaney's face cringes. He stares at her through
text: eyes filled with fear.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I love you, Frank. I love your
dialog: strength -- be strong for me now.
text: She continues to pour the wax in little BEADS, filling his
text: navel and working her way towards his groin.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Rebecca -- please. No more.
text: Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I told you in the beginning that it
dialog: was my way. My way can be many
dialog: things -- pleasure or pain.
text: She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn.
text: He tenses as she pours it on his chest. -- then relaxes when
text: he realizes it's water. He breathes a SIGH of relief.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You see how life is, Frank? We judge
dialog: things. We look at things from the
dialog: outside and assume we know what's on
dialog: the inside.
text: She takes a sip from the bottle.
dialog: 59
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Water. But you assumed it was
dialog: vinegar -- because you were only
text: looking at the outside.
text: Her meaning isn't lost on Dulaney. She watches him -- as if
text: studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly, she pulls on the
text: belt of her ROBE. The robe parts revealing the beauty of her
text: body. She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her
text: breasts against him. Dulaney's breathing quickens in
text: excitement. Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his
text: burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach.
text: She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON DULANEY
text: he stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion. Soon
text: the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him. His eyes
text: close. The pain that only moments ago filled his body is
dialog: replaced with pleasure.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It's late. Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs. A
text: LIGHT comes on. Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Late night?
text: Her voice startles Dulaney.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yeah -- what are you doing up?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: We have to talk.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: That's what I was hoping you'd tell
dialog: me.
text: Dulaney enters the living room.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Sharon, it's late. Can we get to the
dialog: point?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Where have you been?
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Working. Charlie and I were going
dialog: over some statements.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Charlie called at eleven thirty
dialog: looking for you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You were with her, weren't you?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why did you lie to me?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Because I knew you'd think exactly
dialog: what you're thinking.
text: Sharon springs off the couch.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: This isn't a courtroom. Don't try to
dialog: turn this around on me.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It's bad enough that you are. It's
dialog: even worse that you can stand here
dialog: and lie to me.
text: She starts to walks out of the room. Dulaney grabs her by the
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Sharon...
text: She swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at
text: him angrily, her eyes filled with tears.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You bastard! Do you think I'm some
dialog: kind of idiot? That I don't have
dialog: fuckin' eyes. I see. I feel. I
dialog: hurt.
dialog: 61
text: She walks out of the room, leaving Dulaney alone with his
dialog: thoughts.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: ESTER CRAWFORD is on the stand. She is a BLACK WOMAN in her
dialog: thirties -- thin and tired-looking, although we get the
text: impression she once was pretty. She is dressed in what is
text: obviously her Sunday dress. Cardenas questions her.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's
dialog: maid for nine years?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever
dialog: argue?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: Like cats and dogs.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What did they argue about?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: You name it -- they argued about it.
dialog: Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her
dialog: happy -- but it seemed that no matter
dialog: what he did it was never enough for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did they argue the day before he
dialog: died?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: Well -- he died on a Sunday and I
dialog: have the weekends off -- but they
dialog: were ripping at each other with both
dialog: barrels Friday afternoon.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What was the nature of the argument?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: Sex.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Could you be more specific?
dialog: 62
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: She was calling Mr. Marsh an old man
dialog: -- making discourteous insinuations
dialog: about his sexual abilities. She said
dialog: that she had needs and that if he
dialog: couldn't fulfill them she'd find
dialog: someone who could.
text: Dulaney jots down a note. Cardenas continues.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
dialog: cocaine?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: No -- never.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: (to Dulaney)
dialog: Your witness.
text: Cardenas sits down. Dulaney approaches Ester with a smile.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: High school?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs
dialog: Crawford's educational background has
dialog: to do with this case.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I was just about to make my point,
dialog: Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (reading from note
dialog: pad)
dialog: "Discourteous insinuations about his
dialog: sexual abilities." Who told you to
dialog: say that?
dialog: 63
text: Ester doesn't answer, but her eyes drift past Dulaney and focus
text: on Troxell. Dulaney follows her stare.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Did Mr. Troxell help you with that
dialog: phrase?
text: Troxell and Cardenas squirm a little.
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: I heard him say it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Then -- those are not your own words?
speaker_heading: ESTER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What else did the District Attorney's
dialog: Office tell you to say?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Objection, Your Honor. The fact that
dialog: Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell
dialog: reconstruct her sentence and decided
dialog: to rephrase her words in a more
dialog: intelligent manner for the court
dialog: doesn't mean the incident never
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (to Cardenas)
dialog: I'm just curious to see if Mr.
dialog: Troxell reconstructed anything else.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Your Honor -- please!
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: I'll see both of you in my chambers.
dialog: Right now.
scene_heading: INT. JUDGE BURNHAM'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Judge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his
text: desk. Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him.
dialog: 64
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mr. Dulaney, before you cast
dialog: aspersions on the District Attorney's
dialog: Office by suggesting they've coaxed
dialog: this witness to say things that
dialog: aren't true -- you better have more
dialog: than a hunch. Do you?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Maybe you don't know what it's like
dialog: where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but
dialog: I do. I came from a neighborhood
dialog: just like hers. This is a whole
dialog: other world for her. She's a poor
dialog: working woman who has been thrust
text: into a room full of highly educated
dialog: and mostly unsympathetic people. So,
text: she puts on her best dress, fixes her
text: hair and tries to present herself as
dialog: intelligently as possible.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Being poor and having pride is not a
dialog: crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you
dialog: attempt to impeach another witness'
dialog: testimony in my courtroom -- your
dialog: foundations better be based on
dialog: something other than semantics.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON
text: Dulaney walks down the steps. Cardenas joins him.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: I'm surprised you can walk after the
dialog: way Burnham chewed your ass out this
dialog: afternoon.
text: Cardenas grins. His comment was meant as a friendly jab
text: between old friends. Dulaney doesn't see it that way.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: I've got work to do.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Hey -- the bell's sounded. It's
dialog: between rounds.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I didn't hear it.
dialog: 65
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What's happening to you, Frank?
dialog: You're acting like you're on trial
dialog: here. This has become personal to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Back off, John.
text: Cardenas studies him for a moment.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
text: Dulaney forces a laugh. It's not a very convincing one.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: That's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: I'm talking to you as a friend now.
dialog: Don't ruin your life, your career for
dialog: her. She'll spit you out when this
dialog: is over.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Really? What does an attorney speak
dialog: to his client about at her house
dialog: until three o'clock in the morning?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You've been following me?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Her. It's an obvious move. I'm
dialog: building a case against her,
dialog: remember?
text: Something in Dulaney snaps. He grabs Cardenas and pushes him
text: up against the wall. Cardenas pushes back.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: If your head wasn't up your ass you
dialog: would have thought of it too. You're
dialog: losing perspective. Get out while
dialog: you can -- before she takes you down
dialog: with her.
dialog: 66
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
text: Dulaney walks towards his office. Biggs walks quickly down the
text: hall and joins him.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: I've been waiting for you to get
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You got something on the coke?
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: No -- but I got something.
text: Biggs steps into Dulaney's office. Dulaney follows.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the
text: couch. Dulaney sits at his desk.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: During lunch I was watching some of
dialog: Marsh's home videos.
text: Biggs clicks the control. On the TV we see Rebecca on top of
text: Marsh in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: He was really into recording this
dialog: stuff. The D.A.'s office found a box
dialog: full of tapes.
text: Watching Rebecca with Marsh bothers Dulaney.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: This girl has really got some moves,
dialog: huh?
text: Dulaney stands up and turns off the television.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: If you want to get your kicks go to a
text: video store and rent a porno movie.
text: Biggs studies Dulaney for a moment. Dulaney's reaction bothers
text: him. He turns the TV back on and fast forwards the tape. The
text: screen turns to SNOW where the tape has been recorded over.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: This tape was recorded over an
dialog: existing recording.
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Over what?
text: Biggs raises a hand signaling patience. SNOW still fills the
dialog: TV screen.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: I would have missed it -- but the
dialog: phone rang and I let it play while I
dialog: talked. It looks like blank tape --
dialog: but it isn't. It's been erased
text: without any input signal coming in.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: So, what good is it to us if it's
dialog: been erased?
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: It's very good -- because when the
dialog: D.A's office saw it they assumed it
dialog: was the end of the tape, otherwise
dialog: they would have buried it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Because it hasn't all been erased.
text: Biggs looks at the screen. A beat. The SNOW dissolves and a
text: picture fades in. The PICTURE LASTS only about five seconds.
text: We see Rebecca from the back as she straddles Marsh, grinding
text: up and down on the bed -- her hair flowing down her back.
text: Marsh raises his hand. His WRIST IS IN A CAST. She turns her
text: head to the side and as she does we see that it is not Rebecca
text: -- but Joanne Braslow. The Tape clicks off.
text: Dulaney stares at the blank screen.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (quoting Joanne)
dialog: Where's the attraction to sleep with
dialog: someone like that.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK
text: Joanne Braslow walks to her BMW 325i. She is about to open the
text: door when Dulaney approaches her.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I need to speak with you.
dialog: 68
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I don't think we have anything more
dialog: to talk about, Mr. Dulaney.
text: She starts to get in the car.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You were sleeping with Marsh.
text: She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this. There is now
text: a different quality to her -- an edge.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: He video taped you.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: That bastard!
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
text: Joanne doesn't appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in
dialog: her face.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes, I slept with him but that was a
dialog: long time ago.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You're lying. Marsh was wearing a
dialog: cast on the tape. It was right
dialog: before he went to Chicago and met
dialog: Miss Lawson. He dumped you for her,
dialog: didn't he?
text: Joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: It must have been horrible. Having
dialog: to go there -- seeing them together -
dialog: - knowing he was sleeping with her in
dialog: the same bed he did with you.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I was jealous. Of course I was hurt.
dialog: He switched me off like a little toy
dialog: he was finished playing with. But I
dialog: didn't kill him.
dialog: 69
text: Dulaney studies her.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney.
dialog: Killing Andrew wasn't in my best
dialog: interest. As it is I'm out of a job
dialog: and I'm not in his will.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Money isn't the only reason people
dialog: commit murder, Miss Braslow.
text: Dulaney walks off. Joanne stares after him. Her face is cold,
text: showing no sign of emotion.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: Dulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant. Cardenas
dialog: stands up.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: The State calls Jeffery Roston.
text: As soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense,
text: nervous. Dulaney notices it. He checks a list.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston
dialog: listed as a prosecution witness.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: The State's investigation just
dialog: uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday
dialog: afternoon in Chicago.
dialog: Judge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach the
dialog: bench.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover
dialog: of Miss Lawson's.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Why didn't the State's investigation
dialog: uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: He was away on an extended vacation
dialog: and just returned two days ago.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Alright -- I'm going to allow his
dialog: testimony.
dialog: 70
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: But Your Honor--
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: That's it, Mr. Dulaney. Take a seat.
text: Dulaney walks back to his chair. Rebecca appears genuinely
dialog: nervous.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: Cardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and
text: pepper hair in his late fifties.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Mr. Roston, what was your
dialog: relationship with Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: We were lovers.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: How long were you together?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: For about one year.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: How would you describe your sex life
dialog: with Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: Intense.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: I know this is a very personal
dialog: subject, but could you be a little
dialog: more specific?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: It was wild. She was constantly
dialog: trying to get me more and more worked
dialog: up -- kinky things. I tried to
dialog: satisfy her the best I could, but it
dialog: was difficult in my condition.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What kind of condition are you
dialog: referring to?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: I had a bad heart.
dialog: 71
text: There is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd. Cardenas waits,
dialog: giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of
dialog: Roston's last statement.
text: Dulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded. He tries to control his
text: surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't. He stares
text: ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the
dialog: testimony.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What happened next?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: I had bypass surgery.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: And how are you now?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: Fine. The doctors say if I keep
dialog: taking care of myself I can live to
dialog: be a very old man.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: How did your relationship with Miss
dialog: Lawson progress after the surgery?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: It didn't.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: She left me.
text: Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca. The anger and his
text: sense of betrayal show on his face.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Why did she say she was leaving?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: She didn't. She just left.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Why do you think she left you?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: Well -- I think that after the
dialog: operation she realized that...
text: It takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question. He
text: is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Roston's
dialog: testimony.
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Objection. The question calls for a
dialog: conclusion on the part of the
dialog: witness.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the
dialog: defendant for many months. I feel
dialog: that his opinion is valid in
dialog: substantiating the character of the
dialog: Miss Lawson.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: The opinion of a scorned lover is
dialog: hardly an objective view.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Objection sustained.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did Miss Lawson ever give you any
dialog: indication why she was leaving?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Objection. The witness has already
dialog: stated that Miss Lawson left without
dialog: an explanation.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on
dialog: to another line of questioning.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: When you say your sexual relations
dialog: with Miss Lawson were intense what
dialog: exactly do you mean?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: It was like she was trying to push me
dialog: as far as she could. She called it
dialog: opening new doors.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Can you give the court an example?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: It was like sex was a game to her.
dialog: She got off on the control. She
dialog: always used to tell me it had to be
dialog: her way.
text: This strikes a chord with Dulaney.
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's hard to resist a woman as
dialog: beautiful as she is.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What would she do that made it hard
dialog: to resist?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: She's a woman who is very much aware
dialog: of her own sexuality. Sometimes I
dialog: felt she could read my mind. It was
dialog: uncanny how she knew exactly what I
dialog: wanted. A few nights before my heart
dialog: surgery Rebecca woke me. She had
dialog: handcuffed me to the bed.
text: There are a few SNICKERS from the crowd. Dulaney is thinking
text: about the familiarity of Roston's testimony. Judge Burnham
text: BANGS his GAVEL. The crowd becomes silent.
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: She told me that tonight we were
dialog: going to open new doors. I asked her
dialog: to stop -- to take off the handcuffs,
dialog: but she wouldn't listen.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What did she say?
dialog: Roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of
dialog: his life.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Mr. Roston I know this is difficult
dialog: for you, but it's important you tell
dialog: the court what she did.
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: She said she was going to fuck me
dialog: like I've never been fucked before.
text: More noise from the Crowd. Judge Burnham is annoyed. He BANGS
dialog: his gavel again.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Due to the sensitive nature of this
dialog: witness' testimony and the inability
dialog: of the spectators to allow him to
dialog: complete it, I am clearing the
dialog: courtroom.
text: Sounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to usher
dialog: out the crowd.
dialog: 74
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM LATER
text: The gallery is empty. Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas,
dialog: Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials
dialog: remain.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: She started touching herself and
dialog: telling me how much she wanted me.
dialog: She reached down and put me inside
dialog: her. My doctor had warned me about
dialog: exerting myself -- but you really
dialog: don't think of those things at a
dialog: moment like that. You just think
dialog: about how beautiful this woman is --
dialog: how much you want her. How deeply
dialog: you want to please her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: At first it started off slowly -- but
dialog: the rhythm built and built. Every
dialog: time I got close to an orgasm she
dialog: would stop. Eventually I started to
dialog: have trouble breathing. Rebecca just
dialog: kept going -- faster and faster. No
dialog: matter what I said she wouldn't stop.
dialog: I really thought for a moment I was
dialog: going to die.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: If you knew it was bad for you why
dialog: did you do it?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: I couldn't help myself. You get lost
dialog: inside a women like her. It was like
dialog: a drug. It was the best sex I ever
dialog: had.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: What happened after that?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: I woke up the next morning and she
dialog: was gone.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Did you change your will while you
dialog: were with Miss Lawson?
dialog: 75
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Who was your primary beneficiary?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: She was.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Thank you. The State rests.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mister Dulaney?
text: Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought. He doesn't appear to
dialog: hear the question.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mister Dulaney?
text: Dulaney looks at the jury. What he sees isn't good. He thinks
text: for a moment. He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca.
text: We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated.
text: Rebecca says something. Dulaney looks at Roston. A beat.
dialog: Dulaney stands.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Mr. Roston, you said it was the best
dialog: sex you ever had. Is that the best
dialog: sex with a woman, or a man?
text: Cardenas bolts from his seat.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'll rephrase the question. Mr.
dialog: Roston isn't it true you are
dialog: bisexual?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Objection! Mr. Roston's sexual
dialog: preferences are not at issue in this
dialog: trial.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
dialog: the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson
dialog: felt when she discovered the man she
dialog: lived with was a different person
dialog: than she thought he was.
text: Judge Burnham thinks for a moment.
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: The witness will answer the question.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Mr. Roston?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: And your sexual tastes were something
dialog: that you hid from Miss Lawson?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: And didn't Miss Lawson come home one
dialog: day and find you in bed with your
dialog: male lover?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: And she left shortly after that?
text: A pause. Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision.
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: No. We worked things out. It was
dialog: three weeks later when I told her
dialog: about the heart surgery that she
dialog: left.
text: Roston looks around the court room. He is embarrassed, filled
dialog: with emotion.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Would it be fair to say that when she
dialog: did find out it was a shock to her?
speaker_heading: ROSTON
dialog: (very upset)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: No further questions.
text: Roston looks at the jury -- their disapproving stares. He is
text: on the verge of tears.
dialog: 77
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Rebecca opens the door. A tired-looking Dulaney enters. They
text: walk to the couch together in silence. Dulaney sits. Rebecca
text: lifts a BOTTLE of CHAMPAGNE out of an ice bucket.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: To celebrate how masterfully you
dialog: destroyed Roston today.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life
dialog: in open court.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (suddenly ice cold)
dialog: Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: He was only doing what he thought was
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You're too weak, Frank. When you
dialog: want something you have to do what-
dialog: ever it takes to get it. If
dialog: something gets in your way you remove
dialog: it.
text: Dulaney stares at her. The person he sees has no feelings --
dialog: no empathy for anyone.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You killed him -- didn't you?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I knew you were thinking that. I
dialog: could see it in your eyes today in
dialog: the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank.
dialog: I need you to believe that.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You don't need anybody.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I do need you. No matter what you
dialog: think of me -- I didn't do it.
dialog: 78
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I could see the looks on the juror's
dialog: faces. To the men I represent what
dialog: they can never have. I'm a cold,
dialog: heartless bitch -- and this is their
dialog: chance for pay-back for every woman
dialog: that's ever blown them off in a bar.
dialog: To the old women I'm a vulgar whore
dialog: and to the young ones I remind them
dialog: of what they'll never be. It doesn't
dialog: matter to them that I'm innocent.
dialog: They've already convicted me.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm dropping the case.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (matter of factly)
dialog: No -- you're not.
text: Rebecca picks up a REMOTE CONTROL from the coffee table and
text: pushes a button.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON TELEVISION
text: A TAPE of Dulaney making love to Rebecca fills the screen. It
dialog: is wild, passionate.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON DULANEY
text: he is dumbfounded as he watches. The implications of what this
dialog: tape could do to him run through his mind.
text: Something in Dulaney snaps. He grabs Rebecca. They struggle,
text: falling down onto the coffee table. The CHAMPAGNE bottle
text: crashes to the floor. Rebecca rolls off the table to the
text: floor. She sits up and moves away from Dulaney by pushing
text: herself backwards. Dulaney lunges at her. His hand grabbing
text: her ankle. Rebecca kicks -- breaks free -- stands up. Dulaney
text: gets to his feet -- runs after her. He grabs her by the throat
text: and smashes her into the wall. He slaps her across the face.
text: A thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth. She
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: It gets easier, doesn't it? Once you
text: open the door it never closes.
text: Dulaney realizes what he is doing. He stares at her in horror,
text: then walks towards the door. He stops. Goes back to the VHS
text: machine. He pushes the EJECT BUTTON on the VCR, removes the
text: tape and destroys it.
dialog: 79
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I've got another copy. How do you
dialog: think your wife would feel if she saw
dialog: this -- not to mention your
dialog: colleagues?
text: Dulaney's temper is near the breaking point again, he strains
dialog: to control himself.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You can think whatever you want,
dialog: Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew,
dialog: and I'm not going to prison for
dialog: something I didn't do.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You're a monster.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No -- I'm a survivor.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINNING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dulaney, Sharon and Michael sit at the table eating dinner.
text: There is a tense silence. Although Michael does not know what
text: is going on he can sense the tension. The DOORBELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'll get it.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: I'm sorry to barge in -- but I
dialog: figured after that bombshell that got
dialog: laid on you today you could use some
dialog: good news?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You got something on the Coke?
text: Biggs grins.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Do I? I talked to one of the dealers
dialog: I put the word out to. He's been
dialog: following the trial pretty closely.
dialog: He said at one time he wanted to be a
dialog: lawyer before he became a dealer.
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Charlie -- are you going to make a
dialog: point soon?
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Right now. Guess who's been buying
dialog: Coke from him for the last five and
dialog: half years?
text: Dulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't have a clue.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow.
text: Confusion fills Dulaney's face.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - MORNING
text: Court is in session. Rebecca looks around the courtroom,
dialog: trying to get a feel of the CROWD'S opinion. Dulaney is not
text: there. She looks at the door anxiously. The rooms waits. A
text: beat. Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as if
dialog: she isn't there.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: Dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an ORIENTAL MAN
dialog: in his thirties.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do
dialog: you practice?
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: Oriental medicine.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: --And is Miss Lawson a patient of
dialog: yours?
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: Yes. I've been seeing her for over a
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Why does she come to you?
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: She suffers from severe menstrual
dialog: cramps.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Did you ever prescribe any medication
dialog: for her cramps?
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What did you prescribe for her?
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: Chinese peony root.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Would you describe for the court what
dialog: Chinese peony root looks like?
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: It's a white powder that comes in a
dialog: vial.
text: There is a MOAN from the CROWD. Cardenas looks at Troxell.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How do you instruct your patients to
dialog: take it?
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: I tell them to pour an amount the
dialog: size of a quarter into the their hand
dialog: and mix it with water.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: A previous witness stated that she
dialog: saw Miss Lawson pouring a white
dialog: powder into her hand on October
dialog: twenty-eighth. According to your
dialog: records when did you prescribe the
dialog: drug?
text: Dr. Wong checks his records.
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: October twenty-seventh.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: One last question, Doctor. If
dialog: someone didn't know better, would it
dialog: be easy to mistake the peony root for
dialog: cocaine?
speaker_heading: DR. WONG
dialog: Yes -- quite easy.
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (to Cardenas)
dialog: Your witness.
dialog: Cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this
dialog: witness.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: No questions.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: You may call your next witness.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: The defense calls Miss Margaret
dialog: Sellers.
text: Cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her
text: mid twenties approach the stand.
scene_heading: DULANEY AND MISS SELLERS
text: Miss Sellers appears a little nervous. Dulaney smiles warmly.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan
dialog: Paley?
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Where did you meet him?
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: I'm a nurse. I used to work at
dialog: Roseburg Memorial Hospital. Dr.
dialog: Paley's on staff there.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What was the nature of your
dialog: relationship with Dr. Paley.
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: We dated for about a month last year.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Then what happened?
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: I realized he wasn't serious. He was
dialog: seeing other women -- asking other
dialog: nurses at the hospital out, so I
dialog: ended it.
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: -- And what did Dr. Paley do after
dialog: you stopped seeing him?
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: He used to call me -- tell me that I
dialog: couldn't just walk out on him. He
dialog: said that if I didn't come back he'd
dialog: make my life miserable.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Did he make your life miserable?
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: Yes -- he did.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How?
text: Cardenas stands again.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Objection! May I remind Mr. Dulaney
dialog: that the person on trial here is Miss
dialog: Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a
dialog: pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with
dialog: women.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Objection overruled. The witness
dialog: will answer the question.
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: He'd call me in the middle of the
dialog: night. Show up at my house and bang
text: on the door. Finally after two weeks
dialog: I went to his office one day to tell
dialog: him to stop.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: He laughed -- and basically said he
dialog: would decide when it was over.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Do you remember his exact words?
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: Yes. He said, "If you want to play
dialog: games, we'll play -- and you'll be
dialog: sorry."
text: Another BUZZ from the CROWD. Cardenas inwardly cringes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What happened next?
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: While I was seeing Dr. Paley I
dialog: mentioned to him one night that
dialog: someone was stealing drugs from the
dialog: third floor dispensary. Three days
dialog: after I spoke to him in his office he
dialog: went to the Head Nurse and told her
dialog: he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MISS SELLERS
dialog: There was an inquiry. It was his
dialog: word against mine. They believed
dialog: him. I was fired.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S OFFICE - DUSK
text: Dulaney is at his desk. Biggs enters excited.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Joanne Braslow is getting more and
dialog: more interesting. I followed her
dialog: today to an attorney's office.
dialog: Joseph Koehler.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Joe Koehler. I know him. He's an
dialog: estate attorney -- and he's very
dialog: expensive.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: What would Joanne Braslow need with
dialog: an estate attorney? She wasn't even
dialog: mentioned in Marsh's will.
text: Dulaney thinks for a moment. He grins as an idea enters his
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Not this will.
dialog: 85
scene_heading: INT. FILE ROOM - EVENING
text: Dulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of
text: papers. Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Here it is! According to the old
dialog: will Joanne Braslow was to inherit
dialog: two hundred and fifty thousand
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: What good does that do -- it's the
dialog: old will?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Under the law a person cannot profit
dialog: from their own wrong doing. Since
dialog: Rebecca Lawson is the sole
dialog: beneficiary of the new will, if she
dialog: is found guilty the will is void and
dialog: Joanne Braslow could make a very good
dialog: case to have the old will reinstated.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
text: She kills the old man and makes it
dialog: look like Miss Lawson did it. Pretty
dialog: slick.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING
text: Dulaney is washing up for dinner. He speaks to Sharon who is
dialog: in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I was thinking that when the trial is
dialog: over we'd all go skiing for a
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Maybe it would be a good idea if you
dialog: just took Michael.
text: Sharon leaves the room. Dulaney reaches for his TOOTHBRUSH --
text: picks up a TUBE of TOOTH PASTE. It is empty. He stares at the
speaker_heading: EMPTY TUBE.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Drug store.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - MORNING
dialog: 86
text: Dulaney looks worn, tired -- the tension between him and
dialog: Rebecca shows.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call
dialog: your next witness?
text: Dulaney doesn't seem to hear him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mr. Dulaney, are you with us?
text: Dulaney snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Yes, Your Honor. The defense recalls
dialog: Joanne Braslow.
text: As Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at
text: Rebecca. It's as if he is trying to make up his mind about
text: her. Joanne takes her seat.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you
dialog: that you are still under oath.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How often do you use cocaine?
text: Cardenas shoots out of his seat.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Objection, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Counsel approach the bench.
text: Dulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mr. Dulaney, I'm getting tired of
dialog: seeing you this close to me.
text: Judge Burnham looks at Cardenas indicating he will hear his
dialog: argument now.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Whether or not Miss Braslow uses
dialog: drugs is not an issue here.
dialog: 87
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Your Honor -- the prosecution has
dialog: introduced cocaine as one of the
dialog: contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died.
dialog: How it may have been introduced into
dialog: the household is of vital importance.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Are you able to back up this
dialog: allegation -- or are you fishing?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I can back it up.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: You better.
dialog: (to Joanne)
dialog: Please answer the question.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I've tried it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You've tried it? Isn't it true that
dialog: you've been in and out of Rehab
dialog: centers for the last four years?
text: This is clearly embarrassing for her.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I've been to a few -- yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You don't like Miss Lawson much do
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You don't like her because you were
dialog: involved with Mr. Marsh before she
dialog: came along. Isn't that true?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You resented the fact that she told
dialog: you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 88
text: Dulaney moves the questions along, quickening their pace,
dialog: building a rhythm.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: And you resented that he cared for
dialog: her in a way he once cared for you?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: (breaking down)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: --And that Mr. Marsh paid less
dialog: attention to you?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: --and that he changed his will?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
text: She has blurted out the answer before the full implications of
text: the question has dawned on her. Her face reveals her mistake.
text: Cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: In his previous will Mr. Marsh left
dialog: you two hundred and fifty thousand
dialog: dollars -- then he cut you out. Why
dialog: do you think he did that?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: She talked him into it. She wanted
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Two hundred and fifty thousand
dialog: dollars is a lot of money. That must
dialog: have made you pretty angry?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
text: Dulaney picks up a small PIECE OF PAPER and walks towards
dialog: Joanne.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You testified that you returned to
dialog: Mr. Marsh's house at eleven o'clock
dialog: the night of his murder. Is that
dialog: correct?
dialog: 89
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Well - I'm a little confused.
dialog: (holds up the paper)
dialog: This is a charge receipt from Rosen's
dialog: Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an
dialog: account. It's dated the day of the
dialog: murder.
dialog: (hands it to her)
dialog: Is this your signature?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: (nervously studies
dialog: it)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: There's an item you picked up that's
dialog: marked. Will you read it?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Dristan nasal spray.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Would you read for us the time of the
dialog: purchase?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Three fifteen.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: A.M -- or P.M.?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: P.M.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You see that's what bothers me. No
dialog: other bottle of nasal spray was found
text: in the house. The police looked.
dialog: There was only the one bottle. But
dialog: you say you didn't arrive until after
dialog: Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he
dialog: was using the nasal spray prior to
dialog: his death. How do you think it got
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 90
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Isn't it true that you stopped by the
dialog: house after you left the drug store
dialog: and dropped off the items you bought?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Isn't it true that you put the
dialog: cocaine in the bottle?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: No! Why would I want to kill him?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Because you were jealous. Because he
dialog: cut you out of the will. Because you
dialog: have a cocaine habit to feed --
dialog: because you know that if Rebecca
dialog: Lawson is found guilty the new will
dialog: is void -- and there's a very good
dialog: chance the old one would be honored.
text: SILENCE fills the room. Members of the JURY look at Rebecca,
text: they are confused -- doubt fills their minds.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: The defense rests.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S DEN - EVENING
text: Dark. Dulaney is standing by the window, watching the RAIN
text: FALL outside. Sharon enters.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: We can't go on like this, Frank.
text: Dulaney continues to stare out the window.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Talk to me.
text: He shakes his NO.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Please -- this is ripping us apart.
dialog: 91
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (emotionally)
dialog: I can't talk about it now.
text: She senses his pain and moves to him, wrapping her arms around
dialog: his shoulders.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Don't shut me out. Let me in.
text: He turns and faces her. She can see the pain on his face.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You wouldn't like what you'd see.
dialog: You don't know me anymore. I don't
dialog: know me anymore.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: We can't pretend this isn't
dialog: happening.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Please -- not now.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Why didn't you come to me?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You used to like to touch me -- to
dialog: make love to me.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: It's more involved than that.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: It was a place to start.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You think that's the answer? Sex?
dialog: Is that what you want? You want me
dialog: to make love to you?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I don't want our lives ruined because
dialog: of this. I love you, Frank. I want
dialog: this to work -- but you have to help
dialog: me. You have to come back from where
dialog: ever it is you are.
dialog: 92
text: Dulaney's confusion and emotion begins to surface. She kisses
text: him, softly, gently. Dulaney closes his eyes. He kisses her
text: harder - and harder. His passion builds -- his anger grows.
text: He runs his arm over his desk, brushing everything to the
dialog: floor.
text: He grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk. He kisses
text: her forcefully, his lips pressed hard against hers. She
text: struggles against him. His hands tear at her blouse. It is
text: rough, angry sex and it frightens Sharon.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Frank -- stop it! Stop it!
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Is this what you want -- huh? Is it?
text: She is crying now -- struggling futilely against him.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Let me go! Godammit, Frank let go!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (OS)
dialog: (racked with fear)
dialog: Daddy -- stop it!
text: Dulaney stops and looks.
text: Michael is standing in the doorway, his face filled with fear
text: and incomprehension. Tears streak down his face.
text: Dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him.
text: His face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total
dialog: effect of his behavior.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Oh -- Jesus.
text: Filled with pain and embarrassment Dulaney runs from the room.
scene_heading: EXT. BAND SHELL, PARK - NIGHT
text: RAIN falls in sheets. Dulaney sits inside the small structure,
text: huddled against one of the pillars. He is a tragic figure,
text: desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once
dialog: knew.
dialog: 93
scene_heading: EXT. DULANEY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
text: RAIN continues to fall. Dulaney is standing across the street,
text: staring at the house. He crosses over and is half way to the
text: door when he stops. He starts to leave.
text: The front door opens and Sharon steps out onto the porch.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Frank?
text: He turns around slowly. He can't bring himself to look at her.
text: She walks out into the rain. He lifts his head. Tears flow
text: down his face and he cries. When she begins to cry with him
text: he breaks down.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (ashamed)
dialog: I'm sorry. God -- I'm so sorry.
text: He slowly drops to his knees -- holding on to her as if she
dialog: were a strong tree in a wind-storm.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Help me. Please -- help me.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: Dulaney sits beside Rebecca. There is tension between them. He
text: does not look at her.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Mr. Dulaney.
text: Dulaney stands and walks over to the jury.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
text: The Prosecution's case is built on
dialog: theory -- speculation. Could Rebecca
dialog: Lawson have done this? Is it
dialog: possible that she did that? Where are
dialog: the facts? The evidence. The State
dialog: has presented two spurned lovers and
dialog: a jealous secretary. Hardly what I
dialog: would call impartial witnesses.
dialog: Where is one shred of conclusive,
dialog: irrefutable evidence? I don't see it
dialog: -- and I don't think you do either.
dialog: Do you know why? Because there isn't
dialog: any.
dialog: 94
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What's the issue here? That Rebecca
dialog: Lawson likes wild sex? No. But the
dialog: District Attorney is trying to make
dialog: you think if Rebecca Lawson could
dialog: stray from the path of normal,
dialog: accepted sexual behavior, then she
dialog: could be capable of murder. Did she
dialog: force Andrew Marsh to make love to
dialog: her? Did she hold a gun to his head?
dialog: No. Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and
dialog: why wouldn't he? She's beautiful,
dialog: alluring -- the type of woman men
dialog: dream about.
text: As Dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing
dialog: arguments to himself.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: It's human nature. We want what we
dialog: want -- when we want it. We don't
dialog: think about the consequences of our
dialog: actions. When desire fills us we all
dialog: do things that we know are bad for
dialog: us. We live for the moment.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Here was an exciting young woman who
dialog: unlocked doors. Doors that led into
dialog: a new world. A world he entered
dialog: willingly -- eagerly. He wanted to
dialog: please her -- and so, he did not tell
dialog: her of his illness. I know it might
dialog: be difficult for you to understand
dialog: wanting something so badly that you
dialog: are willing to risk everything -- but
dialog: that's what passion does to you.
text: It's a fire -- uncontrollable. It
dialog: consumes you -- and the only thing
dialog: you can do is let it burn. Andrew
dialog: Marsh let it burn. It was his life -
dialog: - his choice -- and maybe his mistake
dialog: -- but making love is not a crime.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We all have fires inside us -- secret
dialog: desires. We guard them --hold them
dialog: in the cages that we've built. When
text: someone comes along and opens the
text: gate, they rush out and feed blindly
dialog: on their pleasure. Rebecca Lawson
dialog: loved Andrew Marsh. She didn't kill
dialog: him -- if anything did, it was his
dialog: own passion.
speaker_heading: 95
text: Dulaney walks back to his table and sits down. Rebecca looks
text: at him warmly. Dulaney does not look at her. Cardenas stands
dialog: to address the jury.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: It's true -- we all have fires
dialog: burning inside us. Rebecca Lawson
dialog: was very aware of the fire burning
dialog: inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked
dialog: those flames -- fanning them until
dialog: they burned so hot that reason and
dialog: judgement left him. Is making love a
dialog: crime? Of course not -- but the
dialog: question isn't as simple as that.
dialog: Rebecca Lawson used her seductive
dialog: qualities to entice Andrew Marsh.
dialog: She used sex as a catalyst and
dialog: cocaine as the terminus. The
dialog: combination of the two provided the
text: conclusion of a premeditated act.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She asked Dr. Paley about cocaine.
dialog: Her fingerprints were found on the
dialog: nasal spray bottle that contained the
dialog: cocaine -- and she was the sole
dialog: beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will.
dialog: She planned it from beginning to end.
dialog: She knew about his heart. She
dialog: secretly administered cocaine, then
dialog: used wild and physically demanding
dialog: sex to induce a heart attack.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Making love is an act of passion
dialog: between two people to affirm their
dialog: vows of love. This was not an act of
dialog: love -- this was an act of greed.
dialog: This was betrayal. Rebecca Lawson
dialog: killed Andrew Marsh -- and I'm
dialog: counting on you to punish her for
dialog: that crime.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM, COURTHOUSE - DAY
text: Dulaney sits on one side of the room -- Rebecca on the other.
text: The room is quiet -- tense. A MAN enters and nods to him.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (to man)
dialog: They're back already? It's only been
dialog: three hours.
dialog: 96
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: Dulaney sits beside Rebecca. In the row behind them is Sattler
dialog: and Biggs.
text: The JURY enters. Their faces betray nothing. One by one they
dialog: file into their seats.
text: Cardenas sits with Troxell -- both of them watching anxiously.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BURNHAM
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
dialog: have you reached a verdict?
speaker_heading: The JURY FOREMAN stands.
speaker_heading: JURY FOREMAN
dialog: We have, Your Honor.
text: The BAILIFF walks over and takes the VERDICT SLIP from the
text: FOREMAN, then walks over to Judge Burnham and hands it to him.
text: Judge Burnham reads the decision. He hands it back to the
text: Bailiff who takes it to the COURT CLERK.
speaker_heading: ON REBECCA
text: She waits nervously for the Court Clerk to read the verdict.
speaker_heading: ON CARDENAS
text: he taps his pen against the desk anxiously.
text: ON THE COURT CLERK
text: He opens the verdict slip and looks at it. He stands slowly.
speaker_heading: COURT CLERK
dialog: The jury finds the defendant -- not
dialog: guilty.
text: Relief floods Rebecca's face. Dulaney shows no emotion.
text: Sattler and Biggs shakes hands, then lean forward to
dialog: congratulate Dulaney.
text: Rebecca turns to Dulaney to hug him -- before she can, Dulaney
text: has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
text: Dulaney walks towards his car with Biggs. There is no sense of
dialog: victory or elation.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: What are you gonna do now?
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Take some time off.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: You think the D.A.'s gonna file on
dialog: Joanne?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I don't know.
text: Dulaney reaches his car.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You did a good job, Charlie.
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Thanks, Mister D.
text: Biggs walks away. Dulaney takes out his keys, opens the door
text: to his car. He is about to get in when he senses someone
text: behind him. He turns around.
text: Joanne steps out from behind a pillar. She stares at Dulaney
text: hatefully. Her hand is inside her purse.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: That bastard should have left me
dialog: something. I worked for him for six
dialog: years -- and he goes and gives it all
dialog: to her.
text: Dulaney looks around the parking lot. He is alone. Joanne is
text: obviously very high on something. Her mind seems to wander,
text: her eyes drift.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: You take what people say and make it
dialog: ugly. You make others believe what
dialog: you want them to. She should have
dialog: been found guilty. She shouldn't
dialog: have gotten off.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Then you would have gotten your
dialog: money?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Do you think if I did I'd be stupid
dialog: enough to tell you?
text: Dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: What do you have in your purse?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: What do you think I've got? A gun?
dialog: Maybe I'm gonna kill you too. Maybe
dialog: I'll blow your head off right now.
text: Her hand starts to come out of the purse. Suddenly, Biggs
text: appears, rushing her from behind a pillar. He grabs her hand
text: and pushes her against a car.
text: He pulls her hand from the purse. She is holding a piece of
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: (crying)
dialog: I'm gonna go to jail. I know they're
dialog: gonna make it look like I did it.
dialog: They gotta put it on someone.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Why'd you come here?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: (holds up the letter)
dialog: To show you this. It's a letter from
dialog: that lawyer, Koehler. He wrote it to
dialog: me the day after I saw him. He's the
dialog: one who told me I could get the money
dialog: if Miss Lawson went to jail.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You didn't know about it before that?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: No.
text: Dulaney is suddenly very confused.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler
dialog: in the first place?
speaker_heading: JOANNE
dialog: Because he called me.
text: Dulaney is stunned. He looks at Biggs with a knowing stare.
dialog: 99
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - EVENING
text: It is RAINING lightly. Dulaney waits at the door of a nice two
text: story home. It is answered by a heavy-set man in his fifties,
speaker_heading: JOSEPH KOEHLER.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Hi, Joe.
speaker_heading: KOEHLER
dialog: Frank -- what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I need to ask you a question. What
dialog: made you get in touch with Joanne
dialog: Braslow?
speaker_heading: KOEHLER
dialog: You know I can't talk about that.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm not asking for names or
dialog: specifics. I just want to know what
dialog: prompted you to make the call?
speaker_heading: KOEHLER
dialog: Sorry.
text: Koehler starts to close the door, Dulaney sticks his foot
text: inside, blocking it. His face is filled with determination.
text: Koehler sees it.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Please -- I need your help.
text: Koehler thinks for a moment. He can sense Dulaney's need.
speaker_heading: KOEHLER
dialog: All I can tell you is I was contacted
dialog: by an interested party on Miss
dialog: Braslow's behalf.
scene_heading: INT. DULANEY'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Dulaney stares through the windshield, straining to see the
text: road through the heavy rain. His CAR PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: REBECCA (VO)
dialog: Frank -- It's Rebecca. I need to see
dialog: you right away. I've got the tape.
dialog: 100
text: A calmness spreads over his face.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'll be right there.
scene_heading: EXT. REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: RAIN FALLS. LIGHTNING fills the sky. Dulaney drives up --
text: finds a PARKING SPOT down the street -- gets out of his car
text: and runs to the door. As he KNOCKS as loud CLAP on THUNDER
text: BOOMS overhead. Dulaney waits impatiently. He lifts the
text: FLOWER POT, removes the key and opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. DEN - NIGHT
text: The dim glow of a DESK LAMP is the only source of light.
text: Dulaney moves through the room slowly.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Rebecca?
text: Two CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES are on the floor by the couch. Dulaney
text: looks on the coffee table.
speaker_heading: HIS POV - COFFEE TABLE
text: A VIAL is open and on its side. A RAZOR BLADE and STRAW lay
text: next to it. A pile of WHITE POWDER has been dumped out.
text: Several lines of cocaine have been drawn.
text: Dulaney starts to move towards the living room. He is almost
text: at the door when the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION TURNS ON. We see
text: the tape of Dulaney and Rebecca making love.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (OS)
dialog: Is this what you're looking for,
dialog: Frank?
text: Dulaney turns around to find Rebecca standing behind him, a
text: remote control in her hand.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (distant)
dialog: You killed him. You killed him --
dialog: and I got you off.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: That's crazy.
dialog: 101
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Is it? Joanne Braslow was perfect,
dialog: wasn't she? You knew we'd see her on
text: the tape and find out about her coke
dialog: problem. After that, the digging
dialog: should have been easy -- but we
dialog: missed the will. You knew we were
dialog: following her, so you called Koehler
dialog: and had him contact her. That put us
dialog: right back on track. All we needed
dialog: then was to prove that she had an
dialog: opportunity. The drug store took
dialog: care of that. She dropped off the
dialog: stuff and you came back and killed
dialog: him. Didn't you?
text: She shrugs her shoulders. His frustration clearly amuses her.
text: She grins slightly, almost taunting him.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I want the tape.
text: Dulaney starts into the living room.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I've been thinking about that. I've
dialog: decided to give it to you after I've
dialog: collected the inheritance. You can
dialog: take that one if you want -- but
dialog: there's another copy.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: That wasn't the deal.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (provoking him)
dialog: So, sue me.
dialog: (as cold as ice)
dialog: Things have changed. I think you
dialog: should go home -- and after you leave
dialog: I see no reason for us to ever have
dialog: contact again.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (growing angrier)
dialog: I'm not leaving without that tape.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Don't push me, Frank. I might lose
dialog: my temper and send it out just for
dialog: spite.
text: Dulaney loses control.
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: You fuckin' bitch!
text: He grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall.
text: Rebecca struggles, but it is little use -- he is a man consumed
text: with rage. Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall.
text: Rebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a FOUNTAIN PEN and
text: stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck.
text: Dulaney SCREAMS and lets go. Rebecca starts to runs into the
text: living room. Dulaney follows.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dulaney catches Rebecca -- grabs her -- spins her around --
text: then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground.
text: In the b.g. the VIDEO of them in bed plays on the screen.
text: Dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair. He
text: repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Let her go!
text: Dulaney stops. He looks behind him.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Standing in the bedroom doorway is Dr. Paley. He is holding a
dialog: GUN at Dulaney.
text: Dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his
text: feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder. A short,
text: breathless LAUGH drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it
text: all together. Rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries
dialog: to catch her breath.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: (to Rebecca)
dialog: Are you alright?
text: Rebecca NODS. Her face hardens.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: You've got to kill him, Alan.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: What?
dialog: 103
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: She's right, Paley. You've got to
dialog: kill me. She doesn't have to --
dialog: she's free -- she can't be tried
dialog: again -- but you, you planned it with
dialog: her. You supplied the Coke. You're
dialog: an accessory to murder.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Shoot him.
text: Paley struggles to make a decision. The gun shakes in his
text: hand. Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Don't you see what she's doing? She
dialog: needs you to kill me. She's planned
dialog: it that way from the start. That's
dialog: why she phoned me tonight.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: You called him?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: No -- he's lying.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: How's it supposed to work Rebecca?
dialog: You and Paley celebrate your victory.
dialog: You get me over here and provoke a
dialog: fight so he has to rush in and save
dialog: you -- but then he's given himself
dialog: away as your accomplice -- now he has
dialog: to kill me.
dialog: (to Paley)
dialog: After that I figure she'll tell the
dialog: Police that you broke in. That you
dialog: were crazed because we humiliated you
dialog: in court?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Don't listen to him. Can't you see
dialog: he's trying to turn you against me.
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: (continuing; to
dialog: Paley)
dialog: Here's the good part. The truth dies
dialog: with me and she turns State's
dialog: evidence against you. It won't
dialog: matter what you say. No one will
dialog: believe your version -- you've
dialog: already discredited yourself in
dialog: court. You'll go away forever and
dialog: she'll have the money all for
dialog: herself. She's played us both
dialog: perfectly.
text: Paley is becoming more and more confused. Dulaney moves
text: towards him. Paley lowers the gun slightly.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Alan, listen to me. If you don't
dialog: kill him it's over. Everything we
dialog: did will be for nothing.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: Shut up, Rebecca.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: She's good isn't she? But maybe with
dialog: you it's the real thing.
dialog: (points to the
dialog: screen)
dialog: I'm sure all those nights she was
dialog: fuckin' me she was thinking of you.
text: Confusion crowds Paley's mind.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I'm sure that every orgasm she had
dialog: with me was faked.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: That's enough.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: I mean she only screwed me two or
dialog: three times a night because she had
dialog: to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I love you, Alan. You have to
dialog: believe I love you. Kill him! Kill
dialog: him and we can be together forever!
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: That's right, she loves you. Just
dialog: like she loved Roston and Marsh and
dialog: me. Don't be a fool. You're nothing
dialog: to her. The second you pull that
dialog: trigger she'll turn on you.
text: Betrayal fills Paley's face. His eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: DR. PALEY
dialog: (to Rebecca)
dialog: I loved you.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (tense)
dialog: Alan, don't let him do this. You're
dialog: everything to me.
dialog: (she moves closer)
dialog: Give me the gun. Give me the gun and
dialog: I'll do it for you.
text: Paley stares at her -- his mind races. Pain fills his face as
text: he fights to make a decision. Suddenly, his face tenses. He
text: starts to raise the gun at Dulaney -- then just as suddenly he
text: turns it on Rebecca and FIRES.
text: The bullet hits Rebecca in the chest. The force blows her off
dialog: her feet.
text: Paley stares at her blankly. He slowly lowers the gun and
text: drops it to the floor, then staggers over to Rebecca.
speaker_heading: ON REBECCA
text: she stares up through glazed, dead eyes.
text: Paley takes her pulse. He breaks down, weeping over her body,
text: his tears signaling to Dulaney that she is dead.
scene_heading: EXT. REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
text: Police cars are lined up outside, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
scene_heading: INT. REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Members of the POLICE FORCE, along with FORENSIC PEOPLE go over
text: the area. Dulaney sits on the couch. He looks indifferent --
text: as if all emotion has been sucked out of him. Troxell is
text: beside him, taking notes. Dulaney looks up.
text: A BODYBAG on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room.
dialog: 106
text: Dulaney follows it with his eyes. Cardenas enters from the
text: bedroom. They lock eyes.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Paley's confessed to the whole thing.
dialog: It's like he's got no will to live
dialog: now that she's gone.
dialog: (thinks for a moment)
dialog: She almost got away with it. Ironic,
dialog: huh? Do you believe in karma, Frank?
text: Dulaney doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Well -- call it what you want. Fate.
dialog: Destiny. We usually get what we
dialog: deserve in the end.
text: A beat. Dulaney looks at him wearily.
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Can I go?
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: (to Troxell)
dialog: You get his statement?
speaker_heading: TROXELL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Then you can go.
text: Dulaney gets up and starts for the door. Cardenas watches him.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: Frank?
text: Dulaney turns around slowly. Cardenas reaches into his
text: RAINCOAT pocket and take out a VHS TAPE.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: I found this video in her room. It
dialog: has your name on it.
text: The two men lock eyes. There is a long silence between them.
text: Dulaney waits for Cardenas' next move.
speaker_heading: CARDENAS
dialog: (holding it out)
dialog: I assume it's yours.
text: Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it. A hint of a grateful
text: smile shows on his face. He takes the tape.
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: DULANEY
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: EXT. REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A light RAIN falls. Dulaney walks out and heads towards the
