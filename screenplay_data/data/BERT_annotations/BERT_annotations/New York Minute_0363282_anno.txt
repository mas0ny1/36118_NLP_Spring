speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN
text: CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW
text: MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin
text: Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after
text: her but UNSEEN.
text: She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
text: her BREATHING becoming more labored.
text: Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
text: Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
text: the leaves.
text: Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
text: beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
text: racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.
scene_heading: DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR
text: and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the
text: effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
text: door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.
text: ANGLE ON THE SHRUB
text: where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN
text: RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
text: HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!
scene_heading: INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER
text: from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window
text: in the front door and sees...
speaker_heading: DREW'S POV
text: The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to
text: extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs
dialog: it close:
scene_heading: SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL
dialog: Where are you going, Jelly Bean?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING
text: CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly)
text: which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW
speaker_heading: WAGGING.
text: From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,
text: 17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the
text: shrieking ALARM CLOCK.
text: With a SIGH, she throws her feet over the edge of the
text: bed. Her room is a train wreck. Grabbing a MatchBox 20
text: T-shirt from the pile on the bed, she gives it a sniff.
text: Good enough. Pulling it on, she pauses, looks a bit
text: concerned down at her navel.
text: A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She
text: touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins
text: tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the
dialog: source.
text: She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M.
text: Parker snickers, types her return from...
speaker_heading: NOTATWIN: CONFESS
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER.
scene_heading: NOTATWIN: THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATE
text: COURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M.
text: This makes her smile.
text: NOTATWIN: A CAREER MAN. I LIKE THAT.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In
text: a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...
text: ... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little
text: labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath
text: where it says, "tweezers."
text: She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray
text: eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her
text: other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow.
dialog: Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
dialog: keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She
text: reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches
dialog: herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too
dialog: psychotic.
text: She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces
dialog: them.
text: Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit. Grabbing her
text: WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.
speaker_heading: PARKER (O.S.)
dialog: Morning.
text: Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water
text: pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off
text: the water pick, dries her face.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Why the young executive look?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I have my interview at NYU today.
text: Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new
text: belly ring.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No way Mom knows about that.
text: Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: And she never will. At least
dialog: until after I'm married.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Didn't it hurt?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Like hell.
text: Drew shivers.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Piercings are so... unhygienic.
text: A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Breakfast.
text: Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her
dialog: Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...
text: ... HER SIDE OF THE BATHROOM which resembles a post-
text: apocalyptic toiletry landscape. There's a very clear
text: line of demarcation on the counter like the demilitarized
dialog: zone separating the Koreas.
text: Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but
text: notices another message on her Blackberry:
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?
scene_heading: NOTATWIN: ANOTHER DAY IN HELL?
text: THOREAU 786: TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT.
scene_heading: NOTATWIN: OUR ANNIVERSARY. HOW SWEET.
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL
text: NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D
text: LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO.
text: Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes
text: downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein
dialog: model-type.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (suddenly wide-awake)
dialog: Hellooo, Warren.
text: Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces
text: off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet.
text: ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking.
text: Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of
text: the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered
text: holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...
dialog: nah.
text: Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,
text: brushes with a finger and spits.
scene_heading: INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying
text: her open DAYBOOK.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously
text: together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and
text: her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still
text: in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head.
text: As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he
text: takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Morning, Dad.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Morning, baby.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: How's the book coming?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: Well, sweety, my writing process
dialog: is a lot like a giant
text: hydroelectric dam. For a long
dialog: time I just let the great ideas
dialog: build up and build up until the
text: sheer weight of them spills over
dialog: and the words just come pouring
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Still stuck, huh?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Not a word.
text: Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her
text: pop, then takes a sat.
text: Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour
text: milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super
text: Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both
dialog: hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.
text: Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat
text: toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like
dialog: Drew.
text: Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker
dialog: can turn it over.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Another one for the trophy room,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Boys can be fun. You should try
dialog: one some time.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: You ready for your interview?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (funny you
dialog: should ask)
dialog: I've prepared a color-coded
dialog: itinerary based on dividing the
dialog: day into fifteen minute increments
dialog: alternating blue/red, double-
dialog: checked the train schedule,
dialog: confirmed with the Weather Channel
text: and rehearsed a couple of
dialog: alternate scenarios last night,
dialog: you know, just to account for all
text: the possible glitches.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We'll take that as a yes.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: I'm proud of you for sticking to
dialog: your plan all these years, sweety.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I still don't understand why you
dialog: want to finish college in two
dialog: years? What's the big hurry?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I want to hit the ground running.
dialog: All those football games and the
dialog: partying and the whole dating
dialog: scene. It just seems like a lot
dialog: of wasted time that could be spent
dialog: more productively.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: The Accelerated program would look
dialog: great on your med school
dialog: application.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Football games I get. But
dialog: partying? A waste of time?
text: Parker looks to her dad. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: To each her own.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Well, Drew. I have a surprise.
text: Everybody stops what they're doing for a BEAT.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: I took the day off.
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: I'm going into the City with you.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: What -- ?!
text: Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out
text: her nose.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Isn't that great! We can do some
dialog: shopping, have lunch, real girl
dialog: stuff. Won't that be fun?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: If you want to have fun, I'm the
dialog: one who should go, not Mother
dialog: Teresa over there.
text: Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Let me know if you want me to do
dialog: the Heimlich. It'd be cool to
dialog: have you owe me your life.
text: WHOOSH! The granola goes down and she sucks air.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (still clearing)
dialog: No... I mean, it's... impossible.
dialog: I've got every minute accounted
dialog: for right up to the interview.
dialog: Blue and red! It won't work.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: I just thought... you know... I've
dialog: been working and we haven't had a
dialog: chance to spend much time
dialog: together...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Quinn, the normally thick-skinned M.D., is tearing up.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: ... and both my babies are going
text: away to college next Fall.
text: She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker
text: follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Don't be sad, Mom. Just think,
dialog: when Drew leaves for school, you
dialog: won't be losing a daughter, you'll
dialog: be losing an anal-retentive social
dialog: misfit who will be voted most
dialog: likely to die a virgin.
text: Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet
dialog: of you. But don't worry. Parker
dialog: will be living here with you
dialog: forever since no college on earth
dialog: will ever take her.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Stop it, you two.
text: Mom blows her nose.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: It's not fair you guys get to go
dialog: into the City and I don't.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Don't you have a chem test, young
dialog: lady?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Chemistry? Please. Name one time
dialog: you ever used chemistry in your
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Good point.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: (adamant)
dialog: I use chemistry every day.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You're a doctor, Mom. I'm not
dialog: going to be a doctor. I can't
dialog: even say the word 'orifice,' let
text: alone put a finger up one.
text: The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go.
text: Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the
text: news that her mother's going to accompany her.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Time to go.
scene_heading: INT. DREW'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. Almost
text: trembling with tension, she ENTERS and immediately sits
text: down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the
speaker_heading: present DATE:
text: CLOSE ON THE PAGE, WHERE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS COLOR-
text: CODED AND ACCOUNTED FOR RIGHT UP TO...
scene_heading: 2:07 -- PROFESSOR QUE SPAULDING, CHAIR, NEW YORK
scene_heading: UNIVERSITY ACCELERATED STUDIES PROGRAM, ADMINISTRATION
scene_heading: BUILDING, SUITE 101.
speaker_heading: QUINN (O.S.)
dialog: Come on, honey! Let's tear up
dialog: Manhattan!
text: With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the
text: mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself
text: and tries some self-reassurance.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're smart. You're resourceful.
dialog: You'll find a way to make it work.
text: She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but
text: something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.
text: Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell
text: phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING
text: Quinn hops in her Saab.
text: ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep
text: breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned
text: prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. QUINN'S SAAB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: RING! Quinn's CELL PHONE goes off. Quinn looks annoyed,
text: checks the incoming number. Drew closes her eyes and
dialog: prays.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: (to phone)
dialog: Doctor MacLeod...
dialog: (beat; winking
dialog: at Drew)
dialog: I'm sorry, but my itinerary is
dialog: booked solid today. Call Dr.
text: Wessels. He's covering for me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He did?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you sure it's the baby's head?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: All right. I'm coming.
text: Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound
text: disappointment, turns to Drew.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: I'm sorry, hon. It's a Blue Light
dialog: special in Maternity. Every bed's
dialog: full and some poor woman is about
dialog: to give birth in the gift shop. I
dialog: have to go in.
text: Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Ah, darn it, Mom. That's a shame.
dialog: It's like fate is conspiring
dialog: against us.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You absolutely, positively have to
dialog: promise me we'll do it another
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: I promise. I better hurry. Have
dialog: Parker drop you at the train
dialog: station on her way to school, will
dialog: you?
text: Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Kill 'em in that interview.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mom, you know, I might not get in.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Are you kidding me? You're Drew
dialog: MacLeod. Nobody's smarter, nobody
dialog: works harder and nobody, and I
dialog: mean nobody, is ever more
dialog: prepared.
text: Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her
text: mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.
text: With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her
text: shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."
text: This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in
text: her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course
text: her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey! Stop!
text: Drew takes off running after the car!
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: PARKER!!
scene_heading: EXT. PHILADELPHIA TRAIN STATION - MORNING
text: Commuters all jump from their cars and into the station.
scene_heading: INT. THE GIRLS' HONDA - MORNING
text: Parker pulls up to the curb at the station. Drew
text: collects her bag.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Good luck with your interview.
text: Drew pauses, holding the door open.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You know, Parker. Chemistry is
dialog: important. When you think about
dialog: it, everything's made of
dialog: chemicals.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Oh, I'm interested in chemistry.
dialog: Just not the kind with all the
text: numbers and stinky test tubes.
text: Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train
text: station. Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the
text: seat next to her.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Ah, chemistry.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING
text: Drew finds a seat. She neatly folds her jacket and sets
text: it next to her.
text: She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind
text: her -- just right. Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable
text: lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. A pen
text: goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos.
text: After laying out her interview materials, she turns to
text: her reflection in the window.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (low; rehearsing)
dialog: Professor Spaulding. Good
dialog: afternoon. I'm Drew MacLeod.
text: An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after
text: a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his
text: Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away.
text: EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring
text: off into their own world, wondering why their life has
dialog: lead them to this sad moment when...
text: ... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE
text: singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun." It's Parker,
text: wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full
dialog: train car.
text: Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (too loud; with
dialog: headphones on)
text: Looking for a seat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: This can't be happening. Wait, I
dialog: know. This is one of those Ground
dialog: Hog Day dreams, isn't it?
text: Drew pinches herself too hard.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Ow!
dialog: (to Parker)
dialog: I'm awake now. You're supposed to
dialog: disappear.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (still too loud)
dialog: You know, I just got this itch.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Then scratch it and get back to
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I couldn't concentrate anyway.
dialog: I'm too... distracted today.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're permanently distracted.
dialog: It's called Attention Deficit
dialog: Disorder.
dialog: (spotting her
dialog: Blackberry)
dialog: Is this about that chat room guy?
dialog: It is, isn't it?
text: A look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and
text: she pulls them off.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: No! It's about spontaneity, which
dialog: you obviously wouldn't know
dialog: anything about.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I swear to God, Parker, you go
dialog: through boyfriends like Junior
dialog: Mints. It's pathetic.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Pathetic? You want to talk about
dialog: pathetic?! At least I don't count
dialog: getting accidentally felt up in
dialog: dodge ball as my first date!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to be eighteen and
dialog: you've never even HAD a boyfriend!
text: The EXECUTIVE furrows his brow at Drew -- never?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Is this any of your business?
text: He goes back to his paper.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: This is ridiculous. I don't have
dialog: time for this today. Fine. Don't
dialog: graduate from high school. Make a
dialog: mess of your life over some
dialog: complete stranger. I don't care.
dialog: But leave me out. I have
dialog: something important I need to
dialog: accomplish today, so please go
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: (to Parker)
dialog: Would you like this seat so you
dialog: two can fight?
speaker_heading: DREW/PARKER
dialog: No thank you.
text: Drew's ALARM WATCH BEEPS.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I have to mentally preview my day
dialog: now. I can't talk anymore.
text: Parker turns to go, then remembers something.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Uh, Drew? Do you have any money?
dialog: I don't have enough for a ticket.
text: Drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her
dialog: sister.
text: The Executive peers over his spectacles at Parker with
text: the old paternal reprimand look.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Please. Like you never ditched
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND TRAIN CAR - MORNING
text: Parker's got her headphones back on and is SINGING Uncle
text: Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: 'You don't know how you met me...'
text: But when she spots the CONDUCTOR ENTERING the front of
text: the car, she abruptly stops, slips down in he seat and
text: slides past the COMMUTER LADY next to her into the aisle.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket-
text: taking Conductor and out the back of the train car.
scene_heading: INT. THE TRAIN - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if
text: the coast is clear.
text: Sounds good. She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes,
text: closes the door and THERE'S THE CONDUCTOR. He smiles.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Ticket, please.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Why don't I save the b.s. story
dialog: and just ask you to cut me a break
dialog: this one time because I know
dialog: you've got a big heart and you
dialog: remember what it was like when you
dialog: were young and... and...
dialog: (off the Conductor's
dialog: look)
dialog: ... randy?
scene_heading: EXT. TRENTON STATION PLATFORM - MORNING
text: Parker's on the platform. The Conductor climbs back on
text: the train into the FIRST CAR.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: I guess you were never young and
dialog: randy!
text: This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window,
text: smiling and giving her a little victory wave.
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING
text: The Conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take
text: when he sees Drew.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Very funny.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Let's go.
text: He takes her by the arm.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little
text: inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: I tried to be nice about it, but
dialog: if you want the police involved,
dialog: this is the way to do it.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Police? I didn't do anything.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: No ticket, no train ride.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: No! That's not me! That was my
dialog: twin sister you threw off!
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Young lady, in thirty years I have
dialog: heard every possible line but
dialog: that's the lamest ever.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: She's right there!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE PLATFORM
dialog: No Parker.
text: He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR,
scene_heading: SHE BUMPS HEAD-ON INTO BIKE MESSENGER/PRE-MED/MOUNTAIN
text: CLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY -- they really do CRACK FOREHEADS,
speaker_heading: OUCH!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: IS DREW SEEING STARS? OR IS IT THE MAGIC OF THIS INSTANT
text: IN TIME WITH DREAM GUY?
text: BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE WOOZIES. He smiles:
speaker_heading: DREAM GUY
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'm... ouch.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: She's fine, considering she should
dialog: be in jail.
text: As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and
text: Dream Guy share a last look before she's...
text: ... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.
text: Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her
text: wits about her.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: This can't be happening! I have
dialog: a... a... little paper thingy.
dialog: What are they called? Ticket! I
dialog: have a ticket! It's right...
text: She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her
text: hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket
text: in the mess.
text: The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as
text: it pulls away. He just waves, victorious.
text: Parker steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor
text: spots her. He looks from one sister to the other --
text: oops, mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs
text: inside and the train is gone.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (to the gods)
scene_heading: AARRGGH! PARRR... KERRR!
text: Parker steps up from behind her.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You get kicked off, too? Why
dialog: didn't you just buy a ticket?
text: Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but
text: Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What happened to your head?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh, just a minor concussion I
dialog: sustained while the Conductor was
dialog: throwing me off the train because
dialog: he thought I was you sneaking back
dialog: on the train!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'll bet.
text: Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the
text: ticket counter. The WELT on her forehead is gonna be a
dialog: doozey.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: I am! Where are you going?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: To see when the next train
dialog: leaves.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I already --
text: But Drew's inside the stationhouse.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: -- did. They said something about
dialog: a delay.
text: Parker follows into the stationhouse.
scene_heading: INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Packed with frustrated COMMUTERS. Drew's standing in a
text: long line at the ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold
dialog: shoulder on...
text: ... Parker, who walks right through to the street side.
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - STREET SIDE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: ACTION
text: Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. She
dialog: scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded
text: COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS.
text: TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.
text: To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS --
text: standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a
text: DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's
text: name scratched on it.
text: An EXECUTIVE (#2) passes her, finger in the air,
text: signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read:
dialog: "Wilcox."
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: That's me.
text: With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for
text: him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his
text: side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.
text: Parker raises an eyebrow. Hm.
text: The second driver (BENNIE) with a head like a cinder
text: block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and
text: holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI."
text: Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets
text: his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals
text: again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.
scene_heading: INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION
text: Drew has reached the counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK
dialog: who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of
text: angry commuters.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That can't be. I have to be there
dialog: before two!
speaker_heading: TRAIN CLERK
dialog: Well, maybe if you flap your arms
dialog: real fast you can fly there,
dialog: because you won't get there on a
dialog: train.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (about to explode)
dialog: What did you just say?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Parker arrives in the nick of time, pulling her by the arm.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Come on. Hurry. I got us a ride.
speaker_heading: DREW
text: Let go of my arm.
text: But Parker drags her away. Drew shoots a look back at
text: the Clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her.
scene_heading: EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: PARKER
text: A car service.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Car service? You couldn't have
dialog: called for a...
text: But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a
dialog: thousand times.
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: Morning, miss.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Good morning. Thank you. My
dialog: sister's coming, too.
text: Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only
text: got this instant to consider. She glances at the
text: STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB,
text: engulfing it.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You want to make that interview,
dialog: or not?
text: Drew lets herself be pulled inside. Bennie shuts the
text: door and waddles around to his side.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN CAR - MORNING
text: Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and
text: afraid. Bennie checks his invoice.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: So you're headed to the Teamster's
dialog: Hall on Second Street?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (chewing a lip)
dialog: You know, Mister...
text: She checks his Chauffeur's License up front: Benjamin
dialog: Loyola.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: ... Loyola.
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: Bennie.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Mr. Bennie? We have a slight
dialog: change of itinerary. We need to
dialog: go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th
dialog: will be fine.
text: Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit.
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: It's pre-paid. No skin off my
dialog: nose.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (whispering
dialog: throughout)
dialog: Pre-paid? What's 57th and 5th?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (whispering
dialog: throughout)
dialog: Barneys.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Not Barneys.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We've got five hours. Relax.
text: He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go.
dialog: Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's
text: going on. She leans into her sister and WHISPERS.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: This was supposed to be someone
dialog: else's car, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: So?
text: Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on
text: the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can
dialog: read:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: 'Scarpelli'? We're supposed to be
dialog: Italian?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Northern Italian.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: This is so... wrong.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What? You need to get to that
dialog: interview. We now have a ride.
dialog: We will pay for the ride. End of
dialog: big deal.
text: This is when Bennie's CELL PHONE RINGS and he answers it.
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No. The city.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What'a you talkin' about?
text: Bennie glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR, smiling at the
dialog: girls...
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: I already got 'em.
text: ... but his smile TURNS DOWN AT THE CORNERS as he
text: listens. The girls exchange doubtful looks. It gets
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: BENNIE
text: They're right here in the car.
dialog: (to girls)
dialog: 'Scuse me.
text: Bennie RAISES THE PRIVACY GLASS but doesn't realize he's
text: left the intercom button on so they can still hear his
text: half of the conversation.
text: The girls are PETRIFIED.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (low to Drew)
dialog: Not good.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (swallowing)
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: (to phone)
dialog: Don't you think that's a little
dialog: severe? I mean, they didn't see
dialog: nothin' yet. They can't hear
dialog: nothin'.
dialog: YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell.
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: You're the boss.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Take it easy. I'll fix it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No, I don't have a shovel. Not
dialog: today. It'll be a big mess.
dialog: Besides, I just had this suit
dialog: cleaned.
dialog: The girls want OUT OF THIS CAR!
speaker_heading: BENNIE
dialog: I'll take 'em to the wharf, what
dialog: difference does it make?
text: Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (whispered terror)
dialog: Parker, I think maybe we should
dialog: get out.
text: Parker sees the LIGHT AHEAD TURN RED.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I agree. How about... NOW!
text: Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her
text: door open and pulls Drew into the street!
text: An ONCOMING BUICK LOCKS UP its BRAKES as they dash for
dialog: the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: BENNIE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey?! Where you goin'?!
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: EXT. JERSEY SIDEWALK - MORNING
text: They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race
text: around the first corner, looking back over their
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: He's stuck at the light!
text: VRROOOM! Here comes the Lincoln storming around the
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: He has no respect for traffic
dialog: laws!
text: They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a
text: GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back
dialog: out, the same way they came.
text: SCREECH! Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS!
text: They round the same corner going the opposite way and
text: Parker pulls them into the first door...
scene_heading: INT. MINI-MART - MORNING
text: ... where they crouch down the magazine rack. Among the
text: magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a Chinese
text: Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: "EMPEROR
scene_heading: DEFENDS CROWN."
text: Parker peers over the top and out the window.
text: PARKER'S POV -- slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street,
text: Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Is he gone? I can't believe this.
dialog: What did you get us into?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We lost him. Wow. That was a
dialog: rush.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: A rush? Are you out of your mind?
speaker_heading: BUM (O.S.)
dialog: Hey. Give me a quarter, will ya?
text: Spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly HOMELESS GUY

text: reaches over to stop her...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Parker, you're only feeding the
dialog: poor man's disease. Buy him a

text: We watch in SLOW MOTION AS THE SLUSHEE TAKES FLIGHT, THE

speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Ew. That stinks. That's not just

text: The MINI-MART CLERK approaches them, shaking his head.
scene_heading: MINI-MART CLERK
dialog: It's Mad Dog. Look at that mess.
dialog: It's gonna smell up the store all

text: Drew appears STUNNED, unable to form words so Parker

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: May we use your bathroom please?

scene_heading: INT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING

speaker_heading: BURT

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I could be arrested for vagrancy

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Listen. I've got an idea.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No. No ideas. I'm going straight
dialog: to that interview and wait,

dialog: especially to you, for four hours.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: Come on! We're going to the

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (near coma)

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: He knows where I live. He's going

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Come on, Drew. I don't think even

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Six dollars and thirty-two cents.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That won't get me hosed down at a

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey, how'd you know about my
dialog: secret-safety twenty?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: That's not important now. But
dialog: let's just say that it's a good

dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Hey, how about there?
text: Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads:
scene_heading: THE RITZY PLAZA -- HOURLY RATES, HOT TUBS.
speaker_heading: DREW

scene_heading: INT. THE RITZY PLAZA
dialog: This looks like a good place to get your throat cut

text: There's no real lobby, just a small area to stand at the
text: "desk" which is behind iron bars. Behind the iron bars a
text: rabbit-eared TV with a busted-in tube houses a dead

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: DESK CLERK (O.S.)

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: Sixty bucks.
speaker_heading: PARKER

text: for half an hour.
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: Maybe if you two were in school

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: No, not at all.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: It's all we have. Twenty-six

speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: Are you the one that stinks so
dialog: bad?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (insulted)
dialog: I had a little accident, okay?
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: All right, all right, don't get
dialog: your underwear in a bunch. As a

text: between the bars.
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
text: Ten-dollar deposit on key.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What part of 'That is all the

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Sir, that's every last cent we

dialog: your key.
speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: I give you some special deal, the
dialog: next thing you know, you two are

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I promise we won't tell anyone.

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Not a word. Girl Scout's honor.

text: ON DREW -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet
text: where a HUGE RAT is licking the sweet stuff off her
dialog: shoes.
text: There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in,

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: AHHHHHH!!!!

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Drew?! DREW?!

speaker_heading: DESK CLERK

scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE HOTEL - DAY

speaker_heading: PARKER

text: But Parker's not listening. She's staring intently...

text: the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART.
text: Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee. Parker spots him
text: and freezes.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You're not even listening. That's

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Quiet. Don't run. He'll see us.

speaker_heading: DREW
speaker_heading: HE SAW US!

speaker_heading: DREW

text: She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th. Oops.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Come on!

text: CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute,
text: Parker spots a fresh pile of...
text: ... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew,
text: however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Jump!
text: Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow
text: manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT,
text: we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it.
text: Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and
text: puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits
text: in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.

scene_heading: INT. THE PLAZA - GIRLS' POV - DAY

dialog: I want to be done. No more rats,

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Well, Cinderella, your wish has
dialog: come true.
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Voila, La Plaza, mademoiselle.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: So? Hello? No dinero?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Yeah. I've got what I'd like to
dialog: call a 'creative solution' to
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No. I'm calling Mom.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What good will that do?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll have her... uh...
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Have her what? Hi, Mom? Could
dialog: you leave that baby halfway outta
dialog: there and drive into the city?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Dad, then.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Dad, hey. Drew. Complete loser.
dialog: Couldn't get to an interview by
dialog: myself, need full bail out. Yeah.
dialog: I'm the one who was going to
dialog: change the world, I just couldn't
dialog: get across town.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Damn it, Parker, my itinerary is
dialog: shot to hell! Blue, red --
text: Her WATCH ALARM BEEPS.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I don't even know what that means!
dialog: I'm running out of time.
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Is that guy looking at me?
text: Parker starts to look.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Don't look.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: When you ask a question like that,
dialog: the person is going to look.
text: Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the
text: lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY
text: (MORTY SESTERO) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I think he was.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Drew, we haven't done anything.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah, but I'm standing in the
text: lobby of the Plaza looking like a
dialog: deranged street person who might
dialog: attack at any moment. In fact, I
dialog: might attack at any moment.
text: The ELEVATOR behind them opens.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Let's go.
text: The girls slip into the elevator. When it closes,
text: Morty's watching.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA - DAY
text: The girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end
text: of the hall where Parker stops and peers back around the
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What are we doing? And why am I
dialog: whispering?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We're getting you a shower. Blake
dialog: Greer pulled this at the Sheraton
dialog: after the prom.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Great. Now we're emulating Blake
dialog: Greer, voted most likely to commit
text: a felony before having to shave.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We're not going to steal anything.
dialog: We're just going to sneak in, use
dialog: a little soap and water and get
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh, we're not going to steal
dialog: anything. Super. Just a little
dialog: 'breaking and entering.'
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We're not going to break anything.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We are going to enter, however.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No. No. No.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Shhh... here comes somebody.
text: DOWN THE HALL a door swings open and MR. AND MRS. LO
text: BIANCHO, wealthy Bostonians, EXIT their suite.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: REVEALS -- at the opposite end of the hallway, Parker and
text: Drew aren't the only ones watching. A PAINTER with one
text: lazy eye, ROGER, pauses with his roller and carefully
text: peeks around the corner.
speaker_heading: MRS. LO BIANCHO
dialog: It's the New York Kennel Club,
dialog: Emile, not the New York
dialog: Knickerbockers. Please call the
text: caterer and cancel the beer.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The ELEVATOR OPENS for them and they step in. Parker
text: RUNS LIKE HELL for the door of their suite... it's just
text: about to close when she SLIDES LIKE PETE ROSE INTO FIRST,
text: just getting a hand on it.
text: She lies there on the floor, holding the door and
text: WHISPERS LOUDLY to Drew.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Hurry up!
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I didn't want to have to do this,
text: but... look in the mirror behind
dialog: you.
text: ON DREW -- bracing herself, she turns slowly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - DAY
text: Practically sewn to Parker, Drew follows her into the
text: suite, both nervous, tiptoeing.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: Housekeeping?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
text: At the end of the hallway, the PAINTER watches the suite
dialog: door close. Hm. What are those girls doing?
scene_heading: INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE
dialog: It's lavish, yaddada yaddada.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I can't do this.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Drew, you're not a criminal. You
dialog: just smell like one. This way.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master
text: bedroom and slowly OPENS them.
text: There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of
text: the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A CHINESE CRESTED
text: HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he
dialog: may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply
text: eyes them. He might even be smiling.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh, no. Oh my god. A... a...
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: What the hell is it?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: A dog?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'm itching already. See? Are my
dialog: arms red?
text: Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Key down. I'll take him in the
text: living room and keep a lookout.
dialog: You just get in that shower.
text: Parker approaches The Emperor.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (baby talk)
dialog: Hi, little guy. You don't look so
dialog: tough, huh? You don't look much
dialog: like a dog, actually. More like
dialog: Woody Woodpecker.
text: Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps
text: into Parker's arms.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You're cute, aren't you, in a
dialog: freakazoidal kinda way.
text: She takes him into the living room and moves to the door.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Was your daddy a rat? Is that it?
dialog: Well, I still like you.
text: Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to
dialog: keep a lookout.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: PARKER'S POV
text: The hallway's empty.
text: But The Emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into
text: the hallway, then turns TO face her. Come on. Let's
dialog: play!
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Come back here, little ratdog.
dialog: Come to Mommy Parker.
text: Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to
text: keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to
text: spook him into running away from her, she steps into the
dialog: hallway.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA
text: But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and
text: dashes down the hallway.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Bad ratdog!
text: She chases him down the hallway and then around the
text: corner where they have to dodge cans of paints, a ladder,
text: until finally The Emperor slides on some plastic
text: sheeting, careens into a can of mauve paint and is
speaker_heading: COVERED.
text: Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see
text: the Painter (ROGER) with the now-mauve Emperor in his
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Wow. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Thank you. Bye bye.
dialog: No.
text: He turns and RUNS for the stairwell door marked
text: EXIT. Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after
dialog: him:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: That's not your dog! Hey!
dialog: 42.
text: ANGLE ON THE ELEVATORS AROUND THE CORNER
text: as they open and the HOUSE SECURITY GUY (Morty) steps
text: out, looking both ways and spotting one thing awry...
text: ... a shoe holding open the door to the Lo Bianchos'
dialog: suite.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - MASTER BATH - DAY
text: Drew finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky
text: clothes and gets ONE FOOT IN THE SHOWER WHEN SHE HEARS:
speaker_heading: HOUSE SECURITY GUY (O.S.)
dialog: Hello? Mrs. Lo Biancho? House
dialog: security!
text: POOR NAKED DREW FREEZES. THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING ON ITS
text: AXIS. Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling
text: it off its hanger and covering herself.
scene_heading: INT. LO BIANCHOS' SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The SECURITY GUY snoops toward the bedroom doors. Just
text: as he reaches for the handle, the door swings open,
text: SHADOCK, clocking him and dropping him.
text: Wrapped in the shower curtain, Drew races across the
text: living room. Just as she reaches the hallway, Parker's
text: there, also at a dead run and they don't even break
dialog: stride.
scene_heading: INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: There's a man in there!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Somebody took the dog!
text: They reach the end of the hallway and are TRAPPED.
text: Only one out. Parker HUFFS OPEN the window to the fire
text: escape and they climb out...
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA ALLEY FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY
text: ... and scurry down the stairs only to find that THE
text: LADDER DOESN'T REACH.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Parker hangs and then drops onto the top of a DUMPSTER
text: with one side of the lid still closed, then jumps to the
dialog: alley.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Hurry up!
text: But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters,
text: she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I'll, uh, go around.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Are you out of your mind?! It's
dialog: only a little ways! JUMP!
scene_heading: INT. THE PLAZA - HALLWAY
text: Rubbing his sore head, Morty the Security Guy lumbers

speaker_heading: MRS. LO BIANCHO

speaker_heading: MRS. LO BIANCHO

speaker_heading: MORTY

speaker_heading: MORTY

speaker_heading: MRS. LO BIANCHO
dialog: Not 'a' dog, no. THE NEW YORK
scene_heading: KENNEL CLUB CHAMPION AND WHY
dialog: AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FIND HIM!
text: Morty pulls his RADIO as he backs out the door and heads
text: down the hall.
speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: (to radio)
dialog: This is Remote One to base, Remote
dialog: One to base. Code 12, I repeat,

speaker_heading: MORTY

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I can't do it!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Yes you can!
text: ANGLE ON THE END OF THE ALLEY
text: where Roger appears with The Emperor. Surprised to see
text: the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen, but
text: they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and he

text: dumpster.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: I did it.
text: Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for
text: it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK --

text: ALLEY at Parker's feet.
speaker_heading: DREW (O.S.)
dialog: OW!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Get out of there!
speaker_heading: DREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: Stop! Bring back that dog!
text: MORTY'S POV -- The girls near the end of the alley. A

text: ON THE GIRLS -- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: He thinks we have the dog!
speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: A pain --
text: WHAM! -- Drew's CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: NYU!

speaker_heading: DREAM GUY

speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Hair! Makeup!

dialog: Daywear!
dialog: (Drew)
dialog: Clubbing! Vite!

dialog: Hm. Does he like it?
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: (confess)
dialog: Is that Helmut Lang?
dialog: (recovering himself)

text: The DREW TEAM parts and we are stunned to see they've
text: chosen to drape her in a show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW
text: OUTFIT that is some sort of marriage between dominatrix

text: ON PARKER who spots Drew and is, for the first time in

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Why does this not surprise me?

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Excuse me, but I'm supposed to be
dialog: going to my college interview.
speaker_heading: SHOWRUNNER
dialog: That's rich. A model going to

scene_heading: INT. RUNWAY - DAY
text: FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS! Blinded, Drew stumbles

scene_heading: ON THE AUDIENCE -- ALSO SPEECHLESS.

scene_heading: INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE

scene_heading: Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES (WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN)

text: The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her
text: onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker
dialog: takes the initiative and...
scene_heading: INT. RUNWAY
text: ... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she
dialog: was born to it.
text: Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the
text: APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in
text: her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and...
text: ... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy
text: executive! and leans into her sister:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: The hotel guy's here.
text: The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS
text: draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into
text: PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the
text: artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR!
speaker_heading: BRAVA!
text: Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (louder)
dialog: And the police.
text: Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Everybody washed their hands,

scene_heading: ANGLE ON MORTY
text: Spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the

speaker_heading: PLANT.
speaker_heading: HOGAN

scene_heading: INT. THE PLAZA - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: ... right back into The Plaza lobby.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Is this what they call 'returning
dialog: to the scene of the crime'?
text: Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they
dialog: have to pass by...
text: ... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT,
text: BRUCE (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling Mrs. Lo
dialog: Biancho.
text: When MORTY and the COPS come through the doors behind
dialog: them, however, there's no choice.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PLAZA MANAGER
dialog: I assure you, Mr. and Mrs. Lo

speaker_heading: MRS. LO BIANCHO

speaker_heading: MORTY
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Bruce! 10-80 at the wagon wheel!
text: Bruce looks over to Morty like he's speaking Slavic, but

text: THE GIRLS break for the revolving doors. Parker gets
text: there first, plunges in so fast that a MAN ENTERING is
text: tossed headlong into the lobby.
text: Drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of
text: the very high SPIKED HEELS catches, throwing her forward
text: and sandwiching her in the revolving door.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (no breath)
dialog: Park...

scene_heading: EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

speaker_heading: WILLIAMSON
dialog: Maybe they ate it.
text: The cops giggle at this.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMSON
dialog: The rent-a-cop said the mutt's

dialog: ten.
text: ANGLE ON THE NEWS STAND
text: where a BLIND CASHIER (SPEEDY) smiles at the two
dialog: policemen.
speaker_heading: HOGAN
dialog: (to blind cashier)
dialog: Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a
text: couple of blondes run past here,
dialog: did you?
speaker_heading: SPEEDY
dialog: Yep. Couldn't miss 'em. Real
dialog: criminal types. Looked like they
dialog: were headed to Mexico.
speaker_heading: HOGAN
dialog: That's where they all go.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter
text: right next to Speedy.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMSON
dialog: See you around.
speaker_heading: SPEEDY
dialog: Not if I see you first.
text: The cops head back to The Plaza.
speaker_heading: HOGAN
dialog: I say we put Abbott and Costello
dialog: on the ransom watch. I don't want
dialog: to be stuck in the same room all
dialog: day with Leona Helmsley's nasty
dialog: stepsister.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: With the Detectives gone, Speedy turns up his nose and
text: waves the air, fanning away a bad smell.
speaker_heading: SPEEDY
dialog: Whew. You know, it's not some old
dialog: wives' tale about blind people
text: having an acute sense of smell.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: SPEEDY
dialog: So? What did you do with that
dialog: dog?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: We didn't steal it, I swear.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: A painter did.
speaker_heading: SPEEDY
dialog: You girls best give yourselves up
dialog: and tell 'em the story.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (torn)
dialog: He's right, Parker.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Of course he's right. We're going
dialog: to march in there and give
dialog: ourselves up right this minute.
dialog: They will, of course, take us down
dialog: to the precinct, call Mom and Dad,
dialog: we'll give our statement, they'll
dialog: grill us under hot lights for a
dialog: few hours, force us to confess
dialog: with some tricky good cop/bad cop
dialog: routine and the next thing you
dialog: know we're doing five to ten in
dialog: Attica.
text: Drew checks her watch.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: So we'll turn ourselves in right
dialog: after the interview.
speaker_heading: SPEEDY
dialog: May I make one suggestion?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: SPEEDY
dialog: Hit the showers before you do
dialog: anything else.
text: A BEEP BEEP indicates Parker's BLACKBERRY is receiving a
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: We're facing felony charges,
dialog: Parker. Maybe you can do your on-
text: line flirting later. Better yet,
dialog: he can see you during visitor's
dialog: hours.
text: Parker reads the incoming MESSAGE from...
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: HOW'D CHEM TEST GO?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (beat; epiphany)
dialog: Oh my God. Warren works in the
dialog: city.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Warren? WARREN?! So you lied,
dialog: right to my face. No, Drew, this
dialog: isn't about the chat room guy.
dialog: Nah!
text: But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on --
text: she has to lean around Speedy's legs. A GUY buying a
text: newspaper peers down at the strange sight.
speaker_heading: SPEEDY
dialog: (to guy)
dialog: Take your daughters to work day.
text: The guy pays for his paper, leaves.
scene_heading: NOTATWIN: WARREN. MY REAL NAME'S PARKER MACLEOD. MY

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Knock it off, Drew! This guy
dialog: might be able to help. He lives
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Parker, you have completely lost
dialog: your mind if you can be thinking
dialog: about boys at a time like this!
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: PARKER. THANKS FOR SHARING. ANYTHING YOU
speaker_heading: NEED.
text: NOTATWIN: BIT OF A JAM IN THE CITY. MOB, POLICE AND
text: HOTEL SECURITY ON OUR TAIL. COULD USE A HIDEOUT.
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: LOL! ADVENTUROUS TYPE. MEET ME AT WORK?
dialog: I'M AT THE U.N.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: (to Drew)
dialog: The United Nations?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You can't possibly know somebody
text: who works at the United Nations.
dialog: Maybe he meant United Sub
dialog: Sandwiches. Or United Skate Rats
dialog: Store.
scene_heading: NOTATWIN: UNITED NATIONS?
scene_heading: THOREAU 786: JUST A DAY JOB. JOIN THE 11:00 TOUR.
speaker_heading: SOON.
text: Parker pockets the Blackberry.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: So. We're going to the United
dialog: Nations to use the restroom.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: How convenient. You arrange a
dialog: little date while your sister's
text: future hangs in the balance.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Look, he said he'd help and it's
dialog: only a couple blocks away. You
dialog: got a better idea?

speaker_heading: SPEEDY

dialog: I'm going into the City to meet

speaker_heading: BABS

speaker_heading: MRS. LO BIANCHO
dialog: Precisely!
speaker_heading: BABS

dialog: nice suit, huh? Right?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (abrupt)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You're going to get accepted, then
dialog: we can explain the
dialog: misunderstanding about the dog to

dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Maybe after the police forgive us
dialog: for sneaking into someone else's

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: WARREN

dialog: picture, would you have met me?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: That's not the point.
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: That means no. At least this way
dialog: I got to see you before you blow

speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (quickly interjecting)
dialog: Super. Now that that's all

speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: What's wrong with going out there?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Police, for one thing.
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Police? I thought you guys were

speaker_heading: WARREN

dialog: make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian
text: Rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of
text: the Assembly members. She sits up, shuffles the files
dialog: around.
text: Glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone
text: else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE. She puts one
dialog: on.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVE
text: Williamson's gaze comes to rest on...
text: ... THE BACK OF DREW'S HEAD. Hm. That looks familiar.
text: This is when the CHINESE REP stands, furious, and points
text: an accusatory finger at Drew!
speaker_heading: CHINESE REP
text: This crisis falls at the feet of
dialog: one nation and one nation only!
speaker_heading: CANADA!
text: ALL EYES TURN TO DREW.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHINESE REP
dialog: How do you defend such a position!
dialog: The world is waiting to hear!
text: These are fighting words. The Assembly grows SILENT.
text: Drew wishes she could BEAM HERSELF somewhere off planet.
text: She gulps air. Glances left, right.
text: BUT SHE KNOWS THE DETECTIVE'S EYES ARE ON THE BACK OF HER
text: HEAD AND SO SHE CLEARS HER THROAT AND:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, I'm not certain...
text: This furrows some brows.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (recovering)
dialog: ... that I NEED to defend our
dialog: position!
text: Ah, yes, some knowing nods.

speaker_heading: NORWAY
dialog: Beats me.
speaker_heading: NORTH KOREA
dialog: She's hot.
speaker_heading: NORWAY
dialog: Weird hairdo.
speaker_heading: BACK ON DREW
speaker_heading: CHINESE REP
dialog: That is absurd!
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Absurd?!
text: Uhhh... where now? She notices the FILE the Rep in the

dialog: emphasis.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (dramatic emphasis)
dialog: Not so absurd, since I have the
dialog: documents right here in my

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. U.N. - MAILROOM
text: Parker's peeking through the door, checking the hallway.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: How are we going to find Drew?
speaker_heading: WARREN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. U.N. ASSEMBLY - DAY
text: Drew glances Williamson EXITING.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: And besides, who said absurd is
dialog: necessarily bad? Sometimes absurd
dialog: is good! For instance, absurd can
dialog: be sort of... funny! In conclusion,
dialog: I propose that all of you should
dialog: talk amongst yourselves.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Like Cinderella at Midnight, she turns and races up the

speaker_heading: U.S. REP

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY OF THE U.N. ASSEMBLY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

text: Warren thinks fast and YELLS IN JAPANESE.
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT!

scene_heading: EXT. U.N. PLAZA - DAY

speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai!

text: The three of them run for the line of taxis.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You speak Japanese?
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: I may not look like an underwear

text: Warren grabs a Taxi door.
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: We don't have any money!
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: I'm smart AND rich!
text: Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through
dialog: the little Japanese Girls.
text: Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they
text: head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just
dialog: ahead of...
text: Bennie's TOWN CAR. He's holding the door for a cigar-
text: chewing CLIENT but watching the Girls climb into the cab

scene_heading: INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS ACTION

speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: PARKER

speaker_heading: WILLIAMSON

speaker_heading: HOGAN
dialog: Fine. But we're gonna have to
dialog: stop for lunch pretty soon, 'cause
dialog: I'm getting heartburn.

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Excuse me, what were you doing?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Someone was sick in the bathroom
dialog: and they asked me to -- hold on, I
dialog: don't owe you any explanation.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You're the one all 'I gotta get to

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Not now, Warren.
speaker_heading: DREW

dialog: It was you that got me tossed off

dialog: suit, I get the leather bikini!
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: (under)
dialog: Which isn't so bad.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: And you got Bernie Lipscomb while
dialog: I got Scrabble with Mom and Dad!
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Who's Bernie Lipscomb?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: I told you, I didn't know you
dialog: liked him! It was no big deal!
speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: How could I know? You never tell

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: There's a good reason for that!
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: DREW

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No interview. I screwed up.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You screwed up what?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Scheduling the interview. You
dialog: deaf?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You're Drew. Drew doesn't screw
text: ANYTHING up, let alone scheduling.
dialog: You're the Iron Chef of
dialog: scheduling.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I missed the deadline.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: After they made the first cut from
dialog: the preliminary application, we
dialog: were supposed to send in a form to
dialog: secure our interview time and I
dialog: filled it out and had everything
text: ready to go in the mailbox and
dialog: then...
text: Drew is near tears.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: And then what? Earthquake?

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I forgot.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Forgot?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yes. I just forgot. When I found

dialog: missed the deadline.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: So today? All this? What are you
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (humiliated)
dialog: I... I was going to try to meet
dialog: Professor Spaulding and...
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You were just going to jump him?
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Sort of a guerilla interview? You
dialog: know, I'm a big Michael Moore
dialog: fan...
text: A look from Parker quiets Warren. Drew's choked up. She
dialog: just nods, yes.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I called and the secretary said
dialog: there were no exceptions to the
dialog: deadline so I was going to try to
text: see him when he finished the other
dialog: interviews. I knew it was
dialog: hopeless, but... I was so...
dialog: embarrassed.

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh, to hell with it.

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Drew?! Drew, get back in this

speaker_heading: DREW

text: traffic and can't see clearly what's going on up ahead.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMSON
dialog: Did one of them just get out?
speaker_heading: HOGAN
dialog: I think so. Maybe she's going for

speaker_heading: WILLIAMSON

speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: How you're secretly jealous of me?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Why would I be jealous of you?
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Oh, let me see. Because I don't
dialog: have a stick up my butt? Because
dialog: I know how to have fun? Because
dialog: I'm spontaneous and creative and

speaker_heading: DREW

scene_heading: PROFESSOR SPAULDING
dialog: Are you certain?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I wanted more than anything in the
dialog: world to be a part of your
dialog: program. I still do. But I
dialog: failed. I didn't follow the
dialog: rules. And honestly, before
dialog: today, I didn't know how I was
dialog: going to live with that. How to
dialog: live with failure. I'm not good
