dialog: I am Legend
dialog: Screenplay by Mark Protosevich
dialog: based on the novel by Richard Matheson
dialog: In 1995, researchers at the University of Kansas used
dialog: viruses linked to healthy respiratory cells to destroy and
dialog: replace diseased cells in patients afflicted with lung
dialog: cancer.
dialog: In 1997, scientists at the Krippen Center for Genetic
dialog: Research in Berkeley, California made a significant
dialog: stride forward. By manipulating the genetic
text: information in a common blood cell and infusing it
dialog: with the characteristics of a potent virus, they were
dialog: able to create a biological warrior cell--the viragene.
dialog: Once introduced into a host, the viragene could hunt
dialog: and obliterate the body's natural enemies--tumors,
text: thickening arteries, decaying bone. Anything. The
dialog: 'enemy' would be consumed, digested, and
dialog: transformed into energy to fuel the viragene. It was a
dialog: perfect tool. And the possibilities were limitless. AIDS,
dialog: cancer, muscular dystrophy, even the flu--the viragene
dialog: could beat them all.
dialog: The first human trials began in March of 1998. The
dialog: initial trial group, dubbed the 'Krippen Ten', were
text: afflicted with leukemia. These individuals, along with
dialog: Dr. Krippen, were about to make more than medical
dialog: history. They were to forever change the course of
dialog: humanity.
dialog: "Being unconquerable lies with yourself; being conquerable lies with the
dialog: enemy."
dialog: Sun Tzu, The Art of War.
dialog: "We used to wonder where war lived, what it was that made it so vile. And now
dialog: we realize
dialog: that we know where it lives. That it is inside ourselves."
dialog: Albert Camus, Notebooks.
dialog: "'Let there be light!' said God, and there was light. 'Let there be blood!'
dialog: says man, and
dialog: there's a sea!"
dialog: Lord Byron, Don Juan.
text: A VIDEO IMAGE FLICKERS TO LIFE. A ruggedly handsome man with dark, haunted
text: eyes. Eyes that have seen hell.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: My name is Robert Neville. Today is October 17th,
dialog: the year 2002. I was born in 1960, on this very day,
dialog: so that makes today my birthday. (remembering)
dialog: Every year for my birthday, my wife Ellen would throw
dialog: me a party. A kid's party. Cake, ice cream, funny hats,
dialog: "Pin the Tail on the Donkey". One year she rented a pony.
dialog: It didn't matter that we were grown-ups and this was all
dialog: kind of silly to the neighbors. She just did things like
dialog: that.
dialog: She brought such joy into everything she did, everything
dialog: she touched... (too nostalgic) I am forty-two today.
dialog: I feel fine. I feel fit. My mental state is... pretty good.
dialog: (withdraws) Let's start over. (focuses)
dialog: My name is Robert Neville. I was born forty-two years
dialog: ago in Des Moines, Iowa. I had a wife Ellen and a daughter
dialog: Grace. My father's name was Bill and my mother's
dialog: Charlotte. They were farm people.
dialog: I hope... Someday... When someone finds these tapes...
dialog: You will know who I was. What I was about.
dialog: What I tried to do. What I try to do. (withdraws)
dialog: I think I killed six last night.
text: THE VIDEO IMAGE TURNS TO STATIC.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: ROBERT NEVILLE switches off the VIDEO CAMERA pointed at him. He collapses
text: the tripod and rests the apparatus in a corner. He wears shorts, a t-shirt,
text: tennis shoes. He slices a CD into an impressive MUSIC SYSTEM and Mahler's
text: "Resurrection" Symphony BLASTS from speakers throughout the house.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - EXERCISE ROOM - DAY
text: A serious workout facility. Weights, boxer's heavy bag, rowing machine, etc.
text: Neville pushes himself through a series of strenuous exercises. His body is
text: in fantastic shape. Taught muscle. Lean, not bulky. His movements are
text: lithe, almost graceful. More track athlete than body builder.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - SHOWER - DAY
text: Neville washes his body and we notice the SCARS. On his ankles, wrists,
text: neck, stomach, back. A few are the results of crude stitches, the others...
dialog: Bite marks ? Scratches ?
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIBRARY - DAY
text: Neville passes shelves filled with COMPACT DISCS, AUDIO CASSETTES, and
text: VIDEOTAPES. Another section filled with BOOKS and PAINTINGS. Only a
text: carefully selected few hang on the walls--Degas, Klee, Rothko, Van Gogh. The
dialog: rest are stacked like pallets. They must be copies. Mustn't they?
text: A TELEVISION gives us the "Today Show", A RADIO, NPR's "Morning Edition",
text: "Resurrection" in the background. A wall of sound. The sound of everyday
text: life. Normal life. Neville descends a SPIRAL STAIRCASE leading to the GROUND
speaker_heading: FLOOR.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GREENHOUSE - DAY
text: Neville strolls the aisles of a hothouse. Vegetables, fruit, herbs,
text: potatoes. All in carefully compartmentalized lots. Panes of glass on the
text: roof allow in SUNLIGHT.
text: Neville notices a loose screw on a shutter and pulls a SQUARE of METAL from
text: his pocket. It's an ALL-IN-ONE-TOOL--something Neville is never without.
text: Only two inches-by-two inches, it has a screwdriver tip, a serrated 'saw'
text: edge, a knife edge, magnifying glass, etc.
text: Neville tightens the screw, holds the tool in his teeth--a habit--and makes
text: sure the window is shut tight. Neville picks a few strawberries, checks the
text: Condition of a tomato plant, and trims a vine with the knife side of the
dialog: tool.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Neville sits at a table eating a bowl of oatmeal with fresh s-strawberries,
text: sipping a cup of coffee. On a wall mounted TELEVISION, Katie Couric and
text: Bryant Gumbel. Neville watches
text: with an almost disturbing gaze. He mouths along with them, somehow
dialog: anticipating the "live"
dialog: dialogue...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE / KATIE
dialog: And for those of us who'd like to lose a
dialog: few pounds, Dr. Art Ulene will be here to
dialog: tell us about his new weight loss plan...
dialog: (If we paid attention we'd notice the information contained in the TV show
dialog: and radio "broadcast" is old and familiar. We know these stories. There's
dialog: nothing "new" about the news.)
text: Outside, we HEAR a DOG BARKING.
text: Neville enters a ROOM adjacent to the kitchen--a state-of-the-art MEDICAL
dialog: FACILITY. Operating table, pharmacy, I.V.s, EKG, surgical equipment, you name
text: it. He uses a hypodermic to withdraw BLOOD from his arm. He fills two
text: plastic vials and tosses the syringe into a BIOHAZARD waste bin.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Spartan. Bed, reading lamp, a few books. A PHOTO of his wife and child. on
text: the wall, an HISTORICAL PAINTING showing Napoleon's surrender at Waterloo.
text: Nearby, within a second's grasp from bedside, are a SHOTGUN and a .44 MAGNUM.
text: At a closet filled with very few clothes--all the same type--Neville loses
text: the robe and steps into a BLACK TIGHT-FITTING BODYSUIT. Similar to a diver's
dialog: wetsuit, but the material is more flexible. It's some type of protective
text: undergarment, composed of a Kevlar-like mesh.
text: He dons a Kevlar vest, a work shirt and durable pants. He slips on combat
text: boots, tucks the pants into them, and TAPES THEM . He adds a "utility" belt
text: and fits the BLOOD VIALS into a secure pouch. He straps on two wristwatches
text: and chains an ELECTRONIC POCKET WATCH to his belt. Again, the DOG BARKS
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: All right, all right. Keep your fur on.
text: He picks up a REMOTE CONTROL and switches off the TV, radio, and music. It's
text: replaced by an EERIE SILENCE.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
text: A no-frills underground garage. A LAND ROVER, SPORTS CAR, and MOTORCYCLE.
text: (Now shut off, the walls are lined with HALOGEN LAMPS.) Neville walks to an
text: electronic control panel and hits a button. The garage door opens, but it
text: doesn't open vertically. Instead, a horizontal panel slides back, parallel
text: with the earth's surface, revealing a slanted cement ramp leading to the
dialog: garage below.
text: SUNLIGHT pours in from above. The DOG BARKS. A MUSCULAR CANINE silhouetted
text: at the top. Neville WHISTLES. The dog bounds down the ramp, delighted to
text: see its master. Neville reacts coldly. No, "Hi, boy, how ya doin'?!"
text: Nothing. We know the dog wants a reaction, but Neville is firm. He opens a
text: CABINET, grabs a bag, and pours some chow. The dog hungrily devours his
text: breakfast and Neville sees the bag is empty. He opens ANOTHER and finds it's
text: CRAWLING WITH ANTS.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Terrific.
text: He dumps the infested bag into a trash Container. Neville whistles and
text: points to the Land Rover. The dog leaps into the vehicle. Neville shuts the
text: passenger door and we see the Rover has been customized. The roof, hood,
text: doors, and trunk are crisscrossed with BARBED WIRE. All windows--save the
text: windshield, and that is protected by chicken wire--have been replaced by
text: THICK METAL PLATES. SLITS are cut into the steel, but visibility is limited.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - DAY
text: Neville climbs behind the wheel. The interior of the vehicle is outfitted
text: with emergency medical supplies, flares, heavy-duty flashlights, lamps, rope,
text: wire, tools. The dog settles an a blanket an the floor. Neville hits a few
text: switches and CLOSED-CIRCUIT MONITORS flicker to life. Via video, they show
text: the side and rear views from the Land Rover. Neville starts her up and the
text: souped-up engine ROARS to life. We stay within the Land Rover as it ascends
dialog: the ramp.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: (donning sunglasses)
dialog: Another beautiful day.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
text: The Land Rover speeds along. We vaguely recognize the road as one of streets
text: of SAN FRANCISCO, but something's wrong. The road is in great disrepair and
text: littered with debris. The trees are barren, the area deathly silent, and
dialog: there is absolutely no other traffic.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - DAY
text: Neville continues to listen to Resurrection an the Rover's CD player. He
text: spots a DRIVE-WAY and turns into it.
scene_heading: EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY
text: High on a hill sits an abandoned broadcasting facility and tower. This too
text: is in utter disrepair. The Land Rover is parked outside, the dog an guard.
text: A desolate wind whistles.
scene_heading: INT. RADIO STATION - BASEMENT - DAY
text: Very familiar with the equipment, Neville connects wires, throws switches,
text: and powers up the EMERGENCY GENERATOR.
scene_heading: INT. RADIO STATION - DJ BOOTH / CONTROL ROOM - DAY
text: Neville adjusts the mixing panel and takes a seat behind a microphone.
dialog: (Throughout this scene we will notice that the radio station looks like a
dialog: tornado blew through it.)
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Good Morning San Francisco. Big Bob Neville
dialog: here with you this morning, as I am every morning.
dialog: Monday through Sunday, seven days a week, three
dialog: hundred and sixty five fucking days a year. Traffic?
dialog: There is none. Weather? Who cares. News? I'm still
dialog: alive. What about you, San Francisco? How 'bout
dialog: giving me a call? 1-800-F-U-C-K-Y-O-U.
text: He glances to his right. The Telephone switchboard panel is shattered, dead,
text: covered with dust.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
text: Wow. The board's lit up like a Christmas tree.
dialog: Too bad our time is up. If you would like to see
dialog: me in the flesh, however, I'll be doing a personal
dialog: appearance this afternoon at Golden Gate Park.
dialog: Today and every day. 12 Noon. All you have to do
dialog: is show up. (dead air) Please (more silence, then
dialog: pops a tape cart into a player) I leave you today
dialog: with one of my favorites. I know you're sick of the
dialog: fact that I only play classical music, but frankly, I don't
dialog: care. I like it. And right now... that's all that matters.
text: An Eric Satie piano concerto. Melancholy and haunting.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS- VARIOUS - DAY
text: MUSIC CONTINUES as the Land Rover cruises through the heart of the city. We
dialog: don't spend much time here and it's frustrating, because we can't fully
text: comprehend the visual make-up of downtown. The streets are deserted, litter
text: and dust blow freely with the wind and the buildings look ravaged. Looted?
dialog: Burned? Destroyed by earthquake?
scene_heading: EXT. PET STORE - DAY
text: Neville and the dog exit the Rover and for the first time we notice Neville
text: wears a shoulder holster containing a .45 automatic. and carries an M-16
text: machine gun. A high-intensity flashlight is attached to the machine gun
text: barrel and extra ammo clips taped to its handle.
scene_heading: INT. PET STORE - DAY
text: Merchandise is scattered on the floor--chew toys, plastic bones, etc.--and
text: the dog is drawn to it. Neville whistles and the dog obeys, disappointed.
text: Neville switches on the flashlight and heads for a STORAGE ROOM.
scene_heading: INT. PET STORE - STORAGE ROOM - DAY
text: Neville KICKS IN the door. The flashlight beam dances to all corners.
text: Nothing but old supplies. The dog prances in and leads Neville to the bags
text: of chow. He hefts them onto his shoulder. Whistles. The dog doesn't
text: follow. His vision is locked on a thick piece of rawhide. He turns his sad
text: eyes to Neville, who gives in, nods. The dog happily grabs it between his
dialog: teeth.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY
text: The monuments still remain, but the grass is scorched, tall, and dry.
text: Neville eats a sandwich he made at home and the dog chews the rawhide.
text: Neville checks his watch. 12:45. Scans the area. Absolutely no one in
text: sight. Forlornly, he stares at the ground, the cracks in the pavement...
dialog: Alone.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY
text: The streets are abandoned, buildings deserted. The Land Rover parked at an
text: intersection, the dog on lookout. Neville stands beneath a lamp post, a coil
text: of WIRE over his shoulder. He measures a length, tosses it over the arm of
text: the post, and creates an old-fashioned SNAPE out of the cable. He adjusts,
text: tightens, and pulls one of the vials of blood from his utility belt. He
text: takes a rag, douses it with the blood, and positions it as "bait" in the
text: snare. Satisfied with the trap, he whistles for the dog and returns to the
dialog: Land Rover.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY
text: Neville sets another snare.
scene_heading: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
text: The Land Rover pulls to a stop in front of what used to be Nieman-Marcus.
text: Right now, it looks like a ghetto tenement.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - DAY
text: Neville's eyes are glued to something across the street...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: A BODY dangles from one of Neville's traps--one he must have set a previous
text: day. It hangs limply, ankle ensnared by the cable, its head hanging a few
text: feet above the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. LAND ROVER / STREET - DAY
text: With the dog at his heels, Neville chambers a round in the .45 and approaches
dialog: the body.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Quite abruptly, we are watching Neville from across the street, HIGH ABOVE,
dialog: from a sixth or seventh story window. We HEAR movement and labored
dialog: breathing.
text: BACK ON THE STREET
text: Neville reaches the body and spins it around. As soon as he sees the face of
text: a MANNEQUIN, he knows he's fucked.
speaker_heading: THE HIGH ANGLE
text: We HEAR a bolt slide on a rifle and we realize we're watching Neville through
text: a SNIPER'S SCOPE. Neville's chest dead in our sights. We FIRE.
text: BACK ON THE STREET
text: Neville hits the dirt. The first bullet EXPLODES in asphalt. Neville rolls.
text: The second bullet just misses him. He DASHES behind an abandoned car,
text: escaping yet another shot from the sniper. The dog stands in the middle of
text: the street, BARKING at an upper story window in Nieman-Marcus. Neville
dialog: shouts...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
text: GET OUT OF THE STREET!
text: The dog continues to , its eyes on a specific section of the building.
text: Neville steals a glance and sees a RIFLE BARREL poking out of a shattered
text: window frame. ANOTHER SHOT whistles past the dog's fur. The beast flinches,
dialog: afraid.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: GET OVER HERE!
text: He waves his arm and the dog comes running to his side. He pulls the dog
text: close to him, sheltering him from the gunfire.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Dumbest goddamm dog I ever had.
text: BLAM! A bullet HITS the car. Neville is pinned down.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Great, Bob, just great.
text: He looks at the pistol in his hand. It's useless against a rifle. And
text: unfortunately, the machine gun is in the Land Rover. He can't make a move.
dialog: Unless...
text: Along the curb, hidden from the sniper's view, is a storm drain. Neville
text: inches his way toward it and slithers inside. The dog tries to follow, but
text: Neville motions for him to stay and speak. The dog understands and BARKS at
dialog: the sniper.
scene_heading: INT. STORM DRAIN TUNNEL - DAY
text: Crouching down, Neville is able to scurry to the other side of the street.
text: He inches his way through a crevice.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
text: Neville crawls into a dilapidated BATHROOM in the store's first basement.
text: The plumbing has been backed up for god knows how long and Neville can
dialog: barely tolerate the stench.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - FIRST BASEMENT - DAY
text: What used to be "Housewares." Neville spies the no-longer-functioning
text: escalators and strides upwards.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - ESCALATORS - VARIOUS - DAY
text: Neville reaches the fourth floor. We catch glimpses of BIZARRE GRAFFITI, but
text: mostly we're taken aback by the sheer emptiness of the store.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY
text: Neville creeps up the escalator. He HEARS the sniper, but it's difficult to
dialog: see anything because the windows in this section have been covered with
text: sheets of cardboard, blankets, and plywood. The only light is a tiny shaft
text: coming through the cracked pane the shooter is using for his rifle.
text: The shooter himself is bundled in rags. Gloves cover his hands, a parka hood
text: hides his head, and a scarf shields his face. We see no details, only a
text: shape. in a corner is a sort of "tent' made from bedsheets and blankets.
text: The sniper watches the street. Faintly, we HEAR the dog BARKING. The sniper
text: SHOOTS. A distant ping!--the bullet hits the abandoned car. Neville gauges
text: his surroundings, his enemy. Thinks. Positions himself about twenty feet
text: behind the sniper. Locks target with the .45.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Hey.
text: The sniper jumps, turns around, and shakes in his shoes at the sight of
text: Neville. He fumbles with the rifle.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Ah-ah-ah.
text: The sniper stops. It's no use--he'd never be quick enough.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Slide the gun over here.
text: The sniper has no choice. He sets the rifle on the floor and shoves it at
text: Neville, who quickly examines it.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: A hunter's gun. Where'd you find it?
text: No reply. Neville points the .45, SHOOTS and blasts the window behind the
text: shooter. Glass explodes and SUNLIGHT pours into the room. The sniper
text: SCREAMS with fright and scurries for darkness. Neville aims his pistol at
dialog: another window.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: (a threat)
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: (his voice a raspy hiss)
text: Up north. In the mountains, a cabin.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You're not part of Cortman's bunch.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Never mind. In the mountains...
dialog: Were there people? Like me?
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: If there were, we wouldn't have had to
dialog: come to the city, now, would we?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You're a smart one.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You said "we."
text: The sniper realizes his error. Goes tight-lipped.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: How many?
text: No answer. Neville flips back the top of the "tent" and sees three sleeping
dialog: areas.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where are they?
text: The sniper refuses to respond. Neville BLASTS another window. More LIGHT.
text: Like a snake escaping a predator, the sniper slithers away, but Neville
text: pounces on him and jams the .45 into the center of his back. He pins one arm
text: and extends the shooter's other arm into the path of the light.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: No!
text: The sniper is in agony.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Tell me.
text: Frustrated, Neville, pulls off the man's glove. First, we see that the flesh
text: is pale white. So pale it's almost translucent. Second, we see the effect
text: of sunlight--the skin blisters and blackens.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: WHERE ARE THEY?
text: The sniper SCREAMS. Neville releases him and he hides in the shadows,
text: caressing his tortured limb. The sniper decides to pull off his hood and
dialog: remove the scarf, revealing...
text: A demonic visage. Ghostly white flesh so devoid of pigment we can see the
text: blue and purple veins beneath the surface. His eyes are an unearthly cold
text: blue/grey and white. He is completely hairless--nothing on his pate, no
text: brows, no facial hair. His lips a deep ruby red. This thing was once human,
dialog: but now, now...
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: (somewhat awed)
dialog: You're him, aren't you? You're Neville.
text: Neville reaches into his belt and takes out a VIAL of blood. The sniper's
text: eyes light up.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where are they?
text: The sniper is mesmerized by the blood.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: (can't help himself)
text: The bay... The basement.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I was in the basement.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
text: Down... below... By the... subway.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Do they have guns?
text: He won't answer. Neville pours a few drops of blood and steps back.
text: Thirstily, the sniper laps it up with his tongue, like a cat to some spilled
text: cream. Neville looks away. The sniper falls back onto a pile of rags and
text: lets his "fix" kick in. His body spasms and his face contorts. The sniper's
text: arm jerks and he lets out a satisfied breath. A junkie feeling the high.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: We heard about you. Way up in the hills
dialog: we heard about you.
text: Miraculously, the sniper's charred hand begins to heal.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Your friends. Guns?
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: No. We found only the rifle.
text: His hand forms a fist. A sinister, unearthly hiss emerges from his gullet.
text: He looks at the vial in Neville's hand.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: More.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You'll get more if you tell me the truth.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: More!
text: And something dark, something terrible fills the sniper's eyes. He LUNGES at
text: Neville. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Neville pounds him with three bullets. Two in
text: the stomach. One in the shoulder. Blood spatters. The sniper teeters, but
text: does not fall. Neville aims at the heart and fires, but his weapon is empty.
text: He mutters "shit," hastily loads a clip. The sniper clutches at his wounds,
text: kneels and touches the floor with his finger. He takes a deep breath and
text: enters into some kind of meditative trance. He summons...
text: The scattered drops of his blood heed his call. Like droplets of mercury
text: drawn to a common source, the blood moves across the floor and flows up his
text: finger into the open bullet wounds. And heals them.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: That was clever, the mannequin. That
dialog: took some thought. You nearly had me.
text: Click. Neville jams in the clip. The sniper moves. POW. POW. POW. POW-
text: Only this time, Neville aims at the windows. GLASS SHATTERS and a wall of
text: LIGHT pours in, hitting the sniper like a freight train.
speaker_heading: SNIPER
text: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
text: The skin on the sniper's face blisters. Smoke rises from beneath his
text: protective clothes. he HOWLS. Neville, with intense calm, holsters his .45
text: and raises the RIFLE.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You know, I can understand me. But why
dialog: shoot at the dog? What did that dog ever do
dialog: to you?
text: The sniper staggers toward Neville, one last attack. Neville SHOOTS, hits
text: the sniper square in the chest. The force of the blast propels him backward,
text: to the open windows. The sniper slips on the broken glass and falls...
text: ... out the window. Seven stories to the street below.
text: Neville moves to the window, locks at the sniper's body on the concrete. The
text: DOG emerges from behind the abandoned car, sniffs in the direction of the
text: corpse, and looks up at Neville in the window. Neville shouts down...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: STAY AWAY FROM HIM! You stay away!
text: The dog sits.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Good boy.
scene_heading: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
text: A bandana acting as a mask on his face, Neville pulls a spare gas can from
text: the rear of the Land Rover and douses the sniper's corpse (blackening in the
text: sun) with fuel. He ignites a book of matches, tosses them at the body, and
dialog: whoosh--instant funeral pyre.
text: Neville reaches into a supply chest in the rear of the Land Rover. He pulls
text: out a mean looking, more powerful MACHINE GUN, two ammo clips, a portable
text: high-intensity halogen lamp, a COMBAT KNIFE, three small electronic devices,
text: and a customized remote control. He hangs a pair of night-vision goggles
text: around his neck and instructs the dog...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Come.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - SUB-BASEMENT - DAY
text: Neville walks past rusting generators to a collapsed wall which connects the
text: store to an old subway tunnel. The FLASHLIGHT on the barrel of the machine
text: gun illuminates the path. The halogen lamp is strapped to his shoulder, but
text: for now, it's switched off. Neville allows the dog to sniff a rag taken from
text: the sniper's 'tent.' Having the scent, the dog proceeds into the tunnel.
text: Prior to following, Neville fixes one of the SMALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES to the
text: to the wall.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
text: A dank, dark, creepy place. No more electricity to feed the lights or
text: tracks. Neville paces himself behind the dog, flashlight illuminating old
text: cigarette ads, a 49ERS billboard, a pile of cat and rat skeletons, the rails,
speaker_heading: more GRAFFITI.
dialog: Which we now see more clearly. This isn't the creation of homeboy
text: gangbangers. it is fierce and savage in its beauty. Wild symbols, patterns,
text: and colors. Majestic. Tribal. Neville has seen it many times before and
text: doesn't like it. It spells trouble. He stops and attaches another
text: electronic device to an overhead pipe.
text: The dog stops and utters a soft bark in the direction of a wrecked SUBWAY CAR
text: spilled on the tracks ahead. Neville shuts off the flashlight and dons the
text: night-vision goggles. He raises his finger to his lips and the dog knows to
text: proceed quietly. Neville attaches the final electronic device to the door
text: leading to the car and silently enters.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY
text: THROUGH THE GREENISH TINT OF THE GOGGLES, we scan the interior. Ripped
text: seats, trash, and in one corner, a HUMAN FORM. An EMACIATED CORPSE.
text: Stripped naked, every ounce of blood drained. A festering bullet wound in
text: the chest, the skin punctured by teeth marks. on its chest, an elaborate
text: TRIBAL DESIGN, much like the graffiti, somehow raised from the skin, similar
dialog: to a cattle brand.
text: Neville checks out the opposite end. Sleeping there are TWO FORMS.
text: Breathing. He removes the goggles and motions for the dog to move back. He
text: readies his weapon with one hand, and reaches back with the other,
dialog: igniting...
text: THE HALOGEN LAMP. Instantly, BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT floods the compartment. The
text: two figures stir awake and SCREECH.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
speaker_heading: DON'T MOVE.
text: But they do not listen. Instead, they REACH into their bedding, pull out TWO
speaker_heading: HANDGUNS and FIRE.
text: Not what Neville expected. As bullets whiz past, he unleashes the machine
text: gun, firing a spray across the car. One of the sleepers' bullets takes out
text: the halogen. It shatters, burning Neville's cheek. More gunfire. Is he
dialog: hit?
text: Neville falls back. A firefight in close quarters is not what he wants. He
text: maneuvers back into the tunnel. Takes cover behind a pile of rubble and
text: finds the dog already there.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Never believe them, Robert, never.
text: BLAM! BLAM,! Bullets explode in the wall near his head. He sneaks a peek
text: and sees the two sleepers firing at him from inside the train. Neville
text: reaches into his belt and pulls out the customized REMOTE. He presses one of
text: the buttons and KABLAM! The car is rocked with a small EXPLOSION. The door
text: is torn from its mooring and one of the sleepers is RIPPED APART- The wounded
text: sleeper HOWLS with pain and falls to the
text: tunnel floor, barely able to keep his body from splitting in half.
text: Amazingly, he's still alive.
text: BLAM! The other one's still shooting. Neville takes cover. The second
text: sleeper exits the car and tends to its wounded comrade. Both are the same
text: type of creature as the sniper, but this one, the living one, is FEMALE. Her
text: dying partner, a MALE, is finished. She caresses his face, then buries her
text: mouth in an open wound, infusing herself. Dark blood covers her chin and
text: chest, but as she walks, the liquid crawls across her skin into her mouth.
text: It seems to give mass and power to her body and rich color to her translucent
dialog: skin.
text: She raises her gun. Neville ducks just as she FIRES. BEEP BEEP BEEP. His
text: electronic stopwatch sounds an ALARM. He switches it off and looks at the
text: sunlight pouring into the tunnel. Its quality slowly starting to shift.
text: MOVEMENT. Both Neville and the female react to SOUNDS behind them, past the
text: wrecked subway car. Neville knows what's coming. Far in the distance, we
text: see MORE FORMS. What could be an army. He and the dog RACE to the crumbled
text: wall of the department store. The female SCREECHES and gives chase. She's
text: very fast, like a panther. Neville glances up, runs, presses the REMOTE...
text: The second DEVICE EXPLODES, collapsing the roof of the tunnel. Pipes,
text: concrete, dirt--it all cascades down. A SHAFT OF LIGHT be in from the street
text: above, stopping the female dead in her tracks. The light separates her from
text: Neville and she does not like it. Frustrated, she snarls...
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - SUB BASEMENT - DAY
text: Neville helps the dog through the hole and heads for the
text: escalator. Presses the REMOTE. The third device EXPLODES,
text: sealing shut the connection from the store to the tunnel.
scene_heading: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
text: Neville and the dog hurriedly enter the Land Rover, haphazardly tossing
text: supplies and weapons into the rear. Neville starts the vehicle and checks
text: the sky. Must be about an hour before sunset.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
text: The Land Rover zips down California Street and we PULL BACK, FAR BACK,
text: revealing the scope and breadth of the city.
text: San Francisco has been raped, mutilated, and murdered. Buildings burned,
text: streets littered with rusting cars, trees and grass dry, dead. No bombs were
text: dropped--too , y of the structures are intact--instead, it feels as though
text: something sinister and insidious rotted the place from the inside out.
text: Most startling is the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE. Barricades, barbed wire, EMPTY
text: NATIONAL GUARD TANKS--all scattered about like a child's toys. it looks like
text: a war zone. The bridge itself is charred and torn, unstable, swaying in the
dialog: wind.
scene_heading: EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY
text: This area too -has been ravaged. WIND kicks up LEAFLETS. The
text: Land Rover speeds through, kicking up the old papers. CLOSE
text: ON A LEAFLET as it sails to the ground. It reads:
text: YOU ARE NOT ALONE. I AM A SURVIVOR JUST LIKE YOU. I WILL HELP. YOU 				CAN TRUST ME. THERE IS HOPE.
text: MY NAME IS ROBERT.
scene_heading: MEET ME IN GOLDEN GATE PARK. PORTALS OF THE PAST. 12 NOON.
scene_heading: MIDDAY. EVERY DAY. WHEN THE SUN IS HIGHEST IN THE SKY.
speaker_heading: PLEASE.
text: The leaflet is yellowed and dirty. These things have been floating around
dialog: for a long time.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL DISTRICT- DAY
dialog: Land that once held the beautiful homes of Pacific Heights, Nob Hill, and
text: Russian Hill now looks like terrain in Bosnia. or the surface of the moon.
text: Atop one of the hills still stands one edifice--Neville's house. The Land
text: Rover climbs.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - DAY
text: Neville presses a remote garage door opener.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The vehicle slows outside a massive GATE fashioned out of wrought iron,
text: corrugated steel, and barbed wire. It WHEELS open, allows entry, then CLANGS
text: shut once the Rover's inside.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL THE REST OF THE HOUSE
dialog: A turn-of-the-century house. The kind you can't find in other cities. From
text: a distance, it almost locks "normal." But normal it is not. Every window and
text: door has been bricked and cemented shut. Small SLITS have been cut into the
text: walls at strategic points to provide some vantage. These portals are covered
text: with chicken wire and are outlined by sharp NAILS pointing outward at jagged
dialog: angles.
text: The exterior walls are covered with a hodgepodge of metal plating--steel
text: sheets, corrugated iron. The gables bounded by coils of barbed wire. High-
text: intensity LAMPS (now shut off) and SECURITY CAMERAS jut out at odd angles,
text: pointing at every corner of the surrounding landscape.
text: And what a terrifying landscape it is. In the immediate vicinity, every
text: other house--to the north, south, east, and west--has been burned and razed
text: to provide Neville with an unobstructed view, and to prevent his enemies from
text: using other structures as bases of attack.
text: Outlining the perimeter of Neville's house are TWO FENCES. The interior
text: fence, only fifty feet from the house itself, is seven feet high and
text: constructed of wooden beams and ribbons of BARBED WIRE, crisscrossed and
text: interlaced. From within the house, once could see through, but no one could
dialog: get past.
text: The outer fence, much higher and foreboding, forms an impenetrable square. It
text: is composed of railroad ties, Telephone poles, metal sheets, iron staffs,
text: barbed wired, and massive amounts of RAZOR WIRE. outside and in, it is
text: bordered by row upon row of SHARP WOODEN PIKES, pointed out.
text: Between the two fences, within the compound, is a three foot deep DITCH,
text: filled with muddy water. A crude moat. Its circle broken only by a thin
text: LAND BRIDGE, over which now comes the Land Rover. We an ELECTRONIC WHIRRING
text: and a STEEL DOOR, level with the ground, SLIDES BACK, revealing the slanted
text: driveway into the UNDERGROUND GARAGE.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY
text: Neville and the dog climb from the stopped Rover. He looks up the ramp and
text: sees the sun begin its descent. He hits a button and the upper door slides
text: CLOSED. He winces with pain as he pulls off the shattered halogen.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT
text: He BOLTS AND LOCKS the door to the garage, ignites THREE BIG
text: GENERATORS, opens a fuse box, and flips the circuit breakers.
text: Artificial light flickers on throughout the house.
text: The basement acts as a workshop, tool room, and repair facility. All manner
text: of hardware is in stock as are various chemicals, electronics, and
text: instruction manuals. At the opposite end of the room is a WEAPONS ARSENAL
text: and TARGET RANGE. Neville deposits the busted lamp on a workbench and checks
text: the rifle taken from the sniper.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Sight's for shit.
text: He dumps it on the workbench and selects a gorgeous MARKSMAN'S RIFLE from his
text: well-stocked arsenal.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Now, if you had this, I might not be here
dialog: right now. (sardonically) Too bad.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DUSK
text: Neville peels off the bodysuit. We see that his shirt is ripped above the
text: sleeve and a shoulder badly BRUISED. He examines the vest and finds a BULLET
text: flattened into the fabric. He pries it out and hangs the suit in his closet.
text: He slips into some loose fitting black pants, black t-shirt, and sneakers.
dialog: Clothes for mobility, agility.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK
text: Neville looks at a shelf of VIDEOTAPES: NBC NIGHTLY NEWS/JUNE 5, 1992, NBC
scene_heading: NIGHTLY NEWS/AUGUST 5, 1997, ABC NIGHTLINE/ DECEMBER 12, 1995, CBS EVENING
speaker_heading: NEWS/OCTOBER 27, 1994.
text: He pops one into a vcr and Dan Rather reports on the day's events. A long

text: Miserere. Like this morning, a wall of sound. Comforting. "Normal."
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
text: Neville digs into a freezer and pulls out two frozen STEAKS from a dwindling
dialog: supply of meat.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: It's my birthday. Why not?
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING
text: A rather sad figure, Neville sits at a lonely little table eating his steak.
text: Next to it, a lumpy
text: muffin with a thick candle stuck in its heart. A pathetic "birthday cake."
text: Uneaten. On the floor, the dog devours his steak--raw. Neville's disturbed
text: by the bloodiness of the meat and can't watch the red juice drip from the
text: dog's mouth.
text: Nearby, past a TV playing the news video, is a wall of CLOSED-CIRCUIT
text: MONITORS showing grainy black-and-white images of the area surrounding the
text: house. There's MOVEMENT on a few of the screens and Neville attunes to it
dialog: instantly.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: They're early.
text: He snaps into action. Moves to a LARGE COMPUTER SET-UP near the security
text: video console, takes a seat, and calls up a PROGRAM detailing the various
text: ELECTRONIC CONTROLS connected to the compound. Hits the keyboard...
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
text: LIGHTS. Dozens of bulbs along the outer fence ignite. others atop the roof
text: SPRAY LIGHT onto the compound.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - EARLY EVENING
text: Neville grabs the muffin off the table, blows out the candle, and tosses it
dialog: to the dog.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Happy birthday.
text: The dog sniffs and doesn't find the prospect too appealing.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT ARSENAL - NIGHT
text: Neville checks and loads a series of WEAPONS.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
text: He places GUNS around the house and heads UPSTAIRS.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT
text: A HATCH opens onto a PROTECTED DECK--A makeshift "crow's nest." It screws
text: with the aesthetics of the old home's architecture, but it serves a purpose,
text: providing Neville with a high, secure vantage point. He rests his marksman's
text: rifle in a crook, climbs up a small "lookout post," and raises a pair of
text: NIGHT VISION BINOCULARS to his eyes...
text: IN THE DISTANCE, through the foggy green light of the glasses, we see FORMS
dialog: beyond
text: the outside fence. Right now, there are a dozen, perhaps twenty. However,
dialog: to the left, to the
text: right, MORE, many more, are journeying up the hill, toward the house. Hiding
dialog: in the
text: shadows creeping behind rubble, crawling through trenches.
text: ON THE ROOF, Neville slides down the pole, into the house.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville opens a DOOR, revealing a small room within--a converted closet. He
text: moves INSIDE and we see its walls are lined with numerous HOLY TEXTS and
scene_heading: FIGURES OF WORSHIP--
text: A crucifix, the Buddha, a Celtic cross, rosary beeds, Hindu gods, a menorah,
dialog: Norse rune stones, you name it.
text: Neville lights a candle and incense, silently prays. The dog rests outside
text: the door. He becomes ALERT, hearing the SOUND before his master. AN EERIE
text: MOAN. Low, resonant. A C Far in the distance. Beyond the walls, beyond the
text: fence. The MOANING INTENSIFIES. The dog whimpers.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I know.
text: The moaning subsides. It is replaced by a DEEP, RHYTHMIC DRUMMING. There is
text: something powerful and dangerous to the beat. And it affects Neville.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville plays a CD. CRANKS UP THE VOLUME. The music is loud, angry and
text: disturbing. Krzystof Penderecki. Neville moves to the computer station,
dialog: presses a co
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MUSIC BLARES from SPEAKERS mounted on the roof. Outside the fence, the
text: DRUMMING INTENSIFIES. Combined with Neville's music, an odd, discordant
dialog: symphony is created.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville sits on the floor, hands covering his ears. The dog whimpers his
text: concern. Finally, Neville SCREAMS...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: STOP!
text: He SHUTS OFF the music. Outside, the drumming continues. Neville GRABS the
text: dog by the collar and JERKS him to a small HATCH cut into the KITCHEN DOOR.
text: He slides back a bolt and PUSHES the dog outside. The dog looks back at
text: Neville with sad, frightened eyes. Neville angrily instructs...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: IT'S YOUR JOB. GO.
text: He slides the hatch back in place, locking the dog outside.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The dog begins his patrol of the inner perimeter. it is his job to alert
dialog: Neville to anyone who makes it this far. out here, the DRUMMING is much
dialog: louder.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT
text: Neville emerges from the hatchway, grabs the marksman's RIFLE, adjusts the
text: sight with the screwdriver tip of the all-in-one-tool, and positions himself
text: in the crow's nest. He arms the weapon and raises the INFRA-RED SCOPE to his
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: All right, Cortman. I'm ready.
scene_heading: EXT. BARREN LANDSCAPE - NIGHT
text: We shift our point-of-view to the area far beyond the outer fence, to the
dialog: source of the drumming. And what we see should be terrifying...
text: AN ARMY. A horde of awesome, frightening creatures.
text: Close to three hundred in number. Male and female. All have the pale,
text: translucent skin of the creatures Neville encountered in the department store
text: and subway, the same lack of hair, the same disturbingly blue grey/white
dialog: eyes. But this group, this tribe, has something different about it.
text: Something strong. Something imperious. Something savage.
text: They wear very little clothing an their magnificently shaped bodies. Most of
text: the men and many of the women are topless, proud of their muscular torsos and
text: ghostly flesh.
text: Unique TRIBAL MARKINGS AND JEWELRY adorn their bodies. However, all, each
text: and every one of them, bear one identical mark an their chests. The "brand"
text: Neville saw an the drained corpse in the subway car. It is their mark.
dialog: There is a hierarchy to the assembled:
text: Lowest are CARETAKERS, who nurse and tend to the wounded. Above them are the
text: DRUMMERS. They intone frightening chants and beat out powerful rhythms an
text: large decorated drums. Next are the CLERICS--A somber, serious bunch whose
dialog: markings are very ornate, very significant, very "holy."
dialog: The greatest in number are the WARRIORS. The strongest, the fiercest, the
text: most savage-appearing. Hate fills their eyes. Hate fuels them. A pure hate
dialog: for one man--Neville.
text: Very near the top are two LIEUTENANTS, one leader of the Clerics, the other
text: leader of the Warriors. The Cleric Lieutenant is CHRISTOPHER. An intense,
text: almost sensitive looking fellow whose body is the most decorated, the most
text: artistic in its impression. The Warrior Lieutenant is EVA. A fantastically
text: strong, vicious woman whose body bears the SCARS of warfare. She possesses a
text: manic, ferocious energy.
text: And the LEADER. The leader is CORTMAN.
text: He exudes the confidence and power of a king. His body is chiseled, his
text: visage haunting. He commands this group with the calm of a head of state,
text: the drive and focus of a field marshall, and the brute force of a tribal
dialog: warlord.
text: He stands an a promontory, a big jagged hunk of concrete jutting from the
dialog: earth's surface. It provides protection and perspective--beyond the range of
text: Neville's guns, but close enough to observe his activity. There is constant
text: movement in the ranks, but all await and heed the word of Cortman.
dialog: ( *NOTE--Although these creatures consume blood, are allergic to light, and
dialog: bear other similarities to vampires, they are not. They are something new,
dialog: something we have never seen before, something strikingly different. There
dialog: is nothing but their existence or behavior that is based in the occult or
dialog: supernatural. They are real. And we will learn how and why soon enough.
dialog: For the purposes of this screenplay, we will call these creatures Hemocytes.
dialog: )
text: Cortman RAISES HIS ARM and the drummers cease.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Bring her to me.
text: TWO WARRIORS shove forward the FEMALE Hemocyte Neville encountered in the
text: subway. Eva forces her to "bow", in submission. Cortman gently strokes the
dialog: female's cheek.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You wish to join us.
text: She nods in the direction of Neville's house.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: He killed my love.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Neville has slaughtered so many we loved.
dialog: You want to see him dead? See him punished
dialog: for this injustice?
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You want to feed on him.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Why should we grant you that privilege?
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Why?
text: She reaches into the small of her back and pulls forth the PISTOL she used
dialog: against Neville.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: I'll give you this.
text: Cortman and others LAUGH. He takes it, examines it.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: I haven't played with toys since I was a
dialog: child. What about you, Eva?
text: He tosses it to her. She looks at it with disdain.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Do you really think I need these relics of the past?
dialog: I have every weapon I need. My body. my mind.
dialog: My soul. (re the gun) Such toys are pointless. (MORE)
speaker_heading: CORTMAN (cont'd)
dialog: Neville. He needs them. Take them away,
text: and he is naked.
text: To prove a point, Cortman nods to Eva and she SHOOTS him twice in the
text: stomach. He LAUGHS and we watch his body heal itself, blood refusing to
text: flow, flesh sealing the holes. Eva THROWS the gun into the night.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Remind her of what she has done.
text: Christopher turns to his clerics and they bring forth the DRAINED CORPSE the
text: female and her "Love" fed upon in the subway car. There is real anger in the
dialog: eyes of the Clerics.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You recognize him?
text: The female realizes she is in trouble. Cortman shows her the DISTINCTIVE
text: BRAND on the chest. Cortman touches his own brand. Others in the tribe
dialog: touch theirs.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: It is our mark. It distinguishes us and unites us.
dialog: Without it, we mean nothing. Without it:, we are
dialog: no better than you. And you disgust me.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: "Please." (re the corpse) Did he beg?
dialog: whimper and plea? If so, what: was your
dialog: response? How did you react? With
dialog: understanding? Compassion?
dialog: Or with hunger? And brutality?
text: Cortman extends his arm. He CONCENTRATES and the muscles and tendons of the
text: forearm thicken. Elegantly, his NAILS GROW, creeping forth from the flesh,
text: forming RAZOR-LIKE TALONS.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Life is eternal.
text: He SLASHES her throat. SLASHES her chest once, twice. Her body spasms and
text: twitches at the massive blood loss, but there's clearly still life in her
text: eyes. Her FLESH tries to heal itself, to heal the wounds. Cortman looks to
dialog: Eva.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Who goes forth tonight?
text: She motions toward TEN HEMOCYTE WARRIORS, their faces and bodies painted
dialog: differently than the others.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Feast on her. Let the blood give you strength.
dialog: Your brother's spirit will live within you. Go. Drink.
text: The ten move on the female like vultures to carrion. She SCREAMS and within
text: moments, she is drained. The other Hemocytes link hands and surround the
text: warriors. Cortman approaches the body of the female, a last glimmer of life
text: in her eyes. He whispers...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: This is not a punishment. It is a gift.
text: His talons puncture her heart. The talons RECEDE and her blood forms a pool
text: in the "cup' of Cortman's hand.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You have been chosen on this night of
dialog: glorious darkness to do battle with an
dialog: anachronism. our nemesis. Say his name.
text: Together, the warriors chant, "Neville."
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Allow the blood to flow through you, allow
dialog: its power to strengthen your limbs,
dialog: your flesh, your soul. Feel its beauty.
dialog: Feel its immense force.
text: Fueled by the fresh blood, the bodies of the ten men and women seem to grow
text: in mass and muscle. Their skin thickens, forming a kind of flesh armor.
text: They open their eyes and they are red with ferocity, Cortman raises his own
text: hand to his mouth, drinks, and kisses each warrior on the mouth.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Feel the power.
text: He repeats this down the line, and when finished, the warriors are
text: frighteningly pumped up, their bodies and spirits now adrenalized with
dialog: terrible dark energy.
text: Everyone chants, "Ne-ville". Again and again - "Ne-ville". Cortman signals
text: the DRUMMERS who begin an accelerated beat, an accompaniment to combat. Like
text: magnificent predatory beasts, the TEN WARRIORS MOVE across the barren
text: landscape and gather at the OUTSIDE FENCE. Cortman stands atop the
text: promontory and points at the house.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: DESTROY THE DEVIL!
dialog: The warriors SCREAM.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT
text: A dark intensity in his eyes, Neville watches the perimeter. The HOWLING and
text: DRUMMING of the Hemocytes echoes through the night sky. He does his best to
dialog: block it out. Block it out.
text: IN THE DISTANCE, LONG POLES are RAISED against the outer fence. The TEN
text: climb, reaching the razor-wired crest.
text: Neville looks through his INFRA-RED SIGHT, finds the CHEST of one warrior and
text: FIRES three rounds--two find the heart. The warrior drops. NEVILLE SEARCHES
dialog: for another target.
text: ATOP THE FENCE, the warriors struggle to avoid lacerating themselves with the
text: razor wire. THREE STRONG HEMOCYTES LEAP OVER THE WIRE and land in the
text: compound, avoiding the row of PIKES before the moat.
text: ON THE ROOF, Neville switches on SUPER BRIGHT LIGHTS aimed at the outer
text: fence. (We notice a considerable DIMMING of other lights in and around the
dialog: house--these lamps draw power).
text: ATOP THE FENCE, SIX HEMOCYTES are BLINDED by the light. One loses his
text: footing and FALLS BACK onto the exterior PIKES, horribly impaled. Another
text: BADLY CUTS HIMSELF on the razor wire. The blood loss is too great and the
text: warrior nearest him--a BEAUTIFUL FEMALE--wills it to her, drawing the fuel
text: into her mouth, into her system, and LEAPS into the compound.
text: IN THE CROW'S NEST, Neville removes the sight and uses the high-intensity
text: lamps to seek out the THREE remaining Hemocytes on the fence. He SHOOTS.
text: HITS one square in the chest, dropping him. SHOOTS. Bullets tear into the
text: flesh of another, but they're off-center and the WOUNDS HEAL. This Hemocyte
text: leaps, joining the others inside the compound.
text: The last of the three jumps down, but NEVILLE FIRES, catching her in mid-
text: flight, spinning her off-balance. She tries to correct her fall, but lands
text: on the INTERIOR PIKES. Her body is SPEARED in three different places, but
text: she's still alive.
text: ON THE ROOF, Neville SHUTS OFF the high-intensity lamps (returning power to
text: the other utilities). Inside the inner perimeter, the DOG BARKS, alerting
text: Neville to the FIVE HEMOCYTES who made it into the compound.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I know, I know.
text: He climbs through the hatch into the house.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville propels himself down the spiral staircase and moves to the MONITORING
text: STATION- On the closed-circuit screens, we can see FOGGY IMAGES of Cortman
text: and his followers outside the compound, IMAGES of the FIVE HEMOCYTES just
text: inside the compound, and THE DOG patrolling the inner perimeter.

dialog: You like surprises?
scene_heading: EXT. THE COMPOUND - NIGHT

text: He kisses her. The OTHERS congregate and drink her blood. The Impaled

text: Neville observes the COMPUTER as one of the "X"s steps onto a RED quadrant of
text: the grid. Neville PRESSES a button.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: We HEAR an ELECTRONIC "BEEP" before Warrior One steps on a REMOTE-CONTROLLED
text: MINE. The CONCUSSIVE BLAST propels him up and back, into the fiery ditch.
text: Across the moat, Warrior Four and the Beautiful Female look on in horror.
text: Frightened, Warrior Four slinks back in the direction of the outer fence.
speaker_heading: WARRIOR FOUR
dialog: We'll never get inside!
text: The Beautiful Female looks at him with disgust. She notices the blast has
text: torn a HOLE in the fence, creating easy access to the HOUSE ITSELF. She
text: turns to her cowardly comrade.
speaker_heading: BEAUTIFUL FEMALE
dialog: I have a better idea.
text: She extends her RAZOR SHARP TALONS...
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM. - NIGHT
text: Neville's eyes watch the monitors He can barely make out TWO HAZY FIGURES
text: beyond the moat. Suddenly, one drops from view. He checks the computer
text: screen. The sensors only show the area between the outer fence and inner
text: fence. (The area between the house and inner fence is unmonitored to allow
text: for the dog's patrols.) There is still one "X" outside the moat.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: The Beautiful Female stands over the corpse of Warrior Four, his throat
text: slashed, body pale and drained. RICH CRIMSON drips from her lips and her
text: body GROWS in strength and energy. She sets her sights on the house.
text: In a MAGNIFICENT LEAP, she hurdles over the moat, through the flames, and
text: LANDS on the other side. The DOG GROWLS. She HISSES and moves toward him,
dialog: talons ready.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville reacts with surprise as the final "X" disappears from the screen. He
text: adjusts the grid, fiddles with the mouse, checks the video screens --nothing.
text: OUTSIDE, the dog WILDLY, then MANICALLY SCRATCHES at the "dog door." Neville
text: rushes to it, but can't open it--it's stuck. The dog YELPS in fear. Neville
text: tries to force open the hatch, but it won't budge. The dog BARKS a warning.
text: Then SILENCE.
text: He rushes to the MONITORS, but can't see anything. Just smoke and dead
text: Hemocytes. He frantically paces. Then grabs a FLASHLIGHT and heads to the
dialog: basement.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Near the garage entrance, Neville removes a STEEL PLATE from the wall,
text: revealing a TUNNEL--about two feet high, three feet wide--leading from the
text: house, below the compound. He grabs two .45 AUTOMATICS from the Arsenal,
text: tucks them in his belt and slithers into the tunnel, flashlight showing the
dialog: way.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: Neville reaches a specific section of the crawlspace. Directly above him is
text: another HATCHWAY. He undoes a bolt, slides it back, shuts off the flashlight
text: and sits for a few moments in darkness, listening for movement above. When
text: he's satisfied with the level of quiet, he reaches for the hatch.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: The hatch, camouflaged by dirt and dry grass, FLIES UP from the ground. In a
text: flash, Neville SPRINGS UP, .45s at the ready. Silhouetted against the
text: gasoline flames in the moat, he surveys the area between the inner fence and
dialog: the house...
text: Nothing. He silently moves to the HOLE in the barbed wire, inspects it. He
text: follows FOOTPRINTS around the house, eyes moving side to side, behind, above.
text: He rounds a corner ... MOVEMENT. Raises his weapons. And finds...
text: Nothing. MOVEMENT. He spins, ready to shoot... THE DOG. on the opposite
text: side of the barbed wire fence, near the moat. Neville scolds the dog.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What are you doing over there?
text: Neville points to the hole.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Get inside.
text: The dog heads for the hole, then stops. He BARKS WILDLY. Neville spins, but
dialog: the warning comes too late.
text: THE BEAUTIFUL FEMALE Hemocyte stands a few feet away from him. Completely
text: nude. Her talons are sheathed, the blood wiped clean from her mouth and
text: chin. Although her pallor is ghostly, there is no denying her body is
text: comely, seductive, and magnificently shaped. Proud and calm, she extends her
text: hand toward Neville, as if welcoming him.
text: He raises one of the weapons and aims at her heart. She pouts. And takes a
text: step toward him. Neville's hand shakes. His face sweats. His finger cannot
text: pull the trigger. The dog senses his master's dilemma and RUNS for the hole.
speaker_heading: BEAUTIFUL FEMALE
dialog: Please don't hurt me. I want to...
text: The Beautiful Female steps within inches of him. Neville
dialog: hates himself for being unable to act.
speaker_heading: BEAUTIFUL FEMALE
dialog: ... touch you.
text: Her hands caress his face and she kisses his neck. Her hands move down his
text: body, along his arms, pull the guns from his fingers, and drop them to the
text: ground. She pulls Neville's hands to her breasts.
speaker_heading: BEAUTIFUL FEMALE
dialog: Touch me.
text: As Neville becomes lost in her flesh, the Beautiful Female extends an arm.
text: TALONS emerge from her fingers. Her eyes glow with hate, with blood lust.
speaker_heading: BEAUTIFUL FEMALE
dialog: So easy.
text: As her razor-sharp fingers move to his throat, THE DOG TACKLES them both.
text: Neville snaps out of his sexual reverie and PUSHES her away. She LASHES OUT,
text: SLASHING his forearm. Neville scrambles for the guns. The dog jumps at the
text: Hemocyte, but she bats him away, knocking him unconscious.
text: Neville aims the .45s. FIRES. Three-four-five-six shots from each gun.
text: Protecting herself, the Beautiful Female turns SIDEWAYS and covers her chest
text: with her arms. The SKIN
text: THICKENS an command, forming a protective shield. The bullets penetrate, but
dialog: do not cause damage.
text: Neville drops the spent, smoking weapons to the ground. The
text: Beautiful Female stands and "commands" her skin to return to "normal." She
text: looks the helpless Neville up and down and laughs. A superior, cruel laugh.
text: She bares her teeth, hisses, and moves in for the kill.
text: Like lightning, Neville reaches into a boot sheath, pulls his COMBAT KNIFE,
text: and drives it into his attacker's heart. The Beautiful Female SCREECHES WITH
text: SHOCK. Neville TWISTS the blade. She falls to her knees and tries to summon
text: her body to heal, but the damage is too great, the loss of blood immense.
text: She hisses and dies.
text: As life drains from her, her eyes become soft, almost human Neville is
text: haunted by the transformation. And cannot bear to watch. A WHIMPER. The
text: dog is regaining consciousness. Neville lifts him in his arms and heads for
dialog: the tunnel.
scene_heading: EXT. SURROUNDING AREA - NIGHT
text: Cortman kneels, deeply feeling. He rises. Stoic. Majestically raises his
dialog: arms...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Let them hear you. Tell their souls we
dialog: do not forget.
text: Christopher and his Clerics lead the tribe in a MOURNFUL
text: CHANT. The DRUMMERS provide haunting accompaniment. There is something
text: disturbing, yet beautiful about the sound.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL FACILITY - NIGHT
text: Neville is shirtless, tending to the laceration on his forearm. He
text: disinfects, bandages, then looks to the DOG who lies on an exam table,
text: stunned, but conscious. Neville examines his pelt for cuts, checks his bones
dialog: for breaks.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You okay?
text: The dog looks up at him with sad eyes, then licks his face.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You're okay.
text: The dog REACTS to the distant MOURNFUL SOUND generated by the Hemocytes.
text: Neville too can't seem to deny its power. He LIFTS the dog in his arms.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville huddles in a corner, cradling the dog in his arms, needing the
text: contact with another living thing. The MOURNFUL CHANTING INTENSIFIES. And
text: Neville fights back tears. He desperately holds the dog, burying his face in
dialog: his fur.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. SURROUNDING AREA - DAWN
text: The Hemocytes are long gone. The bodies of the warriors who never made it
text: past the outer fence have been taken away.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - DAWN
text: However, the bodies of the Hemocytes who died within the compound remain,
text: smoldering in the early morning light. The gasoline fire has died and black
text: acrid smoke forms a fine mist over the compound.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN
text: Neville and the dog slumber in the corner. An ALARM sounds from the upstairs
text: bedroom and Neville BOLTS AWAKE, reaching for a gun that isn't there. The
text: dog springs away. Body aching, Neville initiates his daily routine.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - MORNING
text: CLASSICAL MUSIC--upbeat (Vivaldi?)--plays over the following.
text: Neville works out in the EXERCISE ROOM. SHOWERS. Applies a new bandage in
text: the MEDICAL FACILITY. He selects a VIDEO-another past episode of the "Today
text: Show"--and a TAPE of "Morning Edition." The sounds of "normalcy." He removes
text: STEEL SHUTTERS from the roof of the GREENHOUSE. And picks fruits and
text: vegetables for today's meals. He stops near a section of FLOWERS, taken by
dialog: their simple beauty.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: He surprises himself by further depleting his supply of meat and giving the
text: dc>g another STEAK. The dog, too, is shocked, but delighted. Neville sits
text: at the small table, barely touches his oatmeal and strawberries, and watches
dialog: the dog.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You saved my ass last night, you son
dialog: of a bitch. (re the steak)
dialog: For what it's worth... Enjoy.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Neville DRESSES. He finds himself staring at the PHOTOGRAPH on his bedside
text: table. His wife and daughter. Both beautiful. Smiling. Neville's eyes are
text: cold. Almost blank.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Neville addresses the VIDEO CAMERA. His daily journal.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: My name is Robert Neville. I was born in
dialog: Des Moines, Iowa, October 17th, 1960.
dialog: My father was Bill, my mother Charlotte.
dialog: I had a daughter Grace. My wife... Ellen.
text: He stops. Continues...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Ten last night, there were ten. Tonight, they
dialog: will mourn and there'll be no attack. I'll have
dialog: "peace." But tomorrow it'll start all over again.
dialog: Why doesn't he give up? Why not, Cortman ?
dialog: Thinks.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Why don't you, Bob? Why don't you?
text: He stares into the camera.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - MORNING - LATER
text: The Land Rover waits near the inner fence. The dog observes Neville's bleak
text: task--the carting away of dead Hemocytes. Three corpses lay piled on the
text: roof of the vehicle and Neville drags two more out of the moat. He wears
text: gloves and a bandana covers his mouth and nose to block out the stench.
text: He tends to the sun-ravaged body of the Beautiful Female, but can't bear to
text: look at her face. LIFTS her in his arms.
scene_heading: EXT. PRESIDIO - DAY
text: The Land Rover turns off California Street just below Highway 1, onto the
text: grounds of the Presidio. It looks as though, at one time, a small war was
text: fought here. Neville steers the vehicle onto what once was the Army Golf
text: Course. No links here. Only DEEP PITS dug far, far into the earth. An old
scene_heading: sign reads: U.S. GOVERNMENT CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL EMERGENCY CREMATION
text: CENTER. The Land Rover stops.
scene_heading: EXT. PRESIDIO - CREMATION PIT - DAY - MINUTES LATER
text: The dog stays inside the Rover, hating the smell of this place. Neville
text: lines the Hemocyte corpses along the edge of the pit, douses them with
text: gasoline and pushes them over the side. The Beautiful Female is the last to
text: go. He lights a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and LOBS it into the pit. A BURST OF FLAME
text: rises into the air.
text: CAMERA CRANES to reveal the expanse and awful nature of this place. THREE
text: DEEP CRATERS filled with the bones and ashes of human beings. It is a
text: disturbing, unforgettable image.
text: Neville takes something from, the Rover and walks to the edge of another pit.
text: He kneels and we see a small bouquet of FLOWERS in his hand. He whispers...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I love you, Gracie.
scene_heading: EXT. PRESIDIO - DAY
text: The Land Rover exits, black smoke still rising from the pit.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - PORTALS OF THE PAST - DAY
text: Neville sits, waits. It is so silent, the air incredibly still. No
text: movement, no sound, nothing. Neville can't bear it. He erupts with
text: frustration, SCREAMS at the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - OUTER GATES - DAY
text: The fences and gates of the cemetery look like Fort Knox. More barbed wire
text: and evidence of conflict. SIGNS read: ENTRY FORBIDDEN! ABSOLUTELY NO ENTRY
text: PAST THIS POINT BY ORDER OF U.S. NATIONAL GUARD. TRESPASSERS SHOT ON SIGHT.
text: The Land Rover waits outside a heavily fortified gate. Neville carries a
text: huge CIRCLE OF KEYS. Uses one to open a padlock and chain.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: Many graves have been dug up, many vaults ripped down. Others carry
text: BIOHAZARD warning labels. The Land Rover stops at a BEAUTIFUL TOMB guarded by
text: statues of angels. The door to its interior locked and chained. Neville
text: waits. It's difficult for him, whatever he's about to do.
scene_heading: INT. TOMB - DAY
text: The door cracks open and Neville uses all his weight to push it in. LIGHT
text: fills the crypt, illuminating dead flowers on a stone casket. Followed by
text: the dog, Neville enters, collects the old flowers and lays fresh ones in
text: their place. He kneels, shuts his eyes, and silently prays.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: It was my birthday yesterday, Ellen.
dialog: Forty-two. You wouldn't recognize me,
dialog: sweetie--I'm in better shape today than I
dialog: was when we got married. (thinks of something)
dialog: Gracie's birthday is next month, isn't it?
dialog: She would've been ten. That's a big birthday
dialog: for a kid.
text: He can't continue. Whispers...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I miss you, Ellen. I miss you so much.

speaker_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: A beautifully decorated, sun-filled room. ELLEN NEVILLE, a pretty, gentle
text: woman, lies in bed, half-awake. in his bathrobe, Neville reads the morning
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Did you hear about this guy?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What guy?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Dr. John Krippen. He's at the U.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: This is really something.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Would you tell me, already?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Wow. In theory, this could cure AIDS.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: "Krippen's Viragene." (laughs) Sounds like
dialog: something you'd buy from an infomercial.
text: Neville reads to her from the article.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: "A simple hemocyte..."
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What's a hemocyte?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: A blood cell. (continues) "... which has been
dialog: genetically altered and adhered to a virus."
dialog: (explains) They started with lung cells a couple
dialog: years ago, but Krippen's working with blood
dialog: --on leukemia. (reads) "The altered cell--the
dialog: viragene--is injected into the bloodstream where
dialog: it destroys all cancerous cells and, by utilizing
dialog: the properties of a virus, replaces them with
dialog: healthy cells." It eats disease and makes you
dialog: healthy. "Dr. Krippen states that, in theory, use
dialog: of viragenes could be applied to HIV, other
dialog: forms of cancer, damaged nerves, blindness
dialog: --virtually any ailment."
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Let me get this straight. Genetic engineering
dialog: and viruses?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: The properties of a virus--I guess so it can
text: multiply and grow throughout the bloodstream.
dialog: But they disable it (MORE)
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (cont'd)
dialog: somehow, so it's not harmful. This is
text: amazing! And it's buried on page 12.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: It sounds dangerous, Bob.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Ellie...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: All these so-called scientific breakthroughs.
text: Playing with the building blocks of life.
dialog: As a race, do you think we can catch up?
dialog: I mean, we're back here, and they're twenty
text: miles down the road.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: (significantly)
dialog: It could cure cancer. All forms of cancer.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Maybe there's supposed to be cancer.
dialog: Does anyone think about that? What if
dialog: there's a reason? What if... All this goes
dialog: against God's plan?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I thought God's plan was simple.
dialog: She waits.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: To love each other, Ellie. To lend a
dialog: helping hand to someone in need, to care
dialog: for one another. Compassion.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Bobby, you're an idealist. You always
dialog: have been.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I have hope. You can never lose hope.
speaker_heading: GRACE'S VOICE
dialog: Mommy?
text: Their daughter appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What is it, honey?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I don't feel good today.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh, come here, sweetie...
text: Grace joins them in bed. Ellen hugs her close. Neville finishes the article
text: in the paper and joins them
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: (whispers in Ellen's ear)
dialog: I'm going to see him. This Dr. Krippen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABRUPT CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOMB - DAY
scene_heading: END FLASHBACK.
text: Neville stands. Dispassionate, almost militaristic in his movements. He
text: collects the dead flowers and exits.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: Neville locks the outer gate, climbs into the Land Rover and drives away, the
text: SUN an hour or two away from setting.
scene_heading: INT. EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAY / DUSK
text: Neville secures the house for the evening. Fills generators with gasoline,
text: checks power connections, repairs the hole in the inner fence, loads weapons,
dialog: etc.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
text: Neville barely touches his dinner as the dog devours its bowl of fresh chow.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The sun's last rays shine through the window slits. Neville washes dishes.
text: The dog glances at the "doggie door" leading outside. Neville tells him.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Not tonight. You can stay in tonight.
text: The happy dog follows him to the video monitor/computer station. Neville
text: checks the screens--no activity yet. He sits behind the computer and looks
text: at a CHESS PROGRAM--a game already in play. He analyzes the board, but is
dialog: distracted.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville goes through his archives of VIDEO TAPES.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville sits up in bed, the dog at the foot, on the floor, watching TV. Guns
text: in close proximity. A videotape plays John Ford's THE LOST PATROL. A small
text: group of British soldiers cracking under the pressure of attack by a superior
dialog: force of Arabs.
dialog: Neville's seen it many times. He's seen all his favorites too many times.
text: He gets bored with it, stops the tape, returns to the archives and moves to
text: another. He hesitates. Wanting to play certain tapes, and desperately not
text: wanting to play them. He gives in, selects one, and moves to the vcr.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
text: VIDEO IMAGES. His wife ELLEN and daughter GRACE (5 years old here) washing
text: the car in the back yard. Both wear bathing suits and are having a terrific
text: time with the water and soap suds. Ellen turns the hose on the camera and we
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE'S VOICE
dialog: Hey! This thing costs a lotta money!
text: The video camera ducks out of the way and we see Neville's bare feet.
text: Typical home movie shenanigans. He refocuses on his wife. She looks quite
text: lovely in her bikini.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: How come we're doing all the work?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yeah, how come? I think you should wash
dialog: the car, daddy.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Uh-uh. Mommy and I made a bet and she
dialog: lost.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You cheated!
text: REVEAL NEVILLE. Sitting on the edge of his bed, haunted by the images.
text: Haunted by his vibrant little girl, mesmerized by his wife's vitality, her
dialog: beauty.
text: And then we HEAR... MOURNFUL CHANTING. SLOW, RHYTHMIC DRUMMING-
text: The ghostly cries...
speaker_heading: VOICES OUTSIDE
dialog: Neville... Neville...
text: Neville shuts his eyes. Covers his ears. The dog goes to the balcony,
text: demurely barks a reminder. Neville looks out. In the distance, in the
text: darkness, the Hemocytes continue to MOURNFULLY WAIL. Neville SLAMS SHUT the
text: steel shutters.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville moves to an ALCOVE containing a HAM RADIO setup, dons HEADPHONES and
text: juices up the system. He SCANS and LISTENS. Nothing. The static and dead
text: air, however, blocks out the cries of the Hemocytes. Neville switches to the
text: emergency frequency and leans into his microphone...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
scene_heading: San Francisco KDX-CFY-CA 1971335.
scene_heading: San Francisco KDX-CFY-CA 1971335.
dialog: Listens. He's done this far too many times. Tried too many times. But
text: still, he listens.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: San Fran--
text: He stops. What was that? He turns up the volume and now we HEAR it, too.
dialog: Is it?
text: A human voice? Unintelligible, staticy. What did it say? Was it "Help
text: me?" Was it?! He adjusts the scanner, cranks the volume. It's gone. Just
dialog: like that, it's gone. Was it even there?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Hello? Please...
text: Static. There was nothing. You're cracking up! Neville rips the headphones
text: from his ears, throws them.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: There was nobody. Nobody.
text: He looks at the monitors, the Hemocytes. The CHANTING very loud now.
text: Neville SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: LEAVE ME ALONE! FOR GOD'S SAKE.
text: Manically, he runs upstairs, grabbing a HANDGUN on the way.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT
text: Neville indiscriminately FIRES the pistol.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: LEAVE ME ALONE !
text: He futilely empties the clip. The Hemocytes collectively HISS. He THROWS
text: the gun into the compound and falls to his knees. He cradles his head in his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Dear Jesus, why? Please. Why?
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: He secures the hatch and collapses onto his bed. The dog sadly approaches.
text: Softening greatly, Neville lays his hand on the dog. His eyes move to the
dialog: photo of his wife.
scene_heading: EXT. SURROUNDING AREA - NIGHT
text: The Hemocytes stand hand-in-hand in mournful vigil.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
text: THE BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS, NEVILLE.
dialog: YOU ARE THE MURDERER.. TRY TO SLEEP
scene_heading: TONIGHT. TRY. REMEMBER THE FACES
dialog: OF THOSE YOU KILLED. WE WILL NEVER
dialog: FORGET. AND ONE DAY, YOU WILL PAY.
dialog: I PROMISE YOU THAT. THERE WILL BE
speaker_heading: RETRIBUTION.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville's haunted face stares at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN'S VOICE
scene_heading: RETRIBUTION, NEVILLE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
text: Neville drives the Land Rover out of the compound.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - DAY
text: Eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses, a quiet, solemn Neville cruises the
text: deserted city streets.
scene_heading: EXT. CIVIC CENTER - DAY
text: City Hall is in ruins. The Federal Building blown to bits. The Library has
text: suffered damage, but the structure is intact. Neville, loop of wire in hand,
text: sets another SNARE on a lamp post and keeps a watchful eye on the surrounding
dialog: buildings.
dialog: What was that? Did something move? Nothing. Nothing, Bob.
scene_heading: EXT. EMBARCADERO - DAY
text: The Land Rover stops near the Bay Bridge. Neville looks
text: around. Cars are overturned, burned, rusting. Boats in the
text: harbor are ravaged, sunken.
scene_heading: EXT. EMBARCADERO - DAY - AN HOUR LATER
text: Neville has strung a series of five traps along the street. He's working on
text: his sixth when he realizes he won't have enough wire. He returns to the Land
text: Rover, pets the dog, and sets his machine gun on the roof of the vehicle. He
text: removes the Kevlar vest and his shirt. It's hot today. He drinks from a
text: bottle of water, grabs a fresh spool of wire, and returns to the post. He
text: arranges and sets the wire and prepares to bait it when he STOPS. Absolutely
text: dead stops.
text: MOVEMENT. About half a block away. He locates the source of the SOUND and
text: sees something in one of the abandoned buildings. Neville reaches for his
text: machine gun.
text: But it's not there. It's on the fucking roof of the Land Rover. The dog is
text: hyper-alert. He heard it, too. Keeping his eyes glued on the abandoned
text: building, Neville moves toward the vehicle...
text: The dog BARKS a warning, but it's too late...
text: Neville has stepped into the snare of his own trap!
text: SNAP! The wire WHIPS TAUGHT jerking Neville off his feet. He SMACKS his
text: head on the asphalt as the wire PULLS UP. The snare LOCKS into place and
text: Neville HANGS above the street, upside-down, his head about three feet from
text: the surface. The ALL-IN-ONE-TOOL FALLS from his pocket. He REACHES for it,
text: but it's already on the street.
text: The dog BARKS AND BARKS. Panicked, afraid, scolding. Neville is so pissed
text: at himself. The wire CUTS deep into his ankle. BLOOD drips to the street.
text: He's a little dazed, but Neville's desperately trying to maintain clarity.
text: The dog circles below, barking and whimpering. Neville breathes deeply,
text: gauges his surroundings. What to do?! And then he realizes why the dog is
dialog: so frantic.
text: The sun is setting.
text: As if on cue, his ELECTRONIC POCKET WATCH sounds its ALARM. BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.
text: The color drains from Neville's face. BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. Neville angrily
text: THROWS the watch down the street. The dog continues to BARK his warnings.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: SHUT UP! DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW?!!!
text: The dog backs off, circles the area, sniffs. Whimpers and growls.
text: Transforms into defensive posture.
text: SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT in a nearby building. Neville hears it. Looks at the
text: sky. About thirty, forty minutes before sunset. Damn! He calms himself.
text: Can't panic, absolutely cannot panic. He tries reaching for the wire, to
text: pull himself up, but it's just beyond his reach, the strain too great. He
text: remembers his KNIFE in the ankle sheath. Pulls it and HACKS at the wire. No
text: good. It would never cut through. He tucks the knife back into the sheath.
dialog: Thinks.
text: CRASH! Something falls and breaks in one of the shops. More MOVEMENT. The
text: dog REACTS, BARKS and RUNS to check it out.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: NO! STAY!
text: Neville can do nothing. The dog's gone. Must act quickly. Although it
text: makes the wire cut deeper into his ankle, Neville SWINGS back and forth,
text: making his body a pendulum. Reaches for the post. Misses. Swings back.
text: Forth. GRABS IT. Holds on for dear life. In an impressive feat of strength
text: and dexterity, he twists and PULLS himself up the post, to the overhang bar,
text: and CRAWLS along it, even though the tension it creates on the wire is
text: shredding his ankle.
text: Neville desperately tries to untangle the snare. His fingers can't quite do
text: the trick, so he pulls the KNIFE and uses it to SAW into the cable.
text: A HOWL from within a building.
text: Neville glances in the direction of the sound. Just as the blade succeeds in
text: slicing through enough of the wire, it weakens and SNAPS! Releasing an
text: unprepared Neville. He FALLS and lands HARD on the asphalt. A bone BREAKS
text: in Neville's wrist but that's the least of his worries.
text: He landed on the knife. It's sticking straight through the meat of his
dialog: thigh.
text: He screams in pain! Reaches for it, but that arm has a broken wrist--and
text: that's agony! He rolls to his side, feels for the handle with his good hand
text: and psychs himself up for what must be done. He PULLS the blade, SCREAMS,
text: and passes out.
text: The image loses focus... FADES... To BLACK. Silence.
text: FADE IN to grey. Unfocused, gaining sharpness... A SOUND. A wet sound...
text: The DOG LICKS Neville's face and pokes him, urging him to consciousness.
text: When Neville awakens...
dialog: IT IS NIGHT.
text: The look of terror on his face is unmistakable. The dog whimpers, prods him,
text: begging him to move. A small pool of blood has collected around Neville's
text: thigh and ankle. His broken wrist is swollen and he has a bad bump on his
text: forehead. He coughs, spits, raises his head...
text: The atmosphere of the Embarcadero has changed. Gone is the deadness and
text: silence--replaced by SOUNDS. Some far off, some closeby. Activity. There
text: is life. Some kind of life. The dog's defenses are way up. He sniffs and
text: growls.
text: The Land Rover is about fifty feet away. Such a short distance, but now, for
text: Neville, in this condition, it is more like fifty miles. He examines his
text: wrist, his ankle. The blood has coagulated and he looks to the thigh. He
text: rips part of his shirt into a tourniquet. It's difficult to work with the
text: broken wrist, but he manages to stop the bleeding. He tries to stand, but
dialog: that is a joke. The ankle is bad enough, but the thigh wound is just too
text: deep--it can't take the pressure. He falls back to the asphalt and catches
text: his breath. He finds the knife, clutches it in his fist--just in case--and
text: begins to drag himself toward the Land Rover.
text: SOUNDS. MOVEMENT. All around him. Something--footsteps?--circling the
text: area. Neville accelerates his pace. The dog viciously growls, BARKS! And
text: then Neville HEARS it, too. SNARLING. HOWLS. Not footsteps. Paws on
dialog: pavement.
text: Neville knows what's coming and it terrifies him. Again, he tries to stand,
text: but falls hard onto the street. He drags himself toward the vehicle, and his
text: dog begins to circle, BARKING, urging him to move faster. Neville stops when
dialog: he sees the first one...
text: A BLACK DOG. A hemocvte dog. Standing on top of a pile of rubble. Watching
text: him with icy grey eyes. The beast's fangs are bared--long, sharp, vicious
text: things. It assesses Neville and his dog. It BARKS AND HOWLS.
text: Neville's about twenty feet from the Rover. He remembers the MACHINE GUN on
text: the roof and yells at his dog.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: THE GUN! GET THE GUN!
dialog: But this isn't "Rin-Tin-Tin." The poor thing has no idea what Neville means.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: GET THE FUCKING GUN!
text: No use. Neville presses on, dragging his wounded body toward the Land Rover.
text: Holds tightly to the KNIFE when he sees...
text: FIVE MORE DOGS. DANE, BROWN, BOXER, WHITE, and GREY. All muscular, sharp-
text: fanged, and icy-eyed. They snarl and sniff, calmly waiting, gauging their
dialog: best attack...
text: The dog moves in close to Neville, guarding. Neville fears the worst. Hits
text: the dog with his arm, instructing him...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: GO! RUN! Get the hell out of here!
text: The dog doesn't move.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: GO! You stupid thing! GO!
text: But the dog will not leave him. And the attack begins.
text: Black BARKS and THREE RUSH IN. Neville's dog meets BROWN, immediately
text: engaging in combat. Neville knows his dog is doomed, but can't think about
text: that now. The OTHER TWO are upon him! He LASHES out with the KNIFE, ripping
text: WHITE open along the ribcage. The beast YELPS and retaliates and BITES into
text: Neville's thigh. Neville SCREAMS- And KNEES White with the opposite leg.
text: GREY BITES into Neville's broken wrist. The PAIN is unimaginable, but
text: Neville STABS GREY in the chest. AGAIN AND AGAIN. Blood bursts from Grey's
text: heart and the dog dies. Neville spins to see WHITE in the air, POUNCING,
text: eyes on Neville's jugular...
text: But the beast is broadsided by Neville's dog! Battered and bleeding, he
text: FIGHTS with a proud ferocity. Neville sees the badly wounded BROWN coming,
text: LICKING BLOOD from Grey to gain strength. As his dog engages in struggle
text: with White, Neville sees BOXER and DANE move in.
dialog: And Neville knows there is only one chance. Summoning every ounce of
text: strength and adrenaline in his body, he RISES to his feet and emits a
text: guttural, primordial SCREAM. Grimacing, denying the pain, he MOVES to the
text: Land Rover, forcing his fragile limbs forward.
text: As Neville's dog and White engage in a brutal dance, Brown-rushing on the
text: fresh blood--sets his sights on human prey. Neville makes it to the Land
text: Rover. He rests against it-just for a moment--then reaches up and grabs the
text: machine gun. He turns. Just in time to see Brown coming at him.
text: Neville OPENS FIRE and Brown is ripped in half. Neville WHISTLES and his dog
text: breaks away from White. Neville shoots White, then SPRAYS bullets at the
text: oncoming Boxer and Dane. The automatic weapon fire has the desired effect
text: and the two beasts--sufficiently intimidated--run away.
text: Neville and his dog relax for a moment, then, almost simultaneously, realize
text: they have forgotten about the leader, the BLACK. Who ERUPTS from behind,
text: knocking Neville to the ground. The Black is about to devour human neck when
text: Neville's dog BITES into Black's hindquarters. The Black YELPS, spins, and
text: LOCKS ITS JAWS onto the dog's neck.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: NO!!!!!!!
text: Neville SMACKS the Black with the butt of the machine KICKS him away, and
text: OPENS FIRE, emptying the clip into the hellish thing. Until it falls. Dead.
text: Neville checks his dog. The poor thing is bleeding badly. Fueled by
text: desperation and conviction, Neville LIFTS the dog and deposits him in the
text: Rover. Now well beyond pain-transcendent, really--Neville shuts the doors,
text: climbs behind the wheel, and gets the hell away.

scene_heading: EXT. AREA SURROUNDING NEVILLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The Hemocytes on their nightly vigil. Cortman observes Neville's house. The

scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville looks ahead, observing the terrain. He's about half a mile away from

speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm going to get us home.
scene_heading: EXT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville exits, opens the trunk, straps on two SHOULDER HOLSTERS with fully

speaker_heading: COCKTAIL.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET LEADING TO HOUSE - NIGHT
text: With its lights still off, the Land Rover slowly moves up the hill. And

scene_heading: EXT. AREA - SURROUNDING COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: The Hemocytes furthest from the fence have no time to REACT to the speeding,
text: armor-plated Rover heading straight at them.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville hits a series of SWITCHES.
scene_heading: EXT. AREA SURROUNDING COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: A BURST OF LIGHT! Not only from the LAMPS, but from a RACK OF LIGHTS on the
text: ROOF, two HIGH-BEAM lamps mounted near the side mirrors, and FOUR LIGHTS
text: rigged near the trunk.
text: The Hemocytes SCREECH and retreat. A few react like deer, frozen, and the
text: Land Rover just PLOWS through them. NEAR THE FENCE, CORTMAN REACTS. He sees
text: the Rover ROARING toward him and realizes Neville is outside the compound!
text: He stands at the GATE--the only way into the compound--and BELLOWS...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
speaker_heading: STOP HIM!
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville maintains focus. His eyes stay fixed ahead. He sees the Warriors
text: forming a wall in front of the GATE. Takes a deep breath... And STOPS the
dialog: Land Rover.
scene_heading: EXT. AREA SURROUNDING COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Hemocytes form a circle around the vehicle. The LIGHT blinds them and
dialog: SCORCHES their skin, but they must take advantage of this opportunity, they
dialog: must get Neville!
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville readies the machine gun, undoes a ceiling BOLT.
scene_heading: EXT. AREA SURROUNDING COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: A HATCH opens on the ROOF of the Rover and Neville pops up. He SPRAYS
text: MACHINE GUN FIRE in a circle, keeping the Hemocytes at bay. INTENSELY FIRES
text: at the Warriors barring the gate. Neville crawls out farther, rests the
text: machine gun, and pulls out the JERRY CAN. TWO BRAVE HEMOCYTES rush the Land
text: Rover, SMASH a side lamp and headlamp, and crawl toward Neville.
text: He pulls a sidearm and SHOOTS! Dead shots in their hearts. Takes a LIGHTER
text: from his utility belt. MORE HEMOCYTES move toward the Rover. Neville spots
text: them. Lifts the MACHINE GUN. FIRES, keeping them back--momentarily. He
text: tries to light the rag in the jerry can, but his hand isn't working well and
text: the lighter SLIPS down the windshield. Neville curses, crawls out, REACHES
dialog: for the lighter...
text: His arm is GRABBED by a Hemocyte. EVA. They lock eyes. She smiles and
text: TALONS emerge from her fingertips.
text: Neville's weak hand fumbles for a sidearm and PULLS the trigger. A BULLET
text: RIPS through Eva's shoulder, sending her back, spinning off the vehicle.
text: Neville SNATCHES the lighter, ignites the rag, and THROWS the jerry can at
text: the gate. It lands with a THUD. Neville FIRES the machine gun. Bullets RIP
text: into the can and BLAM! A FIREBALL! At least a dozen Warriors are roasted.
text: They stumble away, SCREECHING.
text: Cortman knows what Neville has in mind and hurriedly leads a CHARGE at the
dialog: Land Rover.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville drops into the driver's seat. He reaches up to close the hatch and
text: sees the FACE OF A HEMOCYTE. He FIRES. The shattered Hemocyte face
text: disappears from view and Neville SHUTS the hatch. PRESSES the REMOTE
speaker_heading: CONTROL.
scene_heading: EXT. AREA SURROUNDING COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: THE GATE SLIDES OPEN. Halfway to the Land Rover, Cortman realizes he's made
dialog: an error.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: BACK! INSIDE! INSIDE!
text: He changes the direction of the charge just as the Rover ROARS THROUGH THE
text: FIRE. SIX HEMOCYTES manage to jump on THE VEHICLE as it SPEEDS into the
text: compound and abruptly STOPS. Its REAR LAMPS SHINE on the open gate.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville hits the remote.
scene_heading: EXT. AREA SURROUNDING COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: The gate starts to shut. Cortman and his Warriors RUN to it. The HATCH on
text: the roof of the Land Rover FLIPS OPEN. Neville emerges, machine gun in hand.
text: First, he BLASTS THREE of the Hemocytes clinging to the Rover. (The other
text: three are smarter and hang onto the SIDES of the vehicle, out of Neville's
text: field of Vision.) Next, Neville SPRAYS the gate with machine gun fire,
text: keeping Cortman and the Hemocytes at bay. Neville can only urge the gate to
dialog: move faster...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: COME ON! COME ON!
text: He empties one clip, loads the LAST of the three, takes a few more shots,
text: then relaxes when the GATE IS SHUT.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville accelerates, shuts the hatch, hits another REMOTE.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: The other GATE--for the inner fence--SLIDES OPEN, as does the DOOR to the

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
text: The Rover SCREECHES to a stop, almost crashing into the wall. The overhead

scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT
text: Neville checks the dog, comforts him, and almost opens the door. He stops
text: when he faintly hears a SCRATCHING on the outer shell of the vehicle.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
text: The Three Hemocytes quietly release their hold on the Land Rover and set foot

scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Were you fellas Boy Stouts? You know

scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
text: The three Hemocytes barely have time to notice the HALOGEN LAMPS lining the

speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Be prepared.
text: As they lay dying, Neville shuts off the wall lamps, opens the passenger

scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL FACILITY - NIGHT
text: Neville deposits the dog on an exam table. How can he stand the pain?! His
text: body shinners with sweat from exertion, his eyes barely open, barely
text: conscious. After making sure the dog is stable, he tends to his own wounds.
text: Can't help the dog 'til you help yourself. He goes to a cabinet and INJECTS
text: himself with a small dose of MORPHINE to eliminate the pain. To keep himself
text: alert, he sniffs a capsule of AMYL NITRATE, then injects himself with an
speaker_heading: ANTIBIOTIC.
text: He takes a SCALPEL and cuts open his pants leg. The thigh is damn bad. He
text: cleans it--which stings like a mother--bandages it, then releases the
text: tourniquet. God, it hurts! He thinks about another shot of morphine, but he
text: must stay conscious. He painfully removes his boots and cleans and bandages
text: the ankle. Now the wrist. Swollen, throbbing. He feels the tendons, the
text: bones, locates the affected section. He readies a splint, some tape, and
dialog: more amyl nitrate.
text: And then, amazingly, Neville sets his own broken bone. The pain is intense.
text: He nearly passes out, but manages to crack open another capsule of amyl
text: nitrate. He applies the splint and tape. It's sloppy, but it does the job.
text: Neville turns to the dog. He injects the poor thing with a strong dose of
text: morphine, knocking him out. He cleans and bandages, making sure bleeding has
dialog: stopped, but he knows, and we know, that these wounds are deep and serious.
text: Neville watches the dog's sad eyes as the morphine kicks in. He leans in and

speaker_heading: NEVILLE

dialog: at maximum power.
scene_heading: EXT. AREA SURROUNDING COMPOUND - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: After what he has done? The blood he spilled?

text: He looks at the wounded, the dead.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: But you are right about one thing, Christopher.
dialog: That must change. We have lost too many.
dialog: Neville's death will come, of that I am certain, but it

dialog: (to his followers) He will not have that pleasure.
dialog: But Neville will pay. We will feast on his flesh and

scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: All right, Cortman, come on.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: No one there. He scans the area around the fence. There's one, two... A

text: drumming. Silence. Defeat. Is he grateful? Astonished? Or disappointed?
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL FACILITY - NIGHT
text: Neville hobbles over to the exam table and turns his attention to the
text: unconscious dog. He stitches and disinfects--as if this were the most
dialog: important medical procedure ever performed. He will not let this dog die.
text: He lifts one of the dog's eyelids and despises what he sees.
text: A faint greyness to the iris.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Neville searches for something near the Arsenal.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL FACILITY - NIGHT
text: Neville rests a heavy KENNEL CAGE / CARRIER on the floor. He puts a child's

dialog: exits.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

text: cells. They move anxiously, searching, desperate to survive. They lose
text: momentum and cease movement. (5/7/98/3:33 p.m.).
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: No additional blood has been given to the
text: host. Subject terminates.
text: ABRUPT CUT. LARGE IMAGE: The dog's dead form lies motionless. A scientist
text: carefully injects it with blood. SMALL IMAGE: fresh blood cells swim past
dialog: the dead cells.
text: They flicker to life. (5/9/98/4:24 p.m.).
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: No heart, respiratory, or brain function in
dialog: forty-eight hours. Fifty cc's of blood
dialog: injected into expired host.
text: LARGE IMAGE: the Shepherd's limbs TWITCH with life. The bluegreyness returns
text: to its formerly lifeless eyes.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
text: Reanimation occurs in 15.6 seconds.
text: LARGE IMAGE: the Shepard STAPES at the surveillance camera. Bares its fangs
text: and snarls.
text: Neville abruptly STOPS the tape. He moves to the dog's cage and unhinges the
text: door. The dog is still sedated and Neville locates a syringe and DRAWS
text: BLOOD. He places a DROP on a glass slide and examines it under a MICROSCOPE.
text: He REWINDS the videotape in SEARCH mode and FREEZES it so he can compare the
text: SMALL SCREEN IMAGE to what he sees under the microscope.
text: The dog is still in the first stage. Neville notes the LED readout--
text: 5/4/98/7:02 p.m.). He FASTFORWARDS in SEARCH mode and STOPS on the IMAGE of
text: the lethargic, depressed, hostile Shepherd. (5/4/98/11:10 p.m.). Sadly
dialog: realizes how little time he has...
scene_heading: INT. KRIPPEN CENTER - OFFICE - DAY
text: The nameplate on the door tells us this was the office of DR. JOHN KRIPPEN.
text: Neville glances at the mementos on the desk-photos, awards--and wall--
text: diplomas, certificates, a PHOTO of the entire academic staff of Berkeley.
text: Standing among the distinguished gentlemen and ladies is Robert Neville.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. KRIPPEN CENTER - OFFICE - DAY
text: DR. KRIPPEN escorts a VISITOR into his office. Offered a chair, NEVILLE sits
text: opposite Krippen. Looking every bit the professor in tweed jacket and
text: corduroys, Neville smiles...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Thanks for seeing me, Dr. Krippen.
text: Krippen is happy, energetic, pleased with himself.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: We don't get too many visitors from the
dialog: History Department. (recalls) We met at
dialog: the Christmas Party, didn't we?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Yeah, Jeff introduced us.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Listen, I know you're busy, so I'll get
dialog: right to it. The work you're doing with
dialog: leukemia--from what I read in the paper,
dialog: it seems to me the same principles could
dialog: apply to other forms of cancer.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: Absolutely. We chose leukemia because,
dialog: well, if we can do it with blood, we can do
dialog: it with just about anything in the body.
dialog: Once we tackle blood, the rest...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: The lymph system?
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: Down the line, yes.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: How far down the line?
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: What's the problem, Professor ?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Six months ago my daughter Grace was
dialog: diagnosed with lymphatic cancer.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: How old is she?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Seven. (a plea) If you could see her...
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: I'd be happy to recommend someone, but
dialog: there's really nothing I can do.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Please...
text: Krippen's SECRETARY pops her head in...
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: The "Nightline" crew is here.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: Have them set up in the lab, Margie. Oh!
dialog: And let Ben know they're here.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Right.
text: She exits. Neville feels insignificant, rejected.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: Going to be on TV tonight.
text: Neville sort of nods. Krippen scribbles a name and number on a piece of
dialog: paper, gives it to Neville.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: Dr. Tom Bernardi. He's the best pediatric
dialog: oncologist I know. Make sure you tell him
dialog: I referred you.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: We have a doctor.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: Well. I see. If you'll excuse me, professor.
text: Neville nods, stands, as Krippen shows him the door.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. KRIPPEN CENTER - MAIN CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Krippen hurries to the LAB. Neville stands outside the office and crumples
text: the piece of paper in his fist. Through a glass partition, we catch sight of
text: a PATIENT. As if he senses Neville's stare, the man turns...
dialog: It is Cortman. Healthy. Human.
speaker_heading: END
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL CENTER - DAY
text: Neville offers a bowl of food to the dog, but it is uninterested. Neville
text: tries a dish of water. No reaction. The dog sadly curls up in a corner of
dialog: the cage.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
text: Neville examines a recent blood sample from the dog under the microscope.
dialog: His reaction tells us things are getting worse.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
text: Neville sits in the corner, on the floor, watching the dog slowly die. The
text: poor thing is withering away to flesh and bone. Neville can't stand it. He
text: rises, reaches for a GUN, and aims at the dog's heart. His arm hangs there,
dialog: waiting.
text: The dog's pained eyes look to him... Why? Neville cannot do it. Lowers the
text: gun. And makes the decision. He takes a syringe and begins to withdraw
text: BLOOD from his own arm. He allows a catheter to pour the red liquid into a
text: pan. when he's lost about half a pint, he stops the process, opens the cage
text: door, places the dish inside, LOCKS it.
text: He cannot watch as the animal hungrily laps up the blood.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: Neville stands in the crow's nest, rifle nearby. He raises the night-vision
text: binoculars to his eyes ... Nothing. No sign
text: The dog. Forever changed. Rejuvenated by the blood. Possessing a new
text: strength. It paces, gnaws on the bars, and growls at Neville. The icy grey-
text: blue eyes of the dog do not see a friend, a master. They see food.
text: HOWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLL! The beast's appetite is great. The hunger painful.
text: Neville curses himself for what he has done. SLAMS shut the door.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDIA CENTER - NIGHT
text: Neville cranks MUSIC-Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. LOUD. Neville sits.
text: Thinks. Nervous. Concerned. He lurches to the stereo and shuts it off. Is
text: drawn to a stack of
text: VIDEOTAPES. Most labeled KRIPPEN. Another handful: CORTMAN.
text: A TV SCREEN FLICKERS TO LIFE: NIGHTLINE with Ted Koppel. Neville stares.
dialog: Painful memories...
speaker_heading: TED KOPPEL
dialog: ... and this is 'Nightline.' The world of medicine
dialog: has seen its share of miracle cures, from polio
dialog: vaccine to heart transplants. However, all past
dialog: achievements may pale in comparison to the
dialog: work of Dr. John Krippen...
text: The tape FAST-FORWARDS. DR. KRIPPEN engages with Koppel...
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: The process is simple. A blood cell is
dialog: genetically engineered to incorporate the
dialog: properties of a virus. When this viragene is
text: introduced into a diseased circulatory system,
dialog: the new cells seek out the cancerous cells,
dialog: destroy them, and replace them with healthy
dialog: cells.
speaker_heading: TED KOPPEL
dialog: There is some concern, though, doctor,
dialog: because of the viral element.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: We need to use a powerful virus, yes,
text: but the virus itself is made impotent.
dialog: We simply utilize its essential characteristics,
dialog: its benefits--rapid duplication, molecular strength.
dialog: This isn't really a virus. It's not contagious,
dialog: it's not destructive.
text: Neville LAUGHS. He fast-forwards. The video image now includes CORTMAN. He
text: and Krippen are seated in the lab. Cortman is the picture of vitality and
text: health. Although a bit pale, he's muscular and charismatic...
speaker_heading: TED KOPPEL
dialog: Joining us from Berkeley is "Patient One,"
dialog: Mr. Benjamin Cortman.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: TED KOPPEL
dialog: Mr. Cortman, one year ago, you were
dialog: diagnosed with terminal cancer. Leukemia.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: That's correct.
speaker_heading: TED KOPPEL
dialog: And today?
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: I'm cured. Thanks to Dr. Krippen.
dialog: Every blood cell in my body is 100% healthy.
dialog: Better than ever before.
speaker_heading: TED KOPPEL
dialog: Indeed. There have been rumors, Dr. Krippen,
dialog: that your viragene not only eliminates disease,
dialog: but revitalizes the system as well.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: That is a positive side effect, yes.
speaker_heading: TED KOPPEL
dialog: What other side effects are there?
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: None, really, that...
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: ... Photosensitivity...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: ... Oh. Yeah. The sun... My skin is really
dialog: sensitive to light
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: Which has to do with blood supply...
speaker_heading: KOPPEL
dialog: Yes, and that brings up the harshest
dialog: criticism of your work, Dr. Krippen.
dialog: The tremendous amount of donated blood
dialog: needed to pursue these experiments...
speaker_heading: ELLEN'S VOICE
dialog: He's very handsome.
dialog: Neville turns...
text: REVEAL we are now in his OLD BEDROOM. Watching TV with his wife. Their
text: daughter GRACE fast asleep in Neville's arns. (NIGHTLINE continues in the
dialog: background).
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Krippen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: No, silly, the other one. The patient.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: He was there today. I saw him.
dialog: He had scary eyes.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Scary is attractive. Don't you know
dialog: anything, Bobby?
text: CLOSE ON CORTMAN'S FACE. VIDEO STATIC. The NIGHTLINE tape has been
text: replaced. We are now watching an in-house INTERVIEW with Cortman inside the
dialog: Krippen Center.
text: He is inside a PADDED CELL. The camera recording this must have been behind
text: a thick wall of PLEXIGLASS. Cortman STARES at the lens. He is naked save a
text: pair of boxer shorts. His body is muscular, his extremely pale skin drenched
text: in sweat. He's lost most of his hair and his eyes are ice.
text: He's in a very agitated state. He paces, no stalks around the cell,
text: occasionally pounding his fists against or headbutting the plexiglass wall.
text: KRIPPEN'S DISEMBODIED VOICE is piped into the cell.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN'S VOICE
dialog: Ben?
text: Cortman SLAMS his body into a wall.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN'S VOICE
dialog: Ben? Why don't you try to calm, down?
text: Cortman RUSHES to the plexiglass and sneers...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Calm? CALM?! YOU WANT ME TO
dialog: FUCKING CALM DOWN?!!
dialog: YOU GO TO HELL, KRIPPEN.
dialog: YOU GO THERE AND MEET YOUR
speaker_heading: MAKER.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN'S VOICE
dialog: Ben...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: GIVE IT TO ME! ! ! !
text: We HEAR Krippen push something through a SLIDING TRAY into the padded cell.
text: Inside, Cortman LUNGES for the contents of the drawer--a plastic packet of
text: BLOOD and a syringe.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN'S VOICE
dialog: Please use the syringe this time, Ben.
text: Cortman throws the needle. RIPS open the blood packet and DRINKS. Every
text: drop. Licks the plastic clean. Mouth smeared with crimson, he placidly
text: approaches the plexiglass...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You don't understand, doctor.
dialog: It's the taste. The flavor.
dialog: (lost in reverie) I can feel it...
dialog: Feel it inside me. (laughs)
dialog: God. It's so beautiful...
text: The blood races through his veins, apparent to us due to the translucence of
text: Cortman's flesh. His muscles grow-pectorals, biceps. A transformation from
dialog: man to superman.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You did this. You made me. I am the
dialog: future, Dr. Krippen. Live with that.
text: VIDEO STATIC. A new tape. KRIPPEN. A shell of a man. A wreck. In the
dialog: b.g., a
text: blaring ALARM and flashing EMERGENCY STROBE LIGHTS. From head to toe, he is
text: soaked with water. He clutches computer print-outs. Clears his throat and
text: tries to muster up his former pride and dignity...
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: The latest estimates have it spreading to the
dialog: rest of the country in six days. By the time
dialog: it hits New York, ninety-five percent of the
dialog: population of California will be infected.
dialog: The fighting in the streets... The bloodshed...
dialog: I fear is nothing but a harbinger of the real
dialog: battle yet to come. (fights back nausea) We
dialog: have determined that exposure to sunlight,
dialog: plasma starvation, oxygen depravation, massive
dialog: blood loss, and severe damage to the heart are
dialog: the only lethal means of stopping those... infected.
dialog: Even so, cremation is the sole guarantee that
dialog: reanimation will not occur.
text: He wipes moisture from his eyes. The ALARM stops. Somewhere, beyond the
text: thick walls of the center, we HEAR the CRIES of the Hemocytes...
speaker_heading: VOICES OUTSIDE
dialog: Krippen... Krippen...
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: Yes. Well. My latest blood test reveals
dialog: I am in stage two of the disease. Already
dialog: my mind is beginning to deteriorate into
dialog: fantasies of savagery. I feel the desire to
dialog: feed, but I cannot bear the thought of it.
dialog: Nor can I bear the thought of...
dialog: Of Cortman ripping me open. Gutting me.
dialog: Feasting...
text: He pulls something from his pocket. A LIGHTER. We finally notice an object
text: in the background. An empty GASOLINE CAN.
dialog: That's not water he's covered with.
speaker_heading: KRIPPEN
dialog: God forgive me.
text: He ignites the lighter. His body BURSTS INTO FLAMES.
dialog: Neville shuts off the TV. Why? Why did I watch it again? Why torture
text: myself?! He presses his fists against his temples. Closes his eyes.
text: HOWWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLL... The dog again. It BARKS and MOANS...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: STOP IT! STOP!
text: Neville watches the SECURITY MONITORS. Where are they? HOOOOWWWWLLLL...
text: Damn dog. Neville STORMS to the medical center. He looks like he could
dialog: strangle the beast,
text: but he stops and leans against the door...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm sorry...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: MORNING. Neville asleep. Slumped against the med center door. All is
text: quiet. But the silence is broken by a HORRIFIC CRY OF PAIN. Neville bolts
text: awake. He flings open the door.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL CENTER - MORNING
text: A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT slices through the room to the cage. The dog desperately
text: tries to stay away, but the light touches its tail and sizzles. The dog
text: CRIES. Neville shoves the cage aside and covers the window with a blanket.
text: He moves to tend to the dog, hut it snarls at him as he approaches.
text: The dog's body is thin and weak. Its eyes are blank, the tongue a sick,
text: pasty white. Neville draws blood from himself, but places the packets in a
text: refrigerator. The dog sees them, and it drives him mad with thirst.
text: He yelps and whines, begging for the blood, but Neville betrays no emotion.
dialog: How could he torture the poor thing like this?
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - OUTER FENCE - DAY
text: Neville walks the perimeter.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: A stoic Neville eats breakfast.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GREENHOUSE - DAY
text: Neville tends to his garden.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
text: Neville repairs the Land Rover. Four o'clock.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL CENTER - DAY
text: Neville enters, careful not to allow in sunlight. Switches on a flashlight.
text: Its beam finds the dog. Inside the cage. Dead. This is what Neville
text: expected. He covers the cage with a blanket and retrieves the blood from the
dialog: refrigerator.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS/PARK - DAY
text: The Land Rover drives over rough terrain, through an unpopulated, thickly
text: wooded park area, and stops at Land's End, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
text: Neville climbs out, machine gun in hand, and surveys the area. The dirt
text: reveals SMALL ANIMAL TRACKS and up above, in the sky, are a few SEAGULLS.
text: Neville can't believe it. He hasn't seen a bird in quite awhile. When they
text: see him, however, they take flight, soaring out to the ocean.
text: Neville steps down to the BEACH. To his right, a LIGHTHOUSE and PIER. To
text: his left, built into a hillside, is a THICK IRON DOOR. A weather-beaten sign
scene_heading: reads SAN FRANCISCO UNDERGROUND TRANSIT--MAINTENANCE TUNNEL.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY
text: Neville searches. Empty. Nothing lives here. When he reaches the top,
text: Neville looks out at the majestic ocean, the sun beginning its descent. He
text: looks down at the PIER. And spies an old TUGBOAT moored there.
scene_heading: INT. TUGBOAT - DUSK
text: Neville takes a closer look. Apparently, the craft is still seaworthy.
dialog: What about it, Bob? Just go...
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DUSK
text: Neville removes the cage from the Rover and pulls off the blanket. He fills
text: a syringe with his blood, takes the already-prepared packets and rests them
text: on the ground. He looks at the dog's dead eyes and whispers...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Good-bye.
text: He opens the cage door, injects the beast with blood, then quickly runs to
text: the Land Rover and locks himself inside.
scene_heading: INT. LAND ROVER - DUSK
text: Neville watches as the dog's body twitches back to life. It lifts its head
text: and color--icy blue-grey--returns to its eyes. They find Neville. He
text: exchanges one last look with the dog, then speeds away, unable to linger.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Again, Cortman and the Hemocytes do not come.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: A forlorn Neville sits at the table, his dinner uneaten.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville watches the surveillance monitors. Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT
text: Neville in bed, wide awake.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Neville stares at his uneaten breakfast. In a sudden BURST of VIOLENCE, he
text: SWIPES the food onto the floor.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Although it's the middle of the day, Neville lies in bed, eyes staring
text: blankly ahead, gently rocking himself.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY
text: Neville stares at the religious icons. They mean nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The Land Rover ROARS out of the compound.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBS - DAY
text: The VEHICLE stops outside a decaying grocery store.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
text: Neville fills a SATCHEL with bottles of LIQUOR--scotch, wine, gin, vodka.
dialog: What the hell, grab CIGARETTES, too.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Neville stands at the kitchen table. Fills a goblet with wine, a tumbler
text: with scotch, and a martini glass with gin. The ritual is complete. Just one
text: last step. Just go ahead... He lifts the tumbler of scotch to his lips.
dialog: Stops.
text: He returns it to the table and goes to the media center. Locates and plays a
text: VIDEOTAPE. One of his "diary" tapes, clearly made awhile ago. This Neville
text: is pudgy, pasty, heavily bearded, and very drunk. He holds a PISTOL in one
text: hand and a bottle of booze in the other.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (ON TAPE)
dialog: ... Nobody tells Bob Neville what to do.
dialog: That's because there is nobody--not one
dialog: damn body--to tell me anything! (laughs)
dialog: What the hell difference does it make,
dialog: anyway, right? Most people are bores,
dialog: or assholes, or creeps, or... People betray you,
dialog: people criticize you, people steal from you.
dialog: Who needs people? (laughs hard) People who
dialog: need people are the stupidest people in the world.
text: In the background, we hear VOICES bellowing, "Neville..."
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (ON TAPE)
dialog: SHUT UP! SONSOFBITCHES!
text: He FIRES madly at the walls. HURLS the bottle, shatters it.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (ON TAPE)
dialog: Fuck. What'dja do that for, Bobby? That
dialog: was the last of the scotch. Stupid.
text: He points the gun at his own temple. Pulls the trigger. CLICK. Empty
text: chamber. Neville breaks up with LAUGHTER. The tape is shut OFF. Neville
text: stares at the blank screen.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Neville empties the bottles of liquor into the sink.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville lies in bed. Wide awake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GREENHOUSE - DAY
text: Many of the fruits and vegetables are rotting.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN DAY
text: Dirty dishes piled in the sink.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT DAY
text: The shooting range is empty. Exercise equipment unused.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDIA CENTER - DAY
dialog: No wall of sound. No "normalcy."
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Neville still in bed. Empty food wrappers and water bottles litter the
text: floor. He stares at the PHOTO of his wife and daughter. He's been staring
text: at it for days. Finally, before he--and we--can take it no longer, he sits
dialog: up...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Get up, Bob. Just get up.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: The VIDEO CAMERA sits before him, recording. Neville stares at the lens,
text: words failing to come to his mouth. And then...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: My name is Robert Neville. I was born
dialog: in Des Moines, Iowa. I had a wife Ellen
dialog: and a daughter Grace. Since this all
dialog: happened, I've had many dogs. They're
dialog: good scouts, good sentries. They were
dialog: necessary. And disposable. But this last one,
dialog: he... He was a good dog. He seemed to...
dialog: Gracie would've liked him. It was my fault.
dialog: My own stupid fault.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY
text: Dishevelled and depressed, Neville wanders around the park and finds himself
text: at Portals of the Past. Somewhat dazed, he sits on his usual bench. One of
text: his old LEAFLETS at his feet. He
text: smirks at his desperate plea for contact then realizes something is written
dialog: on the other side...
dialog: WHERE ARE YOU ROBERT???
text: For a moment, he thinks he's going crazy. But no, it's there, right in front
text: of him. And then he notices the entire bench is covered with leaflets.
text: Crudely, quickly taped down. All bear variations of the same message...
dialog: WHERE ARE YOU?
text: He stands. Disbelieving. Exhilarated. Terrified. Suspicious. He rips the
text: flyers from the bench, frantically gathering them. One which conveys a more
dialog: detailed message...
dialog: I HAVE TRIED FOR DAYS TO MEET YOU. WHERE ARE YOU,
dialog: ROBERT? I AM ALONE AND NEED HELP. ARE YOU FOR REAL?
text: Neville feels a shiver run through his body. He searches his
text: pockets for something to write with and scrawls a reply...
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I should have been here every day. I
dialog: will be
dialog: here tomorrow, I will. 12 noon. When the sun is highest in the sky. I am
dialog: real.
dialog: I will help. I am here.
text: He signs his name and tapes it to the bench.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm here, (shouts) I'M HERE. (at the
dialog: top of his lungs) I AM HERE.
text: His VOICE ECHOES throughout the city.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Again, the area is devoid of Hemocyte activity.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT
text: Like a housewife preparing for company, Neville cleans the house from top to
text: bottom. Changes bedding, washes clothes, tends to the garden. There's a
text: manic energy to his activity. He's not entirely "all there."
text: And then, when everything is clean, when the house sparkles, he turns to
text: himself. He showers, shaves, clips his nails, washes his hair. Stares at
text: himself in the mirror, smiling.
text: And the smile fades as a moment of clarity prevails.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Near the firing range, Neville dismantles a thick wire door used for storage.
text: He gathers some lumber, some metal plating, and his tools.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT
text: Neville dumps everything from the basement into the room. Clears out a
dialog: corner and gets to work.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Wearing a fresh outfit, bulletproof padding, and heavily armed, Neville
text: climbs into the Land Rover.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY
text: Neville stakes out the surrounding area. Checks any place where someone
text: might hide. Places MOTION DETECTORS in a circle about two hundred feet
text: surrounding the bench. Doublechecks his weapons. Looks at his watch.
text: 11:45. He waits. Not sure what to expect. He rests an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
text: next to himself on the bench. It will alert him to anything that moves past
dialog: the sensors.
text: 11:55. The area surrounding the bench is relatively free of clutter. A
text: waste basket, rotting garbage, newspapers, etc.
text: 12:01. Neville looks around. Already anxious. Clutches his machine gun.
text: He does not hear or see the pile of ROTTING GARBAGE move. He does not see a
text: HAND. He does not see a HUMAN FIGURE emerge from a HOLE, dug into the ground
text: behind the bench, a GUN in its hand...
text: However, Neville does feel the barrel press into his neck.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Don't move.
text: Neville does not panic. Simply does as he is told.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Now. Real slow. Put the gun down.
text: Neville follows orders. The gun barrel fits snugly into the base of his
dialog: skull.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Well, well, well. I was beginning to think
dialog: you were a fairy tale.
text: She starts to move around him. The gun moves with her.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Oh no. I'm real.
text: And with the quickness of a cat, Neville ducks and BACKHANDS her hard. She
text: FIRES a wild shot. Neville PUNCHES. SQUEEZES her wrist until she releases
text: her gun. Neville grabs it and PISTOL BUTTS her in the forehead, knocking her
dialog: out.
text: He stands. Finally able to look at his attacker. She's covered in filthy
text: rags from head to toe. Neville pulls back the cloth covering her face...
text: Although sheathed in dirt and grime, she is beautiful. Her flesh doesn't
text: boil and blister in the sunlight. He brushes away her long dark hair. She
dialog: can't be over twenty. She's still a kid.
text: Neville checks the area, the sensors. No, she's alone all right. He checks

text: lifts her in his arms, and carries her to the Land Rover.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL CENTER - DAY
text: The GIRL lies on an exam table, unconscious. Neville removes the filthy
text: clothing, stripping her down to t-shirt and leggings. Can't let his eyes
dialog: dwell on her breasts, her...
text: He washes her face and tends to her forehead. He prepares a syringe and when
text: he looks for a vein, he sees TRACK MARKS running up and down each arm. He
text: moves to her BACKPACK and dumps its contents. A few cans of food, rounds of
text: ammunition, a flashlight, batteries, syringes and ampules of Red Cross
text: MORPHINE. Neville shakes his head.
text: He takes the syringe and carefully withdraws a BLOOD SAMPLE from a vein in
text: her hand. Despite the long, dirt-encrusted fingernails, they are beautiful
text: hands. Exquisite. He looks away. Takes the blood sample, injects it into a
text: test tube, and places it in the centrifuge.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: All is quiet. Again, the Hemocytes fail to appear.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT
text: Neville sits at the table, eating dinner and looking at bloodwork through a
text: portable microscope. From the Medical Center, we hear a RATTLING. Then a
text: TERRIBLE SCREAM. Neville expected this. He takes a plate of food from the
dialog: stove.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT
text: Neville opens the door and we SEE the Girl is trapped inside a CAGE.
text: Constructed last night by Neville specifically for this purpose. She is not
text: happy. Like a rabid, feral animal, she rattles her cage and SCREAMS. He sets
text: the plate of food on the counter and sits in a chair a few feet away from
text: her. Calm. Cool. Waits for her to blow off steam.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You hungry?
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: LET ME OUT!!!
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: GO TO HELL! That's my name!
dialog: Go To Hell.
text: He opens his hand revealing a vial of MORPHINE- She stops.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You're addicted?
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: That's mine.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Your blood's full of this shit.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Give it to me.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: But you're not infected. AB Negative.
dialog: You're immune. Like me.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: I said that's mine. You have no right.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: That was pretty good. Your little stunt
dialog: in the park. Got the drop on me.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: I wasn't sure. It coulda been a trick.
dialog: You coulda been one of them. When
dialog: they first get it, they can still take the sun.
dialog: That's why I'm in here, right? You weren't
dialog: sure about me, either.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: But... You seen my blood. You know I'm
dialog: okay, so let me out.
text: He grabs a sponge, soap, and a bowl of water. Places them-and the food--on
text: the floor just outside the cage.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You should eat. And wash up.
dialog: You smell pretty bad.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: (re the morphine)
dialog: Do it and you get some of this.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Give it to me NOW.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: This isn't a negotiation.
text: She lifts the bowl, soap, sponge and HURLS it at Neville. He sidesteps as it
text: shatters on the wall. She lifts the food and THROWS, SPLATTERING his shirt.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Fine. We'll try this again a little
dialog: later when you're feeling more... civil.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: GOD DAMN YOU TO HELL!
text: OUTSIDE THE ROOM, Neville shuts the door, leans against it. Closes his eyes
text: and covers his ears, trying not to be affected by her cries. He cannot let
text: her see him like this. He cannot be weak. He must be in control.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville changes his shirt. For a brief moment, he's drawn to the photo of
text: his wife. The Girl's screams have become pathetic whimpers. She's crying.
text: In desperate need of a fix. Neville sits on the edge of his bed. Composes
dialog: himself.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT
text: Neville steps inside. The Girl lies on the floor of the cage, sweating,
text: shivering. Between sobs, she pleads...
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Please, mister. I'm sorry.
text: Neville prepares a morphine vial and syringe.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You have to cooperate. I'll cooperate, too.
dialog: You talk to me, tell me a few things,
dialog: and I give you this.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Fucking blackmail.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What's your name?
text: No response. Just eyes on the morphine.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Anna.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Anna. Anna what?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Anna what?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Anna McCauley.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Anna, I'm Robert. Robert Neville.
text: Ever the gentle , he extends his hand for her to shake, but she just smirks
text: at the gesture.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I know who you are.
dialog: Everybody knows who you are.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Everybody. What do you mean
dialog: everybody?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where I came from.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Give me the fucking drugs.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Just outside Portland. There were
dialog: ten of us living in the woods. It was
dialog: good, you know, real nice, a real "family."
dialog: Then... six months ago, the first ones
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: ANNA (cont'd)
dialog: came. We killed most, but more showed
dialog: up the next night. Me and Doug were the
text: only ones to get away. The only ones left alive.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where's Doug now?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Doug's dead. GIVE ME THE DRUGS.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Why come here? To the city?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: We ran into some people in Eureka.
dialog: They got a whole operation up there.
text: Soldiers started it up. Gung-ho assholes.
dialog: Survivalists. They got food, guns, a
dialog: hospital. They knew about you. Down
dialog: here. All on your own.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's not. I swear.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Why not stay with them?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Because I didn't want to spend the rest of my
dialog: already pathetic life getting gang-raped, okay?
dialog: They murdered Doug. And they had other
dialog: plans for me. But I got away. I got away.
text: Neville explodes to his feet. Angry. Confused.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: There's no one! No one else! I tried...
text: The radio, signal flares, it's pointless.
dialog: For years I've tried...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Then how do you explain me?
text: He approaches with the syringe.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
text: She sticks her arm out of the cage.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Can't find a vein.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yes you can, yes you can.
text: Neville finally locates one and injects. Once the syringe is emptied into
text: her arm, he steps back. Anna smiles and leans against the walls of the cage.
text: Her eyes open wide with fear. Her body shakes. She looks nauseous.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This isn't morphine!
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: No. No, it's sticelezine. They developed
dialog: it for rapid heroin detox, but it'll work for
dialog: morphine addiction, too.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You prick!
text: She lunges at him, but her stomach cramps and she falls.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: It's a severe shock to the system, but the
dialog: treatment only lasts twenty-four hours.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I swear, I'll kill you.
text: She collapses. Losing consciousness.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You won't go through withdrawal--it's not
dialog: a painful process at all. You'll be asleep
dialog: most of the time. There's risk of heart attack,
dialog: but I'll be monitoring you.
text: Anna's eyes roll back into her head. Her body goes limp. Neville unlocks
text: the cage door and lifts her into his arms.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville rests Anna on his bed. She's still filthy, so he makes the decision
text: to wash her. He cuts away her t-shirt and leggings with surgical safety
text: scissors and throws them away. He tries very hard not to be entranced by her
text: young, thin body. He simply does a job. or tries to.
text: He fills a basin with warm water, soaps a sponge, and gently washes her body.
text: Up her legs, her buttocks, around her stomach, her breasts. Shampoos and
text: rinses her hair. Softly caresses her face with a washcloth.
text: It's an undeniably sensual experience, but Neville does not cross the line.
text: He is respectful. We see he has the heart of a caretaker. There is a
dialog: gentleness to his actions which inform us that he must have been a wonderful
text: husband. And a caring father. Neville opens a TRUNK and finds a NIGHTGOWN
text: among his wife's things. Carefully fits Anna into it. He steps back and
text: observes her. Peaceful. Beautiful. Angelic.
dialog: Just like Ellen.
text: He kneels, almost in prayer, then hooks her up to an I.V. and adjusts the
text: flow of the medication. Neville takes towels and blankets, rips them into
text: strips, and secures Anna's wrists and ankles to the bed frame. She's
dialog: comfortable, but secure.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GREENHOUSE - DAWN
text: Neville selects the best fruit from his garden.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN
text: Neville places the fruit in a blender with some protein powder and water.
text: Boils some oatmeal on the stove.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Anna is somewhat conscious. Neville undoes her wrist ties and sits her up.
text: Like a father with a newborn, he attempts to feed her. She spits up and he
text: wipes her face.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: We've got to get something into you.
text: He lifts a glass of the protein shake to her lips and she manages to drink
dialog: some down.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Good girl.
text: He lowers her onto the bed and gives her a series of three injections.
text: Carefully following procedure in a MEDICAL MANUAL. When complete, he
text: reattaches the wrist ties and sits in a chair opposite Anna. Watches her
dialog: sleep.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER
text: Anna's body convulses. Neville expected this. He prepares a syringe,
text: injects her, and she relaxes.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville stands on the balcony, sipping a cup of coffee. The sun sets beyond
text: the hills, over the ocean. He hears Anna stir and moan. He checks her blood
text: pressure, temperature, pulse, and pupil dilation. Is satisfied with her
text: vitals and removes the I.V. He gives her a final injection, removes one
text: of the wrist ties and sits her up as she gains consciousness. Neville sits
text: beside her with a bowl of rice and a spoon. Tries to get her to eat, but she
text: shoves it away.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I know you're hungry.
text: She is starving. But she won't allow him to feed her. With her one free
text: hand, she takes the bowl and spoon from him and feeds herself. Big gulps of
dialog: rice.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Slow down. You'll get sick.
text: She listens. After a few bites, she realizes that she is clean and in
text: someone else's clothes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You were filthy.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Did you enjoy it? Giving me a little
dialog: bubble bath? Did you like my body?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Eat.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Did it turn you on? Did I get you hard?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (re the nightgown)
dialog: Who's is this? Your mommy's? Grandma?
dialog: (sly) Mrs. Neville?
text: From his reaction, she knows she guessed right.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ah, I get it. Clean me up, dress me like
dialog: the dear departed. Then what? Wait 'til I
dialog: pass out and have a quick fuck for old time's
dialog: sake? Was I any good? I'd like to know...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: STOP IT.
text: He explodes. She LAUGHS. He secures her free wrist to the bed. She
text: continues LAUGHING...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Bondage. I'm into it. Was she?
text: Neville closes the shutters to the balcony. Gathers up medical supplies and
text: the food, heads downstairs.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What's the matter? Can't get it up?
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville sits at the bottom of the spiral staircase, face buried in his hands,
text: determined not to let her see him hurt. He moves to the surveillance center
text: and checks the monitors. Still no sign of Cortman and the Hemocytes. He
text: adjusts a few knobs, a joystick controller, changing angles.
text: Something is out there. He ZOOMS IN. Dogs. Half a dozen contaminated dogs.
text: Scavenging. He ZOOMS IN closer, trying to get a better look. No. He's not
text: with them. A CRASH from upstairs. THUMPING. Neville bolts up the spiral
dialog: staircase.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Anna is convulsing. The I.V. is on the floor, the needle detached. Neville
text: loosens the restraints and cradles her body until her limbs cease flailing.
text: She vomits and he carries her into the bathroom. She heaves into the toilet
text: and breaks into a cold sweat. He washes her face, and wraps her in a
text: blanket. She looks at him with terrified eyes...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm scared.
text: She leans into him and he holds her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm really scared.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: It's okay. I'm here.
text: She begins to cry and he softly caresses her face.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I know.
text: She buries her face into his shoulder, sobbing. He looks at the blank walls
text: of the bathroom, stroking her hair...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Anna sits at the kitchen table wearing the nightgown and Neville's robe,
text: gently rocking. Neville places a bowl of oatmeal and a cup of tea in front
text: of her. The same for himself. He eats, she doesn't.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: It'll help with the nausea.
text: She takes a few bites. Sips her tea. They eat in silence for awhile until
text: Anna decides to make conversation.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How long have you been here?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Almost twelve years. This was my house.
dialog: Is my house.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I guess I thought you found it... Took it
dialog: over when... it happened. Why did you stay?
dialog: Everybody knew to get out of the cities.
dialog: They took over the cities.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: My home. They can't take that from me.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (tries to compliment him)
dialog: You... fixed it up real nice. I feel safe here.
text: Neville sort of nods a thanks.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Don't you get lonely?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I keep busy. There's a lot to do.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Answer the question.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Of course I do.
dialog: She nods. Understands. But wants to know more...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I heard a lot of things. About you.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That you've killed hundreds of them.
dialog: Thousands...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That you like it.
text: He doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: They say you chop off their heads and
dialog: stick 'em on poles. That you cut out their
dialog: hearts and eat them raw. They say you rape
text: the women and cut off the men's cocks and
dialog: shove 'em in their mouths.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where did you hear this?
text: She hesitates for a moment. Then answers...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Up in Eureka. Those guys...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Do I what?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Do those things?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What do you think?
text: She doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I've got work to do. If you feel up to
dialog: it, you can help.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - COMPOUND - DAY
text: Neville spot-checks the fences. Makes repairs where necessary. Anna
text: follows, carrying a spool of wire.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why stay here? Why not take off? Who
dialog: knows what you might find.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You afraid?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I know what's here. Out there, I have nothing.
dialog: Here, I have everything. You said it before.
dialog: I'm safe.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I said I feel safe. Doesn't mean I am safe.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GREENHOUSE - DAY
text: Neville tends to the garden. Anna picks strawberries.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I mean, there could be more like you.
dialog: Like me. Uninfected. Surviving.
dialog: Aren't you curious? Don't you want to know?
dialog: There's a whole country... A whole continent...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nineteen.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm forty-two. When you're forty-two,
dialog: you like staying put.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
text: Neville fills the generators, checks the Land Rover, the back-up car, the
text: motorcycle. Anna eats strawberries.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Are you gonna rape me?
text: Neville looks at her with disbelief.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Hadn't planned on it, no.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Those guys in Eureka, that's what they
dialog: had in mind.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I figured as much.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why are they like that?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Men. Most men are like that.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Not me. So don't worry.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah, but you're... weird. Not normal.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm not normal? (re the strawberries)
dialog: Not too many of those. You'll get sick.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY
text: Neville replaces bulbs in lamps. Anna searches the surrounding area with a
text: pair of binoculars.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Why do you think this happened?
dialog: My dad thought it was God. God got
dialog: so pissed off at what people were doing,
dialog: He decided to end it. Once and for all.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: This isn't about punishment. God doesn't
dialog: want us to suffer.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh yeah? Why then? Why let this happen?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: We let this happen. Not Him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I don't. That's just what I believe. If
dialog: I didn't, I would've blown my brains out
dialog: a long time ago.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
text: Anna and Neville sit down to dinner. Neville whispers a blessing, then
dialog: serves the food.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Robert?
text: First time she's called him that. He looks up.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can I stay here?
text: He analyzes her beautiful, youthful face. Her tough exterior has vanished
dialog: like so much vapor.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: If you want.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I do. Thank you.
text: He nods and shyly returns to his plate. They sneak glances at each other as
text: they share the rest of dinner in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT
text: Neville shows Anna how to switch on the powerful exterior lights. He lifts a
text: pair of binoculars to his eyes and surveys the area. Again, no Hemocytes.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Have you gone? Have you?
text: He retreats inside. Anna hesitates on the roof. Looks at the barren area
text: beyond the compound fences. She waits for a moment, apparently deeply torn,
text: then follows.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - SURVEILLANCE CENTER - NIGHT
text: He shows her the various closed-circuit screens and computer.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: For movement outside the far fence, your
dialog: best vantage point is the roof. Beyond that,
dialog: you're better off down here. (re the monitors)
dialog: Visual checks here, (re the computer) sensor
text: checks here. The area surrounding the house is
dialog: monitored for changes in heat, sound, movement.
dialog: If one gets inside the fence, you'll know.
text: The computer displays the electronic mines.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: If you can't take them out with a shot from the
dialog: roof or one of the windows, use these. Each
text: spot on the screen corresponds to a keyboard
text: command. Press it and it ignites a mine.
dialog: Just make sure you have the right one.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Kind of cold-blooded isn't it?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: There are hundreds of them and just one of me.
dialog: (rethinks) Two of us. It's just the way it has to
dialog: be.
text: Anna thinks she sees the system's fatal flaw, a weakness.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What happens if they all come-over the
dialog: fence? All at once?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: They won't.
text: Neville hits a button on the computer keyboard. All the "mine" symbols start
text: blinking red. He throws a switch and an ALARM sounds. A RED LIGHT FLASHES.
text: Anna panics.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
text: In thirty seconds, the whole thing goes up.
text: The house, the yard, the hill. All of it.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Turn it off!
dialog: Neville enjoys her discomfort.
speaker_heading: ANNA
speaker_heading: TURN IT OFF!
text: He pushed it too far. Shuts the system down.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Two years ago, I captured one of them.
dialog: Brought him inside and showed him just
dialog: what I showed you. Then I let him go.
dialog: They know. (remembering) Do you remember
dialog: the old Cold War? No, you were too young.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I read about it.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Well then. During the Cold War, there was
dialog: an unspoken understanding. If any of the
text: major powers launched an all-out assault,
dialog: the target country would retaliate in equal force.
dialog: It would mean total destruction. The attack
dialog: would be rendered meaningless. So peace was
dialog: maintained. I guess you could call it peace,
dialog: even what I have with Cortman--(MORE)
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (cont'd)
dialog: it's a sort of peace. We have our border
dialog: clashes, skirmishes. But we both know...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where are they now?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I have no idea. It could be a trick.
dialog: They might be gone. Once and for all.
dialog: Most of them--when things began to
dialog: settle down--became nomadic. When a food
dialog: supply became depleted, it became necessary
dialog: for them to move on, to find new sources.
text: But he remained. Laying his claim.
text: Establishing a power base.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Cortman.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Who's Cortman?
text: Neville almost laughs. Can't believe she doesn't know.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Who's Cortman?
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - MEDIA CENTER - NIGHT
text: TVs litter the floor. Like an obsessed librarian, Neville searches for the
text: perfect assortment of videotapes. Anna sits in a chair like a moviegoer
dialog: waiting for the show.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: How old were you? Sixteen?
dialog: Anna nods.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where were you living? Portland?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. We lived in the mountains.
text: About two hundred miles east.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You didn't see any of this?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: My dad didn't allow TV. My brother...
dialog: My brother and I used to sneak into the
dialog: car to listen to the radio sometimes...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: But you never saw?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Not until after. Not 'ti1 it was all over.
dialog: When they came our way. From the cities.
dialog: My father thought cities were Sodom and
dialog: Gomorrah. And they were the offspring.
dialog: The damned.
text: He inserts the first cassette.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You know what I did? I taught history.
dialog: I've kept all this as a record. A document
dialog: of the truth. Someday, it might help.
dialog: Someone, someone in the future...
dialog: They can see. See for themselves what
dialog: happened.
text: He presses PLAY. TV NEWS FOOTAGE.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
speaker_heading: (ON TAPE)
dialog: ... a disturbing occurrence at Berkeley.
dialog: Our John Sanchez is on the scene...
text: The tape now shows a herd of REPORTERS, FIREFIGHTERS, and POLICE OFFICERS
text: outside the KRIPPEN CENTER at Berkeley.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ (ON TAPE)
dialog: Three doctors and two security guards were
dialog: murdered as ten patients fled the Krippen Center
dialog: for Genetic Research. We have no information on
dialog: the nature of the work being done here, but...
text: He sees a wounded DR. KRIPPEN escorted from the Center by two policemen.
text: Blood drips from his forehead.
speaker_heading: SANCHEZ (ON TAPE)
dialog: Dr. Krippen? Dr. Krippen?
dialog: Can you tell us why the C.D.C. was alerted?
dialog: Is there a public danger?
text: Krippen looks shell-shocked. He hides his face and slinks into the rear of a
dialog: police car.
text: Neville shuts off the tape. Presses PLAY on another deck, another TV
text: springing to life. VIDEO FOOTAGE of the San Francisco CHIEF OF POLICE at a
text: PRESS CONFERENCE filled with ANGRY REPORTERS. Blown-up PHOTOS of the

speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: That's him. That's Cortman.
speaker_heading: CHIEF OF POLICE
speaker_heading: (ON TAPE)

speaker_heading: (ON TAPE)

speaker_heading: (ON TAPE)
dialog: What are the symptoms?
speaker_heading: DR. PETERSEN
speaker_heading: (ON TAPE)
dialog: Listen, we're still trying to get a handle on
dialog: this ourselves. The Berkeley campus is under
dialog: quarantine. For the moment, we have no plans
dialog: to implement such containment in the city itself.
text: Neville shuts off the tape.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: No, but you should have.
dialog: (to Anna)
dialog: You don't know what it was like.
text: The fear. The panic.
text: He starts another. VIDEO FOOTAGE of the GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA reading a
text: statement. The poor man looks absolutely distraught.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR (ON TAPE)
dialog: ... just spoken to the President. Although it
dialog: grieves me to do so, for the safety of our citizens,
dialog: the National Guard has declared a state of martial
dialog: law in the State of California. I am told such
dialog: considerations are underway in Arizona, Nevada,
dialog: Utah, and Oregon. Under the statutes of martial law,
dialog: and in accordance with the extreme circumstances of
dialog: this situation, all personally-owned firearms will be
text: confiscated by the military. Also, a mandatory curfew
dialog: --for all civilians--is instated. The curfew will begin at
dialog: sunset and last until sunrise the following day. Anyone
dialog: on the street during this period is considered dangerous.
text: A "shoot-to-kill" order has been issued. Anyone exhibiting
dialog: symptoms of infection must admit themselves to the
dialog: nearest medical facility for treatment. If a child is
dialog: symptomatic, the parent or parents will be held responsible.
dialog: Noncompliance in this request is a punishable offense.
dialog: Punishable by death. Finally, all bodies... All victims...
dialog: must be properly disposed of. If you see a corpse, do not
text: touch it. Call the 800 number at the bottom of the screen
dialog: and a disposal unit will be alerted.
dialog: God have mercy on us all.
text: Neville switches off the tape. Turns to Anna.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: In six days--less than a week--the world turned
text: upside down. San Francisco became a war zone.
dialog: Do you know what people do when you tell them
dialog: they no longer have rights? That an individual is
dialog: powerless? They fight. It was ludicrous to think
dialog: mankind would just roll on its back and comply.
dialog: I saw my neighbors--people I've known for years--
text: become bloodthirsty savages. Infected, uninfected,
dialog: it didn't matter. We were all driven mad. The survival
dialog: instinct went ballistic. Food, guns, medicine, blood
dialog: --it all became priceless. Worth killing for. Those
dialog: who had became the targets of the had nots.
dialog: A city of five million people. Within a month more
dialog: than half were dead. Six weeks later, about ten thousand
dialog: like me. AB Negatives. We were all determined to
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (cont'd)
dialog: live. But we didn't gather together. There was no
dialog: unity. It was every man for himself. Trust had
dialog: been abolished. By the end of the year, it was me.
dialog: Just me.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: How? How did you do it?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I remained calm. It's the great secret of survival.
text: When all around is chaos, when everyone is driven
dialog: to the brink of insanity... relax.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (a confession)
dialog: Don't you... Don't you wish, sometimes,
dialog: that you died too? With everybody else?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Every day.
text: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. A sensor ALARM. Neville bolts to the surveillance center.
text: Scans the monitors for signs of activity, but finds nothing.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm going to the roof. Stay here.
text: He grabs a rifle and heads up the staircase. Anna moves to the videotapes.
dialog: Curious to find a certain something...
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: Neville surveys the area with binoculars. For a brief moment, he thinks he
text: SEES SOMEONE going over the far fence. He raises the rifle scope, but finds
dialog: nothing.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: VIDEO IMAGE. Neville's wife, ELLEN, playing in a park with daughter GRACE.
dialog: Home video. Happy times.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE'S VOICE

text: REVEAL ANNA. Watching the tape. She turns to him...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: She was beautiful.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Turn it off, Anna.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What happened to her...?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
speaker_heading: TURN IT OFF.
text: He MOVES to the TV and presses the wrong button. The image won't go away.
text: Angry, disturbed, he frantically tries to shut it off, then YANKS the plug
text: out of the wall.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Don't do that again. Ever.
text: He shuts off the other electronics.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You should get some sleep.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'll be fine. I get about two or three
text: hours just before dawn.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Go to bed, Anna. Please.
text: She heads upstairs. Steals a glance at him, but he isn't looking at her,
text: he's looking at his reflection in the blank TV screen.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER
text: Anna sleeps. An angel. REVEAL NEVILLE standing over her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Neville lies on a mat on the floor. Staring at the ceiling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: ELLEN stands at the living room window, anxious, nervous. OUTSIDE, ARMY
text: HELICOPTERS fly overhead. The streets are virtually deserted. Dusk is
text: approaching. And the curfew. Ellen checks her watch. The Land Rover
text: SCREECHES into the driveway. NEVILLE hurries into the house carrying a big
text: gym bog. Ellen opens the door and LOCKS it once he's inside.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Where were you?!
text: Neville draws the curtains.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: You have a phone in the goddamn car.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Kitchen door locked?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: IS IT LOCKED?!
text: Neville opens the bag revealing a MACHINE GUN and clips of ammunition. Ellen
text: is paralyzed by the sight of it.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Where's Grace?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Asleep.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: How's she doing? Is she...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Bob!
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Where did you get it?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: One of my students is in the National
dialog: Guard. He gave it to me.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Gave it to you?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I traded him.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Traded what?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Blood. My blood. There's some kind of
dialog: rumor going around that transfusions of
dialog: AB Neg can keep you safe.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Is that true?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: No. But he thinks so.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: For God's sake, what if they find out?!
dialog: Do you know what they'll do? They're
dialog: killing people who hide guns!
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Just SHUT UP, Ellen. Okay?
text: They stop when they sense Grace in the room. She's staring at them with
text: dark, glassy eyes. Emaciated, clearly infected. She just looks at them--as
dialog: if their fighting was her fault.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Daddy? I'm scared.
text: Neville feels an overwhelming sadness. He moves to her just as she faints.
text: THE IMAGE DISTORTS. A few days later. We MOVE with Neville into a DARKENED
dialog: BEDROOM...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Ellen?
text: He SEES his wife, sitting on the edge of the bed. Her wrist is BLEEDING and
text: the weak Grace is drinking from the wound. A guilty Ellen explains to her
dialog: horrified husband...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: She needs it, Bob. And I'm not afraid.
dialog: What is meant to pass will pass.
text: THE IMAGE DISTORTS. TWO C.D.C. MEN IN BIOHAZARD SUITS enter the house. A
text: BIOHAZARD-SUITED NATIONAL GUARDSMAN stands watch. The C.D.C. Men see Grace's
text: dead form. Neville stands in a corner, very near the edge of shock. One of
text: the C.D.C. men turns to him, his voice electronically distorted...
speaker_heading: C.D.C. MAN ONE
dialog: It's just the two of you, sir?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Yes. My wife died last week.
text: They load Grace into a body bag and carry her to the door. OUTSIDE, a
text: GARBAGE TRUCK waits. More GUARDSMEN. More GARBAGE TRUCKS on every street.
text: The distraught Neville, maintaining composure, moves to his pre-customization
dialog: Land Rover.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm coming with you.
speaker_heading: C.D.C. MAN ONE
dialog: That's not allowed.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm AB Negative. Besides, you can't stop
dialog: me. I still have that right.
text: THE IMAGE DISTORTS. Neville's Rover stops outside the ARMY GOLF COURSE--the
text: MASS BURIAL SITE. The GARBAGE TRUCK unceremoniously dumps its cargo. The
text: body bags fall. A BIOHAZARD-SUITED WORKER carrying a large HOSE sprays the
text: corpses with GASOLINE. Another WORKER tosses a TORCH over the side and the
text: pit ERUPTS IN FLAMES. Neville watches in horror, the crimson fire reflected
text: against his skin.
text: THE IMAGE DISTORTS. Neville in his HOUSE. He UNLOCKS the door to the master
text: bedroom. KNOCKS a warning...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Ellen? It's me.
text: He pushes into the room and we SEE a terrified Ellen huddled in the corner
text: clutching the machine gun. She is pale and emaciated. Sweating, paranoid.
dialog: Infected.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Are they gone?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: They're gone, sweetie.
text: He kneels beside her. Eases the gun out of her tight grip.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: It's okay...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Is she...?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: She's gone, honey. It's over for her.
text: She's at peace.
text: Ellen begins to sob. Desperately hugs him.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Oh God, Bob. Just kill me. Please.
dialog: It would probably be best, but the idea is anathema to him.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I can't do that.
text: THE IMAGE DISTORTS. The CEMETERY. Working quietly and in darkness, Neville
text: slips past SECURITY and carries Ellen's dead body to the TOMB. INSIDE THE
text: CRYPT, he lays her to rest. She's dressed in her WEDDING GOWN. Neville
text: places her within the stone coffin and kneels in prayer.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I love you, Ellen. I will love you forever.
text: CLOSE ON HER FACE as the stone coffin lid slides into place.
text: THE IMAGE DISTORTS. San Francisco in ruins. Buildings and cars on fire,
text: crashed helicopters smoldering in the streets. HORRIBLE CRIES of pain and
dialog: thirst.
text: NEVILLE'S HOUSE. The first crude barricades up.
text: INSIDE, Neville sits in a chair in the center of the room, empty bottles of
text: LIQUOR at his feet, a cigarette dangling from his lips. Dirty, unshaven.
text: The machine gun resting in his lap. He just stares. Waiting. FISTS POUND
scene_heading: AGAINST THE DOOR,. GLASS BREAKS. ARMS REACH INSIDE.
text: He waits. A small band of HEMOCYTES breaks through the front door. Neville
text: readies the machine gun, stands. Calm. The terrifying creatures move toward
text: him. Six, maybe eight. And he sees the leader's face...
dialog: Ellen.
text: Skin translucent, body muscular, almost naked--the wedding gown stripped
text: away. Her eyes are icy, dead. Long claws extend from her fingertips. She
text: smiles at her husband...
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: Robert...
text: Neville raises the gun to his eye. Takes aim. Ellen and the Hemocytes are
text: upon him. He looks into her lifeless eyes. Hungry for him. I knew you would
dialog: come, Ellen. I knew.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: God forgive me.
dialog: And he OPENS FIRE.
speaker_heading: END
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville SCREAMS as he comes awake from his nightmare. He lashes out at
text: imaginary attackers. Utterly terrified. Anna JUMPS from her bed and tries to
dialog: calm him...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Robert! It's okay!
text: He flails, but she holds him. He leans into her, sobbing.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: It's okay...
text: They both receive something from the embrace. A connection. A necessary
text: thing. A simple human need for touch, for understanding. He looks into her
text: eyes. She gently touches his face. They kiss. Deeply, passionately.
text: They make love with deep emotion, sensitivity, and passion. As if they were
text: proving to each other and to themselves that they are still human, that they
dialog: can steel feel.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Neville prepares breakfast for Anna.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Carrying a tray, Neville quietly enters and delivers breakfast-in-bed to her.
text: Sunlight streams in through the window-slits. She leans against him and he
text: holds her.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Neville and Anna walk the perimeter. Hesitantly, she reaches out and takes
dialog: his hand.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Would you ever leave here?
text: Neville doesn't answer. He spots something entwined in the barbed wire over
text: the main gate. He lets go her hand and climbs up a series of ladder steps
text: nailed into the wood on the interior of the gate posts. He reaches the top
text: and pulls out a piece of clothing...
text: A little boy's BLUE PARKA.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: How'd this get up here?
text: Unseen by Neville, Anna is frozen. Her eyes fixed on the parka. Color
text: drains from her face. Neville drops to the ground and examines the dirty,
text: tattered coat.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Must've been a bad wind last night.
text: He turns to Anna, who is still fixed on the parka.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Nothing.
text: She smiles and kisses him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Let's go inside.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: In a series of DISSOLVES, they make love all afternoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - DUSK
text: Neville stands in the crow's nest, eyes on the horizon. A vibrant red-and-
text: purple sky. Massive clouds. Breathtaking. Neville exudes a sense of peace.
text: A beguiling tranquility.
speaker_heading: ANNA'S VOICE
dialog: Robert?
text: He turns and sees her. She wears a simple, pretty dress and a scarf around
text: her neck. Very feminine. Ellen's.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: You look beautiful.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Dinner's ready.
text: She goes to him and he holds her. Has she been crying?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Are you sad?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No. No.
text: She kisses him. Looks at his dirty hands and clothes.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You should wash up.
text: Her smile seems genuine. He obeys and heads downstairs.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Yes ma'am.
text: Anna hesitates.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll be right down.
dialog: I just want to look at the sunset.
text: Neville smiles and descends. when he is out of sight, Anna's smile fades.
text: She appears distraught, torn. She undoes the SCARF and ties it high on the
text: crows nest, like a flag.
dialog: A signal.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The table is beautifully set and Anna has made dinner. Romantic MUSIC in the
text: background. She stands near the table, waiting, as Neville comes from
text: upstairs. He approaches the tender domestic setting.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I hope it's okay. I haven't actually
dialog: cooked anything in god knows how long.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Looks wonderful.
text: He kisses her. It takes her a moment to fall into the embrace, the warmth.
text: Just as soon as she gives in, she breaks off. Smiles and instructs
dialog: Neville...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Sit. Before it gets cold.
text: Anna returns to the kitchen and carries a PITCHER--the blender, really--to
text: the table. She pours him a wine-glass full of what looks like a fresh fruit
dialog: shake.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I looked for wine...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Not here.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Right, so I made a sort of virgin fruity thing...
text: He takes a sip.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: It's good.
text: She smiles and takes her seat. They start to eat, both a little nervous.
text: Like a first date. Anna watches as Neville takes another drink, tries the
dialog: meal--chicken and pasta.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: This is great, Anna. Thank you.
text: She picks at her food. He takes her hand.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I'm sorry about what I did. When I
dialog: brought you here. I felt I was doing
dialog: what was right. I want you to know, Anna,
dialog: that I care. About you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I would do anything for you.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Don't say that. Please...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Why? I mean it. I would...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please, Robert, please...
scene_heading: BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. A SENSOR ALARM. BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. Neville rises from the
text: table and heads to the surveillance station. As he walks, his stomach cramps
text: up, but he presses on. When he looks into the monitors, what he sees shocks
dialog: him...
text: ON THE MONITORS, THE HEMOCYTES. Hundreds of them. Cortman and his entire
dialog: tribe.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: My god. Anna...
text: He WINCES in pain when his stomach cramps again. Anna doesn't move from the
text: table. She just sits and watches him.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Anna!
text: He's very confused by her behavior. His vision BLURS and for a moment, he's
text: dizzy, and then he remembers.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: The lights.
text: He SWITCHES ON the exterior compound lights, but nothing happens. Outside
text: remains dark.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
text: Anna! Downstairs. The generators...
dialog: Something must be wrong with...
text: He takes a step and falls to his knees. The pain is intolerable. He braces
text: himself from falling over. His vision is cloudy, his speech starting to
dialog: slur...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: What's happening?
text: Anna slowly rises and comes to him. He reaches out for her, but she passes
text: and moves to the surveillance center where she UNPLUGS the computers and
dialog: security monitors.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Oh, Jesus, no. You can't do that...
text: He glances at the kitchen table. His nearly-empty GLASS. Sees hers was
text: never filled. He looks to Anna. She stands in the middle of the room,
text: shivering with fear and shame. Tears in her eyes. Neville feels completely
dialog: betrayed.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Why?
text: Anna cannot look at him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
text: And then he hears... "Neville... !" He crawls across the floor, makes it to
text: his feet, and pulls himself up to one of the window/slits. A nightmare is
dialog: what he sees...
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Numerous POLES are placed against the fence. HEMOCYTES--all mouths red with
text: fresh blood--prepare for a massive assault.
text: CORTMAN climbs the first pole, stands atop the gate to the compound and
dialog: addresses the troops...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: We have waited long enough. The hour is
dialog: nigh. Let us pay a visit to the Devil.
text: CHRISTOPHER signals the DRUMMERS, who beat out the charge. EVA HOWLS to her
text: WARRIORS, who in turn emit a FIERCE BATTLE CRY. And Cortman leads them over
dialog: the side...
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville falls to the floor. Eyes wide with fear. Again, he manages to get
text: to his feet, stumbles to the staircase, and heads upstairs. Anna follows...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Robert! It's over!
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Fighting exhaustion from whatever drug he's been given, Neville forces
text: himself to move. He stumbles and slips, but succeeds in opening a CABINET
text: near the balcony. He grabs the FLARE GUN, a case of FLARES and opens the
text: STEEL SHUTTERS.
speaker_heading: ANNA'S VOICE
dialog: No, Robert.
text: He sees her standing at the stairs, a GUN pointed at him. Her hand is
text: trembling, her face stained with tears.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I assume if they wanted you to kill me,
dialog: I'd be dead already.
text: He loads the first flare. She waves the gun.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Please!
text: Neville steps onto the balcony and FIRES into the air. Anna can't bring
text: herself to do any more. She lowers the gun and covers her face in shame. ON
text: THE BALCONY, Neville LOADS and FIRES flare after flare. The night sky
text: becomes filled with phosphorescent orange light. He aims a few at the fence,
text: and the final flare at the moat.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: The moat ERUPTS IN FLAMES, catching a few, but most have moved beyond the
text: moat, to the inner fence. CORTMAN hisses and sneers, his gaze fixed on his
text: nemesis on the balcony.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
speaker_heading: NEVILLE!
text: The two antagonists lock eyes. Neville above, Cortman below. Heaven and
text: Hell. The gasoline fire burns, black smoke spiraling into the sky. The mass
text: of Hemocyte bodies swarm toward the house. The flares slowly sink to the
text: earth, leaving glowing trails behind them. A surreal, hallucinatory,
text: horrifying scene.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville stumbles inside and from the cabinet grabs a SHOTGUN, MACHINE GUN,
text: and all the ammo he can carry. He loads the shotgun and turns to Anna. For a
text: brief, very brief moment, he ponders the act of killing her. Then simply
dialog: states...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Get out of my way.
text: She steps aside and falls to her knees as he heads downstairs.
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville falls down the last few steps. For a moment, he lies there. SOUNDS
text: of the Hemocytes POUNDING, SCRATCHING, SCRAPING at the outer shell of the
text: house. Neville's eyelids are heavy. Sleep. Just let it come...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: NO!
text: Using the machine gun as a crutch, he defiantly gets to his feet and stands.
text: Eyes shifting from one spot to the next as the SOUNDS direct him. The SOUNDS
dialog: are intolerable...
text: Fingers. Hands. Arms. Forcefully tearing apart the house, reaching inside.
text: Neville hefts the machine gun in one hand, the shotgun in the other.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Come on!
text: And they come. The blood-fueled, rage-filled faces of the Hemocytes poke
text: through the crumbling walls, their sharp talons ripping open the house like a
dialog: birthday gift.
text: Neville OPENS FIRE. Merciless and unfeeling. The last acts of a desperate
text: man. Blood sprays, but the Hemocytes press on. Most of their wounds non-
text: lethal, they crawl into the room like a swarm of insects. Neville manages to
text: drop a few, but the onslaught is endless, limitless. He pushes back, heading
dialog: downstairs...
scene_heading: INT. NEVILLE'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Neville shuts a TRAP DOOR, sealing off the upstairs. He makes it to the
text: ELECTRICAL CONTROL PANELS. They've been irrevocably sabotaged. Why, Anna?
text: Why? Breathing heavily, he goes to the DOOR to the GARAGE. He's about to
text: unbolt it, stops. Listens... Scratching. Scraping. Voices on the other
dialog: side... "Neville..." They're in the garage.
text: Neville is trapped. Hemocytes to all sides. The outcome is inevitable. He
text: drops the machine gun. Loads one last round in the shotgun. Kneels. Puts
text: the barrel under his chin. Reaches for the trigger... And stops.
dialog: Remembers. Maybe there's a way out.
text: He moves to the SMALL DOOR leading to the CRAWLSPACES under the compound--the
text: series of tunnels. He has difficulty opening it, so takes the familiar ALL-
text: IN-ONE TOOL from his pocket and uses it to jimmy open the latch. He manages
text: to open it and sticks the tool in his mouth to get it out of the way. He
text: climbs in and shuts the hatch just as the Hemocytes CRASH through from the
dialog: garage.
scene_heading: INT. CRAWLSPACE - NIGHT
text: Pitch black. Neville cannot see his hand in front of his face. He slithers
text: toward a SLIVER OF ORANGE LIGHT at the end of the tunnel. He grasps the
text: shotgun tight. He LISTENS to the FOOTSTEPS of the Hemocytes on the surface
text: above him. Their HOWLS, SCREECHES, and CRIES. The incessant DRUMMING in the
dialog: distance... Dear god, make it stop.
text: His eyes grows weary, his fingers lose their grip on the gun. Passing out.
text: Like a protagonist in Poe, he is virtually buried alive. Just as he succumbs
text: to the effects of the drug, darkness turns to LIGHT. Orange light from the
text: flares in the sky. Neville senses what is coming. Someone has opened the
text: trap door. Someone has found his hiding place. Neville's eyes open to see
dialog: the face of his discoverer...
dialog: Cortman.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: THE FOLLOWING IMAGES HAVE A DISTORTED, HALLUCINATORY FEEL:
text: Neville pulled from his grave, by dozens of clawed hands. The shotgun ripped
text: from his hands. His clothes torn from his body. Spite-filled faces.
text: Shouting, cursing, spitting. Screeching with glee. Barbed wire pulled from
text: the fences, cutting into his flesh. Cortman's talons teasing his throat.
text: Anna. Surrounded by Hemocytes. They pay her no heed. She walks among them
text: untouched, unharmed. Neville's face. A tight grimace. Clearly he is in
dialog: pain...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: WE FOLLOW NEVILLE'S FACE, first surrounded by earth, then Hemocytes, then
text: sky. It's a disorienting effect. We're not sure what's happening to him,
dialog: and then, we REVEAL...
text: Neville lashed to a thick, long wooden pole. Bound with rope, straps of
text: leather. And barbed wire. He is virtually naked, his shorts affording him a
text: minor degree of dignity. His entire body is laced with scratches. His face
text: is battered and bruised. They' ve been having fun with him.
text: The Hemocytes gathered at the base of the pole secure it to the ground.
text: Cortman and his lieutenants stand before the tribe, displaying their prey.
text: Showcasing the defeat and capture of the Devil. Neville opens his eyes.
text: Orange, red, and yellow. The colors flicker and dance across his face.
text: Sweat beads on his forehead from intense heat.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Everything You held so dear...
text: REVEAL NEVILLE'S HOUSE. In flames. A black shell roaring like a furnace.
text: The Hemocytes watch it with awe. They lustily dance and scream with joy.
text: Cortman climbs the pole until he can whisper into Neville's ear...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: What does it mean now? Anything?
text: Neville turns away. Cortman holds his head in place, forcing him to watch.
text: Cortman touches Neville's neck with a talon.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Your life--as you know it--is over.
text: Cortman SCRATCHES Neville's neck with his talon. A thin line of blood begins
text: to flow. Cortman drinks. Neville tolerates the savage act--no more no less.
text: He stares at his home as it crumbles into a fiery heap.
scene_heading: EXT. SURROUNDING AREA - NIGHT
text: The long pole, with Neville at the end in the dirt, is dragged through the
text: street. The object of public humiliation. The Hemocytes crowd around him,
text: kicking, laughing, spitting, occasionally scratching him with a claw. It's a
text: celebration for them. A time to rejoice.
text: Each bump on the terrain causes the barbed wire to scrape across Neville's
text: skin. He's in agony, but his face remains tight, unemotional, betraying
text: nothing. Giving nothing. They move down the hill, onto the main road--a
dialog: brutal parade.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: The pole is moved hand-by-hand along a staircase leading into the subway
text: tunnels. As Neville is passed along, he sees dozens of Hemocyte faces. Some
text: laughing, some screeching with anger, others terrified to look at "it", at
dialog: the Devil.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: It's dark down here, but moonlight filters in through crumbled streets, open
text: sewers and transoms, casting this netherworld in an odd purple glow. Alien.
text: Cortman leads the parade down the tracks to a ROUNDABOUT, a large open area
text: where many tracks meet. It is multi-levelled, the "ground", having been
text: excavated to REVEAL old layers of the city. Dormant relics of San Francisco's
dialog: past. It is here where Cortman's tribe lives. This is "home." Their
dialog: village.
text: As Neville is pulled, dragged, and thrown into it, he SEES more HEMOCYTES
text: here than ever came to his house. They huddle en masse, fearful of the
dialog: captive demon.
text: There is a decor to the underground Hemocyte village, a style, a sense of
text: culture. The GRAFFITI is more than tribal markings. It exhibits a passion,
dialog: a unique sensibility. Art. The dwelling spaces, the clothing, the makeshift
dialog: "architecture"--there is something developing here. Not human, not what we
text: once regarded as human, but something cultural. A new development.
text: Artistically, aesthetically. Revolutionary. Evolutionary.
text: In the center of the roundabout, in a circular forum (the "town square"),
text: Neville and the pole are raised and presented to the people of the village.
text: The Hemocytes gather around Neville, hundreds of them. Chanting, drumming,
text: screeching, hissing. All eyes on the demon before them.
text: CORTMAN takes his place at what must be the leader's post, a pedestal/throne
text: on which he stands and addresses the assembled. He raises his arms and the
text: Hemocytes give him quiet. Cortman raises a finger and points at Neville.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Behold the Beast. No longer mighty.
dialog: No longer unconquerable No longer an
text: icon of fear. No longer a spirit to haunt
dialog: the minds and souls of our children.
dialog: (to the women) Bring them.
dialog: Let them see this Neville now.
text: The crowd parts and the WOMEN bring forth something Neville never imagined...
scene_heading: HEMOCYTE CHILDREN. Offspring.
text: Dozens of them. Two and three years old. The mothers hold the newborns and
text: toddlers in their arms. High atop the pole, Neville cannot believe it. His
text: expression is a mixture of sadness, terror, and guilt. Children!
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Look at them Neville. How many of their
dialog: fathers have you killed? Their mothers?
dialog: How many families did you destroy?
text: The children look at him with fear and revulsion.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: How arrogant you were. Arrogant in your
dialog: righteousness. To be so convinced that: you
dialog: were doing God's work, that you were his
dialog: avenging angel. The defender of faith. A faith
dialog: in humanity. But what became of humanity, Neville?
dialog: It was struck down. Smote by God. But you.
dialog: You cling to the belief that we are the abomination.
dialog: Did it ever enter your mind, did you ever consider...
dialog: that we are the chosen? That we are the future?
text: Cortman lifts one of the children into his arms.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You are an illusion, Neville.
dialog: You mean nothing.
text: Cortman raises his hand. A talon emerges from his fingertip. He makes a
text: delicate CUT in Neville's ankle and catches the flowing blood in the palm of
text: his hand. Forming a "cup," he brings his hand to the lips of the CHILD in
dialog: his arms.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Drink, son.
text: The child's lips touch the blood. Cortman lowers the boy to the ground and
text: he scampers off to join his friends.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Don't be frightened of them, Neville.
dialog: Look beyond your own ideas and see
dialog: their beauty. Their souls.
text: The Hemocyte children stare at the "monster." Neville finds himself drawn to
text: their faces. odd and ghoulish, yes, but possessing the innocence of all
dialog: children.
text: Cortman signals to a group of WARRIORS who THROW long ropes into the rafters
text: of the roundabout. Near the ceiling, OTHER WARRIORS catch the lines, loop
text: them over steel beams and slip them back to their counterparts at ground
text: level. These warriors tie one end of the ropes to the top of the pole.
text: As they work, EVA shoves ANNA into the circle. Kicks her until she's
text: kneeling at Cortman's feet. He cups her chin in his hand and, as if to kiss
text: her, lifts her to his face.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Such a pretty thing.
dialog: (to Neville)
dialog: Did she played the temptress well?
dialog: Did she Neville? Were you seduced?
text: Anna violently breaks away from him.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (spitefully)
dialog: Where's Ethan?
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Ethan?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where is he?
text: Cortman signals to a Hemocyte NURSE who enters a dwelling space and returns
text: carrying a SMALL BOY in her arms. He is pale and thin, but not from
text: infection. The boy--ETHAN--is barely conscious, NEEDLE MARKS line his bony
text: arms and legs.
text: Anna runs to the Nurse and takes the boy into her arms, clutching him to her
text: breast with love and desperation.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hey, baby brother.
text: He musters a smile for her, then drifts back to slumber. Anna examines the
text: marks on his arms, turns to Cortman...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You said you'd stop!
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: When you returned, yes. (re Neville)
dialog: When he was defeated, yes.
text: Atop the pole, Neville watches the scene play in front of him. His eyes stay
text: fixed on Anna, on Ethan.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well there he is! I did what you asked!
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: And now you wish to go.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: That was the bargain.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Where will you go, Anna? What will
dialog: you find? (re Neville) More like him?
dialog: Pathetic reminders of the past? Leading
dialog: paranoid, delusional lives? Stay.
dialog: You serve a purpose here.
dialog: You've been treated well.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Well? Treated well?
text: She attempts to exit the circle, but every way she turns, her path is blocked
text: by Hemocytes. She pulls Ethan tight, tries to force her way past them, but
text: the Hemocytes sneer and laugh. The NURSE GRABS ETHAN from her and she
text: SCREAMS...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
text: She lunges for him, but EVA comes up from behind and stops Anna with an
text: immobilizing hold. Anna bellows at Cortman...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: YOU PROMISED!
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Silly thing. We need you here.
dialog: We need you to breed.
text: Anna SCREAMS as Eva forces her to the ground and binds her arms and ankles
text: with leather straps. Anna fights her with fury, but Eva is too strong an
text: opponent. Once Anna is bound, Eva hefts her and carries up a staircase to a
text: higher level of the multi-tiered village. The Nurse follows with Ethan.
text: Simultaneously, Neville is LIFTED into the air as the Hemocyte Warriors PULL
dialog: on the ropes. Their purpose is to raise him above the village, for all to
text: view. A living totem. As Neville ascends, he can SEE the cavernous room
text: into which the Hemocytes take Anna and her little brother.
speaker_heading: REVEAL THE ROOM
text: It is filled with filthy beds. Lit by CANDLES. Inside, the Hemocyte NURSES
text: tend to the room's INHABITANTS...
text: DOZENS OF HUMANS. The elderly and infirm, on one side, youngsters on the
text: other. The children invoke the most empathy. Anywhere from three to twelve
text: in years, they lie bound. I.V.s of MORPHINE or SEDATIVES feed into their
text: arms. Some of the Nurses FEED the captives a horrible gruel while others
text: DRAW BLOOD. Collecting it from open wounds, pouring it into large bowls and
dialog: dishes.
text: Neville's eyes are filled with shock, anger, and sadness. Food. He locks at
text: Cortman with disgust. Ascending a staircase as Neville is lifted higher into
text: the air, Cortman explains to his prize...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
text: Savagery gives way to civilization.
dialog: It's a necessary step for us. Fewer of
dialog: your kind remain and if we feast on each
dialog: other, or others like us--we cannot survive.
dialog: For a race to thrive it must not cannibalize
dialog: itself. Therefore, we raise our sustenance.
dialog: Nurture it, let it grow. Allow it to multiply.
text: Neville wants to berate Cortman, but his lips are sealed. His mouth remains
dialog: tight.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: No harsh words, Neville?
dialog: No condemnations? I'm disappointed.
text: IN THE CAVERNOUS ROOM, Anna is bound to a rusty cot. Ethan to a small bed.
text: Both are quickly narcotized. Subdued.
text: Neville hangs his head in despair as his body is lifted into the rafters.
text: The Hemocytes below secure the ropes to the ground. Neville hangs above the
dialog: village. For all to see. No possible means of escape.
text: Cortman stands on a ledge high above the village, addresses the throng, and
dialog: points to Neville.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Here he is and here he will stay.
text: Cortman LEAPS into the air and GRABS HOLD of a PIPE near the pole. Hanging
text: with one hand, he extends the other, allows his talons to extend, and SLASHES
text: the soles of Neville's feet. Neville GRIMACES in pain, but won't allow
text: Cortman the pleasure of a scream. BLOOD begins to flow and drip from
text: Neville's soles. The crimson drops fall...
text: Onto the tongues, into the mouths of the Hemocytes below. Like children
text: catching the first snowflakes of winter.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: DRINK CHILDREN!
dialog: Drink the blood of the fallen!
text: Eva leads the Hemocytes in a SCREECH of support. Far below, not joining in
text: the bacchanalia, is the leader of the Hemocyte Clerics, CHRISTOPHER. His
text: eyes are on Neville. Does he betray a note of sympathy? He looks away and
text: signals the DRUMMERS to take up a victorious rhythm.
text: Dangling above his enemies--now his captors--Neville's chin drops to his
text: chest. From the battle, the beating, the humiliation, the defeat--he is
text: beyond weary. His eyelids droop, his jaw relaxes. He catches himself and
text: grinds his teeth together, keeping his mouth closed tight. Why?
text: He has not said a word since the fight at the house.
dialog: Why?
scene_heading: INT. SUBTERRANEAN VILLAGE MORNING
dialog: Well, yes, it is "morning", but there's no way to tell down here, aside from
text: a few pinholes of early morning light peeping through a crack or crevice on
dialog: the surface.
text: On the various layers of the community, we find the Hemocytes exhausted.
text: From fighting, from celebration, from feasting. They prepare for sleep,
text: huddled together like pups.
text: High above them, strapped to the pole, Neville gently swings, the ropes
text: creaking. He's fighting to stay awake. Above him on the catwalk of pipes,
text: ventilation ducts, steel girders, and old electrical cables, appears
text: CHRISTOPHER. He appears calm and serene--not a threat. He approaches
text: Neville until he's only a few feet away, eye-to-eye.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: You don't remember me, do you?
text: Neville doesn't know what the hell he's talking about.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I was a student of yours. At the University.
text: Neville is stunned. Assesses the man's face. Tries to imagine what he
dialog: looked like before infection.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Christopher Collier. I was a theology major.
dialog: I minored in history--I took your class on
dialog: Ancient Conflicts. As a seminarian, I appreciated
dialog: your focus on moral issues in war.
dialog: What will they make of this, Professor?
dialog: The historians of the future? How will they
dialog: see the events of today? A victory or defeat?
dialog: You don't care to comment? You were always
dialog: quite eloquent in your opinions.
text: Neville looks in the direction of the room containing the humans.
text: Christopher follows his gaze, comments...
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: "In every war, in every great struggle, we see
dialog: the sacrifice of innocents. Are their lives worth it?
dialog: If thousands will live, should we allow a handful
dialog: to die?" Your words, Professor, not mine.
dialog: Your questions. If I recall, you never provided
dialog: us an answer.
text: He turns back to Neville.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I was never ordained. As a priest:. But I have
dialog: a flock. A barbaric one, yes, but we are unified,
dialog: we are strong. Does it surprise you to see us as
dialog: such? As something more than monsters?
text: Neville remains quiet. Christopher reaches into his clothes and uses a damp
text: rag to wash Neville's wounds.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Some of us are not without compassion.
dialog: Some of us saw Cortman's pursuit of your defeat
dialog: a pointless, selfish obsession. He wants you kept alive.
dialog: He always wanted you like this, don't you see?
text: He wants a trophy. A living symbol of his strength.
dialog: He'll bleed you, feed from you, have you father more
dialog: like yourself.
text: He lifts a container of gruel. Brings a spoonful to his lips, but Neville
dialog: refuses to eat.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: You're behaving like a child.
text: Christopher tries to force feed him, but Neville spits out the food and
speaker_heading: SNARLS at Christopher.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Fine... Have it your way. Soon, you'll be
dialog: begging for my kindness.
text: He departs down a staircase to the village.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON NEVILLE'S FACE
text: He waits until Christopher is gone. Looks below and sees the Hemocytes
text: sleeping. And he opens his mouth, REVEALING...
dialog: The all-in-one tool.
text: His tongue and inner cheeks are scratched and bleeding, but he managed to
text: keep it safe. All this time. Very carefully, he pushes it out onto his lips
text: with his tongue then clenches it tight in his teeth. He maneuvers his hand
text: through his bonds and extends his fingers...
text: He only has one chance. Takes a deep breath and spits out the tool. It
text: falls... Nearly slips from his fingers, but he snares it between his second
text: and third fingers. Twists it around until it's safe in his palm. By touch
text: he finds the serrated edge and goes to work on his bonds.
scene_heading: INT. SUBTERRANEAN VILLAGE - TWO HOURS LATER - DAY
text: The Hemocytes are fast asleep. Communal slumber appears to be part of their
dialog: regimen.
speaker_heading: THE RAFTERS
text: Sweat dripping from his brow, Neville works diligently. His right hand
text: already free, he releases the left. Using the bonds around his waist as a
text: fulcrum, he leans over stretching his back as far as it can go, and cuts
text: through the ropes around his legs and ankles. The serrated edge of the all-
text: in-one tool is almost smooth from wear. Neville clenches it between his
text: teeth and proceeds to wriggle out of the remaining bonds and barbed wire,
text: causing the POLE to SWAY...
text: BELOW, where the pole is secured to the ground, the ROPES start to CREAK. A
text: dozing Hemocyte sniffs the air, then returns to sleep.
text: ABOVE, Neville grips an overhead pipe and PULLS himself up, out of bondage.
text: The ropes burn his skin and the barbed wire bites, but he makes it up, into
text: the rafters. Lying atop a ventilation duct, he relaxes and breathes deeply.
text: He peers over the side and looks below. Everyone asleep. His eyes stop on
text: the CAVERNOUS CHAMBER where the humans are kept. Where Anna is kept.
text: He rolls away and slithers along the duct, away from the village. Must be
text: quiet. Absolutely quiet. He moves onto a thick roll of electrical cables
text: and... almost falls! He grabs a cable and PULLS HIMSELF UP to safety.
text: Crawling on his hands and knees, he moves toward an entrance to a subway
dialog: tunnel. Almost there...
text: And he slips. Neville braces himself, but must use one of his wounded FEET
text: to do so. He HOWLS in silent pain.
text: And the tool falls from his mouth.
text: IT SAILS DOWN. WE FOLLOW IT as it LANDS inches away from the face of a
text: HEMOCYTE CHILD. The little creature's EYES OPEN and find the odd piece of
dialog: metal.
text: IN THE RAFTERS, Neville knows he must move quickly. He follows the cables,
text: then drops to a concrete ledge. Although the souls of his feet are tender
text: from the cuts, he must stand, he must walk. He takes a few genteel steps,
text: then overcomes the pain and heads for the tunnel.
text: He stops when he SEES the HEMOCYTE CHILD before him. Just staring at him.
text: She is afraid, yes, but her curiosity supersedes fear. The little Hemocyte
text: girl cocks her head and her eyes find an open cut on Neville's torso. The
text: blood. Like a father with a glass of warm milk, he dips a finger into the
text: blood and offers it to the girl. She cautiously, hesitantly licks it up and
text: of all things, smiles at Neville.
text: He looks at the girl's face. The innocence in her smile, the simplicity, the
text: naturalness of her act. She's hungry. Neville gently touches her head.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Go back to sleep, sweetheart.
text: She obeys. Neville watches as she returns to her flock.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
text: Weak, battered, filthy, and barely clothed, Neville forces himself down the
text: tunnel. A few RAYS OF LIGHT poke through from the surface, but they are GREY
text: AND MISTY. WATER drips through the ceiling of the tunnel--it must be
dialog: raining.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
text: A torrential downpour. In the middle of the water-slicked street, the
text: ventilation grating to a subway shaft is punched up and out. NEVILLE crawls
text: out to the surface and lies on his back, allowing the rain to wash over him.
dialog: Freedom.
scene_heading: EXT COMPOUND - DAY
text: The sky is filled with THUNDERCLOUDS. Rain turns the earth into a blanket of
text: mud. Neville plods through the muck, cold and wet, until he arrives at the
text: site of his house. Stops when he sees what little remains...
text: A BLACK SHELL. Foundation and framework. Charred and crumbling. Debris,
text: ash, and cinders litter the area. The rain creates a hissing cloud of steam
dialog: and smoke.
text: Neville sloshes through the mud and shifts through debris, finding charred
dialog: reminders of the past three years--the books, his paintings, CDs, the
text: exhaustive videotapes. Now all a melted mass of paper, plastic, and metal.
text: He finds a pair of shoes and joyously covers his scarred, throbbing feet.
text: Nearby, in a pile of cinders, is the frame for the photo of his wife and
text: child. The glass cracked, the frame scorched, the picture itself burned
dialog: away.
text: He moves down, into the foundation, into the BASEMENT. Most of the weapons
text: are twisted and burned, a few are functional. He takes essentials--two
text: handguns and a mini machine gun.
text: Searches for usable ammunition and thankfully finds a locker full untouched
text: by fire. In a pile of ash, he discovers the COMBAT KNIFE and ankle sheath.
text: IN THE GARAGE, he finds shelter from the rain. The Land Rover is a junk
text: heap, horribly wrecked by fallen timbers. He finds a long pipe and uses it
text: as a crowbar to open the trunk. Inside is a pair of COVERALLS and,
text: unscathed, an EMERGENCY KIT. He slips into the coveralls, opens the kit, and
text: checks his supplies--freeze-dried food, a tool kit, medical supplies, a
dialog: flashlight, and batteries. It's enough. Enough to start over.
text: He checks the sports car--wrecked. Next, the MOTORCYCLE. Thanks to the
text: lucky placement of a fallen sheet of corrugated steel, it survived. He
text: tosses off the metal and pulls out the bike. It's smoke-damaged, scorched,
text: and a few of the hoses are melted, but it will work. He can get it to work.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - DAY - AN HOUR LATER
text: The RAIN still batters the earth's surface. THUNDER AND LIGHTNING coming in
text: from the Pacific. Neville has fashioned a pair off makeshift saddlebags and
text: a gun rack on the bike. He climbs aboard the motorcycle and tries to start
dialog: it. No go the first time, but the second...
text: The bike's engine ROARS to life. He checks the gas gauge--a full tank.
dialog: Enough to get
dialog: him... Where? Where Bob? Who knows? He plows through the mud...
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO - VARIOUS - DAY
text: The bike SPEEDS through the abandoned metropolis. Neville's eyes are
text: straight ahead.
dialog: No looking back.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
text: Neville reaches the entrance to the bridge and pulls off onto a promontory--
text: where tourists used to stop and take pictures. He comes to a stop, but keep
text: the engine running. He looks down the length of the bridge, at the ocean,
text: back at the city. His eyes find the LIGHTHOUSE where he set free the dog.
text: The TUGBOAT at the end of the pier.
text: The ocean is rough, waves break on the shoreline. STORM CLOUDS gather in
text: number and force. RAIN pounds down on him. Neville assesses it all.
dialog: Everything. Past, present, future.
dialog: And knows what he must do.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CHEMICAL PLANT - DAY
text: Somewhere in an industrial section of the city.
scene_heading: INT. CHEMICAL PLANT - DAY
text: Neville walks down an aisle, machine gun in hand, flashlight searching the
text: LARGE BINS to his left and right. Into three plastic Containers, he fills
scene_heading: PHOSPHOR, SULFUR, and MAGNESIUM.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY YARD - DAY
text: Virtually picked clean.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY YARD - DAY
text: Neville breaks into a small office. Searches until he finds PIPES, BLASTING
text: CAPS and DEMOLITION EXPLOSIVES.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY SWITCHING YARD - DAY
text: An elephant's graveyard of SUBWAY TRAINS. Above, RAIN pours through the
text: cracked and broken SKYLIGHT.
scene_heading: INT. SWITCHING YARD - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
dialog: In what used to be the "nerve center" for the city's Underground transit
text: system, Neville scrutinizes a SERIES OF MAPS, all detailing the routes and
text: layouts of the subway system. To his right is a MANUAL, flipped open to a
scene_heading: page reading "EMERGENCY POWER SUPPLIES--START-UP PROCEDURES."
scene_heading: INT. SWITCHING YARD - GENERATOR ROOM - DAY
text: Neville primes lines, checks circuits, hits igniters. He reaches the final
text: switch, says a prayer, and THROWS IT...
text: The yard lights up like a christmas tree.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY
text: Neville sits in the motorman's compartment, reading another MANUAL, munching
text: on freeze-dried food. He starts up the engine and miraculously, the motor
text: comes to life.
scene_heading: INT. SWITCHING YARD - DAY
text: The LEAD CAR, towing THREE PASSENGER CARS, pulls onto the main track and
text: comes to a stop.
scene_heading: INT. SWITCHING YARD - CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
text: Like a kid with his first model train set, Neville checks the maps and plots
text: a course on the "big board" detailing the lines throughout the city. He
text: throws a series of switches and the SOUND of rails and tracks being put in
text: place REVERBERATES throughout the tunnels and yard.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN
text: In the lead car, Neville mixes the CHEMICALS into the pipes and attaches the
text: blasting caps. Once a half dozen pine bombs are complete, he checks and
text: loads each of his guns.
scene_heading: INT. SWITCHING YARD
text: Neville steps into the yard and looks up, through the skylight... Night.
dialog: They'll be awake. And angry.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Neville climbs into the motorman's compartment and lays out a MAP of the
dialog: tunnel system.
text: A course plotted. He looks into the tunnel before him... Into the belly of
dialog: the beast.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: The TRAIN GROANS down the tracks. Rusting, creaking, it starts to breathe,
dialog: remembering the rhythm of the rails...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: A look of grim determination on his face, Neville accelerates, further into
dialog: the tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. hemocyte VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: The empty pole is lowered into the center of the village. A FURIOUS CORTMAN
text: bellows orders to Eva and her warriors...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
speaker_heading: FIND HIM!
text: A STRANGE SOUND- Everyone HEARS it. A SCREECHING. A RUMBLING. The walls of
text: the village shake. Children run frightened to the shelter of their mothers'
dialog: arms.
scene_heading: INT. VILLAGE - CAVERNOUS ROOM - NIGHT
text: Strapped down, in a weakened state, ANNA HEARS the SOUND, too. It's a
dialog: familiar sound. No, it couldn't be...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: The TRAIN ROARS down the tracks.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Neville at the controls, pushing the machine forward.
scene_heading: INT. HEMOCYTE VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: Eva and a few Warriors run to the center TRACK. She presses her ear to the
text: rail and cannot believe what she hears. She looks to Cortman with
dialog: astonishment...
dialog: He knows what's coming...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Neville.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Neville peers through the motorman's window. There's the village, dead
text: ahead. He HITS THE BRAKES...
scene_heading: INT. HEMOCYTE VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: The TRAIN BURSTS through a pile of debris, flattening a few Hemocyte warriors
text: and SCREECHES to a stop. Thirty, fifty descend upon the lead car.
text: A passenger door HISSES open and out steps Neville. And his machine gun. He
text: OPENS FIRE, cutting through the attackers. He HEAVES the first PIPE BOMB...
text: IT EXPLODES WITH WHITE LIGHT. Not a damaging blast, but the CHEMICALS BURN
text: with a WHITE HOT INTENSITY. He throws another, and another, and another.
text: Soon the center area is bathed in a BRILLIANT GLOW.
text: The light blinds the Hemocytes. They SCREECH and run for cover. More
text: significantly, the sight of Neville terrifies them. For many of them, it's
text: as if the Devil has been resurrected and he's come for retribution. Mothers
text: lead children into the rafters, nurses and clerics pray and flee.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: NO! NO!
text: Eva and the Warriors will fight. If they could only see. Blindly, they move
text: toward the train. Neville tosses a BOMB at the base of the stairs, clearing
text: a path. He grabs two bombs and RUNS, firing the machine gun only when
text: necessary. He throws a tackle into a Hemocyte Warrior, uses the butt of the
text: gun on another, and makes it up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - NIGHT
text: Neville BURSTS into the space, brandishing his weapon. It's Nurses and
text: Clerics in here, and they're petrified. They HISS and SCREECH, but they're
dialog: not the fighting type.
text: Neville searches bed after bed. Children. old men, wrinkled women. Glassy-
text: eyed, empty faces. And then he finds Anna. He kneels beside her bed and
dialog: rips out the I.V.
text: Not completely drugged, her sad eyes find his and search for compassion, for
dialog: understanding.
text: Neville pulls out the combat knife...
text: ... and hurriedly cuts through her bonds.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Can you walk?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I think so...
text: He hands her a GUN.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Take this.
text: Neville frees her brother. Anna takes Ethan in her arns and hugs him dearly.
text: Neville frees another CHILD, and ANOTHER. They're somewhat conscious and
text: stumble to their feet.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: We have to go.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Neville.
text: Neville turns, ready with the machine gun... It's Christopher. Neville
text: hesitates. Finger on the trigger...
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Take the children. The others are too
dialog: weak. You'll never make it.
text: TALONS emerge from Christopher's fingertips. And he SLICES the bonds of
text: another child. Neville lowers the gun.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: We shall have to find another way.
text: Neville, Anna, and Christopher free the children. About a dozen in total.
text: HEMOCYTE WARRIORS appear at the door.
text: Neville sees them and ROLLS a PIPE BOMB right at them. It EXPLODES, sending
text: them flying and flaming into the air. The room CATCHES FIRE. Neville lifts
text: a WEAK CHILD into his arms and heads for the stairs. Anna urges the children
dialog: to follow.
scene_heading: INT. HEMOCYTE VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: The area is still bathed in phosphorescent glow. Neville THROWS another
text: BOMB, again clearing a path. He and Anna usher the children past BLINDED
text: HEMOCYTES into the train.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Neville and Anna lie the children on passenger seats in the second and third
text: cars. When Neville opens the door to the third, he comes face-to-face with a
scene_heading: HEMOCYTE WARRIOR.
text: Although unable to see, the creature fiercely latches onto Neville. The
text: children SHRIEK. The machine gun falls from Neville's grasp and he struggles
text: to reach a handgun in his belt. The Hemocyte raises his talons...
text: BLAM! Anna fells him with a single shot to the heart. Neville pushes the
text: body out of the train and seals the doors. As Anna secures the children,
text: Neville runs to the motorman's booth. As the glow from the bombs diminishes,
text: Hemocytes storm the train. As their angry fists POUND against the windows,
text: Neville gets the train the hell out of there.
scene_heading: INT. HEMOCYTE VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: A FIRE RAGES in the cavernous room. Christopher and a few others manage to
text: flee... The HEMOCYTE CHILDREN huddle in the dark, terrified by the nightmare,
text: hiding from the bogeyman.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: The TRAIN ROARS away from the village.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Anna makes her way to Neville and, weak, collapses. He catches her and sits
text: her on a bench.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I'll be fine.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: (re the children)
dialog: Are they okay?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: They think it's a dream.
text: He smiles. Returns to the motorman's station.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Robert?
text: He turns to her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: As the train RUSHES down the tunnel, REVEAL CORTMAN. On the roof of the lead
text: car. EVA and a MUSCULAR WARRIOR atop the passenger cars.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: We HEAR a window SHATTER and the SCREAMS of children. Neville and Anna
text: REACT. He grabs the MACHINE GUN, loads a fresh clip and positions Anna at the
dialog: controls.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Just keep your foot here, your hand on
dialog: this. Let the train do the rest.
text: FOLLOW NEVILLE as he MOVES into the rear car. Standing there is the MUSCULAR
text: WARRIOR. The children huddle in fear in a far corner. The Muscular Hemocyte
text: RUNS toward Neville. Neville SHOOTS, but this guy is big and rushing on
text: blood. He keeps coming. Neville calls to the children...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Get in the next car, THE NEXT CAR!
text: The children MOVE to Car No. 2. Neville empties the clip, but the Hemocyte
text: grins and moves in for the kill. Neville PULLS OUT the last PIPE BOMB and
text: lobs it at the Hemocyte...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Say good-bye.
text: Neville DIVES. The BOMB EXPLODES inches in front of the Muscular Hemocyte,
text: igniting him and the car in BRIGHT WHITE FIRE. In the second car, Neville
text: attempts to calm and quiet the distraught children, but when he HEARS GLASS
text: CRASH and ANNA SCREAM, he tells them...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Stay here. Don't move.
text: IN THE LEAD CAR, Neville finds EVA cradling ETHAN in her arms. CORTMAN holds
text: a struggling ANNA from behind, his TALONS at her throat. Although still
text: moving damn fast, with no one at the controls, the train is losing speed.
text: Neville raises the machine gun, but Cortman can only sneer...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Put that wretched thing down.
text: Cortman's talon presses into Anna's flesh. Neville lowers the weapon.
text: Cortman gestures to the smashed open window.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Lose it.
text: Neville complies and throws the machine gun away.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: On your knees.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: On your knees, Neville, and beg for her life.
dialog: Do it, or she'll watch her brother die quite
dialog: painfully.
text: Eva HISSES. Neville looks at Cortman with contempt. What's that? Just past
text: Cortman and Anna, over their shoulders, through the front window of the
dialog: train... Is it...?
text: Light at the end of the tunnel. Neville goes to one knee.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Do it.
text: Neville drops to the other.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Cortman? Do you pray?
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Pray?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: If you don't, I would start.
text: Neville goes to floor and braces himself. Cortman turns... Through the
text: front window, he SEES. A THICK METAL DOOR.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: The train CRASHES out of the tunnel, THROUGH the barrier, off the tracks,
text: INTO the SAND, where it topples on its side,
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Neville, Anna, Cortman, Eva, the Children--all thrown out like rag dolls. A
text: SEAT becomes UNHINGED and SMACKS Neville in the skull and he drops.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: The lead car SLIDES TO A STOP about ten feet into the ocean's edge. WAVES
text: CRASH against its hull. RAIN pummels the beach. THUNDER AND LIGHTNING fill
text: the raging sky.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Chaos. Children crying, smashed glass, twisted metal. The boy Ethan gets
text: his bearings and searches the car for his sister. Anna is near the front of
text: the car, crawling away from an apparently unconscious Cortman--his legs
text: PINNED under smashed and twisted metal. Also knocked out is Neville.
text: The lead car is sinking into the sand. WATER rushes in and the car's
text: flooding. Ethan moves to his sister, but the way is BLOCKED by a battered,
text: bloody EVA. She HISSES at the boy.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ethan! Run! Run and hide!
text: The boy knows to listen. He crawls through to the beach. Eva LUNGES for
text: him, but a BULLET rips through her shoulder.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Hey bitch!
text: Eva SPINS to see Anna pointing a gun at her.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Leave my little brother alone.
text: Anna FIRES, unloading every bullet into Eva's chest. Eva tries to press on,
text: but the wounds are too severe. She drops to her knees. Her flesh tries to
text: repair itself, but too much blood is lost and there's too much damage to the
text: heart. She hisses and dies. Anna hurries to Neville. She shakes him...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Robert!
text: Neville is out cold.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I need you!
text: Neville's eyes open. She starts to help him to his feet when a WAVE CRASHES
text: into the lead car and it SINKS DEEPER into the sand. Anna SLIDES down the
text: aisle, into the water. He reaches, but she's gone. Using the seats as a
text: "ladder," Anna pulls herself out of the water. She's nearly clear when...
text: CORTMAN GRABS HER ANKLE. Anna SCREAMS. Cortman EMERGES from the water and
text: draws a deep breath. Anna struggles, but Cortman's grasp is tight.
text: Neville finds his COMBAT KNIFE, slides to them. He SLASHES Cortman's arm,
text: virtually severing it at the wrist. Anna frees herself. Neville pulls her
dialog: out of the car...
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: The lead car SINKS deeper. WATER FILLS the interior. On the sand, Neville
text: and Anna get to their feet and see the rest of the CHILDREN in the second
text: car, WATER on one side,
text: FIRE--from the burning third car--on the other.
text: He and Anna run to the car and help the panicked, crying children from the
text: wreckage. Neville lifts a helpless child into his arms and nods in the
text: direction of the TUGBOAT.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Take them to the boat!
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: In the lead car, Cortman is drowning. His hand dangles and blood forms a
text: cloud in the rushing water. He spies EVA'S BODY down the aisle. He looks at
text: her dead eyes. The pool of blood around her. Cortman closes his eyes...
dialog: And wills the blood to him.
text: It creeps down the floor, along the walls, to his TALONS. He lifts the
text: crimson to his lips and DRINKS.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: The rain is incessant. The children cover at the thunder and lightning.
text: Anna and Neville lead them down the PIER, to the TUGBOAT. Two more children-
text: -too weak to walk--remain at the train wreck and Neville returns for them.
text: Anna scans the faces of the others, searching for...
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ethan?
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT
text: UNDERWATER, Cortman holds his hand to its split-open wrist. The HAND FUSES
text: to its former limb. Muscles bulging from the feeding, Cortman LIFTS the
text: twisted metal and frees his legs from the wreckage. Eyes open wide, glowing
text: with hate, he SWIMS through the cracked open windshield, into the ocean.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - PIER - NIGHT
text: Neville returns to the boat with the last two children. A panicked Anna
dialog: meets him,
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I can't find Ethan!
text: Neville scans the beach and CALLS OUT...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
speaker_heading: E-THAN!
text: A FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates the LIGHTHOUSE and NEVILLE SEES the BOY in
text: the window, hiding.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: He's in the lighthouse. You stay.
dialog: (re the children) Watch them.
dialog: I'll be right back. I promise.
text: He gives her the last gun and runs to the lighthouse.
scene_heading: INT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Neville climbs up the creaking staircase. Ethan spots him and runs away, up
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: No! Ethan! Wait!
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Neville emerges from a maintenance door and steps onto the catwalk
text: surrounding the pinnacle. Atop the DOME of the lighthouse, painted into the
text: sky, is a LIGHTNING ROD. Neville sees it, keeps low, and calls out..
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Ethan!
text: THUNDER AND LIGHTNING. Followed by a child's whimpering. Neville moves to
text: it and finds Ethan cowering in a fetal position. He cautiously kneels,
text: gently extends his hand...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Please, Ethan, come with me.
text: With tear-filled eyes, the boy looks to Neville.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I won't let anyone hurt you.
text: Ethan slowly extends his hand. Neville takes it, smiles, and lifts the boy
text: into his arms. He stands. When he turns, he finds... CORTMAN waiting for
text: him. Dripping wet, pumped up, eyes gleaming, teeth bared.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Hello Robert.
text: TALONS emerge from his fingers.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: By now, we should use first names, don't
dialog: you think? I'm Ben.
text: Neville steps back, away from Cortman, who calmly advances, the two men
text: moving around the circular catwalk.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You're very resilient, I'll give you that.
text: Neville continues to back off, Cortman closing in...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Shouldn't you simply give in? Join the
dialog: rest of them? Die?
text: Neville glances to his left and sees what he wanted--the maintenance hatch.
text: He quickly lowers Ethan and instructs...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: Go to the boat! Go to Anna!
text: The boy does as told and runs down the stairs. Brandishing the COMBAT KNIFE,
text: Neville turns to Cortman.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You're sentimental. A weakness.
text: The two men face off. Cortman makes the first move. SLASHES at Neville's
text: chest, RIPS through the coveralls and SCRAPES his flesh. Neville LUNGES with
text: the knife, but Cortman is swift and easily steps aside. He LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: You'll have to do better.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - PIER - NIGHT
text: Ethan runs into Anna's arms. She looks up at the lighthouse.
speaker_heading: ANNA
speaker_heading: ROBERT!
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT
text: Neville looks down at the boat, at Anna. SHOUTS to her...
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: GO, ANNA! GO NOW!
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: How noble.
text: Cortman SLASHES. Neville ducks and crawls away.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Show some dignity.
text: Neville THRUSTS with the knife. Cortman BLOCKS and the knife FALLS over the
text: side, into the sea. Cortman LAUGHS. Pulls in his talons and proceeds to
text: PUMMEL Neville with his fists. Neville can barely defend himself. He falls
text: and pulls himself up. Neville appears hopelessly doomed to defeat. Cortman
text: extends his TALONS and moves in... Like a cat, Neville scurries up the
text: lighthouse dome. It's slippery, but he makes it to the very top, clinging to
dialog: the lightning rod.
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: Please, Robert. Where do you think
dialog: you're going?
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: I don't know, Ben...
text: Neville stands and LEANS against the rod, using his weight to SNAP it free
text: from its mooring.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE
dialog: But you can go to hell.
text: With the lightning rod extended like a spear, Neville slides down the dome
text: and DRIVES IT STRAIGHT INTO CORTMAN'S HEART. Cortman HOWLS with pain. His
text: chest BURSTS with crimson. Blood gurgles from his throat and all he can
dialog: mutter is...
speaker_heading: CORTMAN
dialog: No...!!!!!!!!!!!!
text: LIGHTNING FLASHES IN THE SKY. In a split second, Neville JUMPS into the
text: hatch. Like the Hand of God, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING slashes across the night
text: sky and touches the spike of metal in Cortman's chest. The top of the
dialog: lighthouse--and Cortman--
text: EXPLODES IN A BURST OF WHITE SPARKS. Cortman's SCREAM ECHOES. His scorched
text: body falls into the ocean.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: Anna waits at the boat. Neville runs across the sand. Although weak, his
text: face is filled with joy. She waited. Anna waited. At this moment in time,
dialog: he is happy. It's all behind. You can move forward. He STOPS DEAD when he
dialog: SEES...
text: A PACK OF WILD HEMOCYTE DOGS. Waiting. Six vicious creatures. GROWLING.
text: Hungry. They circle Neville, waiting for the precise moment to move in for
text: the kill. A HARSH BARK stops them. ANOTHER DOG runs from the forest and
text: climbs atop a large rock. THE LEADER.
dialog: Neville's dog.
text: The other dogs back off, intimidated. Neville's dog runs across the sand,
text: BARKING at his subordinates. Tails between their legs, the others break into
text: the forest. Neville's dog--proud and strong--approaches his former master.
text: A look of recognition and understanding passes between them.
text: The dog looks to the boat, turns to Neville. His eyes. There's still
text: something in the eyes. The dog gently BARKS and steps aside, allowing
text: Neville entry to the pier. Neville walks on, breaks into a run, and falls
text: into Anna's arms.
text: The dog observes, mournfully HOWLS and returns to the forest.
scene_heading: INT. BOAT - NIGHT
text: The Children sit huddled under blankets, clinging to each other for warmth.
text: Neville looks at them. The next generation. He STARTS the engine. The
text: storm is subsiding, the sea calm beyond the breakers. Anna holds him and
text: leans her head on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Where are we going?
text: Neville doesn't have an answer. He just goes forward. He moves the boat
dialog: forward.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAWN
text: The tugboat passes under the Golden Gate Bridge. Neville is oblivious to the
text: physical pain in his body. There's energy coming from him, a sense of
dialog: purpose.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (V.O.)
dialog: "Hell is oneself, Hell is alone, the other figures
dialog: in it merely projections. There is nothing to
dialog: escape from and nothing to escape to.
dialog: One is always alone." (pause) T.S. Eliot wrote that,
dialog: and just yesterday, I might've agreed with him.
dialog: But I don't feel alone. Not now. I'm not escaping,
dialog: I'm changing. I'm no longer trapped.
dialog: Not by Cortman, not by me. I have hope. (pause)
dialog: I was born in Des Moines, Iowa in 1960.
dialog: I had a wife Ellen and a daughter Grace.
dialog: My name is Robert Neville. I am legend.
text: He pulls Anna close and drinks in the sky. The morning sun breaks through
text: the clouds and lights a path to the future.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog:
