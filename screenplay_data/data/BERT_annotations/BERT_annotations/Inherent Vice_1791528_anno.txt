text: A sweet, young woman’s voice narrates.
speaker_heading: SORTILEGE (V.O.)
dialog: She came along the alley and up
dialog: the back stairs the way she always
dialog: used to. Doc hadn’t seen her for
dialog: over a year. Nobody had. Back
dialog: then it was always sandals, bottom
text: half of a flower print bikini,
dialog: faded Country Joe & the Fish T-
dialog: shirt. Tonight, she was all in
dialog: flatland gear, hair a lot shorter
dialog: than he remembered, looking just
dialog: like she swore she’d never look...

scene_heading: INT. DOC’S APARTMENT (GORDITA BEACH) - DUSK (1970)
text: DOC SPORTELLO sits half awake on his couch. He looks up,
text: notices someone standing at his door: SHASTA FAY
speaker_heading: HEPWORTH (20s).
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Is that you, Shasta?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Think you’re hallucinating...?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: No... just the new package, I
dialog: guess...
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: ... I need your help, Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Come in. (... you know I have an
dialog: office now and everything? Just
dialog: like a day job.)
text: She walks in, Doc gets a slow rising BONER in his
text: pants... casually tries to cover it up.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: I looked in the phone book and
dialog: almost went over there, but then I
dialog: thought better for everyone if
dialog: this looked like a secret
dialog: rendezvous.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Somebody keeping a close eye?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: «+. I just spent an hour on
dialog: surface streets trying to make it
dialog: look good.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: How about a beer?
text: Doc moves to the fridge, Shasta looks around, they sit
text: down at the kitchen table:
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: So there's this guy...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Gentlemen of the straightworld
dialog: persuasion?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Okay, Doc. He’s married.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: And the wife -- she knows about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
text: But she’s seeing somebody, too.
dialog: Only it’s not just the usual -- I
dialog: think they’re working on some
dialog: creepy little scheme.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: To make off with the hubby’s
dialog: fortune? I think I’ve heard this
dialog: one once or twice...
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: They want me in on it... they
dialog: think I’m the one who can reach
dialog: him when he’s vulnerable, or as
dialog: much as he ever gets.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Bare-ass and asleep?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: I knew you’d understand.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Are you still trying to figure out
dialog: if it’s right or wrong?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Worse than that. How much loyalty
dialog: I owe him.
dialog: BEAT...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I hope you’re not asking me.
text: Beyond the usual boilerplate,
dialog: people owe anybody they’re fucking
dialog: steady...?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Dear Abby said the same thing.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Emotions aside, let’s look at the
dialog: money. How much of the rent’s he
dialog: been picking up?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: All of it.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Pretty hefty?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: For Hancock Park.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You're giving him I0Us for
dialog: everything, of course...
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: You fucker, if I’d known you were
dialog: still this bitter I wouldn’t have
dialog: come --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Me? I’m just trying to be
dialog: professional. How much are the
dialog: wifey and boyfriend offering to
dialog: cut you in for...?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: So, this... this isn’t just a
text: couple of X-rated Polaroids, then.
text: Dope planted in the glove
dialog: compartment, nothin’ like that.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: It isn’t what you’re thinking,
dialog: Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Don’t worry, thinking comes later,
dialog: what else?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: I’m not sure, but it sounds like
dialog: they want to commit him to some
dialog: kind of loony bin.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You mean legally? Or a snatch of
dialog: some kind?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Nobody's telling me, Doc, I’m just
dialog: the bait...
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - SHASTA’S FACE
text: Looking at Doc.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: He looks at her. Can’t read her face.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Are you still taking those acting
dialog: classes?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Thing is: I heard you’re seeing
text: somebody downtown.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Oh, you mean Penny. Seeing?
dialog: Well. Nice flatland chick out in
dialog: search of hippie love thrills,
dialog: basically.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Also some kind of junior D.A.?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You think somebody there could
dialog: stop this before it happens?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: There’s not too many places I
dialog: could go with this, Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Okay, I’1l talk to Penny, see what
dialog: we can see. So your happy couple.
dialog: Do they have a names?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: It's Mickey Wolfmann.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Mickey Wolfmann who's always in
dialog: the paper? The real estate big
dialog: shot?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: You can’t tell anybody about this,
dialog: Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I won’t. Deaf and dumb. That’s
dialog: part of my job. You have any
dialog: phone numbers you wanna share?
text: She gets a pencil, writes a number down, he watches
dialog: her...
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Try to never use it.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: How do I reach you?
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: You don’t. I moved out of my old
dialog: place. Staying where I can
dialog: anymore...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You could stay here...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOC’S - STREET - EVENING
text: He walks her down to her car, ‘59 CADILLAC EL DORADO
speaker_heading: BIARITZZ --
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: Don’t come any further, somebody
text: might be watching by now.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Well, call me or something...
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: You never did let me down, Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Don’t worry, I’ll...
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: No, I mean really ever.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Oh, sure I did.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: No... you were always true...
text: She backs away, gets in the CADILLAC and drives off into
text: the night. MUSIC STARTS. He watches her go... HOLD WITH
text: DOC. DENIS (rhymes with penis) walks up, says hi, they
text: walk up towards town, away from the beach...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Hey, Denis, you hungry?
speaker_heading: DENIS
dialog: Like Godzilla sez to Mothra, man,
dialog: ‘let’s go eat someplace.’
speaker_heading: SORTILEGE (V.O.)
dialog: When Doc came in that night, it
dialog: wasn’t just the usual hungry-doper
dialog: thing -- it was something else --
text: and with Neptune moving at last
dialog: out of the Scorpio death-trip and
text: rising into the Sagitarrian light
dialog: of the higher mind -- it was bound
dialog: to be something love-related and I
dialog: thought I knew what it was...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PIPELINE PIZZA - NIGHT
text: DOC and DENIS and a bunch of locals, eating pizza.
text: Sitting here are some SURFERS, a friend named ENSENADA
text: SLIM and a lovely young girl, our narrator: SORTILEGE
dialog: (20s); she speaks in the flesh...
speaker_heading: SORTILEGE
dialog: Was that Shasta’s car I saw down
dialog: the drive?
speaker_heading: DOC
text: She stuck her head in for a couple
dialog: minutes...
speaker_heading: SORTILEGE
dialog: Are you broken up?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Kind of weird seeing her again.
dialog: Figured next time I did it’d be on
dialog: the tube not in person...
text: SORTILEGE looks at DOC with sweetness, then at HIS HAIR:
speaker_heading: SORTILEGE
dialog: Better do something about that.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Again?
speaker_heading: SORTILEGE
dialog: I can’t say it enough -- change
dialog: your hair, change your life.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: What do you recommend?
speaker_heading: SORTILEGE
dialog: That’s up to you. Follow your
dialog: intuition.
dialog: (ETC. -- Pizza talk here.)
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOC’S APARTMENT
text: He sits on his couch. THE MUSIC PLAYS. He’s on the
text: phone, it’s ringing to no answer. His hair is rolled
text: into plantation-style knots. He’s rolling a joint.
speaker_heading: SORTILEGE (V.O.)
dialog: There was an ancient superstition
dialog: at the beach, something like the
dialog: surfer belief that burning your
dialog: board will bring awesome waves,
dialog: and it went like this: Take a Zig-
dialog: Zag paper and write your dearest
dialog: wish, and then use it to roll a
dialog: joint of the best dope you can
dialog: find and smoke it all up, and your
dialog: wish would be granted. Doc’s wish
dialog: was simple... (just that Shasta
dialog: Fay be safe...)
text: He writes on the rolling papers a small note in pencil:
dialog: “To Shasta’s Safety. With Love, Doc.” Smokes it and
dialog: calls his AUNT REET (50s) who lives down the street --
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. AUNT REET’S HOUSE
text: She’s applying ten tons of various makeups, spraying some
text: on, applying with ten gallon brushes and dipping her face
text: into other paints.
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: Make it quick, Larry, I’ve got a
dialog: live one tonight and a quarter ton
dialog: of makeup to put on yet --
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Okay. Mickey Wolfmann, what can
dialog: you tell me?
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: Powerhouse in L.A. real estate
dialog: from the desert to the sea --
dialog: Technically Jewish but wants to be
dialog: a Nazi -- what’s he to you?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Shasta... she came around... told
dialog: me about a possible plot to snatch
dialog: up Wolfmann by his wife and her
dialog: boyfriend.
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: And what is Shasta's role in all
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Like how passionately does she
dialog: feel about her flame Mickey? I
dialog: didn’t ask. ‘I love him’ is
dialog: probably the answer, what else?
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: Is she paying you?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Mmm...
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: Pause. Silence. Big surprise.
dialog: Listen, if Shasta can’t pay you,
dialog: maybe that means Mickey dumped her
dialog: and she’s blaming the wife and
dialog: wants revenge.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Possible. But say I just wanted
dialog: to hang out and rap with this
dialog: Wolfmann?
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: I wouldn’t recommend your usual
text: approach, he goes around with a
text: dozen bikers, mostly Aryan
dialog: Brotherhood alumni -- all court
dialog: certified bad-asses.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Wait, wait, wait, I flunked social
dialog: studies: Jews and Aryan
dialog: Brotherhood. Isn’t there
dialog: something about hatred?
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: Mickey’s eccentric. More and more
dialog: lately. I would say stoned out of
dialog: his fuckin’ mind, since he
dialog: discovered drugs, no offense to
dialog: you, Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: So where would I find him
dialog: accidentally?
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: I promised my little sister that
dialog: I'd never put her baby in the way
dialog: of danger.
speaker_heading: 5A
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I’m cool with the Brotherhood,
dialog: Aunt Reet, I know their secret
dialog: handshake and everything.
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: It’s your ass -- try the Channel
dialog: View Estates, his latest insult to
dialog: the environment.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Channel View Estates. The one
dialog: Bigfoot Bjornsen does the
dialog: commercials for?
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: That’s the one. Maybe your old
dialog: cop buddy’s the one who should be
dialog: taking care of your case.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I did think of going to Bigfoot
dialog: but just as I reached for the
dialog: phone, history and all, I thought,
dialog: ‘naaahhhhh.’
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: Maybe you're better off with the
dialog: Nazis. Call your mother once in a
dialog: while so she knows you’re alive...
text: Doc gets up and walks to the TV, switches the channel,
dialog: finds:
scene_heading: INSERT - ON TELEVISION 5A
text: The commercial for “Channel View Estates” comes on after
text: a bad horror movie: It has LT. BIGFOOT BJORNSEN dressed
text: as a “hippie.” He’s wearing an ankle-length velvet cape
text: in paisley, love beads, shades with peace symbols and an
text: Afro wig. He’s like Cal Worthington, except for live
text: animals, he has a pack of SCREAMING KIDS that do
text: cannonballs in the pool of a MODEL HOME that Bigfoot’s
dialog: showing off and listing details and financing options,
dialog: etc... Bigfoot turns to the CAMERA:
speaker_heading: BIGFOOT (V.O.)
dialog: Those 1i’l kids, wow, they're
dialog: really something, huh!
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Doc looks confused. Bigfoot, ON SCREEN seems to be
text: looking STRAIGHT AT DOC... and DOC looks back... HOLD
text: THEIR LOOK AT EACH OTHER.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: So what's all this now...
dialog: Fucking Bigfoot. Well, wouldn't
dialog: you know. Why does the LAPD need
dialog: SAG cards?
speaker_heading: AUNT REET
dialog: I have major liquid liner issues
dialog: to deal with here, Larry -- I'm
dialog: getting off now --
text: She hangs up. DOC doesn't notice and keeps talking.

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: That's right...
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: Tariq Kahlil.
text: Doc collects himself, note pad, etc...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Okay -- so how can I help you?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: There's this white guy I was in
dialog: the joint with. Aryan
dialog: Brotherhood. We did some
dialog: business, now we're both out. And
dialog: he still owes me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: TARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a lot of money. I can't give
dialog: you details.
dialog: I swore an oath I wouldn't tell.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: How about just his name?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: Glen Charlock.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You know where he's staying now?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: Only who he works for. He's a
dialog: bodyguard for a builder named
dialog: Wolfmann.
text: MOMENT. Doc writes: paranoia alert.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: If you don't mind my asking, Mr.
dialog: Kahlil, how did you hear about me?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
text: Sledge Poteet.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Wow. Blast from the past.
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: Said you helped him out of a
dialog: situation back in '67.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: First time I ever got shot at.
dialog: You guys know each other from the
dialog: place?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: That's right -- they were teachin'
dialog: us both how to cook.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I remember him when he couldn't
dialog: boil water. So if you don't mind
dialog: an obvious question: You know
dialog: where this Glen Charlock works
dialog: now, why not just go over there,
dialog: look him up directly?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: Because Wolfmann is surrounded day
dialog: and night with the Aryan
dialog: Brotherhood Army and outside of
dialog: Glen, I've never enjoyed the
dialog: company of Nazis.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: So send some white guy in to get
text: his head hammered.
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: More or less.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: When you were inside, were you in
dialog: a gang?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: Black Guerrilla Family.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: And you say you did business with
dialog: the who now, the Aryan
dialog: Brotherhood? Can you explain that
dialog: to me...
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: We found we shared many of the
dialog: same opinions about the U.S.
dialog: government.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Alright, that racial harmony.
dialog: I can dig it. There something
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: My old street gang. Artesia
dialog: Crips. When I got out of Chino I
dialog: went looking for some of them and
dialog: found it ain't just them gone, but
dialog: the whole turf itself.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: What do you mean ‘gone’?
speaker_heading: TARIQ
text: Not there. Grind up in little
text: pieces. Seagulls all pickin' at
dialog: it. Figure I must be trippin',
dialog: drive around for a while, come
text: back, everything's still gone.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: TARIQ
text: Nobody and nothing. A ghost town
dialog: except for this big sign, ‘Coming
dialog: Soon On This Site.’ Guess who the

speaker_heading: TARIQ

speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: How long you been doin' this?
speaker_heading: DOC
text: Looks closer to Gardena than
dialog: Compton is all I'm sayin'.
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: WW Two. Before the war, a lot of
dialog: South Central was still a Japanese
dialog: neighborhood. Those people got

dialog: the new Japs.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: And now it's your turn to get
dialog: moved along.
speaker_heading: TARIQ
dialog: More white man's revenge. Freeway

speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: If I can get ahold of your prison
dialog: buddy, this Glen Charlock, will he
