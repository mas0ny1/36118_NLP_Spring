text: The book miraculously opens by itself and, as a nostalgic
text: version of "SCHOOL DAYS" PLAYS OVER, the pages quickly
text: unfold the back story of Dick and Jane and the names and
dialog: titles of the people who make this movie. The whole style
dialog: of the opening should be a kind of kiddy-version of those
dialog: "Book Openings'' to old MGM movies. Like this...
text: MUSIC AND TITLES CONTINUE. We blow open to the first page
text: where the story begins. This page is labeled, "DICK" at
text: the bottom and the picture on the page is of a young boy
text: of about ten sitting under a tree reading "IVANHOE." In
text: the background is a large, comfortable house. (NOTE: All
text: the pictures in the book are in that romanticized and naive
dialog: style unique to the Dick and Jane Series. But we shall
dialog: use the real childhood photos of our stars, Jane Fonda and
dialog: George Segal.)
text: Another page turns and we SEE a picture of Dick's father,
text: a rugged but gentle, distinguished but earthy, fun but
text: serious, neat but casual guy, standing on the front porch
text: of the house holding a football and shouting to his son,
text: Dick, who has. dropped his book and is looking eagerly at
text: his father. Beneath the picture are these words... *
