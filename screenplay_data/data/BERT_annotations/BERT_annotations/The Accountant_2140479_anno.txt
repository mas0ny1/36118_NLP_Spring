speaker_heading: MARYBETH

text: RAVEN FOOTAGE. Taken from across the street, an occasional

text: A slender man in a white shirt -- back to the camera -- walks
text: toward the Raven’s entrance. Flanking the Raven’s double

text: The Enforcers exchange glances, push off the building, move
dialog: to block the man.
text: Enforcer 1 extends an arm toward the man.
text: The Techs grimace, BRACE.
text: IMPOSSIBLY FAST -- the man grabs Enforcer 1's straightened
text: arm, jerks him close, his free hand darting to the big man’s
text: neck... PIVOTS around him... a MINI-VAN passes.
text: Enforcer 1 sinks to his knees, shocked, clawing at the STEAK
text: KNIFE BURIED IN HIS THROAT.
text: Enforcer 2 fumbles desperately under his jacket for a gun.
text: The man closes fast. Too fast.
text: Enforcer 2 bails on the gun, loops a vicious roundhouse.
text: The man ducks the swing, comes up with sharp jab to the
text: Enforcer’s throat, stumbles him.
text: Enforcer 2 clutches his shattered larynx.
text: The man grips Enforcer 2's head, forcing him down, snapping
text: his own knee up into the Enforcer’s face. CRUNCH.
text: OS: brakes lock, TIRES SCREECH, HORNS BLARE.
text: Reaching under the slumping Enforcer’s jacket, the man
text: EXTRACTS A PISTOL. The body hits the pavement.

text: Hedge Funder startled by the quickness, power of the strike.
speaker_heading: BRAX

speaker_heading: HEDGE FUNDER
dialog: That gun make you feel like a big

text: Brax rests the gun on the dash, whips his hand, SLAPS Hedge
text: Funder. The financier gasps, head swivels.
text: Hedge Funder’s eyes water, then focus, blood trickles from a
text: split lip. He glances at the free gun on the dash.
text: Brax watches, pushes the gun an inch closer to the man.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: I’m part of a small but potent
dialog: department of a private security
dialog: force. We have a client; a
dialog: European manufacturing concern.
dialog: You’re shorting their stock while

dialog: millions at my client’s expense.
dialog: They’ve been forced to lay off

speaker_heading: HEDGE FUNDER

speaker_heading: HEDGE FUNDER

speaker_heading: HEDGE FUNDER
dialog: I only meant-- We hold short

speaker_heading: HEDGE FUNDER

text: Brax slides the gun directly in front of Hedge Funder.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: Maybe you're faster. Maybe you can

text: A VOICE. Faint, ghostly. Her eyes snap open. She bangs her

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARYBETH’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

scene_heading: INT. CREATIVE ROBOTICS - CHRIS’ OFFICE - MORNING
text: Dana stands in the doorway, staring. Stunned.
text: The dry-erase boards (and a portion of wall) packed with red

dialog: 49,
text: Chris stands where both boards meet, lost in thought,
text: repeatedly CIRCLING the sole empty space available.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Chris?
text: He turns to her, his unshaven face brightens.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Come take a look!
text: He’s across the room in a snap, grabs her wrist, and half
text: walks, half drags a surprised Dana through hundreds of strewn
text: ledger pages to the boards.
text: She looks at his hands, his shirt, stained from marker. The
dialog: destroyed annual reports.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It'll jump right out at you.
text: She’s confronted with indecipherable boards.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (confused nod)
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: He moves quickly to the bottom far left hand side of the
text: boards and a CIRCLED figure. Raps his knuckles on it.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Creative ten years ago. Earnings
dialog: before interest, tax, depreciation.
text: He moves right, another circled figure, raps his knuckles.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Nine years ago. Sales increase,
dialog: profit declines. Declines?
text: Dana stares at him, at the board. Amazed.
text: He moves about the board, underlining various numbers.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No large capital investments
dialog: dragging profits down. No spike in
dialog: raw materials, labor costs, tax.
text: Continues to move, raps a third circle, and a fourth.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Eight years ago, seven. Sales up,
dialog: profits up, but not at a comparable
dialog: rate. X no longer equals Y.
text: Her eyes race, trying to keep up but failing.
dialog: 50.
text: He SLAMS circled figures on the second board.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Six years ago, five, four, three!
dialog: We’re making money, but there’s a
dialog: drain, a slow leak. And--
text: He hustles the length of both boards, underlining figures.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Here. It. Is.
text: She studies the name scrawled near the number.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Cambridge Manufacturing.
dialog: (beat )
dialog: I’ve signed those checks.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Purchase order authorized by?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Ed. Mr. Chilton.
text: Chris shrugs, only mildly interested in Ed, starts to speak--
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: But we pay them every quarter.
dialog: I’ve seen the parts. They’re
dialog: electronic assemblies for the
dialog: consumer division.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You saw somebody’s parts, probably
dialog: decoy scrap from Taiwan, Juarez.
dialog: (taps several figures)
dialog: Notice anything?
text: Her eyes ping-pong - nothing. He hints, taps the second
text: number in an underlined figure, a “3.”
text: She studies. He TAPS again, harder.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Second number in each is a three.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Human error. Most people, when
dialog: asked to pick large numbers at
dialog: random, rely on certain patterns.
text: She stares at the board, touches his arm.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (smiles; looks at him)
dialog: I was right?
dialog: 51.
text: Momentarily thrown by her touch, he recovers, steps away,
text: struggles to re-establish eye contact, blinking.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We’re guessing you reviewed income
dialog: statements from two years ago. You
dialog: saw Cambridge had been paid an
dialog: amount for parts that exceeded what
dialog: Creative was producing at the time.
dialog: Call. No one will answer.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (dumbfounded)
dialog: I studied those ledgers for months.
dialog: It was only one fiscal year.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You went through ten. Overnight.
text: He moves to the center of the boards and the EMPTY CIRCLE.

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I believe you’re needed in whatever
dialog: area I’m paying you to be needed
dialog: in.
text: Dana checks Chris with an embarrassed glance, heads for the
text: door, giving Rita an apologetic smile on the way out.
text: Rita slowly approaches the boards, looks at Chris.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: And?
text: Chris points to circled figures, quickly adding in his head.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: One million, three hundred forty
dialog: five... two million, three hundred
dialog: ninety seven... four million...
text: He ticks off the remaining eight circles as if they were
text: elementary school math, doing impossible figures in seconds.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Twenty million, seven hundred
dialog: ninety nine thousand.
dialog: (uncharacteristic)
dialog: And some change.
dialog: 52.
text: Rita stiffens, nods.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Your best guess?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Mr. Chilton.
text: She squares up to him, confrontational.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You or Mr. Black.
text: She looks at him for a beat, the boards, turns to go.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You’1l have a report for me?
text: He looks at her, away, then back, nods.
scene_heading: INT. ED CHILTON’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Dark. Ed, pajamas and bed-head, shuffles across the large
text: room. In bed, his wife sleeps.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Ed yawns, stands in front of his toilet, urinating. The
text: sound of his urine stream stops, starts, stops.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Ed heads back to bed. A faint NOISE outside the room. He
text: stops, listens.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: A huge river-stone fireplace anchors the home of a wealthy
text: man. Light from a plasma TV left on, volume low. Ed, ina
text: long bathrobe, frowns at the TV.
text: He kills it, heads for the--
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Light spills out from an open Sub-Zero. Ed rummages in the
dialog: fridge for a snack.
speaker_heading: BRAX (0.S.)
dialog: (low)
dialog: You’1l have the lemon meringue pie.
text: Ed whirls around, frightened. Brax and two THUGS.
dialog: 53.
text: Brax waggles the barrel of a silencer-fitted hand-cannon at
text: the interior of the Sub Zero.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: And those two bottles of insulin.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN (LATER)
text: Grouped on the kitchen table-- a wedge of lemon pie on a
text: plate, two vials of insulin, a syringe.
text: Brax and a nauseous Ed seated at the table, face each other
text: over the pie, medication. Thugs stand in the bg.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: (checks watch; low)
dialog: I would think you’d appreciate
dialog: being treated like an adult.
text: Bile rises in Ed’s throat. Brax motions to THUG 1, silent
text: familiar shorthand.
text: Thug 1 places a waste-basket next to Ed. The CFO retches
text: into it, recovers. Brax signals for water.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: You administer an accidental
dialog: insulin overdose, die with dignity,
dialog: in the comfort of your home, your
dialog: wife the beneficiary of, I assume,
dialog: a generous insurance policy.
text: Thug 1 delivers water and a paper towel. Ed takes a shaky
text: drink, wipes his mouth.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: I’m a master of the suicide scene
dialog: but we’ll need the appearance of an
dialog: accident if you want your wife to
dialog: collect on the policy. If we lay
dialog: hands on you you'll fight, squeal,
text: she wakes up...
dialog: (shrugs )
text: Then my hands are tied. One
dialog: accidental death is just that.
dialog: Two? I could stage a murder-
dialog: suicide but you don’t fit the
dialog: profile and quite honestly, sir, I
dialog: have neither the will nor the
dialog: inclination to do so. No, I’1l
dialog: have little choice but to rock and
dialog: roll a simple home invasion,
dialog: violate your wife a dozen different
dialog: ways, kill you both and burn this
text: place to the ground.
dialog: 54.
text: At the mention of his wife, Ed’s eyes well with tears, hands
text: involuntarily plead with the devil in his kitchen.
speaker_heading: THUG 1
dialog: (normal tone; grins)
dialog: Any chance I go first, boss?
text: Ed stifles a sob, cuts panicked eyes to the kitchen entry.
text: Brax turns in his seat, pins Thug 1 with a look that radiates
text: menace even in the dim light. Thug 1 averts his eyes.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: (back to Ed)
dialog: Okay, settle down, nobody’s
dialog: touching your wife. Aside from
dialog: what it would say about me as a
dialog: person, physiologically it’s a non-
dialog: starter. No disrespect, I’m sure
dialog: Mrs. Ed floats your boat but my
dialog: taste leans to twenty-year old
dialog: stripper.
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: So, I apologize. Sometimes I think
dialog: I say shit just to sample what
text: comes out of my mouth.
text: Ed exhales, a grateful smile, chance of a reprieve.
text: No go. Brax pulls his .45, uses the barrel to push the
text: syringe to within a couple inches of Ed.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: I will, however, park a forty-five
dialog: in her brainpan. I honor my
dialog: commitments. That’s who I am. A
dialog: concept you and your sticky fingers
dialog: obviously struggle with. Make a
dialog: decision, sir.
text: Realization dawns on Ed, resignation.
scene_heading: INT. CREATIVE ROBOTICS - CHRIS’ OFFICE - DAY
text: A MAINTENANCE WORKER, bucket at his feet, dutifully cleans

speaker_heading: LAMAR (0.S.)
dialog: Why do you do this, son?
text: Chris turns. Lamar stands watching him, his eyes red, puffy.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We’re good at it.
dialog: 55.
text: Lamar nods, considers the response. Not convinced.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Little doubt about that.
text: He pulls a check from his shirt pocket.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: The balance of your contract.
text: He sets it on the table, rubs his eyes, anxiety building.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Mr. Chilton is dead. And that
dialog: makes you sad.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Very sad--
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We haven’t finished.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Ed was a diabetic for the last
dialog: thirty years. You think he didn’t
dialog: know how to check his own blood
dialog: sugar? No, whatever unresolved
dialog: issues remain, my friend was
dialog: poisoned enough by them to kill
dialog: himself. As far as I’m concerned
text: whatever he did is forgiven.
text: He extends a hand. Chris looks at it, accepts, then grips
text: Lamar’s forearm with his free hand, forces eye contact.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sir. Please. We need to finish.
text: Lamar is momentarily taken aback, searches Chris’ face, then
text: realizes the depth of his need.
text: Movement at the door, the two turn. Dana stands in the
text: doorway, pale.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I’m sorry, I'll come back--
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: Come in, dear. We’re finished.
text: He removes himself from Chris’ hold, moves to the door.
speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: (sympathetic smile)
dialog: Mr. Wolff, you’re very good. But,
dialog: I hope our paths don’t cross again.
text: Lamar leaves, pausing to squeeze Dana’s shoulder.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (to Chris; shaken)
dialog: I heard what Mr. Black said. Do
dialog: you think it’s true? That Mr.
dialog: Chilton killed himself? It, it
dialog: can’t be.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (distracted; sincere)
dialog: It's difficult for us to say why
dialog: people do what they do.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: But, doesn’t it bother you?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Doesn’t what bother us?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: That we’re somehow, I don’t know...
dialog: responsible. If I hadn’t--
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why apologize for the truth?
text: Dana is halted by his apparent indifference, disappointed.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Good-bye, Chris.
text: Chris looks at her, searching for the right words.
text: She walks out. He stares at the doorway, glances at the

text: Marybeth sits in her usual chair, facing Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: MARYBETH

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: MARYBETH
text: Seems unhappy in his work. Said to

text: Ray stands, walks to a tall file cabinet, slides open a

text: tabloid-size 1968 LIFE magazine.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: We were investigating the men he
dialog: killed, not the killer.
speaker_heading: MARYBETH
dialog: The mafia?
text: He flips through the pages as he walks to his desk, folds it

scene_heading: Marybeth’s POV: the heading: LA COSA NOSTRA. A B&W photo of
text: two older men flanked by a younger man, names captioned.
speaker_heading: MARYBETH
dialog: (reads; impressed)
dialog: Carlo Gambino and Meyer Lansky.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: The third guy.
text: The third man; a young Francis, handsome, smiling.
speaker_heading: MARYBETH
dialog: “Unidentified man?”
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Francis Silverberg. He kept the
dialog: books for the Gambino family for
dialog: forty years. They were doing five

dialog: (beat)
dialog: He was Treasury property.
speaker_heading: MARYBETH

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Name Albert Anastasia ring a bell?
speaker_heading: MARYBETH
text: Vaguely.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Head of Murder Incorporated.
dialog: Nicknames: the Mad Hatter, the Lord
dialog: High Executioner. Anastasia also
dialog: ran the Gambino family before it
dialog: was the Gambino family. His under-
dialog: boss was Carlo Gambino. You see
dialog: where this is going.
speaker_heading: MARYBETH
dialog: For Albert, poorly.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Anastasia was kill-crazy, paranoid,
dialog: murdered mobsters and civilians
dialog: alike. A liability to the brains
dialog: running the show -- Lucky Luciano,
dialog: Meyer Lansky -- but too powerful to
dialog: risk killing. Francis was
dialog: Anastasia’s accountant, cooked the
dialog: books on all his rackets;
dialog: extortion, loan-sharking, gambling,
dialog: prostitution, right down to
dialog: expensing the shave and haircut
dialog: Albert treated himself to every
dialog: other week at the Park Sheraton
dialog: Hotel.
text: Marybeth studies Francis’ image; intelligent, decent.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Anastasia got it in his head that
dialog: Francis knew too much about his
dialog: operation, arranged to have him
text: clipped by unrecognizable out-of-
text: town hitters. A cash retainer was
dialog: paid to the Patriarca brothers out
dialog: of Boston which Francis dutifully
text: noted in his ledger.
text: Marybeth listens, absorbed.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: A week later, in the fall of fifty-
text: seven, two masked men walked into
text: the Park Sheraton barbershop and
dialog: pumped six bullets into Albert
dialog: Anastasia. The last words the Mad
dialog: Hatter ever heard were--
dialog: (Boston accent)
dialog: “So long, bean counter.” Quote and
text: dropped ‘R’ supplied by the barber
dialog: who had just obscured Anastasia’s
text: face with hot lather.
speaker_heading: MARYBETH
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: They thought he was Francis. He
dialog: switched the hit.
speaker_heading: RAY
text: Murder remains unsolved. But
dialog: nobody ever fucked with Francis
dialog: Silverberg again. Gambino took
dialog: over with Francis as accountant and
dialog: became the most powerful mobster in
dialog: New York. Lansky and Francis
dialog: laundered money all over the world.
dialog: Then in the Spring of 2000 Francis
dialog: walked into New York’s FBI
dialog: headquarters, sat down and started
text: talking. The acting boss of the
dialog: family, Big Tony Benedetto thought
dialog: Francis’ age made him vulnerable to
dialog: prosecution. Ordered a hit.
text: Francis sniffed it out. He was
dialog: taken into protective custody...
text: She stares at him, absorbed.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: ..-given immunity. The Bureau
dialog: convicted Big Tony and two dozen
text: other mobsters on Francis’
dialog: testimony. Then the Towers came
dialog: down and everything changed. The
dialog: Patriot Act allowed us to detain
dialog: him indefinitely. F.B.I. farmed
dialog: him out to Treasury to develop a

speaker_heading: THUG 1

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Whoa! In a hurry, Mr. Wolff?

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: SHE IS NOT OUR PROBLEM!
scene_heading: INT. DANA’S APARTMENT BLDG. - LOBBY - DAY
text: Dana, hair down, jeans and a t-shirt, enters the elevator,

text: Two large MEN enter the elevator. They move to the rear of
text: the car, push no buttons. She hugs her groceries.
text: The elevator doors close.
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Dana exits the elevator with a nervous glance over a
text: shoulder. MAN 1 smiles, follows. MAN 2 stays, holds the
dialog: elevator.
text: She shifts the groceries, anxious, rummages in her purse.
text: Man 1 reaches under his jacket.
text: Chris barges through an EXIT door, looks down the long hall,
speaker_heading: SPRINTS.
text: Man 2 sees Chris, draws a gun.
text: Dana pulls her keys, sees Chris running, turns. Man 1 levels
text: a gun at her. She’s paralyzed with fear. Groceries fall.
text: Man 1 sees Chris, switches targets. Too late.
text: Chris wrenches his gun hand up -- PHHT! A SILENCED ROUND
text: pierces the ceiling.
text: Dana futilely tries to key her lock, hands shaking.
text: Chris drives his instep down on the inside of Man 1's knee,
text: snapping the leg... he GASPS in pain... the gun falls.
text: Man 2 races down the hall, gun leveled.
text: Chris bends for Man 1's gun... PHHT! PHHT! shots furrow the
text: floor between him and the weapon. Man 2 closing fast.
text: Chris straightens, spins a crippled Man 1 around to face his
text: partner... instantly wraps Man 1 in a FULL NELSON and drives
text: him down the hall toward Man 2.
text: Man 1 SCREAMS, his shattered leg bending unnaturally with
text: each step. Chris shields himself, forces the man’s head side
text: to side, like a METRONOME.
text: Fifteen feet apart...
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: (to Man 2; in agony)
dialog: Stop! You'll hit--
text: Ten feet apart...
text: Man 2 stops, aims. Chris and his groaning partner almost on

text: NOW -- Chris reverses head motion -- PHHT!
text: Man 1 drilled in the forehead. Chris thrusts the dead weight
text: onto Man 2, slamming him into the wall.
dialog: 69.
text: Man 2 shrugs off the corpse, brings up his gun, Chris grabs
text: the arm. PHHT! PHHT! Shots divot drywall.
text: Man 2 drives an elbow into Chris’ face, snaps his head back.
text: Chris hangs onto the gun hand.
text: The gun neutralized, the men fight, all knees and elbows.
text: Man 2 uses his greater weight, drives Chris across the hall,
text: slams the back of his head into the wall.
text: A dog furiously BARKS from one of the apartments.
text: Chris wraps up Man 2’s free arm with his own, tightens his
text: neck muscles and uppercuts the top of his head beneath the
text: larger man’s chin, dazing Man 2.
text: Chris follows with a savage head-butt, the man’s nose bursts,

text: the muzzle lining up with Man 2's forehead.
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: No, wait--
text: PHHT! PHHT! Chris double-taps him. FIGHT OVER.
text: Amid spilled produce, a nearly crazed Dana still fumbles with

text: He hesitates, puts a hand on her shoulder. She SCREAMS.
text: He jerks his hand back. She turns to him, crying. He

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Dana. We must go.
scene_heading: INT. CHRIS’ PICKUP TRUCK (MOVING VERY FAST) - DAY

speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: An hour ago, two men tried to kill

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRIS

text: She glances at his near sleeve, fixates on the blood spots.
speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: 72.
scene_heading: INT. AIRSTREAM - MAIN CABIN
text: Chris, in a black fidget, hustles toward his bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE UNIT
text: Nerves frayed, Dana hugs herself, paces, walks to the

scene_heading: INT. AIRSTREAM - BEDROOM
text: Chris SLAMS the door shut, pulls a bulging duffel from his

scene_heading: INT. STORAGE UNIT

text: Heads for the trailer door.
scene_heading: INTERCUT DANA AND CHRIS
text: Chris unzips the duffel, double-checks the contents; clothes,

text: Dana walks the trailer, scans her surroundings. Christmas
text: tree lights, speakers...
text: He digs a bottle of meds out of the duffle, shakes it to
dialog: confirm the amount.
text: She looks around, pulls open a drawer; knives, forks, spoons--
text: LOOSE DIAMONDS. She slides the drawer shut. Pulls the
text: pantry drawer out-- shrink wrapped Yen, Euros, dollars.
text: Shoves it shut.
text: He glances to the closed door, concerned. He rifles an open
text: drawer full of neatly arranged PASSPORTS.
text: Her face pressed to the port-hole window of the trailer’s Toy
text: Hauler room. A view of the gun racks, the PISTOL GRIP
text: SHOTGUN, KALASHNIKOV, scoped Dakota.
text: He slips into a clean shirt. A quick look around the room...
text: takes the Light Sabre down, hides it in the closet.
text: Dana inspects the Renoir. Is this real? Her fingertips
text: brush the canvas, down, his SIGNATURE. She recoils, the

text: Looks down the barrel of a silenced 10 mm Glock, Chris on the

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Whose military?!
dialog: (then; low)

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: DANA

dialog: Renoir. He continues into--
scene_heading: INT. AIRSTREAM - BEDROOM
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Math? I see, guns don’t kill
dialog: people, math kills people?
text: Chris works the shotgun and shells into the duffel.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We can’t hit a man with Fermat’s

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: DANA

dialog: Decide, Dana.

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Never played a hand. Went to the

text: She stands, enthused, gesturing.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I turned the Naperville North math

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I know what it means to obsess,

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: The dress meant that much to you?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: It wasn’t about the dress. I
dialog: wanted to walk into that gym and

dialog: just wanted to fit in. You know?
text: Belong. Everybody does.
text: Their eyes meet. He knows, understands.
speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: You know, what’s...

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We see it.
text: She waits for the explanation, patient...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Each number has its own shape.

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: He deposited millions in skimmed

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Why? Why would he take it out just

speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: He started skimming and hiding like

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: DYING MOBSTER

speaker_heading: MARYBETH

speaker_heading: MARYBETH

speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: SNIPER 1
dialog: Fuck you.

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We need the layout of the home.

scene_heading: INT. LAMAR’S HOME-LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: (to Lamar; low)

speaker_heading: BRAX

text: Brax grabs Lamar by the scruff of the neck, bolts.
text: Mercs crouch as .50 cal rounds blow jagged holes through the
text: great room, brick powders, walls tear like tissue, strike the
text: lake beyond. A round punches thru 2 walls, a MUSTACHED MERC.
text: A HUGE MERC lies flat, a round gouging the wood floor near
text: his head. The other Mercs crawl to the rear of the house.
text: Stop. Silence. The Huge Merc gathers himself, freezes as he

speaker_heading: LAMAR
dialog: What? What’s happening?
text: Brax sits on the edge of a bed, pistol in hand, detached.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Chris chants, eerily calm, sweeps the home. Each burst of

text: Dozens of silenced rounds splinter door frames, dig into

dialog: 107.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM

speaker_heading: BRAX
text: Died on Saturday, buried on Sunday.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That was the end of Sol--
text: Merc Leader emerges from a connecting hall, fires a silenced

text: Chris dives for cover, badly outgunned.
text: Merc Leader presses his advantage. Chris returns fire in

text: Merc Leader empty. Chris pitches his glasses, vaults
text: furniture, rushes the man. Merc Leader jacks a full clip in,
dialog: racks the slide, points--
text: Chris slams into Merc Leader, the machine pistol discarded.
text: Two professionals; quick fists, elbows, knees.
text: Chris smaller but faster, unemotional. A knee snaps one of

text: A desperate Merc Leader swings wildly, Chris blocks, breaks
text: Merc Leader's nose with unanswered punches, moves to finish--
text: LOUD ROCK MUSIC erupts from the home’s speaker system.
text: Chris winces, distracted. Merc Leader punches him, Chris
text: swings, misses, Merc Leader delivers a kick to the head,
text: Chris goes down.
text: Merc Leader lunges for the weapon. Chris, bleeding,
text: disoriented, scrambles after him. Merc Leader grabs the gun,
text: Chris on top.
text: They struggle for control, Chris -- IN PAIN -- punches Merc
text: Leader in the face again and again. Merc Leader loses

text: MUSIC OFF, LIGHTS ON. Chris lunges, grabs Merc Leader’s gun.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: BRAX (0.S.)
dialog: (screams )
dialog: Enough with the moronic chant
dialog: already!
text: Chris squints against the light, pistol aimed at Brax. He

speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: You crack a spook’s skull?!
text: Chris tries to rise, Brax kicks him.
speaker_heading: BRAX
dialog: Because you feel sorry for some

speaker_heading: BRAX

speaker_heading: BRAX
