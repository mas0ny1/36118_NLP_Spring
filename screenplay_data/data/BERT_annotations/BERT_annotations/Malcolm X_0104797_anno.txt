scene_heading: 1 	EXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY
text: It is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of
text: Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things.
text: SHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark
text: young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears
text: the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs
text: and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.

scene_heading: 5 	EXT. STREET - DAY
text: FOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages.
text: His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without
text: stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is
text: not dissuaded.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6	INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY
text: Shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a
text: surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on
text: a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife,
text: the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing
text: being done just so, in time-honored fashion.
text: He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar.
text: He adds water and makes a paste of the starch.
text: Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is
text: getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON)
text: one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber,
text: CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOLLY
dialog: After I hit the number that woman wasn't no good
dialog: to me at all.
dialog: 
text: The men laugh.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and
text: strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden
text: spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as
text: fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.
dialog: 
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly
text: ajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out.
speaker_heading: CHOLLY'S VOICE
dialog: She says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond
dialog: ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap
text: black sunovabitch to boot.
speaker_heading: TOOMER
dialog: And when a black woman call you a cheap black
dialog: sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black
dialog: sunovabitch.
dialog: 
dialog: Cholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story.
speaker_heading: CHOLLY
dialog: Will you let me tell it?
text: ON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying,
text: unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of
text: rubber gloves.
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Where's Homeboy?
text: He is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of
text: Vaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts
text: of an exasperating child.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOLLY
text: Red's in the head, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOOMER
dialog: You mean hiding in the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOLLY
dialog: Hey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you.
text: His hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes
text: out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes
text: and an expression of apprehension.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOOMER
dialog: Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh,
dialog: Homeboy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOLLY
dialog: Man, don't scare him more than he's scared
dialog: already. Ain't too bad...
dialog: 
text: Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes
text: him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding
text: a protective collar of paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOLLY
dialog: ...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her
dialog: cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But
dialog: pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right,
dialog: Homeboy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE - MALCOLM
text: Malcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar.
text: Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's
text: scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered
text: around, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a
dialog: kind of execution.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOLLY
text: Git his forehead and eyebrows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: I know what I'm doing.
dialog: 
text: Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area. Now he brings over the
text: steaming jar and places it nearby.
speaker_heading: SHORTY (contd)
dialog: Listen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging
dialog: when I get through 'cause this shit can burn a
text: hole through cement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHOLLY
dialog: Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty
text: applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - MALCOLM
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I thought you said it was gonna sting... this
dialog: ain't nothin'.
dialog: 
text: For a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries
text: to catch his breath: his head is on fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM (contd)
dialog: You motherfucker. You're killing me. I'm
dialog: burning up. My damn head is on fire.
text: He nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him.
text: Shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the
text: congolene into his hair.
text: Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a
text: basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the
text: room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his
dialog: hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Don't fight me, man. Let me git it out.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he
text: feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces
text: his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting
text: Malcolm and the shop in the process.

dialog: the jacket...
dialog: 
text: Shoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ......
text: dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully
text: outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length
text: mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Well, all right, then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Well, all reet, then.
dialog: 
text: The transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands.
scene_heading: 10	EXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Malcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked,
text: zoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the
text: street notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the
text: lighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully
dialog: aware of their impact.

text: He looks directly into the camera, wearing a Baptist Minister's robe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)

scene_heading: 15 	INT. ROSELAND STATE BALLROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY
dialog: 
text: They both were posed for a picture. The music "FLYING HOME" is blaring
text: as LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the
text: dancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately
text: BLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks.
text: And Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed
text: couples on the floor.
text: A BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond
text: hair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: SHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: People start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers. The

dialog: 
scene_heading: 16 	INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
dialog: 
text: TWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined
text: by a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the
text: main event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to
text: get better vantage points and the competition is under way.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON THE CROWD
text: It is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience,
text: mostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of
text: refinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch
text: her eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one
text: in particular, but nonetheless looking.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Getting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and
text: bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is
text: greeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites.
speaker_heading: WIDER SHOT
text: The music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more
dialog: remarkable quality.
scene_heading: FOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM
text: He is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her.

dialog: approaching.
text: TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one
text: another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Come on, baby, let's show 'em how.
dialog: 
text: Laura smiles shyly; she's willing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM (contd)
dialog: You better get out of them shoes, girl.
dialog: 
text: Laura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of
dialog: sneakers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 17 	INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Because of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a
text: moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping
text: eagle" and the "kangaroo." Malcolm starts boosting her over and around
text: his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect
dialog: partner. She loves it.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE WITH THE CROWD
dialog: 
text: So does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: "Go,
dialog: man, go." "Hey, Red." "Mmmmmm ummm."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE: - SHORTY
dialog: 
text: A big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and
text: she takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around
text: like a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has
text: had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides.
dialog: 
text: TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners
dialog: now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp
text: waves over.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that
text: people are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in
text: particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to
dialog: his steps.
dialog: 
text: Seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of
text: the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and
text: Malcolm go into a solo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLES
dialog: 
text: The crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other.
text: The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around
text: Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous
text: applause of the audience.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO)
text: Clapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - SHORTY
dialog: 
text: Waiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking
text: his hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Hey, man, gimme some skin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Shorty, this is Laura.
dialog: 
text: Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: 'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Now you come back.
dialog: 
text: Laura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: That's a fine chick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Fine as May wine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHORTY
dialog: Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
dialog: 
text: Then his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a
text: simple, direct gesture, "Want to dance?" Malcolm eyes Shorty and
text: wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the
text: cynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because
text: she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not
text: an obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine
dialog: steps.
dialog: 
text: TWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock
dialog: his black world.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - MALCOLM
text: Trying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the
text: dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Why don't you take your little girl home, Red,
dialog: and come on back?
dialog: 
text: He stops in his tracks. He can't believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (contd)
dialog: Just walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you
dialog: get back.
text: He can only grin.

scene_heading: 19	INT. SOPHIA'S CAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' "IF I
dialog: DIDN'T CARE."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SOPHIA
dialog: 
text: Sophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe
text: white breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's
dialog: very unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might
dialog: say Sophia was way ahead of her time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Malcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white
dialog: breasts like these?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE - MALCOLM
dialog: 
text: He shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (contd)
dialog: Put your black hands on them.
dialog: 
text: He is paralyzed.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (contd)
dialog: Please do as I say.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm mumbles something. He then kisses Sophia as if his black life
text: depended on it and he commences to kill it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (contd)
dialog: Hey, baby.
dialog: 
text: She stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (contd)
dialog: Am I the first white woman you've been with?
text: She already knows the answer. He laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: ...That isn't a whore?
text: Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor.
text: A beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his
text: hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's
dialog: not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't
dialog: run.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE - SOPHIA

text: The couple starts at it again.
scene_heading: 19A	INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

text: The procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three

dialog: Same procedure.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE. SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards
text: are approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced
text: PRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper
text: surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their
text: lips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer --
text: beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is
text: BEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately
text: the gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him
dialog: with great respect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Looka Satan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I see him.
dialog: 
text: Bembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words
text: and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the
dialog: other prisoners.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETE
text: He bout to bust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: No, he's not gonna bust. But he's not gonna fix

speaker_heading: GUARD BARNES
dialog: State your number.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm doesn't answer, doesn't blink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD WILKINS
dialog: Little.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE. Bembry in the FG of the scene.
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: He's a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a break.
dialog: 
text: It's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with
text: admiration. Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry.
speaker_heading: GUARD BARNES
dialog: 0kay, I'll give him a break. Now state your
dialog: number, Little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE - MALCOLM
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I forgot it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - BEMBRY
text: Shaking his head in anguish. He knows what's coming.
text: ANGLE. Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm,
text: grabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest
text: of his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number. The guard bends Malcolm's
text: head to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD WILKINS
dialog: Can you read, boy? Thass your number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD BARNES
dialog: Now say it.
dialog:

dialog: I'm Malcolm Little, not no goddam number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD WILKINS
dialog: Oh, yes you is, baby; thass all you is.
dialog: 
text: And slams Malcolm hard. He slumps to the floor.

dialog: 
text: Only the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of
text: a mattress and a slop bucket. If Malcolm were to stretch out his arms,
text: he could touch both walls. He lies half on the stone floor, half on the
dialog: mattress.
dialog: 
text: A clang as the heavy door is opened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD CONE
dialog: Time's up. Get on your feet.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD CONE (contd)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD CONE (contd)
dialog: You just drew two more days.
dialog: 
text: And slams the door shut.
scene_heading: 104	INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It is almost pitch black. We can almost smell the stench of the room.
text: Malcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall.
speaker_heading: TRUSTEE'S VOICE
dialog: Water.
dialog: 
text: The long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in
text: the cell door. Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout,

dialog: 
scene_heading: 107	INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT
text: Malcolm is alone at the bars: the hope of freedom filling his mind.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm pulls at the bars, tries to shake them in impotent fury. He
text: pounds the walls. Empty, sick, defeated, his nails scratching the
text: walls, he slides to the floor of the cell.
text: It is the low point of his life: nowhere to turn, nothing to hope for.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 108 INT. SOLITARY - LATER
dialog: 
text: Guard Cone is shaking him into consciousness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD CONE
dialog: All right, Little. Get up.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm just about makes it. The guard is in half-focus.
speaker_heading: GUARD CONE (contd)
dialog: State your number.
dialog: 
text: He is beaten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
text: A 859912.
dialog: 
text: A shower is heard.
scene_heading: 109 	INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his
text: broken body. He lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his
text: problems. On a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings
dialog: for a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc.
dialog: 
text: He turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. It's
text: Bembry standing nearby. Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in
dialog: the water. He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left
dialog: alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I know how you feel. Like you want to lay down
dialog: and die.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY (contd)
dialog: I brought you something.
dialog: 
text: He puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things.
text: Malcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to
text: deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Who the hell are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Man, what do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: You need something. It's not a reefer, but
dialog: it'll help some.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
dialog: 
text: But he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties
text: the contents of the matchbox into it. And drinks it down quickly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Sit down or it might knock you down.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. For the first, he
text: smiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison. He at Bembry
text: wonderingly, unable to figure him out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your
dialog: hype?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I can show you how to get out of prison. And
dialog: it's no hype.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad.
dialog: You got some more?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What did you give it to me for then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: 'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear
dialog: me without it.
dialog: 
text: This is a new breed of cat; Malcolm has never met anyone like him. He
text: eyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What in the hell are you talking about?
dialog: 
text: He begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what Bembry is
dialog: saying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I think you got more sense than any cat in this
dialog: prison. How come you are such a fool?
dialog: 
text: Malcolm looks over, piqued.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY (contd)
dialog: Nobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the
dialog: movies. Because even if you get out, you are
text: still in prison.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: You ain't lying.
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: When you go busting your fists against a stone
dialog: wall, you're not using your brains. Cause
dialog: that's what the white man wants you to do. Look
dialog: at you.
dialog: 
text: These last words are spoken sharply with disgust. Malcolm turns his
text: hands massaging the conk into his hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY (contd)
dialog: Putting all that poison in your hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Man, you been locked up too long, everybody
text: conks. All the cats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Why? Why does everybody conk?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Cause I don't want to walk around with my head
dialog: all nappy, looking like--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?!
dialog: Why don't you want to look like what you are?
dialog: What makes you ashamed of being black?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I ain't said I'm ashamed.
dialog: 
text: He turns the water on to wash out the conk -- which has begun to burn.
text: Bembry restrains him, holding his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Leggo. I got to wash it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
dialog: 
text: But it is burning now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Man, you better get off me.
dialog: 
text: He wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all
dialog: that poison into your hair, into your body --
dialog: trying to be white.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Man, I don't want to hear all that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I thought you was smart. But you just another
text: one of them cats strutting down the avenue in
dialog: your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like
dialog: a monkey. And the white man sees you and he
dialog: laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't
dialog: white.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry
dialog: has said disturbs him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
text: Malcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the
dialog: barrage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: The question is, who are you? You are in the
dialog: darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah
dialog: Muhammad can bring you into the light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Elijah who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out
dialog: of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want
dialog: is another fix. I thought you were smart.
dialog: 
text: And he is gone. Malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful
text: moment. He is pulling the comb through his hair.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 110 	INT. PRISON LICENSE SHOP - DAY
dialog: 
text: PRISONERS are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes
text: license plates. Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks
text: to the other prisoners. Malcolm is painting the plates, a little
text: removed from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle,
text: idles by a window.
dialog: 
text: A whistle sounds, ending the work shift. The inmates quickly file out
text: into the yard. Bembry stays. Malcolm is half decided.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD BARNES
dialog: You taking the yard?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I'm staying.

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Me too.
dialog: He goes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave
dialog: you your last fix.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you
dialog: scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: You the only cat don't come on with that
dialog: "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss
dialog: none.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't
dialog: got the words to say what's on his mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Don't con me. Don't try...
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Okay, okay.
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Don't con me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What do you do with your time?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I read. I study. Because the first thing a
dialog: black man has to do is respect himself. Respect
dialog: his body and his mind. Quit taking the white
dialog: man's poison into your body: his cigarettes,
dialog: his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his
dialog: pork.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: That's what Mama used to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy
text: beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks
text: he has come to the essence of a hustle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if
dialog: you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'?
text: I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm
text: talking the words of Elijah, the black man's
dialog: God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What? Everybody knows God is White.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY (contd)
dialog: But everything the white man taught you, you
dialog: learned. He told you you were a black heathen
dialog: and you believed him. He told you how he took
dialog: you out of darkness and brought you to the
dialog: light. And you believed him. He taught you to
text: worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin
dialog: -- and you believed him. He told you black was
dialog: a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look
dialog: up the word black in the dictionary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: Did you ever study anything wasn't part of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM'S VOICE
dialog: White (whit), adj. Of the color of pure snow;
dialog: reflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The
dialog: opposite of black, hence free from spot or
dialog: blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent,
dialog: harmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable.
dialog: 
text: Malcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can. Bembry takes
text: over the reading, giving it ironic emphasis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: That's bullshit. That's a white man's book.
dialog: Ain't all these white man's books?

speaker_heading: BEMBRY

speaker_heading: MALCOLM

dialog: 
text: Bembry smiles at Malcolm. He is a remarkable man who always takes
text: careful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience;
text: he talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk
dialog: funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the

speaker_heading: MALCOLM (contd)
dialog: Come on up here, man, and give us some skin.

dialog: up with me, who robbed with me, and did time in

dialog: and be counted--
dialog: 
text: But Shorty is trying to hide from the spotlight. Malcolm comes down
text: from the platform and walks to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM (contd)
dialog: Folks, the brother is shy and needs special

speaker_heading: SHORTY

dialog: 
text: Malcolm is addressing a HUGE AUDIENCE. His tone is more intense, more

dialog: Her interest in Malcolm (true, also, for most of the other unmarried
dialog: sisters) is more than religious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: --and what has the white devil made of them:
dialog: dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He
dialog: should fall on his knees and say, "My kind
dialog: commits history's greatest crime against your
dialog: kind every day of your life." But does he? No.
dialog: He scorns you, splits your head with his

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (little out of breath)
dialog: Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our
text: loudspeaker is heard on the street?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY
dialog: I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEMBRY (contd)
dialog: The Sister lectures our Muslim women in hygiene

speaker_heading: CLOSE - MALCOLM
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM

dialog: condition of black people in this country. And
dialog: the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting

dialog: otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the
dialog: Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic
dialog: simply because he teaches our people to go into

dialog: the economic leadership in our own community.
dialog: The black people in this country have been the
dialog: victims of violence at the hands of the white
dialog: man for 400 years, and following the ignorant
dialog: Negro preachers, we have thought that it was
dialog: God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute

text: Sidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM/HIS VOICE
dialog: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that
dialog: God is now about to establish a kingdom on this
dialog: earth based on brotherhood and
dialog: [...]
dialog: against peace, his history on this earth has
dialog: proved that. Nowhere in history has he been
dialog: brotherly toward anyone. The only time he has
dialog: been brotherly toward you is when he can use
dialog: you, when he can exploit you, when he can
dialog: oppress you, when you will submit to him. And
dialog: since his own history makes him unqualified to
dialog: be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of
dialog: brotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad
dialog: teaches us that God is about to eliminate that
dialog: particular race from this earth. So since they
dialog: are due for elimination, we don't want to be
dialog: with them.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CLOSE - MALCOLM
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM (contd)
dialog: If the so-called Negro were American citizens
dialog: we wouldn't have a race problem. If the
dialog: Emancipation Proclamation was authentic, you
dialog: wouldn't have a race problem. If the 13th,
dialog: 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution
dialog: was authentic, you wouldn't have a race
dialog: problem. If the Supreme Court desegregation
dialog: decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a
dialog: race problem. All of this is hypocrisy. These
dialog: Negro leaders have been telling the white man
dialog: everything is all right, everything is under
dialog: control. And they've been telling the white man
dialog: that Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to
dialog: him. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been
dialog: saying is going to come to pass is now coming
text: to pass and now the Negro leaders are standing
dialog: up saying that we are about to have a racial
dialog: explosion. We're going to have a racial
dialog: explosion and that's more dangerous than an
dialog: atomic explosion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE - MALCOLM
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM (contd)
dialog: It's going to explode because black people are
text: dissatisfied. They're dissatisfied now not only
dialog: with the white man, but with these Negroes who
dialog: have been sitting around here posing as leaders
dialog: and spokesmen for black people. Anytime you put
text: too many sparks around a powder keg, the thing
dialog: is going to explode and if the thing that
text: explodes is still inside the house, then the
dialog: house will be destroyed. So the Honorable
dialog: Elijah Muhammad is telling the white man get
dialog: this powder keg out of your house, let the
dialog: black people in this country separate from him
dialog: while there's still time. And if the black man
dialog: is allowed to separate and go on onto some land
dialog: of his own, where he can solve his problems,
dialog: then there won't be any explosion. COMPLETE

dialog: Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in
dialog: Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the
dialog: brotherhood that existed at all levels among
dialog: all people, all colors who had accepted the
dialog: religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it
dialog: had done, Islam, for those people despite their
dialog: complexion differences, that it would probably
dialog: do America well to study the religion of Islam
dialog: and perhaps it could drive some of the racism
dialog: from this society. Muslims look upon themselves
dialog: as human beings, as part of the human family
dialog: and therefore look upon all other segments of
dialog: the human family as part of that same family.
dialog: Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow
dialog: and white.

dialog: African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very
text: hypocritical when they stand up in the UN
dialog: condemning South Africa and saying nothing
dialog: about the racist practices that are manifested

dialog: One of your more controversial remarks was a

dialog: I don't see why that should be controversial. I
dialog: think that if white people found themselves
dialog: victim of the same kind of brutality that black

dialog: to protect them, that the intelligence on the

speaker_heading: OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE
dialog: Here at this final hour, in this quiet place,
text: Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its
text: brightest hopes, extinguished now and gone from
dialog: us forever.
dialog: 
text: 200C 	DOLLY SHOT of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor,
text: waiting to see Malcolm's body, where it lies before burial.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE: (contd)
dialog: For Harlem is where he worked, and where he
dialog: struggled and fought. His home of homes, where
dialog: his heart was and where his people are. And it
dialog: is therefore most fitting that we meet once
dialog: again in Harlem to share these last moments
dialog: with him. For Harlem has ever been gracious to
dialog: those who loved her, have fought for her and
dialog: defended her honor even to death. It is not in
dialog: the memory of man that this beleaguered,
dialog: unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has
dialog: found a braver, more gallant young champion
dialog: than this Afro-American who lies before us
text: unconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem
dialog: finds to honor in this stormy, controversial
dialog: and bold young captain and we will smile and we
dialog: will answer and say unto them:

speaker_heading: OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd)
dialog: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you
dialog: have him smile at you? Did you ever listen to
dialog: him? Did he ever really do a mean thing? Was he
