dialog: I'm sure you asked him about it.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I didn't actually.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: That must mean you know what he'd

scene_heading: FWB - BLUE Draft 7-14-10 23
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: He'd tell me to go with my gut. And
dialog: that he's proud of me no matter what.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Sounds like a good guy.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: He is. What about you? Is

speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I don't get that reference. I'm

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: I never really thought about it.

speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's the real island of misfit toys.
dialog: All those people from all over the

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Including you?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Especially me.
text: He glances over at her. There's something about this girl.

speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wanna see something cool?

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: What are you doing?
scene_heading: FWB - BLUE Draft 7-14-10 24
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Stop being so uptight and lie down.
speaker_heading: DYLAN

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Hilarious. Great stuff.

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Only place in the city you can see
dialog: stars.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Whoa. It's awesome.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I come up here to think. Whenever

dialog: It's like my New York version of a

dialog: No cell phone reception.
text: She gets lost in the view.
speaker_heading: DYLAN

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Shush.
text: She leads him down the sidewalk. They land in the middle of

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Now you're showing me large groups
dialog: of people. Because no one ever
dialog: congregates in LA. All we do is
dialog: drive and stay with our own races.
text: Just then a fast cover of "New York New York" starts blasting.
text: The camera finds a few people holding up synchronized
text: boomboxes. Then a few pedestrians start dancing
text: (choreographed) to it, then some people join in, then some
text: more-- it's a flashmob. Shot from all angles, it's stunning.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Do these people get paid for this?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Nah, it's just for fun. Feels nice
dialog: to be part of a group. New York can
dialog: be a lonely place sometimes.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: And you're trying to sell me on it?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Every place is lonely sometimes.
text: Just then one of the dancers leapfrogs Dylan, scaring the

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: No no. Just excited. Cool. You're

text: He hits a button and the flashmob assembles into giant G-Q

speaker_heading: DYLAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I got in touch with a guy who puts

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Yeah. Of course.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: So when are we seeing Jamie again?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What's your problem? Did you have a
dialog: fight with your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Annie, for the last time, we're not
dialog: going out. Why don't you believe
dialog: me? We're just friends.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I saw you creeping out of her room

scene_heading: 102 INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME - DAY 102

dialog: Friends with benefits?! Are you

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Anyway, that's over.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DYLAN

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What more are you looking for?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Who says I'm looking?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Come on, Dylan.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I don't know. But it's not Jamie.
text: Jamie's taking it all in.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Why, 'cause you're great together?
dialog: "Cause you're actually friends with
dialog: each other? 'Cause you're the
dialog: happiest I've ever seen you?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Yes, those reasons. I don't know
dialog: what to tell you, Annie. She's not
dialog: for me. I don't like her like that.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: But you liked her enough to have sex
dialog: with her?
scene_heading: FWB - BLUE Draft 7-14-10 108
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: It was just physical. Like playing
dialog: tennis.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: If it was just physical, it would've
dialog: been a one time thing and then you
dialog: would've never talked to each other
dialog: again. Trust me.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: The fact that we kept having sex is
dialog: proof that it didn't mean anything.
text: Annie smacks him in the head.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't think I've seen you this dumb

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You can't name one thing wrong with

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I could never go out with her.
dialog: (searching)
dialog: She's too fucked up. She doesn't
dialog: want a boyfriend she wants someone
dialog: to solve all her problems.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Sometimes the right person can solve
dialog: all your problems.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Well I can't. Not with her. She's
dialog: too damaged. Magnum PI couldn't
text: solve the shit going on in her head.

dialog: Why'd you take the door off your

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: It was dumb. I read about it in

scene_heading: TOMMY BOLLINGER
dialog: Yeah, like that's how Warren Buffet

dialog: How to be happy? Get with someone

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yeah, so I'm gonna go ahead and try

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I shouldn't have said that. I just
dialog: wanted to get Annie off my back.
dialog: She was convinced we liked each other.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Me, too. I thought we were friends.
dialog: But friends don't say stuff like

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: You're mad because I didn't cuddle?!

speaker_heading: JAMIE

speaker_heading: DYLAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Dad?

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Dad? Dad?
text: He can't find him. He scurries through trying to find him.
text: Some people clear in front of him and he freezes. His dad

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Then he unzips his pants, kicks them off, folds them, and

speaker_heading: DYLAN

speaker_heading: MR. HARPER

speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. HARPER
dialog: My friends used to say the way Dede

dialog: electric. And I just let her go. I
dialog: was too proud to let her know how I
dialog: really felt.
text: Dylan takes this in.
speaker_heading: MR. HARPER

speaker_heading: DYLAN

dialog: that if we got together something
dialog: would mess that up. Like what

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: When did you start feeling this way?
dialog: When we started having sex?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Way before. When we became friends.
