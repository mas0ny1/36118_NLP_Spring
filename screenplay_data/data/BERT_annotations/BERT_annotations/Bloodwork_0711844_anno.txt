speaker_heading: BLOOD WORK
scene_heading: EXT. CRIME SCENE (SILVERLAKE) - NIGHT
text: A media and spectator circus. Two cocky LAPD detectives,
text: ARRANGO and WALTERS, watch as FBI profiler TERRY McCALEB
text: strides past the police barricades. Wearing a blue FBI
text: jacket, the hoary veteran ignores questions shouted out
text: by the press. The words "Code Killer" feature
dialog: prominently.
speaker_heading: ARRANGO
dialog: (disparaging)
dialog: McCaleb... Whatever happens, it’s
text: his face on the front page.
text: As McCaleb reaches Arrango:
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: What do you got?
speaker_heading: ARRANGO
dialog: Fucking hemorrhoids. What are you
dialog: gonna do about it?
text: Arrango’s itching for trouble. Walters is a cooler head.
speaker_heading: WALTERS
dialog: Victims five and six. The code
text: killer strikes again.
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT - ENTRY HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: A dingy, dark place. Police work lights can’t quite cut
text: the gloom. McCaleb stops at the door with Walters and
text: Arrango. The door is half off its hinges.
speaker_heading: WALTERS
dialog: Neighbor came over to complain
dialog: about the noise. Got run over at
text: the door. Didn’t see a thing.
speaker_heading: ARRANGO
dialog: We’re calling him Chuck Taylor.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: How’s that?
text: Arrango points out a series of bloody sneaker prints on
text: the floor. Headed for the door and away down the hall.
speaker_heading: ARRANGO
text: Converse hi-tops. Chuck Taylor.
dialog: Get it?
text: A look and McCaleb continues in past them.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Not for the faint of heart. There are several darkened
text: forms on the floor. Heavy, black plastic bags. An
text: investigative team works.
speaker_heading: WALTERS
dialog: We got the remains of two, maybe
dialog: even three people.
speaker_heading: ARRANGO
dialog: Gives new meaning to the term gang
dialog: bang.
text: Gruff, desensitized laughs from the cops. Walters
text: motions McCaleb to a wall. There, written in blood:
dialog: McCaleb, Catch me if you can. 903 472 568.
dialog: 
text: Arrango winks at his partner, then, to McCaleb:
speaker_heading: ARRANGO
dialog: Another love note. The two of you
dialog: should get a room some place.
text: As McCaleb stares grimly...
scene_heading: EXT. CRIME SCENE (DOWNTOWN) - NIGHT
text: McCaleb exits. The crowd has doubled. A NEWS CREW
text: bursts past the barricade. Police rush to block them,
text: but to no avail. They nearly ring McCaleb.
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: Was another message left for you,
dialog: Agent McCaleb!? -- Why do you
dialog: think the killer has picked
dialog: you?! -- What do the numbers
dialog: mean?!
text: McCaleb scans the sea of humanity before him. Not
text: exactly its best face. With a sigh, McCaleb starts to
text: make his way through, then stops short. Ahead:
scene_heading: FACE IN CROWD
text: Seen for an instant. Wearing a hooded sweatshirt and
text: low-billed cap. Staring at McCaleb, an odd look in his
dialog: eye.
text: BACK TO SCENE 6
text: A beat before McCaleb looks downward. THROUGH a thicket
text: of legs, we spot his feet. Covering them are bloody
text: Converse hi-tops. Chuck Taylor. McCaleb looks over, but
text: the cops seem suddenly so far away. Hi-Top begins to
dialog: drift back.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: (toward cops)
dialog: Hey... Hey! Over here!
text: Hi-Top turns and goes, suddenly swallowed up by the
dialog: crowd.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: (to no avail)
dialog: He’s over here!
text: No one listens. The Reporters continue to fire
text: questions. Hi-Top is getting away. McCaleb fights his
text: way through, charges down the street after him.
speaker_heading: STREET 7
text: Running now, his face unclear as high-top looks back over
text: his shoulder, sees that McCaleb is chasing him.
scene_heading: NARROW ALLEY 8
text: Hi-Top cuts down. McCaleb closes.
text: At the end of the alley, an eight feet redwood fence.
text: Hi-Top jumps, catches hold. As he pulls himself up,
text: McCaleb hits the fence right behind him.
text: The fence collapses. The two men sprawl to the ground.
text: Hi-Top gets up, scoots away. McCaleb rolls to his feet;
text: the chase is back on.
speaker_heading: BACK YARDS 9
text: One after the next. Fences are scaled, kicked through.
text: And McCaleb closes. All we hear are the FOOTFALLS, the
text: RAGGED BREATHS of the two men.
text: Then... a HEARTBEAT.
text: McCaleb reaches for Hi-Top’s shoulder, inches away now.
text: A chain link fence looms ahead. Hi-Top leaps onto it,
text: catches hold. As he pulls himself up, McCaleb is right
text: behind. He catches hold of one of Hi-Top’s legs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10
dialog: 11
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 9
text: Hi-Top grips the top of the fence, rears back with his
text: free leg and kicks McCaleb in the face. McCaleb drops.
text: Hi-Top is up and over, dropping to the other side. An
text: alley behind some businesses.
text: McCaleb gets to his feet, one of Hi-Top’s bloody sneakers
text: in his hands. He starts to climb the fence.
text: The HEARTBEAT INTENSIFIES. McCaleb pauses at the top of
text: the fence, slides back down the way he came. He clutches
text: at his left arm, a look of surprise on his face.
text: The heartbeat eclipses all else. McCaleb is having a
text: heart attack. He grips the fence to keep from falling.
speaker_heading: CHAIN LINK 10
text: Suddenly, through the pain, McCaleb is aware of a form in
text: the gloom. We don’t see his face, but, fascinated,
text: Hi-Top has come back to watch.
text: McCaleb reaches into his jacket, seemingly for his chest.
text: But when his hand comes back out, he’s holding his .38
text: service revolver. Blinking against near blinding pain,
text: he aims through the fence.
text: Hi-Top runs for the dark as ROUND AFTER ROUND EXPLODES.
text: The fourth sends him sprawling. The fifth and sixth sail
text: wide as Hi-Top stands and staggers into blackness.
speaker_heading: McCALEB 121
text: Suddenly illuminated by a spotlight. The revolver slips
text: from his hand as the pain overwhelms him. Bleached
text: white, he falls back into the dirt, his eyes wide.
text: As he stares up at a silent, hovering LAPD helicopter, he
text: mouths words we cannot understand. And as the HEARTBEAT
scene_heading: BECOMES an ELECTRONIC BLIP...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: MONITOR SCREEN 12
text: A grainy silver and black image of a heart: undulating

scene_heading: INT. CEDARS-SINAI HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 13

text: The voice belongs to DR. BONNIE FOX, the cardiologist who
text: guides the line through an incision in McCaleb’s neck.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: Coming out, Terry. You did good.
text: Removing the scope, she tapes a gauze compress to his
text: neck. As she unstraps the brace, McCaleb rubs his neck.
text: He looks less than formidable in his hospital johnny.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: Been taking your pills every day?
speaker_heading: McCALEB
text: All thirty-four of them.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: No fever at all?
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: No, I’m clean.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: And no diarrhea?
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: I’m clean of that, too.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: Good. Blood pressure and pulse?
speaker_heading: McCALEB
text: Right on target.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: And the boat? You’re not working

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: I’m keeping it afloat. That’s

speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: Don’t start running laps yet, but
dialog: I’m very pleased. No rejection,
dialog: all the levels look good. I might

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Good. I’m tired of shaving three
dialog: times a day.
text: Dr. Fox smiles, warms a stethoscope with her breath.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: Lean forward please.
text: He leans forward. She pulls down his johnny, listens to

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: Don’t talk.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Sit up.
text: She listens through his chest. For the first time we see
text: it, the thirteen-inch white scar running over his heart
text: like a rope. McCaleb half-grimaces at nothing in
text: particular. Finally, she’s done.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: How long has he been waiting?
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: About half as long as you did.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: What are his chances?
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
text: Maybe fifty-fifty. Maybe less.
dialog: What’s bothering you, Terry?
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: When I was with the bureau we had
dialog: to qualify on the range every
dialog: year. You know, shoot targets.
text: Circle around the heart scores
dialog: more than the head. It’s called
dialog: the ten ring. Highest score.
text: Dr. Fox smiles sympathetically. Familiar ground to her.
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: Typical. You hang around almost
dialog: two years waiting for a heart,
dialog: draw your string out and nearly
dialog: don’t make it and now you wonder
dialog: if we should’ve given it to you.
dialog: You know what that is?
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Bullshit?
speaker_heading: DR. FOX
dialog: Exactly. Go home and enjoy your

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Can I help you?

dialog: Look, before you start your story,
dialog: I have to tell you, you’re not the
dialog: first person to come out here and
dialog: find me.
dialog: (off no answer;
dialog: she looks sad)
dialog: I can recommend a good, private
dialog: investigator. Someone who’1ll work
dialog: hard and won’t rip you off.
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: The article said you were good.
dialog: It said you hated it whenever
dialog: somebody got away.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: If you read the article, then you
dialog: also know what happened to me.
dialog: I’m retired, Miss Rivers.
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: Graciella. I think you could help
dialog: me. Maybe help yourself, too.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: I don’t need the money.
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: I’m not talking about money.
dialog: Something weird about how she said it. Graciella reaches
text: into her purse, hands McCaleb a photo: a smiling woman
text: watching a boy blow out seven candles on a birthday cake.
text: The woman looks quite a bit like Graciella.
text: He looks at it, looks back at her.
speaker_heading: McCALEB

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Look, Miss Rivers, I just can’t do

dialog: you alone. Tell me if you feel
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: I was an F.B.I. agent, not a

speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: I have a double. You know, two
dialog: for the price of one. You’1l want
dialog: to keep that one.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Why would I want to do that?
text: Graciella reaches out her hand. Past the photo McCaleb
text: still holds out. She places the palm of her hand on his

speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: Your heart. It was my sister’s.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: My phone number’s on the back if

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: The shooter’s been in the store
dialog: before. He knew where the camera

dialog: neighborhood or he cased the
dialog: place. Plus this wasn’t the first
dialog: time. No hesitation, no panic, he

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: This surveillance camera is 3

speaker_heading: JAYE

speaker_heading: CALLER (V.O.)

speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Sir? Please stay on the line.
dialog: Sir?
text: Graciella hangs her head.
text: McCaleb ejects the tape. He reviews the 9-1-1 report,
text: circles the time the call came in: 10:40:58 p.m. He
text: writes it down on a pad of paper...
speaker_heading: McCALEB
text: 10:40:58. 9-1-1 call.
dialog: (to Jaye)
dialog: Give me the camera.
text: She hands him a handheld video camera with the flip-open
text: LCD screens. The tape is from the market camera.
text: It’s the Gloria Torres murder for the umpteenth time.
text: The gun goes to her head. McCaleb freezes it just as
text: she’s shot. His finger stabs down on the security camera
text: time readout: 10:41:37. He writes down under the first
dialog: time...
speaker_heading: McCALEB
text: 10:41:37 -- Gloria Torres shot.
text: McCaleb fast-forwards and freezes where the good
text: samaritan enters.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
text: 10:42:55 p.m. Good samaritan.
text: McCaleb pounds his fist into his palm. Once, twice,

dialog: just one problem.
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JAYE
text: The clock on the surveillance
text: camera is only three seconds off
text: the 9-1-1 clock. He made the call
dialog: before your sister got shot.
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
text: But that doesn’t make any sense.
text: McCaleb doesn’t answer. Neither does Jaye. Finally...
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: Wait a minute. The caller -- it’s
dialog: the same guy.
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: He called the ambulance before he
dialog: shot her.
text: McCaleb stares at the frozen good Samaritan.
dialog: The image,
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Cordell died and his organs were
dialog: no good. The next time the
dialog: shooter wanted to make sure. So
dialog: he got the ambulance started on
dialog: the way. Then he shot Gloria,
dialog: then he came back inside to
dialog: bandage her. To keep her alive.
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: Oh, my God...
speaker_heading: JAYE
dialog: Could this good Samaritan be the
dialog: guy you saw at the bank? At the
dialog: A.T.M. machine?
dialog: as it always has been, is very grainy and we

dialog: A.T.M. tape?
speaker_heading: JAYE
dialog: No. You only asked for this one.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Maybe the shooter did the same
dialog: thing at the A.T.M. He calls an
dialog: ambulance, but they get the
dialog: address wrong. Could this guy be
dialog: Lockeridge?
text: Jaye studies the screen.
speaker_heading: JAYE
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Whoever got the list of organ
dialog: donors had to hack into the BOPRA

speaker_heading: JAYE

scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT 92

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: It all depends on you now. Pull

speaker_heading: McCALEB

speaker_heading: McCALEB

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Kill me and no one will find them.
text: They die alone in a black hole and
dialog: that’s on you... You know me. You
dialog: know I have them.
text: A beat. McCaleb sets back the hammer, lowers the gun.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (standing)
dialog: I want you to live. I want me to
dialog: live. I want it all to start
dialog: again. The battle between good
dialog: and evil. Can’t you see I’ve been
dialog: watching over you? Taking care of
dialog: you? We were meant to be, Terry.
text: Buddy pockets the harmonica and picks up his car keys.
text: McCaleb doesn’t know what to do.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I have to leave now. And you
dialog: won’t follow. You’1l stay by the
dialog: pay phone and I’11 call you from
dialog: time to time. When I’m relocated
dialog: and ready, I’11 let Graciella and
dialog: Raymond go. Then you and me start
dialog: again.
text: Buddy smiles sadly at McCaleb.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I hope you think of me as often as
dialog: I’1l1 think of you.
text: Buddy turns, starts to go. McCaleb watches a beat.
text: Then, without warning, he raises the .38 and FIRES.
text: Buddy goes down in a heap, half inside, and half out. He
text: twists a look up as McCaleb looms.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You’re crazy!
text: Buddy’s been shot through the lower left bicep. He looks

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Show me where they are.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I gotta get to the hospital!
text: Slam! McCaleb flings Buddy against the galley stove.
text: McCaleb fishes the belt off Buddy’s jeans. Looping it,
text: he cinches it high up Buddy’s left arm, just below grabs
text: the armpit. He pulls it taut, gives Buddy the end to
dialog: hold.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: That’1l pinch off the artery. You
dialog: keep the pressure there, you won’t
dialog: bleed to death.
text: McCaleb releases him.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Now. Show me.
text: Buddy looks down at his shattered arm. The bleeding has

text: McCaleb doesn’t answer. After a beat...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You don’t look so good, Terry.
text: McCaleb offers Buddy a grim smile.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Neither do you, Buddy.
text: Looking ahead, McCaleb spots something. He raises a pair

speaker_heading: BINOCULAR POV 116
text: Bobbing in the water -- a can buoy.
speaker_heading: BRIDGE 117
text: Buddy watches McCaleb, but the binoculars come down too

dialog: the buoy.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Do you really think you have a
dialog: chance?
text: McCaleb looks over, but doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I mean, with her. Do you really
dialog: think she could love you? Her
dialog: sister died for you, Terry.
dialog: That’s gonna be a tough one for

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Scratch your nose and I’11 shoot
dialog: it off.
text: MOVE WITH McCaleb as he moves down the ladder to the deck
text: rail. Using a gaff hook he latches onto the buoy, ties
text: off to it with a deck line.
text: There’s a padlocked hatch on the can. McCaleb gives the
text: lock a tug, BANGS on the CAN with the MUZZLE of the .38.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Graciella! Raymond!
text: A horrible beat goes by. Then a MUFFLED BANG and a faint
dialog: response.
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA (V.0O.)
dialog: McCaleb!
text: McCaleb looks back to the bridge at Buddy.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: (re: padlock)
dialog: Key.
text: Buddy reaches into his pocket, pulls out his keyring.
text: Before McCaleb can move, Buddy tosses them.
text: They seem like they’re going overboard when --
text: -- McCaleb catches them.
text: He gives a look that could kill, then starts at the LOCK.
text: One, two, and then the third KEY... CLICK.
text: McCaleb pulls off the lock, throws back the hatch.
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Graciella!
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA (V.0O.)

speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Stay here.
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: McCALEB
dialog: Buddy’s on the boat. Stay here.
text: McCaleb looks at her a beat, then unties the line. He

text: As he turns to survey his boat...
speaker_heading: GRACIELLA
dialog: McCaleb? McCaleb.

scene_heading: INT. THE FOLLOWING SEA - SALON - DAY 123
text: No sign of Buddy. McCaleb leans back to see behind the

text: Leading with the .38, McCaleb continues.
scene_heading: INT. GANGWAY - DAY 124

speaker_heading: LOCKER DOOR 127

scene_heading: INT. GANGWAY - DAY 129

scene_heading: INT. CABIN - DAY 130
text: McCaleb gets to his feet, tries the door, then slams up

text: McCaleb stops to catch his breath, his heart pounding.
text: Then, almost as if he senses it, he looks up.
scene_heading: McCALEB’S POV - HATCH 131
text: A small ventilation hatch. Buddy stands over it on deck,
text: looking down at McCaleb, the end of the belt/tourniquet
text: held between his smiling teeth.
text: He dives OUT OF SIGHT as...
speaker_heading: McCALEB 132
text: FIRES! McCaleb then listens a beat. It’s quiet except
text: for the LOW THROTTLE of the DIESEL.
text: Suddenly, the ENGINE REVS UP and McCaleb almost falls as
text: the boat lurches forward. Buddy’s moving the boat.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (V.O.)
dialog: You make me sad, Terry! You make

dialog: And?
speaker_heading: JAYE
dialog: I thought I’d pick your brain.

speaker_heading: McCALEB
