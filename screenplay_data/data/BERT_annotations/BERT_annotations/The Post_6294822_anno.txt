scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM, DUPONT CLUB - MORNING
text: It’s breakfast, there’s a soft hum of conversation. The glass
text: windows on one side show off the D.C. skyline. BEN BRADLEE
text: (late 40s, articulate but short-tempered) sits with his back
text: against the view. He has a red pencil in hand and reads the
dialog: draft of a story: “Senate Told Nixon Aid to Laos Illegal”.
dialog: Chryon: June 9, 1971
text: Bradlee rubs his eyes and looks around the room. There are
text: MEN scattered amongst the tables reading newspapers. Bradlee
text: squints to get a better look - every paper is “The New York
text: Times”. He frowns and looks back at the story - bored.
speaker_heading: KAY (0.S.)
dialog: Am I late?
text: KATHARINE “KAY” GRAHAM (mid 50s) speaks with trained intent -
dialog: never letting something slip that she hasn’t considered many
text: times over. She’s well put together but not ostentatious.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Mrs. Graham.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I thought we said 8:30.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yes, I was just catching up on a
dialog: few things.
text: She nods once and sits. A WAITER arrives.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (to Kay)
dialog: May I get you anything?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: A cup of tea, please.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Mr. Bradlee?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Thanks, but another cup and I’1l be
text: flying to the office.
text: Neither Kay nor the waiter get it. The waiter leaves.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Is there something you wanted to
dialog: talk about?
text: He reaches into his bag and pulls out a magazine, folded to a
text: certain page, and shows it to her.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Have you seen this?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Of course.
text: She doesn’t take it as he intended, so now it hangs limply
text: between them. He reads -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: “Men are more able than women at
dialog: executive work and in certain
dialog: situations. I think a man would be
dialog: better at this job I’m in than a
dialog: woman.” Did you say that?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It’s an interview with me.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: But do you believe it?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Do you not?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: It doesn’t particularly matter what
dialog: I believe - I’m not the Publisher
dialog: of the Washington Post.
text: She gives a noncommittal acknowledgment. A moment passes.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Well, I’m in a tough position with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: How am I supposed to put a paper
dialog: together with someone who doesn’t
dialog: think they should be in charge?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I didn’t say that.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It was implied.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Forgive me, but I disagree.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Forgive me, but that doesn’t
dialog: particularly matter. I’m pretty
dialog: sure the consensus is in my corner.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: There are corners?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: That’s not what I meant.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Playground fights aren’t going to
dialog: get us anywhere, Mr. Bradlee.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: That’s why we’re in a restaurant,
dialog: not a sandbox.
text: She presses her lips together - a nervous tic she’s never
text: been able to shake. Maybe to stop her from saying something
dialog: she shouldn’t.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: We've been getting mail - letters -
dialog: from women. Asking you to correct
dialog: your quote.
text: She’s taken aback but covers.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That’s ridiculous.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m not so sure that it is.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Well, that won’t be happening.
text: He sighs, a moment passes.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m not trying to be combative.
dialog: I... we’re still new at this.
text: She gives him a look.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: The two of us. Working together. As
dialog: editor and, look, I don’t see a
dialog: point in letting things fester.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Good. I -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I'd like you to tell me what you’re
dialog: doing with the Style section.
text: The term “style” comes out as if it has vinegar attached to
text: it. He crosses his arms and sits back in the chair - annoyed.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Is there more than one?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: We're figuring it out.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It’s been a year.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It’s going to take another.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: We can not keep wasting time on a
dialog: section that discusses... what is
dialog: it again?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Fashion, lifestyle, you know -
text: She doesn’t.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: My wife likes it.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I’m happy for her.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: We can’t drop the “Style” section.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Because The Times is starting to
dialog: print their own.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Good for them.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: If they run with it and it’s a hit,
dialog: how’s that going to look?
text: She purses her lips again; he’s exasperated. She pulls a
text: piece of paper from her purse.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I’ve got a quote here, too.
dialog: (she reluctantly reads)
dialog: “Ben Bradlee needs a managing
dialog: editor like a boar needs tits.”
text: He lets out a laugh, a man nearby gives her a look.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know who sent this to me?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: How many guesses do I get?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Gene Patterson.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Would’ve needed three.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: He'll be stepping down at the end
dialog: of the year.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What’s he waiting for?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I asked him to stay.
text: He gives her a look, clearly annoyed.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You ask for my support, I hire you
dialog: support, then you terrorize them.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Or maybe he just wanted to see if
dialog: you'd say “tits”?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That’s beside the point.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: We’re dancing around that aren’t
dialog: we.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I didn’t terrorize Gene.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: He’s your managing editor.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Was.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: He said you’re not receptive to his
dialog: ideas.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: That’s not how I’d put it.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: How am I supposed to trust The Post
dialog: is doing what it should if you
dialog: change your mind at every turn?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m not changing my mind about
dialog: Style.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You changed your mind about Gene.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No, I never wanted Gene. I was
dialog: clear about that.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: I’m trying to work with you, Mr.
dialog: Bradlee.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No, Mrs. Graham, you’re not. Gene’s
dialog: right - I don’t need a managing
dialog: editor. I need a publisher, you,
dialog: who is willing to back me, my
dialog: editors, and my writers.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: How do I not?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (shaking the magazine)
dialog: By saying idiotic things like this!
text: The people around them sneak a peek once more. This isn’t the
text: first time Kay’s been scolded, but probably the only time
text: it’s happened from outside her family. Bradlee knows he went
text: too far but he’s too stubborn to apologize.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Forgive me, but I don’t know what
dialog: you want me to say.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: In the event of that, just say
dialog: nothing.
text: They sit quietly. The waiter arrives with her tea.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Ready to order?
dialog: This is going to be a long breakfast.
scene_heading: BEGIN OPENING CREDITS
scene_heading: EXT. DUPONT CLUB - A LITTLE LATER
text: Bradlee steps onto the street, the bustle of pedestrians and
text: commuters on their way to work. He begins his journey through
dialog: the maze of D.C.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, DUPONT CLUB - SAME TIME
text: Kay climbs into the back of a chauffeured car. Simply, this
dialog: is something she’s always done.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: The car pulls out into the city and heads in the direction of
text: The Post offices. Sitting on the seat next to Kay is the
text: magazine. It’s her own copy. She’s on the cover - regal, but
text: sad. The title, “One-on-One with the Queen of the Beltway”.
text: She frowns.
scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS, WASHINGTON, D.C. - SAME TIME
text: Bradlee edges his way around a small Vietnam protest walking
text: towards the White House, which can be seen off in the
dialog: distance.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - SAME TIME
text: Kay reads the article. It’s clear she’s read it many times
dialog: and is perhaps more insecure about what she said than she let
text: on. The car pulls into another underground garage and stops.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME
text: Bradlee walks in, his shirt damp from the humidity and walk.
text: He throws his copy of the magazine into a nearby trash can
text: and climbs onto an elevator.
scene_heading: INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR, WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME
text: The elevator doors open, Kay’s posture straightens, jaw
text: tightens, she steps off. The energy is tense, stiff, quiet.
text: Along the wall are two portraits: EUGENE MEYER (1875-1959),
text: Kay’s father, and PHIL GRAHAM (1915-1963), Kay’s late
text: husband. They watch over her as she passes to her office at
text: the end of the hall.
scene_heading: END OPENING CREDITS
scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN, WASHINGTON POST - MORNING
text: Bradlee steps off a different elevator and looks across the
text: bullpen: a constant soundtrack of typewriters, the din of the
text: news on a TV set, random conversations that come in spurts
text: and starts. He smiles to himself - this is home. The serenity
dialog: lasts for just one moment when -
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: I want to ask them about the vets
dialog: again.
text: MEG GREENFIELD (40s, no-nonsense) instantly annoys him. He
text: doesn’t stop walking.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MEG
text: They’re throwing their medals into
dialog: the Potomac and we’re OK with the
dialog: White House’s “no comment”?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I need you to write something about
dialog: the protest.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The United-Women’s-whatever-they’ re-
dialog: called. Go and... I don’t know.
dialog: Just get them to not hate us right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: I take it Mrs. Graham won’t be
dialog: retracting -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Go away.
text: She grins and heads off as Bradlee approaches his office,
text: handing his briefcase to his secretary, CYNTHIA. BEN
text: BAGDIKIAN (50s, Turkish, resolute) is waiting for him.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Cynthia, annoyed)
dialog: I thought you told them not to
dialog: hover?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: They don’t listen.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: This is going to annoy me, isn’t
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Have you seen Sheehan around?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Neil? Have we started letting the
dialog: Times just take up office space
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: He hasn’t been at the briefings in
dialog: a while.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What’s a while?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Weeks.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Weeks?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Yea.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No, I haven’t seen him.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: OK.
text: Bagdikian walks off abruptly, as he customarily does.
text: Something about this sticks in Bradlee’s craw.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Get someone to find out what
dialog: Sheehan’s been up to.
text: Cynthia nods. He heads off down the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. GENE’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - MOMENTS LATER
text: GENE PATTERSON (late 40s, thinning hairline) reads over some
text: pages. There’s a knock on the door, Bradlee stands there.
text: Gene sighs and sits back in his chair. Bradlee enters.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Did you do it so she’d say tit?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Just an added bonus.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I can’t say that I’m all that
dialog: disappointed.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Nothing but honest.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It’s not like either of us get
dialog: anything out of the other being
dialog: miserable.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You're right on that.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Are you miserable?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: It’s been... difficult.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m the “it” in that sentence?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Yes.
text: Bradlee thinks about that and nods.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Mrs. Graham said you’1l be staying
dialog: on for a couple of months.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: She asked me to.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: If you don’t want to, I'll -
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: No, I’d like to see things get
dialog: sorted properly.
text: Bradlee nods and extends his hand across the desk.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: A shame it didn’t work out - I hope
dialog: you know I respect you.
text: Gene rises and accepts the handshake.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I didn’t, so thank you.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM, WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME
text: TEN MEN sit around a large oval table. At the head is
text: FREDERICK “FRITZ” BEEBE (late 60s, Chairman of the Board,
dialog: proper and kind) with PAUL IGNATIUS (50s, President of the
text: Washington Post, Co., stuck up) to his right.
text: On his left is Kay - she’s tense in this setting. Her hands
text: rest properly on a bound document in front of her. It reads
scene_heading: “THE WASHINGTON POST COMPANY INITIAL IPO PROSPECTUS”.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: As you can see, our underwriters
dialog: have proposed an IPO for a little
dialog: over 1.35 Million shares of Class B
dialog: stock. All of the Class A stock
dialog: will stay within the Meyer-Graham
dialog: family and they will continue to
dialog: have the majority vote and right to
dialog: elect 70 percent of the directors.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: FRITZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Class B stockholders will elect the
dialog: remainder.
text: There are some murmurs of acknowledgment, a few nods.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Well, I think that’s where my
dialog: problem is, Fritz.
text: Fritz sighs, he and Ignatius clearly aren’t compatible. Kay’s
text: face tightens.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: The majority vote to elect the
dialog: majority of directors? That
dialog: feels... one sided to say the
dialog: least.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Do you have another suggestion?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: I just think that perhaps there
dialog: should be more of a balance. As
dialog: President, it seems like my voice
dialog: should be heard, no?
text: The tenor of the room becomes tense, Ignatius keeps a
text: watchful eye on Kay. MARVIN (60s), a boardmember.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I see where he’s coming from,
dialog: Fritz. We were elected to the board
dialog: in order -
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: You were elected by the Graham
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Well. I -
text: Marvin shifts in his seat, uncomfortable, eyeing Kay.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It’s alright, Marvin. Go on.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: Respectfully, Mrs. Graham, I was
dialog: elected to this seat by your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MARVIN (CONT'D)
dialog: And - I - well, I feela
dialog: responsibility to keep the company
dialog: going in the direction he had hoped
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: And you feel that I’m not doing
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: BOARDMEMBER #2
dialog: It’s not that necessarily -
text: Kay is surprised by the second opinion.
speaker_heading: BOARDMEMBER #2 (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s just. Well. Your appointment
dialog: happened by... unfortunate
dialog: circumstances. Because of your
dialog: husband's, well, because of Phil’s
dialog: accident. And there’s a standard
dialog: that The Post - there’s a standard
dialog: we're used to meeting.
text: Kay purses her lips. Ignatius clears his throat -
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: It’s about the numbers, Mrs.
dialog: Graham. The revenue from the Post
dialog: is down by 1% so far this quarter.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: It’s only June.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: And there have been quite a lot of
dialog: attacks against the President.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Not just by us.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: I understand the President even
dialog: cancelled his subscription to the
dialog: Post.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: That was years ago.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: You called him Caligula for
dialog: Christ’s sake.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I did?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Your editor.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That’s not me.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Maybe that’s the problem.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: That I’m not the editor?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: That you don’t have control of him.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (heated)
dialog: What does this have to do with our
dialog: stock offer?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: It’s more so with the suggested
dialog: reorganization -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: This company has been owned and
dialog: operated by my family for 40 years.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Perhaps that’s what needs to
dialog: change.
text: Kay is stunned, as are a number of people in the room.
text: Ignatius keeps his eyes on hers.
scene_heading: INT. KAY'S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - A LITTLE LATER
text: Kay slams the proposal onto her desk, furious. Her office is
text: tasteful, mid-century modern with personal touches
text: throughout: photos of her children, etc. Fritz walks in and
text: closes the door behind him.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Phil always hated them.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: That was a long list.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You seem very relaxed about all of
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: I don’t know if relaxed is the term
dialog: I'd use but, yes, I think you’re
text: preoccupied with the negative.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Is there something I’m missing?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: (calm)
dialog: The IPO has been approved. With
dialog: your shares, the estate’s shares...
dialog: it’s a good day.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I hate money.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: That’s because you’ve always had
dialog: it.
text: She gives him a sharp look, but he’s not wrong.
speaker_heading: FRITZ (CONT'D)
dialog: This is what the paper needs to
dialog: keep going. You know that.
text: She nods. Her face softens, the mask of confidence beginning
text: to drip away. A moment passes.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: None of them came to my defense.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: That’s not their style.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Do you think I’m letting them run
dialog: wild?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Downstairs?
text: She nods, he shrugs.
speaker_heading: FRITZ (CONT'D)
dialog: I never got involved in Post
dialog: business. Phil hated it.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It just seemed... easier for him.
dialog: He could talk to them.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Well, Phil... He loved having the
dialog: ink stains and all that. Fighting
dialog: it out. Your father... Eugene liked
dialog: to be a part but not a player.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Which worked best?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: There were issues with both - the
dialog: public thought Phil was too
dialog: involved. Even you've said that.
dialog: Maybe your father not enough. But
dialog: both of them understood the
dialog: difficulties of the post. You have
dialog: to be able to command the board and
dialog: the bullpen.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: And neither had to fend with Ben
dialog: Bradlee in charge.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I thought they would respond to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: The staff. The public.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: I think they do. Do you?
text: She’s not sure. Kay’s secretary, LIZ HYLTON (30s),
text: Fritz rises to leave.
text: Kay nods.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Did they really call Nixon
dialog: Caligula?
text: He shakes his head, waving as he leaves.
dialog: 16.
text: enters.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Your daughter called and said
dialog: she'll meet you at the symphony
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Thank you, Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: And Mr. McNamara called.
text: Kay gives her a look.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME
text: It’s a very different looking room than where the Board
text: meets. Bradlee is alone and sits with his feet up on the
text: table, reading through some reports. HOWARD SIMONS (early
text: 40s, stubborn, Bradlee’s right-hand man) comes in.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Are these meetings attendance
dialog: optional now?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
text: They’re scrambling.
text: Howard sits next to Bradlee, eyeing him. After a moment.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: How'd that go?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: With Gene.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It’s Friday, Howard, let’s wait
text: until the blood dries before
dialog: getting into it.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You're going to talk to me though
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m not sure, if no one else shows
dialog: up in the next five minutes you all
dialog: might be fired anyway.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Phil’s going to come in here and
dialog: tell you we don’t have anyone
text: covering Tricia Nixon’s wedding.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: My heart breaks - which Phil?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Geyelin. How many Phils we got?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Why don’t we have anyone covering
dialog: the wedding?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: The White House won’t let us.
text: Bradlee stares at him.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Ziegler called and said Haldeman
dialog: and Nixon didn’t appreciate the
dialog: coverage from the last event so
dialog: they’re revoking our press
dialog: privileges for this one.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Who was supposed to be there?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Judy.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Devastated, I’m sure.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: She’s been calling for Ziegler all
text: day but he won’t return.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
text: It’s only 11 am.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: So when'd she start calling?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You know what I mean.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I do and I can’t believe that the
dialog: most important conversation I’m
dialog: having with my associate editor is
dialog: whether Nixon’s daughter’s wedding
dialog: is going to make the paper this
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What do you want -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I want coverage of the goddamn
dialog: wedding!
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: How was breakfast?
text: Through the glass Bradlee can see Meg, Bagdikian, and a few
text: other EDITORS approaching.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Later.
text: Howard nods.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Well - thank you all for joining
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: MEG BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Sorry, Ben. Sorry.
text: Gene enters with PHIL GEYELIN (40s, balding) and TWO OTHER
text: EDITORS, he closes the door behind them. They all sit.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: Ben, we’ve got a problem with
dialog: Tricia -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Someone talk to me about anything
dialog: else first. Meg.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: Ben -
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: The Grand Jury is issuing more
text: subpoenas on the Capitol bombing.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Who are they subpoenaing?
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: (checking notes)
dialog: A couple - white collar, middle
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: OK. Bags, anything from Paris?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: North Vietnamese said they want the
dialog: US to stop sending aid. The US said
dialog: no.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: So you'd categorize that as a
dialog: productive conversation.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh yes, absolutely.
speaker_heading: EDITOR #1
dialog: (reading notes)
dialog: The FBI cleared it’s own funds in
dialog: congress yesterday.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Are they allowed to do that?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: They’re the FBI.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (to Geyelin)
dialog: See if you can get some other
dialog: papers to share their notes and
dialog: we'll get our story from that.
speaker_heading: EDITOR #1
dialog: (confused)
dialog: About the FBI?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No. Why, you think the FBI wants to
dialog: know what Tricia Nixon’s wearing at
dialog: her wedding?
speaker_heading: EDITOR #1
dialog: No -
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Hoover does.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: I think he means me.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I think we should ignore it.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: The wedding. They’re ignoring us,
dialog: we might as well ignore them.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I don’t know if poking the bear is
dialog: the best move right now.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Would we call Nixon a bear?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: He’s more like a little... eh...
dialog: what do you call them...
text: He scrunches his nose and puts his hands to his face.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: A weasel?
text: Bagdikian snaps his fingers and points -
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Didn’t Herblock make him up like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What’re you thinking, Ben?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m thinking the reason The Times
dialog: has a one up on us is because they
dialog: don’t fuck around calling Nixon a
dialog: weasel.
text: Everyone quiets down. Cynthia walks in and hands Bradlee a
text: note, he reads.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: I heard some Times boys going
dialog: around talking about printing
dialog: something that would “end the war.”
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: There were one too many pronouns in
dialog: that sentence for me to care.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: They say that every other week.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: This about Sheehan?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Nobody’s seen him in the press room
dialog: in awhile.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: That doesn’t mean anything, that
dialog: could just be Neil being Neil.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: You OK, Ben?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Mrs. Graham wanted me to know that
dialog: she just received a call from the
dialog: former Secretary of Defense letting
dialog: her know that The Times will be
dialog: publishing something “damning”
dialog: about him this Sunday.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: What?
text: Bradlee shows Gene the slip.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: (hushed to Bagdikian)
dialog: How’s she know McNamara?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: She and Phil Graham used to be
text: friends with him and his wife
dialog: before Phil -
dialog: 23.
text: He puts his hand to his temple as if he’s holding a gun and
text: pulls the trigger. Meg makes a face.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: It’s gotta be about Vietnam.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Maybe about them pulling out?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: That doesn’t feel like a scoop.
dialog: (to Bagdikian)
dialog: Could it be that report?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What report?
text: Bagdikian rolls his eyes -
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: There was a rumor a couple years
dialog: back that some guys were hired by
dialog: the White House to do a study on
dialog: Vietnam.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: What kind of study?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: We couldn’t even confirm that the
dialog: thing existed.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (to Bagdikian)
dialog: You talk to Rand?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
text: A couple times. Nothing there.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (tired)
dialog: Make some calls and see if this
dialog: “study” has anything to do with -
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: It doesn’t exist, Ben -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Just do it! I’m tired of being ten
dialog: minutes late to the party! When we
dialog: meet back in a couple of hours
dialog: let’s fill in all those “someones”
text: and “somethings” with a few more
dialog: fucking details.
dialog: 24.
text: He leaves, Gene and Howard exchange a glance.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, WASHINGTON POST - MOMENTS LATER
text: Bradlee walks toward his office and sees MICHAEL (20s, clean-
text: cut) waiting outside. He doesn’t stop walking.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You the runner?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes. Yes, sir. Michael.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: In. Let’s go.
scene_heading: INT. BRADLEE’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - CONTINUOUS
text: Michael follows behind him, he hastily tucks his shirt into
text: his pants. Bradlee gives him a look -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What’re you - you tuck your shirt
dialog: in while walking into the office?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You looked into Sheehan?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: He hands Bradlee a slip of paper. Bradlee looks at it.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What’s this.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Um, that’s all Mr. Sheehan has
dialog: written sir. In the last three
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Are you sure?
text: Michael nods. Bradlee stares at the boy, lost in thought.
text: Michael shifts in his shoes, uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: One article in three months.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Is that... bad?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: It’s not good.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM, CONSTITUTION HALL - NIGHT
text: Beethoven's “Symphony No. 4” is played by the NATIONAL
text: SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. In a box, Kay watches in her finest next
text: to her daughter, LALLY (30s). The D.C. elite are packed in by
text: the thousand; tuxes and studious looks on.
text: While Kay watches the players, others sneak a glance at her:
dialog: the daughter; matriarch; widow; publisher. The attention
text: doesn’t phase Kay - she’s had it all her life. She looks up
text: at the Presidential Box. It’s empty.
text: The Symphony finishes, the quiet settles and the crowd lifts
text: into a roaring applause. Kay snaps out of her stare and
text: politely claps as the Symphony takes a bow.
scene_heading: INT. O’BYRNE GALLERY, CONSTITUTION HALL - LATER
text: Champagne glasses clink, the CONDUCTOR smiles for the cameras
text: as he is celebrated by a few PARTYGOERS. He laughs, enjoying
text: the praise. He is being watched from outside by -
scene_heading: EXT. PORTICO, CONSTITUTION HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Kay. She holds an untouched glass of champagne, encircled by
text: a group of people. As if they’re both protecting her and
text: trapping her from getting away. She can’t tear her eyes from
text: the conductor. His seeming joie de vivré.
speaker_heading: ALSOP (0.S.)
dialog: Kay?
text: She snaps out of it and looks to her friend, JOE ALSOP (60s,
text: journalist, effeminate), who stares at her.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: (light)
dialog: Now it’s not just my wife, but my
dialog: closest friends who ignore me.
dialog: 26.
text: The friends around them laugh, Kay quickly pulls her face
text: back on. With them are ARCHIE, PAUL, Lally. Lally is sociable
text: but doesn’t possess her mother’s innate ability to make
text: everyone she’s speaking to feel important.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Joe - I could never. I was just so
dialog: intoxicated by your story I lost
dialog: myself for a moment.
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: This woman - always with the witty
text: save in her back pocket.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I keep mine in my purse.
text: Laughs abound from the group, they’re smitten by her.
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: I was just saying how sad it will
dialog: be to not have the Symphony perform
dialog: here anymore.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Have you seen the new pavilion?
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: Only in passing. It’ll have quite
dialog: the view.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: This one isn’t terrible.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Have you heard what they’re calling
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Nixon can’t be happy.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Is he ever?
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Touché.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I was thinking about him tonight.
dialog: 27.
text: They turn to her, she surprised even herself by saying that
text: out loud.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nixon?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: No. Kennedy. Phil and I - we - used
dialog: to see him in that box often. I was
dialog: just thinking of how empty it’s
dialog: been since he’s been gone.
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Not a lot of love for the arts with
dialog: this White House.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: I don’t know if that’s true.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: (to Lally)
dialog: Oh, we miss your feistiness around
dialog: here! Kay, tell your daughter she
dialog: must move back here immediately.
text: Kay smiles and forces a laugh - she’s not going to say that.
dialog: It’s too personal. Lally knows this, she covers.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: But if I come back more often the
dialog: luster will be lost and you’11l
dialog: realize I’m only my best in short
dialog: stints of time.
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: That’s what they say about me!
text: The group laughs, Kay looks back to the conductor but, to her
text: disappointment, he’s moved on.
scene_heading: EXT. WARSH HOUSE, GEORGETOWN - SAME TIME
text: In a very different part of town, Bradlee rings the doorbell
text: of a simple home with music coming from within. Standing next
text: to him is his wife, TONY (40s, beautiful but tired). His suit
text: is rumpled. It’s tense.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What's this for?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: This party -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It’s for Warsh.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I assumed - but what for?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I don’t know - he got an award or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You don’t know?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I forgot.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You forgot.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Tony, it’s been a long day.
text: He goes to ring the bell again -
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Don’t. They heard it.
text: He stops. Annoyed.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Marina got a B on her History exam.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (absentmindedly )
dialog: That’s great.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: She was hoping to show you tonight.
dialog: They’ve had this fight before.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I promised Warsh we'd be here.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: For a reason you’re not sure of.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I know the reason I just -
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Forgot.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Can we just get through this and
dialog: save the banter for home? You know
dialog: I can’t sleep without the ringing
dialog: in my ears.
text: The door opens and CHARLOTTE MARCH (40s) answers.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: If it isn’t my favorite duo.
text: Bradlee forces a smile, as does Tony.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE, WARSH HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The room is filled with around 20 PEOPLE milling about.
text: Bradlee heads to a corner where a BARTENDER is making drinks
text: and Howard is drinking them.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You save some for me?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Never.
dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: Two.
dialog: (to Bradlee)
dialog: You stag?
text: Bradlee gestures towards Tony speaking to another wife. She
dialog: couldn’t be less interested.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: She was in a good mood. Once.
text: Howard laughs, Bradlee gets his drink then sees something at
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT'D)
text: Nixon Cheer Squad has arrived.
text: Howard looks as KEN (40s, lanky and balding) enters with his
text: wife. Bradlee watches, unreadable.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Who’s that?
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Lawyer. Works for the party. Had
dialog: lunch with him a couple weeks back.
dialog: Spent the entire time talking about
dialog: Nixon’s new “drug war”.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: When’d guys like that start keeping
dialog: the secrets?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It’s always guys like that. Some of
dialog: them just dress better than others.
scene_heading: EXT. PORTICO, CONSTITUTION HALL - LATER
text: Kay’s thoughts are elsewhere but she plays the part.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: But they haven’t invited any women.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: So the women have decided to
dialog: boycott?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That seems extreme.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Does it?
text: Kay glances at her contradictory daughter.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
text: The Gridiron’s White Tie.
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: What’s so wrong with inviting the
dialog: women in?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Darling, they’re terrified we'll
dialog: spill all of your secrets.
text: Archie and Paul laugh.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: If they invited you - you would go,
dialog: wouldn’t you?
dialog: 31.
text: Kay is taken aback by the question.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (icy)
dialog: I’m not sure I’d look very good in
text: a tuxedo.
text: Charming, but cutting. Lally is disappointed by the answer.
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: Let’s try it at least!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What would your father say?
text: Kay's eyes shoot to Paul, the tension is immediate.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Your father - what would he say if
dialog: women were allowed?
text: Kay watches him for a moment, her stare impenetrable.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I certainly didn’t speak for him
dialog: when he was alive so I don’t see a
dialog: point in breaking the habit now
text: that he’s dead.
text: Paul realizes his misstep, Kay won’t let him back down.
dialog: Luckily -
speaker_heading: SCOTTY (0.S.)
dialog: Kay?
text: Kay turns to see SCOTTY RESTON (60s, white-templed) standing
text: there, a warm smile on his face. The tension broken, Paul
text: heaves a deep sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Scotty.
text: He kisses her on the cheek. Lally gives him a hug, clearly
dialog: they all know each other.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Joe, you know Scotty Reston.
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 32.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Isn't this crossing enemy lines?
dialog: The Times and Post on the same
dialog: terrain?
speaker_heading: ALSOP
dialog: Ignore my friends - they live for
dialog: drama.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Don’t we all.
dialog: (to Kay)
dialog: Can I borrow you for a moment?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Of course.
text: He takes her elbow and gently leads her away from the party.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you alright? Is Sally?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Yes, yes - nothing like that.
text: He shoves his hands in his pockets. Clearly nervous.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY (CONT’D)
dialog: I wasn’t sure if I - I think I
dialog: should've told you earlier but,
dialog: well, I hope you understand why I
dialog: didn’t. I wasn’t sure we were going
dialog: to print until this morning. The
dialog: lawyers -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Does this have something to do with
dialog: the call I got from Bob?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: McNamara? What'd he say?
scene_heading: INT. WARSH HOUSE, GEORGETOWN - SAME TIME
text: Howard and Bradlee accept another round from the bartender.
text: Bradlee looks at his drink, spinning it absentmindedly.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Everything OK with you? You were
dialog: pretty on today.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You looking for my confession?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Not drinking enough for that.
text: Bradlee lights a cigarette. A moment passes.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m just tired of losing. And I’m
dialog: even more tired of weighing
dialog: everything on whether we lost or
dialog: not. There used to be a reason for
dialog: all of this.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: There is. We tell people the truth
dialog: about things they don’t want to
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Like every detail of Tricia Nixon's
dialog: wedding? C’mon.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: If you think that then what’s the
dialog: point?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Because I used to be good at
text: getting a story. Fighting for it.
dialog: Now I’m just... management.
text: Howard watches him, not knowing what to say.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You know Meyer passed her over for
dialog: the job once before?
text: Howard gives Bradlee a look.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Instead of leaving her the paper -
text: he left it to Phil. Her husband.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (whistling)
dialog: Well that tells you something.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It does. I’m just not sure if it
dialog: says more about him or her.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: It says that if you want a good
dialog: party, you call Kay Graham. A paper
dialog: run? There’s a whole list of names
dialog: that come first.
text: Charlotte Warsh approaches them.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yea, well, we went through those -
dialog: they keep dying on us.
text: Charlotte taps Bradlee on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (hushed)
text: Mrs. Graham is on the phone for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Speak of the devil and she will -
text: Bradlee shoots Howard a look.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, WARSH HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER
text: Bradlee picks up the phone. A shopping list is taped to it.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: This is Bradlee.
text: His expression changes upon realizing that it’s actually Kay.
text: Then turns to anger when he hears what she has to say.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, CONSTITUTION HALL - A LITTLE LATER
text: Kay hangs up the payphone in the empty lobby - the sounds of
text: the party wafting in from outside. She stands there for a
text: moment, processing. Then straightens her posture, puts her
text: face on, and heads back towards the music.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, WASHINGTON POST - LATER
text: Meg, Bagdikian, and Geyelin sit at the table. It’s the middle
text: of the night and they’ve all been dragged out of bed.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: You know what this is about?
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Yea, he asked me here at 2am then
dialog: revealed all his hopes and dreams.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Just asking.
text: Bagdikian chuckles. Through the glass they see the elevator
text: doors open and Bradlee storm out. Howard is on his heels.
text: Bradlee reaches the conference room where a few nearly empty
text: coffee cups sit on a nearby table. Bradlee slaps them and
text: sends them flying into the wall. The trio jumps.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Ben! What the -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m getting really goddamn tired of
dialog: finding out we’re being scooped by
dialog: the goddamn publisher!
text: Everyone is silenced. In the background, Gene steps of the
text: elevator and sees what is happening. Bradlee pulls out the
dialog: shopping list -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: According to Scotty Reston of the
dialog: New York Times, they have over
dialog: “7000 documents detailing how the
dialog: White House has lied about the
dialog: Vietnam War for the past 30 years.”
text: Geyelin sits back in his seat, Gene approaches. The night
text: shift in the office gathers to see the show.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Sheehan’s first article comes out
dialog: Sunday, then they’ll be doing a
dialog: series about the documents every
dialog: day. They’re going after the White
dialog: House with proof that there were
dialog: ulterior motives from the beginning
dialog: for sending our guys there. Proof
dialog: that they lied, that they hid it
dialog: from the public and that they
dialog: documented the whole thing.
text: He lets this all settle in.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: They’ve been going over the
dialog: material for three months. Three
dialog: months. And I had to find out from -—
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: How'd -
text: Meg goes to shush him but it’s too late -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It doesn’t matter how she found
dialog: out! She did it before any of you!
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Ben.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You’ve got twenty-four hours before
dialog: the story hits and I’d like to have
dialog: a little more goddman warning of
dialog: what it’s going to say than what I
dialog: already have!
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (a little forceful)
dialog: Ben.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What!
text: After a moment, Bradlee takes a breath. He looks back at the
text: table - the editors look like puppies kicked when they’re
text: down. Bradlee throws the shopping list on the table and
text: storms out.
scene_heading: INT. PHIL’S OFFICE, GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The lights come on, Kay, in her robe, stands in the doorway.
text: It’s not dusty, but feels oddly untouched. She steps in,
text: standing across from the large wooden desk. On a bookshelf
text: rests a number of framed photos, Phil Graham (handsome,
text: lanky) featured in most of them. One shows he and Kay on
text: their wedding day - youthful, optimistic, but with Kay still
text: carrying a weight on her shoulders. Later photos show him
text: with LBJ, Kennedy, their children, her father, Bradlee. She
text: lingers for a moment. Considering.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Lally sits at the table, reading the article from earlier.
text: Kay steps in, Lally looks up.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Can't sleep?
text: Lally shakes her head. Kay sees what she is reading and
text: frowns, moving to the stove.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tea?
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: OK.
text: A moment passes. Kay fills the teapot.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: What time is Yann dropping
dialog: Katharine off tomorrow?
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: He said 10.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: And he won’t stay?
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: (warning)
dialog: Mom.
text: Kay offers a thin smile and nods, backing off. She sits while
text: the water boils.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (re: the magazine)
dialog: I thought I’d thrown that out.
dialog: No she didn’t.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: It’s a... it’s a good article.
text: The page is open to a photograph of Kay laughing with Truman
text: Capote at the Black & White Ball. A different version of her
text: than the one in the boardroom - glamorous, in her element.
speaker_heading: LALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (gentle)
dialog: I just wish that maybe you'd...
dialog: take, I don’t know, a little more
dialog: pride in -
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Pride? I can -
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: That’s not the right word. You just
dialog: - you come across like - I don’t
dialog: know. You’re in one of the most
dialog: powerful positions in the country,
dialog: Mom. And it just seems like... you
dialog: don’t want it. There’s a lot of
dialog: people who look up to you.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I think that’s a bit dramatic.
text: The teapot sings, ending the conversation. Kay pours them
text: tea. Lally moves on.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: So what will happen now?
text: Kay gives her a look.
speaker_heading: LALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: With The Times. With what they’re
dialog: printing.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I’m not sure. It’s in Mr. Bradlee’s
text: hands at the moment.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: But aren’t you curious?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Of course but it’s not my place to
dialog: interfere.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Didn’t you get them the story?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You don’t understand how it works.
text: Lally goes to speak but realizes it’s a moot point.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your father always seemed to have
dialog: the right answer.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: At the meeting today. Paul and
dialog: Marvin, well, they feel that the
dialog: Board and the trust should share
dialog: the same voting power.
dialog: 39.
text: Lally is taken aback.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: That’s crazy. It’s never -—
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It will be fine. I spoke with Fritz
dialog: and he’s going to take care of it.
dialog: I was just... I was surprised.
dialog: That’s all.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: (treading carefully)
dialog: Did they ever... suggest anything
dialog: like this when Dad was in charge?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: No. No. Absolutely not. Phil
dialog: would’ve never stood for it.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: So... why are you?
text: Kay stares at her a beat.
speaker_heading: LALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean... I know Dad had a
dialog: different relationship with them -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Yes, of course -
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Why wouldn’t you just tell them

speaker_heading: KAY

scene_heading: INT. BRADLEE’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - MORNING
text: Bradlee sits on the phone, same clothes as the night before.
text: Howard across from him. Gene walks in.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Nope. He’s on the phone with a kid
dialog: from our New York office. Sent them
dialog: to the hotel.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What do you mean you ran away?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Hotel?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: The Times has the 11th floor of the
dialog: Hilton.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes. I understand.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I’m sorry?
text: Bradlee hangs up.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
text: The New York Times is squatting on
text: the 11th floor of the Hilton with
text: two guards standing watch outside
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Our guys got so spooked they
dialog: pretended to be lost and ran in the
text: opposite direction.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What do you mean ran?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I mean when you go from one point
dialog: to the other and you don’t walk.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: What else did they say?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Not a whole lot. We heard anything
dialog: from the White House?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: They’ve been busy all weekend.
text: Bradlee gives him a look.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: The wedding.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: That fucking wedding.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: All they’re saying is the documents
dialog: didn’t come from them.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Which we know is bullshit because
dialog: the only thing that would make this
dialog: story stick would be documents from
dialog: the inside.
text: Bradlee checks his watch.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: So it’s 9am and we’ve got guards
text: outside a hotel room, the White
dialog: House denying any knowledge of
dialog: documents that were most likely
dialog: created inside the White House
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: And McNamara’s call.
text: Bradlee stares at him.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
text: The call. From McNamara.
text: This sticks with Bradlee. Bagdikian walks in.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You got something?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: They’re not budging. I’m trying to
dialog: get a hold of a guy I used to know
dialog: when I was there. Left a couple
dialog: months ago and I can’t seem to find
dialog: him. Ellsberg. Dan.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: He’s kind of a quack isn’t he?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I remember him - he was down here
dialog: for awhile working on something.
dialog: Doved real quick.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (absentmindedl]ly )
dialog: If the leak didn’t come from the
dialog: White House, why is McNamara
dialog: calling us?
text: Bradlee stands, moving towards the door.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bags - find Ellsberg.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Where’re you going?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: To talk to Mrs. Graham, because she
dialog: seems to be the only one who can
dialog: get any answers.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: She's not here.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: It’s the weekend.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I don’t know. Home?
text: Bradlee walks out. Howard sighs -
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: That’s going to go well.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD, GRAHAM HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Kay sits in an Adirondack chair next to Lally, going over
text: some documents. Her expression one of concern. The grass is
text: getting long and unkempt, rising well above the ankles.
text: Playing a few yards away is KATHARINE (5, tow-headed), Kay’s
text: granddaughter. She runs her hands through the grass, which is
text: now itching Kay. The doorbell rings, Kay’s brow furrows.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Were you expecting someone?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: I'll go check.
text: Lally leaves. Kay looks back to Katharine and watches her
text: play in the yard. A look of concern begins to cloud Kay’s
text: face as Katharine begins to twirl in the grass.
speaker_heading: KAY
text: Katharine, slow down.
text: Katharine giggles and starts spinning faster, her feet
text: pounding the ground and her arms out beside her.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Katherine, I said stop!
text: Katharine doesn’t hear her, she throws her arms above her
text: head and, in one violent leap, loses her balance and crumbles
text: to the ground, hidden in the tall grass. Kay is up in an
text: instant, rushing to her granddaughter.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Katharine! Lally! Lally!
text: Kay approaches, fearful of what she’1ll find where Katharine
text: was once in action. She finds Katharine on her back, gazing
text: at the sky, a look of fascination on her face. Her arms move
text: as if she’s making a “grass” angel. In the background, Lally
text: runs toward them.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: KATHARINE
dialog: Look.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You scared me! I asked you to -
speaker_heading: KATHARINE
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Look! It’s red!
text: Kay looks up to the sky and sees the rising moon is a deep
text: red. Kay seems to get momentarily lost in the sight of it.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: KATHARINE (CONT’D)
dialog: Isn't it pretty?
text: Kay looks from the sky to her granddaughter and back again,
text: surprised at the natural wonder of the child. She’s
text: unaccustomed to such unhindered joy and curiosity - something
dialog: she’s always kept at bay.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: It’s beautiful.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What? What is it?
text: Kay snaps out of the daze.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Oh. It was nothing.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Nothing?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Yes. I’m sorry, I -
text: She looks to the back door and sees Bradlee standing there.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: He said he needs to ask you
dialog: something.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kay hands Bradlee some water. They can see Lally and
text: Katharine playing out the window.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: This is very inappropriate.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Well, I’m here. So... Is that your
dialog: granddaughter?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Yes. What did you want to ask me?
dialog: No small talk is fine with him.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Do you have any idea why McNamara
dialog: called you?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: He’s an old friend.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: He trusts me.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yes.
text: He waits for more, she doesn’t give it.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Maybe I don’t understand the
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: We’re still piecing together what
dialog: it is exactly that The Times is
dialog: printing. We’re not going to get
dialog: their source in time -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Why not?
text: He’s a bit taken aback.
text: He steams.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Because finding a source is like
dialog: finding a -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I don’t need a metaphor, Mr.
dialog: Bradlee.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Well it’s extraordinarily
dialog: difficult, Mrs. Graham. I haven’t
dialog: been a writer in a while so the
dialog: haystack comparison is really the
dialog: only one I can come up with right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: But if you could get McNamara to
dialog: talk to us, well, that would be
dialog: helpful and -
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Talk to you? About what?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: About whatever it is that The Times
dialog: is printing.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: What makes you -—
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Mrs. Graham, the former Secretary
dialog: of Defense called you because he
dialog: knows what’s in that article. He
dialog: knows what’s in those documents.
dialog: Which means he either wrote them or
dialog: organized them or found them. I
dialog: honestly don’t care which one
dialog: because he’s one of two people we
dialog: know of who can tell me about it
dialog: and the only one whose name I have.
text: She purses her lips.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Well, I’m sorry, Mr. Bradlee but
dialog: you'll have to find another way.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: KAY
text: Bob McNamara is an old friend who
dialog: spoke to me in confidence. Not as a
dialog: source. Not as a subject.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: He spoke to you because you’re the
dialog: publisher of a newspaper and he was
dialog: hoping you’d bail him out.
speaker_heading: KAY
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (heated)
dialog: He spoke to you because he was
dialog: hoping to get you on his side and
dialog: banking on the fact that I wouldn’t
dialog: notice.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Bradlee.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I don’t know if I can articulate
dialog: just how important it is that we
dialog: get -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You have, but my answer is no. I
dialog: will not exploit a friendship of
dialog: over twenty years for -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Unfortunately that’s the position
dialog: that you’re in. We exploit
dialog: friendships and acquaintances and
dialog: sources to find the information we
dialog: need because the end is better than
dialog: the means.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I’m not a journalist, Mr. Bradlee.
dialog: And I'm not going to change my
dialog: mind.
text: Bradlee grits his jaw, thinking for a moment.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Are you trying to tell me I
dialog: shouldn't go after this story?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That’s not what I -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Because I'll just walk out of the
dialog: bullpen right now if that’s how
dialog: it’s going to be.
text: She’s taken aback by his ferocity.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: I need to know that you’re going to
dialog: print these documents if we get
dialog: them.
text: A moment passes.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (firm)
dialog: I absolutely will not guarantee
dialog: that, Mr. Bradlee.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I have no idea what is in them, who
dialog: it might expose, what relationships
dialog: it could damage if we -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Relationships.
text: He shakes his head and rises.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: When we fail, this will be on you.
dialog: Thank you for the water, I’1l see
dialog: myself out.
text: He exits, leaving Kay stunned. She looks out the window and
text: sees Katharine twirling in the grass, smiling up at the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS, WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN, WASHINGTON POST - LATE NIGHT
text: Bagdikian’s desk is empty. In the background, he waits for
text: the coffee to percolate. He hasn’t slept or left the office
text: in over a day. There are other people, in other cubicles, who
text: have been doing the exact same thing. His phone rings. He
text: doesn’t hear it at first. Finally, he runs over and grabs it -
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Bagdikian.
text: His mood changes.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Who is this?
text: He seems satisfied with the answer and grabs a pen, writing

speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Sure, yes - I’ve got it.

scene_heading: EXT. BRADLEE HOUSE - DAWN
text: Bradlee stands on his front porch in his robe, watching as
text: TWO TRUCKS make their morning deliveries: one for The Times
dialog: and one for The Post.
dialog: 49.
text: He smokes a cigarette and waits for them to drive off. Then,
text: he carefully walks across his neighbor’s yard where a Times
text: paper has been dropped off. Checking to make sure no one sees
text: him, he grabs the paper and runs back to his porch. He opens
text: to the front page and reads, “PENTAGON STUDY TRACES 3 DECADES
text: OF GROWING U.S. INVOLVEMENT”. He frowns.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM, WASHINGTON POST - DAY
text: The same boardmembers sit at the table. Ignatius has a copy
text: of the Times next to him. The tension is palpable. Fritz and
text: Kay listen while Ignatius speaks.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: I think it’s clear, after the
dialog: events of this weekend, that I was
dialog: correct in suggesting we rethink
dialog: the voting percentages.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: What does this weekend have to do
dialog: with that?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: The failure of The Washington Post
dialog: to properly investigate and report
dialog: on a story that The New York Times
dialog: has dedicated the better half of
dialog: this year to.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Have you read The Times’ article?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: So you'll agree, it’s damning.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Damning?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: To the White House.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Well, it’s -
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: And this morning the White House
dialog: filed an injunction against the
dialog: Times. It was approved an hour ago.
speaker_heading: MARVIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
text: A restraining order. The Times is
dialog: prohibited from printing anymore of
dialog: the documents until there is a
dialog: hearing.
text: Kay smiles, letting Fritz fight for her.
speaker_heading: FRITZ (CONT'D)
dialog: So I’m just confused - do you want

dialog: stand with them?
text: Ignatius stutters.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, WASHINGTON POST - A LITTLE LATER

speaker_heading: FRITZ

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Can he really take away my voting

speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: (hesitating)

speaker_heading: KAY

dialog: Removed?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: I’m afraid so.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: But -

speaker_heading: FRITZ (CONT'D)
dialog: You read the article?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (solemn)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: (re: the papers)
dialog: Horrible. The audacity of - I wish
dialog: I was more surprised.
text: He expects her to respond in unison, but she doesn’t.
speaker_heading: FRITZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think Bradlee will go after
dialog: the documents?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It seems that way.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: We can’t get pulled into some kind
dialog: of legal battle over this, Kay. Not
dialog: now. It could jeopardize -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (loaded)
dialog: I don’t think it will come to that.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Let’s hope not.

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (gentle)
dialog: More of the letters came in today.
text: Kay furrows her brow and sees a return address on one of the
text: envelopes reads: “EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN”. Kay extends her hand.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I'll take them.

speaker_heading: LIZ

scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN, WASHINGTON POST - DAY

speaker_heading: ANCHOR

text: Bradlee walks off, shaking his head in annoyance.
scene_heading: INT. BRADLEE’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - MOMENTS LATER
text: Bradlee sits in his chair and looks down at a Post story in
text: front of him. He reads.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: “As reported by the New York
dialog: Times.”
text: He sighs and throws a pen at the wall. Frustrated. Angry.
text: There are lots of other little dents in the wall from pens
text: that have been thrown there before. He stares out at the
text: bullpen, mulling over the next move. The elevator doors open
text: and Bagdikian speeds out. Bradlee watches him as he awkwardly

speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Bags, what the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: I need to go to Boston.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Boston?

text: Bradlee smiles and closes his office door.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You find Ellsberg?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: He found me. Or, someone we know -
dialog: it’s not important.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Is he the Times’ source? Does he
dialog: still have the documents?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: I need to go to Boston.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Alright.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're still standing here.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN

dialog: documents unless I promise we'll
dialog: print them.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: We don’t know what they say yet.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Still. I’11 have to say something.
text: Bradlee thinks a moment.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: If what’s in these documents is as
dialog: good as we think, you can tell him
dialog: that if we don’t print, there’1l be
dialog: a new executive editor at the
dialog: Washington Post.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN

dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE

scene_heading: INT. TAXI, BOSTON - DUSK

speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: You sure you want to go up there?

speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: What the hell do you mean walk to -
dialog: I just let the cab go! Fine, fine.
dialog: I’1l be there soon.
text: He slams the phone down on the receiver. Then one more time
text: to do it right. He starts to walk down the path of the river.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE, BOSTON - A LITTLE LATER
text: Bagdikian stands at another payphone, getting more
text: instructions. He hangs up and turns in yet another direction.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL, OUTSIDE OF BOSTON - NIGHT
text: It’s dark now. A taxi pulls up outside a run down, out-of-the-
text: way motel. Bagdikian climbs out and looks around. He goes to
text: one of the rooms and knocks. The curtains move to the side
text: but he can’t make anyone out. The door opens and DANIEL
text: ELLSBERG (40s, big eyebrows) stands there, an apologetic

speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: Ben.

speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN

scene_heading: INT. BRADLEE’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - NIGHT
text: Bradlee sits as his desk reading. His hand toys with his

text: His mood is icy.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Mrs. Graham?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: My secretary gave me your note.
text: She holds a slip in her hand.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You didn’t need to come down. I
dialog: just wanted to let you know where
dialog: we stood.
text: She nods her head once, considering.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: May I come in?
text: He gestures to the chair in front of him. She sits and takes
text: in the sight of the office - she hasn’t been in here since he
dialog: took the job. He knows this.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
text: Mr. Bagdikian is on his way to
dialog: Boston?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Should be there by now.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Who is he meeting with?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m not going to tell you that.
text: She nods - understanding the protection of a source.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You think he’1ll be able to retrieve
dialog: the documents?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (loaded)
dialog: I hope so.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That's quite a coup.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: We've got good reporters.
text: She purses her lips.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You're going to stay until you hear

speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It‘’ll be awhile.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Your wife doesn’t mind you staying
dialog: so late?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: She minds. But here I am.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: And your children?
text: He looks at his watch -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
text: Long asleep by now. Or should be.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Should be and will be are always
dialog: difficult with children.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Truer a statement has never been
dialog: made.
dialog: 56.
text: She looks around, noting the minimal personal touches. Only a

text: Graham, and one of Bradlee and a YOUNG MAN (20) in an Army
dialog: uniform.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I haven’t been in here since Russ

speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your son?

speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: From my first marriage.
speaker_heading: KAY

speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Couldn’t stop him.
speaker_heading: KAY

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mine too. Well, not the Peace
dialog: Corps. But home.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What are you doing here, Mrs.

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I thought that we should get to

speaker_heading: BRADLEE

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: As Phil’s wife.
text: An awkward tension enters the room. A moment passes.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you find that difficult?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Excuse me?
text: She points to a photo of Bradlee and JFK.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Being close with the President.
text: Being a journalist and his friend.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Only when someone pointed it out.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Phil never felt... awkward about
dialog: it. He liked being able to call the
dialog: President and for him to answer.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: A lot of things were different back
dialog: then.
text: Beat. Kay’s eyes stay with the photos, Bradlee’s on her.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I think my father found personal

speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I have some.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Most people have things on their

dialog: to be watching over you.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’ve never thought about it.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Of course you have.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: There are a lot of reporters on my

speaker_heading: KAY

speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: On my staff?

speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: Sorry about the rigmarole getting
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: A lot of guys looking for you.
text: A moment passes.
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: How'd you figure it was me?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Sounded like something a crazy guy
dialog: would do.
text: He’s half-joking. Ellsberg laughs.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I poked around at Rand. They got
dialog: nervous when I mentioned your name.
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: What do you know?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: The basics. You were part of a team
text: set up at the DoD to gather
dialog: information on Vietnam.
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: (almost wistful)
dialog: McNamara would say “let the chips
dialog: fall where they may”. He wanted
dialog: scholars to have the opportunity to
dialog: examine Vietnam policy - all
dialog: angles. I loved it.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG (CONT'D)
dialog: I loved the guys - the work. We had
dialog: access to everything. I mean, how
dialog: often does that happen, you know?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: (treading lightly)
dialog: But.
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: What else... “but” we found
dialog: something.
text: Bagdikian holds his breath. Ellsberg lights a cigarette, his
text: hand shakes.
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG (CONT’D)
dialog: None of it was ever about helping
dialog: Vietnam.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: What was it about?
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: What’s it always about? Self-
dialog: interest. Expansion. Making sure we
dialog: had the final say.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: But how -
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: It was us. From the beginning:
dialog: Covert Ops, rigged elections,
dialog: guaranteed debt. It’s all in there
dialog: memos, studies, cables. Since the
dialog: 40s they’ve been doing this. The
dialog: CIA, NSA, DoD... the White House.
dialog: 80% of it is classified. They knew
dialog: all along that we were sending men
dialog: boys - not to fight, but to die.
dialog: The knew because they started it
dialog: all. And they planned it from the
dialog: start. Then they knew that we were
dialog: going to lose. But they kept
dialog: sending those boys over anyway.
text: The truth hangs between them for a moment.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: If there’s nothing in there about
dialog: Nixon - why does he care? He must
dialog: love how it makes the Democrats -
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ELLSBERG
dialog: You think Nixon wants you guys to
dialog: be able to start publishing
dialog: materials like this? Nixon may not
dialog: be in these, but I guarantee he’s

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: About?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: If you're going to let us print

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I don’t know that it’s worth the

speaker_heading: BRADLEE

text: She purses her lips - this should be good.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: I think you want to help. I think

speaker_heading: KAY

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Call it a woman’s problem.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (scowling)
dialog: Don’t do that. Don’t bring up the
dialog: woman thing again.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I am one.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yes. But that doesn’t mean you need
dialog: to act how a woman thinks a man
dialog: thinks a woman should act like.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Not the interview again.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I just don’t understand it. You’re
dialog: running this massive company. All
dialog: this responsibility on you and... I
dialog: mean - it’s not 1952 and you’re not
dialog: running around getting the old boys
dialog: their coffee.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Yet you think it’s appropriate to
dialog: yell at me about how to do my job.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yes! Because you’re not doing it!
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Would you speak to Phil that way?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I was never in charge of Phil’s -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: If you had been.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Suppositions don’t suit anyone.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Bradlee -
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (annoyed, heated)
dialog: No! I wouldn’t have to yell at Phil
dialog: about that! I would’ve had to about
dialog: a dozen other things but not that.
dialog: Because he would’ve made the call
dialog: before I even walked in the door.
dialog: This was his paper. Phil knew that.
dialog: And he knew that his influence, his
dialog: opinion, mattered. It was the
dialog: opinion of the Washington Post. And
dialog: you, Mrs. Graham, your opinion, for
dialog: better or worse, is the opinion of
dialog: the Washington Post! If you don’t
dialog: believe you should be running it,
dialog: why the hell should I?
text: Kay looks at her glass, the honesty hitting them both. He’s a
text: little embarrassed by his outburst. The moment hangs there.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: What you don’t seem to understand
dialog: is that it’s not about what I want.
dialog: It’s never been about that. It’s
dialog: about what is right for the paper.
dialog: That’s what comes first.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That’s what has always come first.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: But can’t you -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I’ve been getting some of those
dialog: letters, too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Everyone seems to have an opinion
dialog: on how I’m supposed to behave. You.
dialog: The Board. My daughter. I walked
dialog: around like my father, they’d call
dialog: me a narcissist. If I behaved like
dialog: Phil they’d have me committed much -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Well -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: - faster than he was. I’m left with
dialog: no real option except to let all of
dialog: this keep spinning while I try to
dialog: make sure it doesn’t slip off its
dialog: axis.
dialog: This hits

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You'll keep me informed?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I’m throwing Harry Gladstein a

speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think Phil would print them?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE

speaker_heading: KAY

scene_heading: EXT. BRADLEE HOUSE - MORNING
text: It’s early, the morning light casting a beautiful glow on the
text: semi-suburban neighborhood. A few extra cars are parked in
text: the driveway and MARINA BRADLEE (11) sits at a table selling
text: lemonade. Trudging along from afar is Bagdikian, the box of

speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: Lemonade?
text: He doesn’t respond or stop; a man on a mission.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, BRADLEE HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: Meg, Howard, and Geyelin all crowd around the kitchen. Tony
text: tries to make coffee as quickly as possible but the reporters
text: keep gulping it down. Bradlee hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The Times is going to lose their
dialog: appeal.
text: The mood in the room falls a bit.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BRADLEE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: The front door opens and closes, the reporters peek their
text: heads around the corner as Bagdikian walks in. He drops the
text: box on the ground then goes to the living room and lies on
text: the couch. It’s a feeding frenzy, they grab handfuls of paper
text: and start to read. Bradlee approaches Bagdikian.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You OK, Bags?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: (eyes closed)
dialog: Yea. I just - need a minute.
text: Bradlee smiles and smacks him on the shoulder. Meg goes
dialog: through some pages -
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Wait - are... these in order?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Doesn’t look like it -
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Bags, did you see if they were
dialog: organized in some -
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: This is how they came to me.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: It’s more than...
text: She looks to Geyelin who, in turn, looks to Bradlee.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: We can’t sort through this much
dialog: stuff in time to -
text: Bradlee’s expression quiets him.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: The Times had three months, we -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: Have nine hours.
text: The editors stare at him. They don’t move.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: I think... it’s... it might be -
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: It’s a tall order.
text: In the background, Marina approaches Bagdikian with a cup of
text: lemonade. He smiles and reaches for it, she pulls back.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: 10 cents.
text: He scowls but reaches into his pocket, she grins.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What?
text: Marina glances at her father - she’s heard that tone before.
text: This is about to get bad. She goes to get more lemonade.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: I just -
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What does that mean “it’s a tall
dialog: order”.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: He’s saying -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: He’s saying it’s not worth it. It’s
dialog: too hard. Why even bother - The
dialog: Times has done it already. They've
dialog: got everyone talking so why waste
dialog: our time.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: That’s not -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: That’s exactly what he’s saying!
text: The room is quiet.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: For the last six months, hell, for
dialog: the last two years, we've been
dialog: taking what they give us and now,
dialog: when we have something and we can
dialog: do something about it - no. No. We
dialog: don’t want to do that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because it’s a tall order.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I can’t be the only one who cares
dialog: about this. Because if that happens
dialog: I get mad and every else gets fired
dialog: and we’re all screwed in the end.
text: He goes to the box and grabs a stack of papers then sits and
text: begins to sort through them. After a moment, the rest of the
text: team does so as well.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT, GEORGETOWN - SAME TIME
text: Kay walks in, looking around for someone. She spots ROBERT
text: McNAMARA (50s) sitting at a table by himself, reading the

speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: I’ve had articles written about me
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Not like this.
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: No. Not like this.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Bob -
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: Do you know what I did at Ford?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: You were the President, I assume
dialog: you -
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: All anyone cared about was selling
dialog: cars. All that mattered was how
dialog: they looked, how they sounded, how
dialog: they felt. No one saw a car like I
text: saw it - like a weapon.
dialog: She’s listening but - where’s this going?
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I wanted them to put in seat belts.
dialog: But they said, “Well, if you put
text: the seat belt in there, all
dialog: anyone’s thinking about is their
dialog: kid’s head going through the
dialog: windshield.” It didn’t matter that
dialog: I had mountains of research to
dialog: prove otherwise. Eventually I got
dialog: them to put it in as an option.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Bob.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: I thought “At least I got them to
dialog: do that much.” My conscience could
dialog: be clear. For the most part. Of
dialog: course, it didn’t matter.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Bob.
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: The second I left for Washington
text: they took the seat belts away.
dialog: People kept dying. But - they kept
dialog: selling cars.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And they sure looked pretty.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Bob, why did you call me?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: I guess I was trying to give you a
text: seat belt.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BRADLEE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
text: The journalists have split the piles into different sections.
text: Meg and Geyelin are on the floor, sorting things while Howard
text: reads the organized materials. The room is tense. Quiet.
speaker_heading: GEYELIN
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: He and Meg exchange a look filled with anger... sadness.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: The whole time... when Johnson was
dialog: running and... he was...
text: She looks up at Howard.
speaker_heading: MEG (CONT'D)
dialog: He’d sent the boys over there

dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, BRADLEE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bradlee sits at the table, phone to ear, head in hand. The
text: cord is stretched inconveniently across the room so if anyone
text: wants to walk in, they have to duck. Tony makes sandwiches.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m still on hold.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: On hold with who?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Who are you on hold with?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The lawyers. Supposedly. Though at
dialog: this point they could've
dialog: transferred me to the Guam Embassy
dialog: and I wouldn’t know.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You do that all the time.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Call Guam?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Say something without knowing that

text: Howard pokes his head in, getting Bradlee’s attention.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yea?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Some of this stuff. It’s... it’s
text: heavy. Even just going through it.
dialog: I’m wondering if we could get Mrs.

dialog: Tell us if -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: That’s not her job, Howard.
speaker_heading: HOWARD

text: He’s clearly put on hold again. He slaps his hand on the

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It might help if you were more
dialog: condescending. Why don’t you just
dialog: call Mrs. Graham?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Jesus -—
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I was teasing that time. I can
dialog: tease.
dialog: No he can’t.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Because if I call Mrs. Graham
dialog: without knowing what the lawyers
dialog: are going to say then the first
dialog: thing she’s going to do is call the
dialog: lawyers and I’11 be on hold with
dialog: both of them. At least this one
text: cuts out the middle man.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Except you’re still on hold.
text: He glances over at her.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What are you doing back there?
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Making sandwiches.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: For who?
text: She stares at him and shakes her head. She puts the
text: sandwiches on a platter and walks out, ducking under the
text: cord. The front door opens - Bradlee turns. He sees ROGER
text: CLARK (late 30s), ANTHONY ESSAYE (40s), and a few other
text: LAWYERS arrive.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Mr. Bradlee?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: We’re from Royall, Koegell, &
dialog: Wells.
dialog: Koegell is pronounced “Kegel”.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (to Meg re: Koegell)
dialog: What’d he say?
text: She would roll her eyes but she’s too tired.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The lawyers?
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Who the hell am I on hold to talk

speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Probably me.

speaker_heading: BRADLEE

speaker_heading: MEG

speaker_heading: KAY

speaker_heading: MCNAMARA

speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)

dialog: a long time.
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: Yes.
text: She steels herself to ask this tough question.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Well, I just... you knew Don was

dialog: how - how could you not tell me? Or
dialog: Phil? How could you just let him...
dialog: With everything that you knew... ?
text: McNamara’s eyes are on the table, unmoving. She’s well
text: composed, not overtly emotional. She just wants an answer.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I suppose you couldn’t have told me
dialog: but, I can’t help thinking...
text: Kay watches him, seeing that she’s upset him.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s alright. Nevermind. He’s home -

speaker_heading: MCNAMARA
dialog: No. I - I just wish I could tell

text: He trails off.
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: We made mistakes. All of us. It
dialog: doesn’t excuse - nothing could
dialog: but... well.
text: He takes a moment, gathering his thoughts.
speaker_heading: MCNAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe we did the right thing. Maybe
dialog: we didn’t. Who knows. Maybe it’s
dialog: your job, the job of the press
dialog: to... I don’t know. Keep us all
dialog: honest? I’m not so sure if people
dialog: should know everything. But I...
dialog: I’m not sure anyone has a right to

speaker_heading: KAY

speaker_heading: MEG

speaker_heading: Mmhm
text: He reads, shaking his head at what he’s reading.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Why would the Director of the CIA

dialog: Ignoring the fact that the
dialog: documents could be represented as
dialog: stolen property and therefore -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: We didn’t steal anything.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: But they were -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Not by -
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: Regardless of that. And forgetting
dialog: that we don’t know what is going to
dialog: happen with The Times case -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What’s going to happen is -
text: Fritz puts up his hand for a second, Bradlee stops.
speaker_heading: CLARK
dialog: As I said. Forgetting all of that.
dialog: We simply don’t have the time to
dialog: vet these documents. The majority
dialog: of what we’re dealing with is
dialog: classified information and we don’t
dialog: know what’s in them. I don’t
dialog: understand why it isn’t the most
dialog: prudent to simply wait and ask -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (bursting)
dialog: Because we lost!
text: Fritz looks at him, the lawyers watch.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Why can’t we wait? Because we've
dialog: already waited three months and
dialog: four days longer than we should’ve.
dialog: We’ve got egg on our face and
dialog: unless we publish these documents
dialog: right now we might as well be some
dialog: shitty, one stoplight, no radio
dialog: town, single edition paper.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT'D)
dialog: We are the Washington Post. We
dialog: aren’t anyone’s runner-up.
text: Fritz thinks a moment.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: (to Bradlee)
dialog: The Post is going public next week.
text: Bagdikian looks up - surprised. Bradlee is disappointed.
speaker_heading: FRITZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Our IPO is contingent on a series
dialog: of steps and markers that will
dialog: ensure to the -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: How’s it going to look when the
dialog: biggest property in the company
dialog: goes down because they didn’t have
dialog: the balls to stand up with the
dialog: Times.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: It’s not always about winning, Ben.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: Yes, it is! With this? It is
dialog: entirely about winning. I don’t
dialog: care what’s in those papers and I
dialog: don’t care who we make look bad!
dialog: We’re printing them and -
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: That’s not your decision.
text: A tense beat. Bradlee hates that Fritz is right.
speaker_heading: ASSAYE
dialog: I have an idea.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Oh, goodie.
speaker_heading: ASSAYE
dialog: What if we wait. Hold off on
dialog: printing today -
text: Bradlee starts to interject, Assaye speaks over him -
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ASSAYE (CONT’D)
dialog: And, instead, we call the Attorney
dialog: General and tell them that we
dialog: intend to print the papers on
dialog: Sunday. That way we give them, and
dialog: ourselves, time to figure out the
dialog: legality of it all. Let the courts
dialog: decide what will happen with the
dialog: Times. Just - give ourselves some
dialog: breathing room.
text: Bagdikian, Fritz, and Bradlee stare at him. Clark keeps his
text: head down. A long moment passes.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: You want to... tell the Attorney
dialog: General that we... have these
dialog: documents and are going to print
dialog: them. In a few days.
speaker_heading: ASSAYE
dialog: (less sure)
dialog: Yes.
text: Bradlee looks back at Bagdikian, then Fritz.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: That’s the shittiest idea I’ve ever
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Ben -
text: Bradlee walks towards the door.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You know what? Hang on, let me go
dialog: talk to my eleven-year-old and see
dialog: if she has a better plan.
text: He leaves, slamming the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. KAY'S DRESSING ROOM, GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kay sits at the vanity, clipping large pearls to her ears.
text: Music can be heard from downstairs, the party winding up. Kay
dialog: is the consummate hostess and tonight will be no different.
text: But her mind is elsewhere.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. PHIL’S OFFICE, GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kay stands in the doorway, her hand on the light switch.
text: After a moment, she turns the light off and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. VARIOUS, GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kay greets various GUESTS while WAITERS distribute small
text: bites, a glass of champagne in everyone’s hand. Kay teases
text: and laughs, her best party face on. Every now and then she
text: flicks her eyes to the telephone - waiting.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS (0.S.)
dialog: Having a nice time?
text: Ignatius stands there, martini in hand. Kay forces a smile.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Bittersweet.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Why’s that?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Retirement parties tend to be
text: tinged with it.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Oh, is that what this is?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Did you not see it on the
dialog: invitation?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: I’m not sure I received one.
text: Kay absorbs the jab, forcing that smile again. She makes a
text: move to leave, he subtly cuts her off. Entertaining him is
dialog: not a task she needs right now.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS (CONT’D)
dialog: I hope you weren’t offended by what
dialog: I said in the board room.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (tense)
dialog: Offended isn’t the word I’d use.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: However you might feel, I hope you
dialog: know - I’ve always been impressed
dialog: by you.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: (genuine, condescending)
dialog: Surprising as it may seem to hear
dialog: it. The way you stood by Phil
dialog: during everything. Even when he,
dialog: well, I guess there’s no need to
text: walk on a dead man’s name.
dialog: Is he serious?
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS (CONT’D)
dialog: I never met him, you know, but I
dialog: always though we’d get along. And
dialog: the way you handled yourself during
dialog: his - situation - with such...
dialog: style. However all of this works
dialog: out - I want you to know that I
dialog: have the best intentions towards -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (irate but calm)
dialog: Mr. Ignatius, this really isn’t the
dialog: time or place for the type of
dialog: conversation you’re wading into.
dialog: But I can assure you, I am well
dialog: aware of your intentions - good or
dialog: otherwise.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Enjoy the party.
text: She walks away, leaving Ignatius taken aback. Kay fumes.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK DECK, BRADLEE HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: Bradlee sits and watches Marina and a FRIEND (10) play in the
text: backyard. He watches but he’s not really there. A coffee mug
text: is placed in front him, he looks up and sees Tony.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Looked like you needed a pick-me-
dialog: up.
text: He nods and accepts it, she sits next to him.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You give it the good stuff?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: The staff drank us out of
dialog: everything.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Could’ve guessed that.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But your daughter made a killing
dialog: with her lemonade business.
text: Bradlee smiles. Tony watches him. As much as she doesn’t want
dialog: to sometimes - she cares about this guy.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: They’re idiots. All they can see
text: are dollar signs vanishing in front
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Have you tried to convince -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Of course I have.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You sure? All I heard was a lot of
text: “me” and “the paper” and —
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (scowling)
dialog: Tony -
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Did you try and tell them what the
dialog: point of it all is?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The point of it?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I’1ll never understand how you
dialog: convinced people you were so
dialog: perceptive.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What do you -
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Did you even read -
dialog: 84.
text: But they’re interrupted with Bagdikian walking out - he looks
dialog: panicked.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Ben? Beebe - Fritz - he just left.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What? Where’d he -
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: To the Graham house.
text: Bradlee grits his jaw, running into the house.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Sonofabitch.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: But I have to tell you -
text: Bradlee doesn’t hear anything - his rage overwhelming. Tony
text: just watches him go. As she always does.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, BRADLEE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bradlee storms in and grabs the phone. He dials. The
text: remaining editors and lawyers keep their heads down in the
text: living room, trying to power through.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: Ben.
text: Bradlee raises his hand. The phone rings.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: He went to tell her we can’t
dialog: publish.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: No, Ben. It’s because of Ellsberg.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Nobody’s answering. What’re you
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: He wanted to know if we had the
dialog: same source as the Times and -
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, this is Ben Bradlee, I’m
dialog: looking for -
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: He says -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (growing frustrated)
dialog: I understand that it’s a party, but
dialog: I promise that she -
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: He says we can be charged with
dialog: conspiracy to commit treason!
text: That gets the attention of everyone. Geyelin rises from his
text: chair, the lawyers survey the room.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: They could argue that we knew that
dialog: because it’s the same source as The
dialog: Times, we knew we were getting
dialog: stolen documents. I - I don’t know.
dialog: I had one too many to catch it all -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Shit.
text: He hangs up the phone and grabs his keys.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: She's probably too busy rubbing
dialog: elbows to even know what’s going
dialog: on.
text: Bradlee stops and grits his jaw.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Enough!
text: The volume startles everyone, Tony pokes her head in from
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Ben, it was just -
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No! I’ve heard - you have no idea
dialog: what that woman is dealing with!
dialog: What she’s been through! The
dialog: pressure that we - you should just -
text: He stops himself, getting blank stares. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT'D)
dialog: You should just be... better.
text: He walks out, his staff left both confused and hanging their
dialog: heads.
scene_heading: INT. GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: The HONOREE (60s) speaks to the crowd, Kay stands to the
text: side, smiling.
speaker_heading: HONOREE
dialog: Many of you are too young to
dialog: remember Mr. Meyer so, I’1l just
dialog: leave you with this. Remember that
dialog: this... this was a man’s life. This
dialog: paper. And he did it all for the
dialog: public. For the readers. He never
dialog: wanted anything in return, I mean,
dialog: he sunk so much money into it those
dialog: early years, you’d a thought he was
text: trying to marry it.
text: Laughs abound. Kay digests these words. Fritz walks in and
text: makes eye contact with Kay. She’s slightly concerned by his
text: arrival. Ignatius spots him, too.
speaker_heading: HONOREE (CONT'D)
dialog: But he believed it was his duty,
dialog: his public service, to put out the
dialog: paper every day. Give people a
dialog: chance to read the news.
text: Bradlee runs in. A few guests notice, shooting him wary
text: looks. Bradlee pants, beads of sweat rolling down his
text: temples. He spots Fritz and approaches him.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You're not talking to her without
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Ben -
dialog: 87.
dialog: Ignatius approaches -
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Mr. Bradlee - are you... alright?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (panting)
dialog: I had to run. Who are you?
text: Ignatius goes to speak but Kay approaches, interrupting them.
text: She gives Bradlee a once over.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: If we could take this outside.
text: They follow her, including Ignatius, which surprises both
dialog: Fritz and Bradlee.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD, GRAHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Bradlee, Fritz, and Ignatius fight it out. Kay sits nearby,
text: listening and seemingly ignored by the three men. She takes
dialog: it all in.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: It’s not just that the offering can
dialog: be suspended, but also the
dialog: government might have just cause to
dialog: seek a criminal indictment.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Don’t be dramatic.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: A felon may not hold a broadcast
dialog: license, which means they will
dialog: seize all of our broadcast
dialog: properties. Without that revenue,
dialog: we'll be forced to sell. If they
dialog: win, and we are convicted, then The
dialog: Washington Post Company will cease
dialog: to exist.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: If we’re living in a world where
dialog: the government can tell you what to
dialog: print and broadcast then that
dialog: license doesn’t mean shit any way.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: That’s just -
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: How is this even a debate? We can’t
dialog: possibly risk -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: If we don’t publish, we’ll be out
dialog: of business soon enough as it is!
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: How -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Because The New York Times will
dialog: win! Maybe not tomorrow, or next
dialog: week, but gradually people will
dialog: stop thinking The Post has a leg to
dialog: stand on.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Ben, I understand that this might
dialog: be difficult to understand -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Your patronizing tone aside, this
dialog: isn’t -
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: This is about your ego? Mr.
dialog: Bradlee, I truly don’t -
text: Bradlee tries to ignore Ignatius but it’s difficult.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Look. I understand that the public
dialog: offering is important. I understand
dialog: that being convicted felons isn’t
dialog: high on everyone’s list. But in
dialog: this case it’s better than failure!
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: You and I have very differing
dialog: opinions on failure.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (finally)
dialog: I’m not talking to you!
text: Ignatius is taken aback. He hates reporters.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: There will be other fights. Other -
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You want to talk about a court
dialog: battle? If they start fighting back
dialog: with freedom of the press - which
dialog: they absolutely will - and it comes
dialog: out that we had these documents and
dialog: didn’t publish them or stand with
dialog: The Times - at best we’1l look like
dialog: we're scared. At worst it’ll seem
dialog: like the government is telling us
dialog: what we can and can’t print!
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Publishing these documents could
dialog: destroy this paper.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: There’s more than one way to do
dialog: that and you’re just letting them
dialog: have it! We’re not even going to
dialog: push back a little? What are you so
dialog: scared of?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: It’s my job to -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It’s not your job! It’s hers!
text: He points to Kay. They all look to her, she seems tiny
text: compared to the three of them. They wait for her to speak.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It... it is Mr. Beebe’s job to -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No. It’s yours to make this
dialog: decision. Just you.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: You could've told me to get off the
dialog: story. But you didn’t. You could’ve
dialog: told me to not get the documents.
dialog: But you didn’t.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: And if The Post doesn’t publish
dialog: these papers, you'll have to finda
dialog: new executive editor tomorrow.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: (scowling)
dialog: Don’t be dramatic.
text: Bradlee’s eyes don’t leave Kay’s.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You're willing to stand by that?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Absolutely.
text: She thinks, not taking this decision lightly.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: While you may feel responsible to
dialog: act as an exemplification for
dialog: freedom of the press, Mr. Bradlee,
dialog: I have a commitment to the
dialog: thousands of people employed by
dialog: this company. This isn’t their
dialog: crusade and I refuse to put them in
text: jeopardy over a... vendetta.
text: Bradlee is crest-fallen, Ignatius heaves a sigh of relief.
text: She looks to where her granddaughter spun in the sunshine
text: just days ago - lost in the memory for a moment. Finally, she
dialog: stands.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: But -
text: Bradlee perks up.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I also have a responsibility to the
dialog: public. To the readers. Even when
dialog: it might not support our own best
dialog: interests.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They lied. All of them. They lied
dialog: and told us that what we were doing
dialog: was good. That we were helping
dialog: people who couldn’t help
dialog: themselves. But that wasn’t it at
dialog: all. No one wanted us there. So,
dialog: they, we, just sent a bunch of
dialog: young men to die. It wasn’t just my
dialog: son, or your son, that they sent
dialog: over there. And it shouldn’t just
dialog: be us to know the truth.
dialog: gl.
text: She stands her ground, Fritz can’t help but be moved. Kay
text: looks to Bradlee, softening.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: They knew it was wrong. Our... our
dialog: friends knew. And they didn’t care.
text: Bradlee stares at her - the weight of it all hangs between
text: them. She catches herself in the emotion straightens herself
dialog: back out.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you guarantee me that we can go
dialog: to print without publishing the
dialog: names of anyone in danger?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: I can’t believe this.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Ignatius, I’m -
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: You can’t be actually considering
dialog: this! This is just your maternal -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Ignatius -
text: Ignatius turns to Fritz.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: You're just going to let her do
dialog: this? She can’t possibly -
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: I assure you, this is entirely Mrs.
dialog: Graham's decision.
text: Ignatius stammers. Kay hides a smile, looking back to
dialog: Bradlee.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I give you my word.
text: She thinks again, then looks up at him.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Do it. Print them.
dialog: 92.
text: She turns and walks back into the party, going back to host
text: as if nothing happened. Bradlee can hardly believe it.
scene_heading: EXT. NEWS STAND, WASHINGTON, D.C. - MORNING
text: Bradlee leans on a wall with a coffee and watches a POST
text: TRUCK deliver stacks of newspapers. The early morning
text: COMMUTERS begin to grab them. No one picks up The Times.
text: Bradlee smiles and, after a moment, walks over and picks one
text: up himself. He reads the front page: “DOCUMENTS REVEAL U.S.

scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS, WASHINGTON, D.C. - MORNING
text: MEN and WOMEN, young and old, pick up copies of the

scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN, WASHINGTON POST - MORNING
text: The usual cacophony of typewriters and go-getters rushes
text: through the giant room. Gene is in his office. Howard sips
text: coffee - his eyes glued to the glass wall of Bradlee’s office
text: where Fritz, Kay, and Bradlee sit inside. Meg approaches.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: They’re going to catch you staring.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Then he shouldn’t have made it a

speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Chalmers onto the next piece?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: He’s got Murrey working on one too.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: Think we'll get to print them?
speaker_heading: HOWARD

scene_heading: INT. BRADLEE’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - SAME TIME
text: An awkward silence hangs between Bradlee, Kay, and Fritz -
text: who has a legal pad on his lap.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You're sure they’re going to call.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I met the AAG once. Tiny hands.
text: Kay hides a smile. After a few moments of unbearable
text: silence... the phone at Cynthia’s desk rings. After a moment -
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA (0.S.)
dialog: It’s the Assistant Attorney
dialog: General.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Put him through.
text: Bradlee takes a deep breath, Kay doesn’t know what to expect.
text: Bradlee’s phone rings and he puts it on speaker.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: This is Bradlee. I have Mrs. Graham
dialog: and Mr. Beebe here with me.
speaker_heading: BALILES (0.S.)
dialog: Good morning, this is Assistant

speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Hello, Mr. Baliles.
text: Fritz begins making notes.
speaker_heading: BALILES
dialog: (rote)
dialog: Mr. Bradlee, I have been advised by
dialog: the Secretary of Defense that the
dialog: material published in The
dialog: Washington Post this morning
dialog: contains information relating to
dialog: the national defense of the United
dialog: States and bears a top-secret
dialog: classification.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: BALILES (CONT'D)
dialog: As such, the publication of this
dialog: information is directly prohibited
dialog: by the provision of the Espionage
dialog: Law, Title 18, United States Code,
dialog: Section 793.
text: Fritz closes his eyes tight. Kay and Bradlee exchange a
dialog: glance.
speaker_heading: BALILES (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Moreover, further publication will
dialog: cause irreparable injury to the
dialog: defense interest of the United
dialog: States. Accordingly, I respectfully
dialog: request that you publish no further
dialog: information of this character and
dialog: advise me that you have made
dialog: arrangements for the return of
dialog: these documents to the Department
dialog: of Defense.
text: Bradlee looks to Fritz who gives him another nod of the head.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Thank you for the call, Mr.
dialog: Baliles, but we respectfully
dialog: decline.
speaker_heading: BALILES (0.S.)
dialog: Thank you for your time.
text: The call ends. The moment hangs there briefly.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: What’s next?
text: Fritz sighs and stands.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: We’re going to court. Today.
dialog: They’11 try and prove we knowingly
dialog: published something that was a
dialog: danger to the US government.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Did he call us spies?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Not as glamorous as you thought, is
dialog: it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’1l call when I have more news.
dialog: For now... keep them writing.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: FRITZ (CONT'D)
dialog: We’ve opened the door. No reason
dialog: closing it until they order us to.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Will it come to that?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Most assuredly.
dialog: (to Bradlee)
dialog: You wanted a fight.
text: Fritz leaves, she looks at Bradlee.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Bradlee?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (in a daze)
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: When was the last time you slept?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The day before I started this job.
text: Beat. Bradlee wonders why she’s still there.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Mrs. Graham?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I spoke to Mr. McNamara.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: What? You - will he -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: He’s not a villain.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You don’t have to be a villain to
dialog: do villainous things.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: He won’t be a source for you.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Mrs. Graham -
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (standing)
dialog: I think I’11 go with Fritz to the
dialog: hearing.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: They probably won’t let you in. Why
dialog: did you tell me if you’re not going
dialog: to let me -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Because I didn’t want you to think
dialog: I was afraid to ask.
text: He’s stunned by this. A moment hangs between them.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

text: down the hallway, part walk/part run. She’s about to open the
dialog: door to the courtroom -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I wouldn’t do that. It’s a closed
dialog: hearing.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Shoot. Have they been in there for
dialog: long?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (checking her watch)
text: A few hours.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Shoot, shoot.
text: She presses her ear to the door, Kay watches her from the
text: corner of her eye. Finally, the young woman sits.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I was supposed to bring something
dialog: to my boss but I had to finish up a
dialog: few things and there was so much
dialog: traffic and I - well - you just
dialog: wouldn’t think - at this time of
dialog: night.
text: Kay nods once, trying not to get involved. A moment passes.
text: They woman gives Kay a once over.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you... Mrs. Graham?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (forcing a smile)
dialog: I think we’re supposed to keep our
text: voices down.
text: The young woman nods. Another moment passes.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: I’m probably not supposed to say
dialog: this, but I hope you win.
text: Kay looks at her, a strange expression on her face.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I mean, I think what you’re doing -
dialog: printing those papers - I think
dialog: it’s right. It’s the right thing to
dialog: do.
text: Kay nods once. The woman waits a minute but can’t help
dialog: herself -
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I read that interview you did and -
dialog: I know people been giving you a
dialog: hard time but - I think you gotta
dialog: just ignore them. It’s not easy
dialog: being the only one of us in a room
text: with a bunch of them.
text: She gestures her head towards the door.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Sometimes people don’t appreciate
dialog: how much you’re doing until you’ve
dialog: already done it. And I like seeing
dialog: someone tell these guys what’s
dialog: what.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: But don’t tell my boss I said that -
dialog: he'd fire me just for talking to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Let’s not have that happen.
text: The woman nods and goes back to sitting there in silence. Kay
text: realizes she might have been rude.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: The woman offers a friendly smile, JUST as the doors to the
text: courtroom open. Kay stands, Fritz walks over - there’s a
text: frenzy coming from all the lawyers as they spill out.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: They’re issuing a restraining order
dialog: until we can get back in to see the
dialog: judge.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Tonight?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: (tired)
dialog: Monday. And if that doesn’t work
dialog: for them, we'll head to the Supreme
dialog: Court of Appeals.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (angry) |
dialog: We can’t print anything?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Not after tonight. But, it’s not
dialog: over yet.

scene_heading: GOVERNMENT LAWYER.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BRADLEE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Bradlee walks in disheveled, exhausted. He drops his
text: briefcase on the ground and stands there for a moment.
text: Enjoying the quiet. He hears the faint sound of a TV.
dialog: 99.
scene_heading: INT. DEN, BRADLEE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Marina is asleep in front of the TV. He smiles. He moves to
text: turn it off but sees that it’s special news program on
text: Vietnam produced by ECO. He sits for a minute.
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL
dialog: “... The truth of the matter is,
dialog: the Paris Peace Talks, hailed as a
dialog: major breakthrough in 1968 have, by
dialog: 1971 achieved nothing. The
dialog: delegates still turn up, make
dialog: accusatory speeches and leave. Week
dialog: in week out, the delegates play
dialog: their parts but its all become a
text: puppet show without an audience.
dialog: And in the meantime, the war goes
dialog: on and the casualty lists mount...”
text: Bradlee grits his jaw as he watches.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO, BRADLEE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
text: Tony sits on a stool, painting in splattered overalls. A
text: record player plays softly, a cigarette smokes in an ashtray.
text: Bradlee walks towards the studio with a beer. Eventually he
text: leans on the doorway. She knows he’s there but she doesn’t
dialog: need to acknowledge it.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I thought that one was finished.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're thinking of a different one.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Oh.
text: Their conversation is slow. At ease. He walks to the worn-out
dialog: recliner he sat in for many nights in the early days of their
text: marriage. Now, it’s cluttered with papers. He moves them off
dialog: and sits.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Your daughter snuck down to watch
dialog: TV again.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You look terrible.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: So I’ve been told.
text: He watches her paint. The sounds from the record playing in
dialog: between them.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fritz thinks it’s going to go to
dialog: the Supreme Court.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That’s what you wanted, right?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Yea, I -
text: He trails off.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I think I messed this one up.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Just because you might not win
dialog: doesn’t mean you messed up. Not
dialog: everything is supposed to go your
dialog: way, Ben.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Do you?
dialog: Maybe he doesn’t.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: If this goes bad they’re going to
dialog: put the blame on me. I guess... I
dialog: just don’t know if it was worth it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Don’t be an idiot, Bradlee.
text: He stares at her.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yea, maybe you won’t win. Maybe
dialog: you'll have to resign and start all
dialog: over again. But you did the right
dialog: thing. That’s worth it.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: Besides, you asked for the blame in
dialog: the first place. You can’t put that
dialog: on anyone else now that you’re up
dialog: shit’s creek.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You sure know how to cut to the
dialog: quick.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Of course. It’s why you married me.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Ah, is that why, I keep forgetting.
text: It’s a joke, but there’s some truth to it. He watches her
text: again - lost in thought.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: What do you think of her?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Who? Our daughter?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No, Mrs. Graham.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don’t know her.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: That’s never stopped you from
dialog: having an opinion before.
text: She takes her time with it, turning to look at him.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I think... she’s in a position she
dialog: never thought she’d have and I’m
dialog: sure plenty of people don’t think
dialog: she should be in. If I were her...
dialog: I wouldn’t even know where to
dialog: start.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM, WASHINGTON POST - MORNING
text: Copies of The Washington Post are dropped. Each headline
dialog: details the progress that’s been made on the case: “GESELL
scene_heading: UPHOLDS PREVIOUS RULING IN ‘PENTAGON PAPERS’ CASE, APPEAL
text: HEADED TO FEDERAL COURT”, “COURT FINDS IN FAVOR OF POST,
text: RESTRAINING ORDER UPHELD”, “TIMES AND POST CASES ENJOINED,
text: CASE HEADED TO SUPREME COURT”, “SUPREME COURT HEARING ON
text: ‘PENTAGON PAPERS’ SET FOR EMERGENCY SATURDAY HEARING”.
text: IGNATIUS slams each paper onto the table. Kay watches
text: patiently from her normal seat; Fritz looks on. The past week
text: has taken a toll. They look exhausted.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: And now our IPO is being
text: reconsidered.
text: A murmur amongst the board members.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: They’re just doing their due
dialog: diligence. This is a big offering.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Due diligence?
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Yes, Paul. And what is it -
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS
dialog: Please don’t ask what I’m
dialog: insinuating. I think it’s clear:
dialog: ever since Mrs. Graham took over we
dialog: have seen not only a steady decline
text: in profits but, now, a jump off the
dialog: cliff!
text: Kay lets it happen - but she’s not happy about it.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS (CONT’D)
dialog: I was brought here because of my
dialog: experience and never have I seen
dialog: such a disregard for the best
dialog: intentions of a company. If I offer
dialog: my opinion and it is ignored once,
dialog: I’ll let it go. Twice, I’1l raise
dialog: my hand. Three times - I must
dialog: speak! If no one else will, I will
dialog: stand up for the interests of our
dialog: Board.
text: That’s a dagger to Kay’s heart. Fritz surveys the room, he
text: can’t tell whose side the boardmembers are on.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: IGNATIUS (CONT’D)
dialog: Mrs. Graham, your decision to allow
dialog: The Post to become involved in this
text: crusade is beyond reprehensible.
dialog: You've repeatedly allowed Mr.
dialog: Bradlee and his - group - to have
dialog: his way with this paper. Through
dialog: weak and misguided leadership. And,
dialog: frankly, it is something I am sure
dialog: that neither your father, nor your
dialog: husband -
text: She stands, surprising everyone - not the least of which,
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That will be quite enough. It is
dialog: perfectly clear, Mr. Ignatius, that
dialog: you and I have very different
dialog: opinions of how to run this
dialog: company. However, whether you agree
dialog: with my decisions or not, I have
dialog: made them. Not you.
text: Ignatius is almost red with anger.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: If it is your intention to bully me
dialog: into leaving this company, I assure
dialog: you - that is not going to happen.
dialog: If you truly believe that the
dialog: correct step is for me to step
dialog: down, please - take a vote. But I
dialog: recommend you do it after the
dialog: hearing tomorrow. You may not think
dialog: I know much, but I can tell you
dialog: your headline will sell much better
dialog: if you fire a felon. Not just a
dialog: woman.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I hate to disappoint you, Mr.
dialog: Ignatius, but Phil Graham never
dialog: cared for bullies and he wouldn’t
dialog: have cared for you.
text: She leaves the room, emboldened. The boardmembers shocked.
scene_heading: INT. GENE’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - DAY
text: Bradlee knocks, Gene looks up.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You got a minute?
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Sure.
text: Bradlee walks in and shuts the door behind him.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You coming to the hearing tomorrow?
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: I think I should probably stay
dialog: here. In case the world decides to
dialog: keep rotating while you’re all in
dialog: court.
text: Bradlee laughs once.
speaker_heading: GENE (CONT'D)
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: No... I - I need to ask a favor.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (joking)
dialog: Hang on, let me write this down.
text: Bradlee’s mood is serious, Gene’s expression changes.
speaker_heading: GENE (CONT’D)
dialog: Jesus, Ben. What?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: If this thing goes bad. Which... I
dialog: don’t know. I thought it would be
dialog: over by now and it’s not so -
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: They’re just -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: When Fritz Beebe tells you it
dialog: doesn’t look good... it doesn’t do
text: much to bolster confidence.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If I have to resign, if it comes to
dialog: that, I need you to stay.
text: Gene is stunned. A moment hangs between them.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Well, that’s about the last thing I
dialog: ever thought I’d hear.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Howard’s going to want the job and
dialog: if I’m here he’1ll get it. But if
dialog: things go south and I have to leave
dialog: - I need you to be here. They’11
dialog: listen to you and I - look, I may
dialog: not have done a lot around here
dialog: but... I assembled a great
dialog: newsroom. I need you to keep them
dialog: together for as long as you can.
text: Gene thinks a minute.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Alright.
text: Bradlee stands and offers his hand, Gene rises and takes it.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: But if this goes your way I’m still
dialog: getting the hell out of here.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, GRAHAM HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kay sits at the table, writing in a notepad, she keeps
text: scribbling things out. Frustrated. A half-empty glass of wine
text: next to her. She hears the front door open and turns to look,
text: concerned. Lally walks in, looking exhausted. Solemn.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Lally?
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: I’m sorry I didn’t call.
text: She sits across from her mother.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Is everything OK? Where’s
dialog: Katharine?
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: With Yann. I just... I needed to
dialog: get away for a bit.
text: Kay goes to the cabinet and gets a glass for Lally. Then
text: pours a hefty one, surprising her daughter. Lally looks at
dialog: the notepad, confused -
speaker_heading: LALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’re you -
text: It dawns on her.
speaker_heading: LALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: The case - I didn’t -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It’s alright. I’m not getting
dialog: anywhere.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: You have to make a statement?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Fritz thinks it would be best.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Can I help?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Oh no. Honestly, I’m not even quite
dialog: sure where to begin.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: I’m sorry - I should’ve called -
text: Kay waves her hand to stop her.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Growing up, we always had to be
dialog: scarce. Out of sight and all. I
dialog: never wanted that for my children
text: but - now. Well. It’s quiet again.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: We should visit more.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: I raised you to have your own
dialog: lives. It would be hypocritical of
dialog: me to ask for them back.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: No it wouldn’t. You’re allowed to
dialog: ask for things, Mom.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Do you? Sometimes I feel like you
dialog: don’t speak up because... I don’t
dialog: know. You're afraid you’1l sound -
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That’s not fair. When -
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Fair or not, it’s the truth.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: My children always think they know
dialog: everything.
text: Lally watches her mother with interest.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: People thought I must have been
dialog: devastated when your grandfather
dialog: picked your father to run the
dialog: company instead of me.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: Weren’t you?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: No. I was... proud. Your father was
dialog: the smartest man I’d ever met. When
dialog: your grandfather chose him it was
dialog: like, well, it was like he chose
dialog: me. Because Phil had been my
dialog: choice.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: But... He didn’t choose you.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: It’s different for you. Your
dialog: generation - women can get away
dialog: with having expectations -
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: No we can’t! But we do it because
dialog: if we don’t... well. No one’s going
dialog: to do it for us.
dialog: 108.
text: Kay watches her daughter.
speaker_heading: LALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I grew up in this house, too, Mom.
dialog: Dad was smart but you... you’re the
dialog: one that kept it all together.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Grandpa was wrong.
text: Kay looks down at her notepad.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I keep wandering into your father’s
dialog: office. Hoping that I’1l find
dialog: something new there. A journal or a
dialog: letter - telling me what I’m
dialog: supposed to do next. What steps to
dialog: take - If I made the right ones.
speaker_heading: LALLY
dialog: (soft)
dialog: This isn’t about Dad. Or Grandpa.
dialog: This is about you. And you've
dialog: already done the hardest part - now

scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM, SUPREME COURT BUILDING - DAY

text: 60s) sit in their leather chairs and listen to the arguments.
text: There are three sets of lawyers: the government (GRISWOLD,
text: 40s), the Post, and the Times. At the moment, Griswold is at
dialog: the lectern.
text: Kay is in a pew directly behind Fritz, next to Lally.
text: Ignatius is nearby. Bradlee a few behind her next to Howard.
text: He’s nervous, foot tapping on the ground. The doors open and
text: Bagdikian sneaks in, taking a seat next to Meg.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: You see how many people are
dialog: outside?
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: MEG
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I’ve been here for the last four
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: GRISWOLD
dialog: ... We also contend that the
dialog: publishing of these documents is a
dialog: dishonorable and treasonous act
dialog: that will dramatically undermine
dialog: the President’s power to conduct
dialog: foreign affairs and in authority as
dialog: Commander-in-Chief of the Armed
dialog: Forces.
text: Bradlee and Kay both wince at Griswold’s use of
dialog: “dishonorable”.
speaker_heading: GRISWOLD (CONT’D)
dialog: As the scope of these documents is
dialog: so vast, it’s hard to fully warn
dialog: against the consequences of them
dialog: being made public. To print these
dialog: papers without consulting the
dialog: government is to exercise a
dialog: criminal disregard for the safety
dialog: of this country and our troops
dialog: overseas.
text: Griswold closes his folder and takes his seat.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BLACK
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Griswold. Now I
dialog: understand that Mrs. Katharine
dialog: Graham will be making a statement.
text: Bradlee is surprised. She rises and walks to the lectern.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Thank you, Judge Black.
text: She takes a breath, steeling herself.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: As you said, my name is Katharine
dialog: Graham and I am the owner and
text: publisher of the Washington Post.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’ve been in the newspaper business
dialog: almost my whole life. My father
dialog: purchased the paper when I was
dialog: sixteen and - well - all I ever
dialog: wanted to do was work at it. It...
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: took me a little longer than I
dialog: thought it would, but, well,
dialog: sometimes things happen as they
dialog: should, I think.
text: The crowd is rapt with interest.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: As I said, I’ve been in this
dialog: business nearly my whole life and
dialog: never, never, have I seen a story
dialog: that displays such a wanton
dialog: disregard for the public interest.
dialog: To have hidden these decisions made
dialog: without the people’s knowledge that
dialog: resulted in decades of torture,
dialog: murder, and oppression.
text: Bradlee is stunned by the power of her words.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: My father, when he stepped down,
dialog: issued a press release. He said,
dialog: “The citizens of a free country
dialog: have to depend on a free press for
dialog: the information necessary to the
dialog: intelligent discharge of their
dialog: duties of citizenship. That is why
dialog: the Constitution gives newspapers
dialog: express protection from Government
dialog: interference.” It... it might have
dialog: taken me a little while longer than
dialog: my father would’ve hoped to truly
dialog: understand these words but... I
dialog: believe them to be true. It is my
dialog: responsibility to stand behind my
dialog: staff and the truth of their
dialog: convictions to tell this story. It
dialog: is our duty.
text: Meg and Howard are rapt with attention. A shock to them both.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: This paper has been in my life
dialog: longer than most of my staff has
dialog: been alive. And the legacy it
dialog: carries is not just my name, but my
dialog: father’s name. My husband’s name.
dialog: And my decision to publish these
dialog: papers is one that could put into
dialog: jeopardy the lot of it.
text: She almost looks back at Bradlee, but keeps her eyes forward.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: However, if the decision is made by
dialog: the courts to side with the
dialog: government, and the Washington Post
dialog: ceases to exist, I can think of no
dialog: stronger mark to leave than by
dialog: taking a stand for what is right.
dialog: And there will have been no greater
dialog: honor in my life than to be beside
dialog: the men and women of the Post while
dialog: we attempt to do just that.
text: Her voice shakes, Bradlee’s eyes are glassy but he covers.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: She steps back to her seat, she and Bradlee avoid eye
text: contact. Lally beams with pride.
speaker_heading: JUDGE BLACK
dialog: Thank you, Mrs. Graham.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, COURTHOUSE - A LITTLE LATER
text: The attendees file out. Bradlee stands with Meg and Howard.

text: attention to their conversation. He can’t find her. Bagdikian
text: jogs towards them from outside.
speaker_heading: BAGDIKIAN
dialog: There’s something you gotta see.
text: Bradlee looks around one last time to find Kay but, if she’s
text: there, she’s lost in the sea of people. He follows the trio
text: to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. SUPREME COURT, WASHINGTON, D.C. - MOMENTS LATER
text: Bradlee, Meg, Bagdikian, and Howard step out onto the iconic
text: front steps to see a PEACE RALLY taking place. Thousands of
text: people, PICKETS in the air plastered with messages like “NO
text: MORE LIES”, “BRING OUR BOYS BACK”, and “VETERANS FOR PEACE”.
text: Meg smiles and pats Bradlee on the back. He stands there,
text: hands in pockets, watching everything that’s taken place.
scene_heading: EXT. SUPREME COURT, WASHINGTON, D.C. - EARLY MORNING
text: Kay sits on a bench outside of the courtroom. Her ankles
text: crossed, posture perfect, there is an unreadable look on her
text: face. Fritz walks over.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: FRITZ
dialog: Shouldn’t be much longer.
text: She nods, he goes back to the attorneys. She seems to be ina
text: bit of a daze, trying to wrap her head around the magnitude
text: of it all. The sound of shuffling feet knocks her from her
text: thoughts. She turns, surprised to see Bradlee straightening
text: his tie and rushing towards her. He sits.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The verdict in yet?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I don’t think so.
text: He relaxes into the bench. She studies him, he finally looks
text: at her.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You didn’t think I’d leave you here
dialog: with the suits.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I'ma “suit”.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Mrs. Graham, you are much more than
dialog: that.
text: The faintest of smiles appears for a moment on her face. She
text: sits back in the bench. After a beat -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: About yesterday -—
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Did you ever see The Vagabond King?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The one with Rita Moreno?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: My father took me to see it when it
dialog: was on Broadway. I was just a
dialog: little girl but I remember being so
dialog: excited that he picked me to go
dialog: with him. Not everyone. Just me.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: He liked you.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: There’s a scene I’ve been thinking
dialog: about quite a lot lately.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Since Phil died, really. At the
text: end, when the King appears in royal
text: garb, walking down those steps for
text: the first time. All the archers
text: have their arrows pointed at him,
dialog: ready to release at any moment -
dialog: deciding what to do - deciding
dialog: if... he is worthy enough to wear
dialog: those robes.
text: She trails off into the memory, choosing to keep the
text: intention of the story private. He watches her, then -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: She looks at him, surprised.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: For... well. Not trusting you.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: (conspiratorial grin)
dialog: I didn’t trust you the whole time
dialog: either, Mr. Bradlee.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Still. I was wrong.
text: After a moment, she nods ever so slightly.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Being the victim doesn’t really
dialog: suit me. All it does is open a door
dialog: for more people to judge you.
dialog: Criticize you. And, I guess, one
dialog: day you have to just decide not to
dialog: allow them to do that anymore.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Would love to know how you did
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Sometimes in life you don’t really
dialog: decide to move on, you just do.

dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Blindly and mindlessly. I like
dialog: that.
text: Next to them, the doors to the courtroom open and Fritz turns
text: to give Kay a nod. She stands, nervously smoothing her dress.
text: She walks into the courtroom first, followed closely behind
text: by Bradlee. The doors shut.
scene_heading: INT. BRADLEE’S OFFICE, WASHINGTON POST - THE NEXT DAY
text: The front page of the Washington Post sits on his desk. The
text: headline reads, “SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF PAPERS”.
text: Bradlee looks at the famous photo of he and Kay on the steps
text: of the courthouse, celebrating their victory, a smile of
text: pride on his face. He tears it from the rest of the paper.
text: Cynthia walks in.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: We can have an actual photo framed
dialog: for you, y’know.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I like this one. Did you reach Mrs.
dialog: Graham for me?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: I left word.
text: He writes on the photo, “Wear the robes - B” then hands it to
text: Cynthia. She looks at it, confused.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Make sure that gets to her desk.
text: She nods and he rises, walking to the bullpen.
scene_heading: INT. BULLPEN, WASHINGTON POST - CONTINUOUS
text: He walks to the center of the room, his back to the
dialog: elevators.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: Hey! Can I have everyone’s
dialog: attention for a minute?
text: The staff turns. Gene steps out of his office and into the
text: doorway. Meg, Howard, Bagdikian, and Geyelin all listen from
text: various parts of the newsroom.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: This is going to be quick because
dialog: it takes an act of God for any of
dialog: you to hit a deadline even without
text: an interruption.
text: Laughs from the crowd.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT'D)
dialog: I just wanted to say thank you. I -
dialog: you know - I don’t say it enough
dialog: but. The guts. The energy and of
dialog: everyone involved in this and...
dialog: well - it has impressed me more
dialog: than anything. You were all
dialog: beautiful.
text: Behind him, Kay steps off the elevator. He doesn’t see her,
text: but others do. Bradlee’s voice shakes slightly.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: To have been able to work beside
dialog: you all, to work with our publisher
dialog: who saw through the fear of
dialog: retribution. Who saw the need to
dialog: bring it all to light. To echo Mrs.
dialog: Graham's words - to have been a
dialog: part of that is one of the greatest
dialog: honors of this newsman’s life.
text: There’s a split second of awkwardness as no one knows what to
text: do with such a level of sincerity from him. Finally, Howard
text: begins to clap. The room applauds and cheers, after a minute
text: he waves his hands -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Alright! Enough! To work!
text: They all listen and get to it. Bradlee makes eye contact with
text: Gene who offers a slight nod of the head before going into
text: his office. Bradlee turns to see Kay walking in his
text: direction. He forces a smile, slightly embarrassed. Kay
text: approaches Bradlee. There’s a moment hanging between them.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Would you have really resigned?
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Do you think Phil would have
dialog: published the Papers?
text: After a moment. That conspiratorial grin again -
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Not in a million years.
text: He laughs and they begin to walk towards his office.
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: If now is alright, I was hoping we
dialog: could discuss the Style section?
text: He starts to laugh, then realizes -
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: You’re serious.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: We can’t sit around in
dialog: sentimentality all day.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: I’m not getting into this with you
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Then it appears we are at an
dialog: impasse.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: That’s one word for it.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I’m not saying it’s entirely wrong,
dialog: but the section it - it just
dialog: doesn’t make sense to me.
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: It’s not meant for you!
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Who’s it meant for?
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: We've discussed this.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I think it deserves just another
dialog: conversation —
speaker_heading: BRADLEE
dialog: The Times -—
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Not with The Times again -
dialog: 117.
text: They walk into Bradlee’s office, where we stay outside in the
text: bullpen and watch through the glass. Bradlee sits, stubborn
text: and headstrong, feet on the desk and arms in the air out of
text: exasperation. Kay, seated across from him, thoughtful but
text: equally stubborn, politely making her point.
