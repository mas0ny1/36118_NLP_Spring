scene_heading: 1 EXT. DALSLAND, SWEDEN- TWILIGHT 1
text: A lake.
text: A forest.
dialog: A dacha.
text: A Saab outside the dacha.
text: A light within.
scene_heading: 2 INT. DACHA- NIGHT 2
text: JACK (dark, fit, mid-forties) is staring at the embers of a
text: log fire. He sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey.
text: The impressive US Army Special Forces crest tattooed on the
text: shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with JACK's quiet
text: manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair and
text: stubble. JACK is no longer young.
text: A creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder.
text: INGRID (34) is naked. With an intimate familiarity she kisses
text: JACK on the top of his head, sits close behind him and wraps
text: her arms around her lover, linking her slender hands across
text: his upper chest.
text: Her head resting on his shoulder, her face beside his, INGRID
text: and JACK watch the fire together in easy silence.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. WOODS- MORNING 3
text: INGRID leads JACK through the trees. Her coat has a white fur
text: collar. They are fresh-faced and warm from bed.
text: They head towards a vast and frozen lake.
text: JACK senses something in the woods.
text: Beneath the Conifers: impenetrable darkness.
text: JACK looks around.
text: Thick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound. There is
dialog: not the slightest breeze.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: What are you looking for?
text: Her Swedish accent is sing-song.
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing.
text: His anxiety is evident.
text: INGRID laughs out loud.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: There are no wolves in the woods so
text: close to the city.
text: JACK smiles.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. LAKESIDE- MORNING 4
text: They continue through the woods until they reach the
text: shoreline of the lake.
text: INGRID steps onto the ice.
text: Holds out her hand.
text: A beat.
text: JACK takes INGRID's hand.
text: Solid as stone, the frozen lake takes his weight.
text: They walk out, INGRID slipping and laughing.
text: The landscape is magical.
text: JACK begins to relax, slipping and swearing.
text: Suddenly, he stops.
text: There are footprints in the thin snow going out across the
dialog: lake.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Snow-hare.
text: Beside the Snow-hare's prints are those of a man.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: A hunter?
text: JACK studies the two sets of tracks.
text: Those of the Snow-hare are heading out into the lake. The
text: man's prints are heading in the opposite direction, towards
dialog: the shoreline.
text: JACK spins around in the direction they've just come from.
dialog: No one.
dialog: 3.
text: Then, about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake, a
text: low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the
dialog: branch.
text: JACK grabs INGRID, yanks her towards the cover of the
text: lakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow.
text: She grunts, winded. He lies besides her.
text: We hear the CRACK of a bullet- so quiet it might be a bough
text: snapping under the weight of winter.
dialog: It isn't.
text: JACK pulls a WALTHER PPK/S semi-automatic handgun from the
text: pocket of his Parka.
dialog: Cocks it.
dialog: Waits.
text: Then bobs up and down once.
text: There's another CRACK from the trees.
text: JACK pinpoints the spot from the drift of BLUE SMOKE, almost
text: invisible in the winter air.
text: There's someone in the shadows.
text: He rubs snow into his woollen hat, edges up until he can just
text: see over the snow and pumps THREE SHOTS into the dusk under
dialog: the trees.
text: We hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound, as if
text: JACK has just shot a tobogganist.
text: More snow slides off the trees.
text: JACK waits.
text: INGRID gathers her breath but loses her wits:
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: You have a gun.
text: JACK keeps his eyes fixed on the trees.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: You have a gun! How do you have a
dialog: gun? Why should you carry such a
dialog: weapon?
text: JACK looks at her briefly but makes no reply.
text: She is busy thinking.
dialog: So is he.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Jack?
text: He stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that
text: is just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees.
text: INGRID follows, frightened.
text: The MAN is slouched forwards in a drift of snow, his body
text: cushioned in white softness.
text: JACK kicks the sole of his boot. He's dead.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Jack talk to me!
text: JACK grabs his collar and turns him over.
text: He doesn't recognise him.
text: JACK fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing.
text: In his breast pocket he finds a MILITARY IDENTITY PASS.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A hunter.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: He's not dressed like a hunter. Why
dialog: is he alone? Hunters always go in
dialog: pairs. For safety.
text: Swiftly, JACK removes the bolt from the man's rifle and
text: throws it far into the trees.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go for help. Call the police.
text: INGRID sets off, stumbling up the track they have made
text: through the snow.
text: JACK shoots her just once, in the nape of her neck.
text: She twitches in the snow, her blood staining the white fur of
text: her coat collar.
text: From a distance, INGRID looks like a shot Snow-hair.
text: JACK approaches her.
text: And steps over her, trying not to look down.
text: Trying not to look back.
dialog: 5.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. DACHA- MORNING 5
text: Outside the dacha is another MAN, standing by a black
text: Mercedes-Benz sedan.
dialog: The second hunter.
text: He is holding an automatic pistol but he's not on alert.
text: JACK fells him easily with a bullet in the ear.
text: He removes the clip from his WALTHER and reloads it.
scene_heading: 6 INT. DACHA- MORNING 6
text: JACK packs a few belongings in a holdall.
scene_heading: 7 EXT. DACHA- MORNING 7
text: JACK smashes the CB radio in the Mercedes and removes the
text: distributor cap from the engine, burying it deep in the snow.
text: Then he gets into the Saab.
text: And drives off.
speaker_heading: 8 TITLES 8
text: Over images of: JACK on a ferry to Gotland; changing clothes
dialog: and vessels for Ystad; travelling by road to Trelleborg;
text: catching the night crossing to Travemunde; driving to Hamburg
dialog: and from Hamburg catching a train to...
scene_heading: 9 EXT. ROME- DAY 9
text: At a fast food stand not far from the central train station,
text: a middle-aged man is squirting ketchup on a hotdog.
text: It is Autumn, and without the usual mass of Summer tourists,
text: LARRY stands out as an American.
text: JACK does not.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Blending in?
text: LARRY is shocked to see JACK but pretends the hot dog is the
text: centre of attention.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Jack. What brings you to Rome?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I closed the Stockholm account.
dialog: 6.
text: LARRY might be older than JACK but he doesn't seem it. His
text: demeanour is sprightly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But there were complications.
text: Then LARRY turns and walks, eating carefully. He is not a man
dialog: who likes to get his hands dirty.
text: JACK walks beside him.
text: Both men keep a trained eye on their surroundings.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Collateral damage. Two shooters.
text: Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl.
text: LARRY takes a bite of his hot dog and casts a sideways look
speaker_heading: at JACK.
text: JACK is tired.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: There's a bar across the street:
dialog: the L'Aquila. Freshen up. Sit
dialog: tight. Give me two hours.
scene_heading: 10 INT. BAR- DAY 10
text: JACK washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of
dialog: the bar.
text: In the background, on the stereo, The White Stripes cover One
dialog: More Cup of Coffee.
text: JACK stares at himself in the mirror. He looks exhausted.
scene_heading: 11 INT. BAR- DAY 11
text: JACK is sitting at the back of the bar. He has a good view of
text: the whole establishment: including the entrance and the door
text: to the bathrooms.
text: He lights a cigarette.
text: LARRY comes in and sits opposite him.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (genuinely shocked)
dialog: You started smoking again?
text: JACK exhales.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Guess so.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Since now.
text: The WAITER slides over and flicks a cloth at the table.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Cafe?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Due.
text: The WAITER disappears.
text: A beat.
text: LARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Stockholm account. Final
dialog: installment.
text: JACK takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket.
text: LARRY is about to speak but stops.
text: The WAITER reappears and puts down two cups of coffee.
text: LARRY puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring.
text: Then speaks low and fast:
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You can't stay here, Jack. You
dialog: won't see `em coming, not in a big
dialog: city. But you can't go far, either.
dialog: If the gentlemen whose accounts you
dialog: closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo,
dialog: Simenov- any of the first division-
dialog: you have four or five hours at most
dialog: before every airport, train
dialog: station, bus stop, toll booth and
dialog: ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje
text: is under surveillance.
text: JACK smokes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So.
text: Not a question. An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly
text: what he's talking about. And JACK is listening.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So. You find a hole- somewhere
dialog: nearby- and you crawl into it and
dialog: you stay put until I say it's safe
dialog: to come out.
text: JACK's expression is as immoveable as a cliff face.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Turn right outside the bar then
dialog: second left. Via Spinetti. You'll
dialog: find a silver Citroen C2 with
dialog: Chieti plates. Check the glove box
text: and follow the map. Castelvecchio.
dialog: It's a fucking fortress. Literally.
dialog: And as dead as a graveyard. Anyone
dialog: within a three to five mile radius
dialog: you'll see `em coming.
text: He pushes something across the table. A MOBILE PHONE in a
text: cellophane bag.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Get there. Stay there.
text: LARRY finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his
text: mouth with a napkin.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Do nothing `till you get my call.
scene_heading: 12 INT. CAR- DAY 12
text: JACK gets into a compact Citroen C2: nothing flash.
text: He opens the glove compartment and finds a PLAIN MANILLA
speaker_heading: ENVELOPE.
dialog: Inside the envelope is:
text: -a PASSPORT bearing Jack's photo in the name of Edward Clarke
text: -a DRIVER'S LICENSE in the same name
text: -and a MAP.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY 13
text: A long tunnel: one of the longest in Europe.
text: JACK at the wheel.
text: It seems like night: red stripes, strip lights, shadows.
text: Vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes.
dialog: 9.
text: A button of light, expanding...
dialog: ...as we burst into daylight.
scene_heading: 14 EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY 14
dialog: We're in another world.
text: JACK'S CAR is winding its way up a twisting mountain road
dialog: towards...
text: ...a ramshackle, lonely, desolate Italian HILLTOP TOWN.
text: The town sits beneath it's own castle. Medieval towers,
text: gables, streets and church bells: framed by the snow-capped
text: mountain peaks beyond.
dialog: This is not the Italy of E.M. Forster or of Bella Tuscany.
dialog: This is the Italy where the Crusaders built their fortresses.
dialog: The Italy where Sergio Leone conceived of his great Westerns.
text: A CHURCH BELL tolls...
scene_heading: 15 EXT. CROSS ROADS- DAY 15
text: JACK stops the car.
text: At the crossroads is a SIGNPOST pointing to the town.
dialog: The sign reads:
scene_heading: CASTELVECCHIO.
scene_heading: 16 INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS 16
text: JACK looks at the sign.
text: He looks up at the silent town, at the vast stone ramparts.
text: An OLD MAN comes out of a crooked medieval doorway, stares at
text: JACK and disappears into another building.
text: JACK looks at the dead sockets of the windows, random beneath
text: the rotting patchwork of rooves.
text: A DOG barks. The WIND hisses. The atmosphere is deathly.
text: JACK makes a decision.
text: And drives away.
scene_heading: 17 EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY 17
text: We see JACK'S CAR heading away from CASTELVECCHIO.
dialog: 10.
text: The CAR crosses a spectacular VIADUCT that spans a deep
speaker_heading: RAVINE.
text: The driver's window opens.
text: A MOBILE PHONE in a cellophane bag is thrown out.
text: It drops hundreds of feet down the ravine.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 18 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, MAIN SQUARE- DAY 18
text: CASTEL DEL MONTE is a well preserved, happy looking little
text: mediaeval town with a handful of tourists.
text: A chunk of time has passed.
text: JACK is sitting on a table outside a small BAR wearing dark
text: glasses, sipping a coffee and reading a guide book. He looks
text: like a tastefully dressed, well educated American tourist. He
text: blends in. And no one pays him much attention as he finishes
text: his coffee, pays his bill, gets up and leaves.
text: We follow JACK as he passes the parapet of the town ramparts
text: and looks across the spectacular valley...
text: ...towards the deserted CASTELVECCHIO.
scene_heading: 19 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY 19
text: At a leisurely pace, JACK passes a row of municipal rubbish
text: bins just inside the fortified gates to the old town.
text: Hidden well behind the bins we catch sight of JACK's parked
speaker_heading: CAR.
scene_heading: 20 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY 20
dialog: We're right in the heart of the mediaeval old town: like the
text: stronghold at the centre of a castle.
text: JACK approaches a small family run bed and breakfast just off
dialog: the main square.
text: The sign reads: "PENSIONE ABRUZZO".
scene_heading: 21 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- DAY 21
text: The internal courtyard is refreshingly cool.
dialog: 11.
text: In the centre of the courtyard is a FOUNTAIN made of marble
text: shot through with black veins.
text: In the fountain stands an alabaster STATUE OF A GIRL. She's
text: wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water
text: falls. The water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre
text: diameter pipe made of bronze.
text: As JACK crosses the courtyard he glances at the STATUE.
text: He finds it hard to tear his eyes away.
scene_heading: 22 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY 22
text: A toothbrush in the glass by the sink.
text: The guidebook on the bedside table.
text: Apart for this, JACK has avoided unpacking: living entirely
text: out of his holdall for some time.
text: From the holdall, JACK produces a pair of Leica 15x56 Geovid
scene_heading: BRF Rangefinding BINOCULARS.
text: Through his casement window he has good view of
scene_heading: CASTELVECCHIO.
text: He sweeps the town in grid formation: calm and methodical.
dialog: This is a routine assessment.
text: JACK's POV: apart from the occasional appearance of an old
text: man, woman or dog, the dead town across the valley is empty.
scene_heading: 23 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 23
text: JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed and wide
dialog: awake.
text: Taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame...
text: ...is his WALTHER semi-automatic handgun.
scene_heading: 24 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY 24
text: Blinding SUN fills frame.
text: JACK is ostensibly photographing the sights: the mediaeval
text: architecture, the square, the church.
scene_heading: 25 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY 25
text: The CHURCH is at the top of town. A PRIEST, dressed in black,
dialog: surveys the world below him:
dialog: 12.
text: Locals are going about their business, a few scattered
text: tourists are enjoying their holiday. One `tourist' catches
text: the PRIEST's attention.
text: Perhaps it's his build. Or the fact that he's the only
text: tourist on his own. Or perhaps it's the obsessive grid-like
text: methodology with which JACK photographs the little town...
scene_heading: 26 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, ALLEYWAY- DAY 26
text: JACK turns casually down one of the town's many narrow
dialog: alleyways.
text: The alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind
text: corners and dark tunnels, the street enclosed by arches,
text: criss-crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by
text: outside stairwells. It's a stalker's heaven- or hell-
dialog: depending on how dangerous the prey.
text: JACK proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a
text: crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS converge. Each
text: alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of
text: steepness. JACK photographs each alleyway.
text: From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game
text: show on television. From another alleyway comes the sound of
text: a barking dog.
text: No dog is visible.
text: Curious, JACK turns around, walking back the way he came.
text: The sound of barking gets louder.
text: On his right hand side, JACK finds a HIDDEN ARCHWAY.
text: The HIDDEN ARCHWAY resembles an archer's slit but is big
text: enough for a gown man to slip through. Unlike a window, the
text: `slit' is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence
text: of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls.
text: The confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap
text: between them very, very difficult to spot.
text: JACK slips though the HIDDEN ARCHWAY.
text: Inside is a courtyard.
scene_heading: 27 INT. COURTYARD- DAY 27
text: Rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms.
text: A MONGREL tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash
text: keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into JACK.
text: JACK stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and
dialog: fury.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY- DAY 28
text: JACK reappears through the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and slips back into
text: the narrow alleyway. It's like he's materialised from thin
dialog: air.
text: He takes 2 PHOTOGRAPHS:
text: -first of the HIDDEN ARCHWAY
text: -and then of the street sign: VIA ROMANA.
text: Just then a MAN on an original 1970s DUCATI turns down the
text: alleyway and drives towards him.
text: Casually, JACK continues walking.
text: The DUCATI gets nearer. The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a
text: black crash helmet with a tinted visor.
text: JACK picks up his pace.
text: The DUCATI is ten metres away.
text: JACK's right hand moves towards his pocket.
dialog: Five metres.
text: JACK's hand goes in his pocket.
dialog: Two metres.
dialog: BANG!
text: JACK drops to his knees.
dialog: BANG!
text: The DUCATI backfires for a second time.
text: A pause.
text: Still on his knees, JACK pretends to tie his right shoe lace.
text: The MAN ON THE DUCATI stops outside an apartment further up
text: the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his
text: helmet. He's a corpulent, ruddy faced Italian man in his late
dialog: sixties.
text: He glances at JACK.
speaker_heading: JACK stands.
speaker_heading: MAN ON DUCATI
dialog: Buon giorno!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Buon giorno.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MAN ON DUCATI
dialog: Da dove provenite?
text: For an instant, the directness of the question catches JACK
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: MAN ON DUCATI
dialog: Ah! L'Americano!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Si. Il Americano.
text: JACK's pronunciation is good but his grammar is a bit rusty.
text: Perhaps he's playing up on this. It suits the role of
dialog: American tourist.
text: The MAN laughs enthusiastically emphasizing the correct
dialog: grammar:
speaker_heading: MAN ON DUCATI
dialog: L'Americano ! L'Americano!
text: A WOMAN'S VOICE comes from within the house- loud and angry-
text: distracting the MAN ON THE DUCATI, who screams back
text: passionately, enters his front door, and shuts it behind him
text: with a hearty slam.
text: JACK walks on.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY 29
text: JACK puts some coins in a CIGARETTE MACHINE.
text: The MACHINE takes his money but won't dispense his
dialog: cigarettes.
text: He hits the refund button but nothing happens.
text: JACK checks the time.
text: And thumps the machine hard.
text: Footsteps.
text: JACK adjusts his position and checks the time again.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Can I help you?
text: The man behind him is reflected in the surface of JACK's
text: battered ROLEX.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm no good with machines.
dialog: 15.
text: JACK turns, smiling politely.
text: The PRIEST smiles back.
text: He is dressed in an ill-fitting, un-stylish black suit, a
text: black silk stock and a deep Roman collar fraying at the edge.
text: His name is FATHER BENEDETTO. He is older than JACK.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: You are American.
text: This is stated matter-of-factly: like a man practising
dialog: English.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Si.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: You speak Italian?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Poco.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Va bene! You stay at Pensione
dialog: Arbruzzo.
dialog: Also a statement: this time with touch of triumph.
text: JACK is disconcerted but doesn't show it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not for much longer.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: On vacation?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Working vacation.
text: This much is true- after a fashion. They speak in English
dialog: unless otherwise specified:
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Lavoro? Che genere de lavoro?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Photographer.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Va bene. Che genere de fotografia?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pictures of the region.
dialog: Architecture, landscapes...
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: People?
dialog: 16.
text: He stands straight and smiles winningly.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: No people. Sights and landmarks.
dialog: For guidebooks, magazines...
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Ah! Magazine! Which magazine?
text: JACK shows no discomfort.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Actually it's a syndicate. Lots of
dialog: different publications. Um... Casa
dialog: editrice.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Va bene. So you must share a glass
dialog: of wine with me. Questa sera. This
dialog: evening.
text: A beat.
text: JACK is slightly thrown.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're very kind, but I...
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Certo. You want to know the truth
dialog: about Abruzzo? A priest sees
dialog: everything.
scene_heading: 30 EXT. PAY PHONE, CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY 30
text: JACK is using the local PAY PHONE.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Do you have any idea how long I've
dialog: been trying to reach you? What
dialog: happened to the cell I gave you?
text: JACK speaks quietly, keeping an eye on the town square:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Did I forget to mention my
dialog: electromagnetic hypersensitivity?
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Don't get jumpy on me, Jack. That
dialog: cell was secure.
text: JACK lights a cigarette.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I've got a job. It's a custom fit.
dialog: You don't even have to pull the
dialog: trigger.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who's the client?
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Relax. She triple checks out. Plus
dialog: she comes to you. You don't have to
dialog: move an inch.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is a small town, Larry. I
dialog: don't like small towns. I grew up
dialog: in one. Besides, I'm already
dialog: attracting attention.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: So will anyone who's trying to kill
dialog: you.
dialog: This is a good point.
text: JACK lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll think about it.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Think about this. I cleaned up your
dialog: shit and made you disappear. You
dialog: owe me my usual twenty percent
dialog: commission plus the first
dialog: installment. The rest is yours.
dialog: After this you're free.
text: On JACK.
text: Turning over the word.
scene_heading: 31 INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S HOUSE- MAGIC HOUR 31
text: The SUN is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook
text: the hilltop town.
text: JACK is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt.
text: He's sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of
text: a crumbling fifteenth century edifice, overlooked yet
text: secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO pours two large glasses of brandy from a
text: globulous green bottle of ARMAGNAC and sniffs his drink like
text: a honey bee hovering over a bloom.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Que siamo! The quality of the
dialog: brandy is good, the liquor is
text: smooth and the glass warmed by the
dialog: sun.
text: He pronounces warmed "war-med". His English is sophisticated
text: but quaint, like an out-of-date book.
text: JACK sniffs his drink before he sips it. Not like a
dialog: connoisseur: like a White House taster checking the safety of
dialog: a Presidential beverage.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
speaker_heading: (in ENGLISH)
dialog: The only good thing to come from
dialog: the Francesi, everything else...
text: FATHER BENEDETTO grimaces.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: The French are... pezzi di merda.
dialog: This is not an American discovery.
dialog: Italians have known this for
dialog: centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome
dialog: called France the province of Gaul,
dialog: they were just the same. Arrogant
text: sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy
dialog: and their wine effeminate. Only
dialog: their brandy is worthy of any
dialog: attention.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
speaker_heading: (in ENGLISH)
dialog: Forgive me. I speak too fast. You
dialog: study our history?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: You come to Italy to make a guide
dialog: book and you don't care about
dialog: history?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I take pictures, father.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Of course. You are American. You
dialog: think you can escape history. You
dialog: live for the present.
dialog: 19.
text: A beat.
text: JACK likes this man. His shrewdness is disconcerting but
dialog: humane.
text: JACK sips his brandy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I try to, father.
scene_heading: 32 EXT. L'AQUILA- EVENING 32
text: Suburban sprawl with a mediaeval heart. L'AQUILA is the
dialog: capital of the Abruzzo region and the nearest big town to
dialog: Castel del Monte and Castelveccio.
text: Like these two villages L'AQUILA is relatively isolated,
text: nestled high up in the Appenine mountains.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. L'AQUILA, SHOPPING STREET- EVENING 33
text: JACK comes out of a SUPERMARKET carrying two bags of
text: groceries and turns quickly down a dark side street.
scene_heading: 34 EXT. L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA- EVENING 34
text: JACK passes a sign for a MODELLING AGENCY. It's a small,
text: inconspicuous sign, but it catches his eye because its
text: graphics are subtly lewd and it's attached to the buzzer of
text: what is otherwise a purely residential apartment block.
text: Entering the apartment block is a beautiful twenty four year-
dialog: old Italian girl.
speaker_heading: CLARA.
text: She catches JACK's eye.
text: He walks on.
scene_heading: 35 INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 35
text: The remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal: apple,
text: pecorino cheese, honey and walnuts.
text: On his lap top, JACK has organised several weeks worth of
text: PHOTOGRAPHS of CASTEL DEL MONTE into three categories:
dialog: 1. Street plan
dialog: 2. Exit routes/car
dialog: 3. Exit routes/foot
dialog: 20.
text: Now he is cleaning and oiling his WALTHER PPK/S.
scene_heading: 36 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY 36
text: JACK completes his morning exercises then showers and
text: dresses. His manner is precise and methodical. Only a man who
dialog: has lived alone for many years can live like this.
text: When his preparations are complete, he picks up his
text: BINOCULARS and studies the nearby town of CASTELVECCHIO
text: through his medieval casement window.
scene_heading: 37 EXT. CASTELVECCIO, JACK'S POV- CONTINUOUS 37
dialog: The dead town has come to life!
text: There's a MARKET in progress. The central piazza is a hive of
text: activity. Food, local produce, clothes and cheap CD stalls.
text: The market has attracted TOURISTS. Standing by a phone box
text: not far from a cheese stall is an attractive WOMAN in dark
text: glasses. She's rifling through her handbag, searching for
text: something. Under her right arm is a rolled up copy of Il
dialog: Messaggero.
text: We notice the front page of the Italian daily newspaper has
dialog: been folded in half.
scene_heading: 38 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- CONTINUOUS 38
text: JACK lowers his binoculars.
dialog: Thinks.
dialog: Decides to proceed with caution.
scene_heading: 39 EXT. CASTELVECCHIO- DAY 39
text: Moving through the busy market, JACK is also carrying a copy
dialog: of Il Messaggero...
text: ...with the front page folded in half.
text: He approaches the OLD WOMAN running a cheese stall.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Un po' di formaggio, per favore.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Quale? Pecorino, parmigiano?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Questo.
dialog: 21.
dialog: He points.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: E un po' di pecorino.
text: JACK glances casually around for the WOMAN.
text: She's sitting outside a CAFE about twenty metres away,
text: chatting on her cellphone.
text: JACK pays for his cheese and approaches the cafe.
scene_heading: 40 EXT. CASTELVECCHIO, CAFE- DAY 40
text: JACK sits at an empty table next to the WOMAN.
text: She finishes her call in English. She's well spoken. As she
text: replaces the phone in her handbag, she knocks the newspaper
text: off her table.
text: JACK picks it up.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Grazie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Prego. You're welcome.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You're American.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: "Amidst gathering clouds".
text: The WOMAN speaks quickly, purposefully, barely looking at
speaker_heading: JACK.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You're assuming I'm English or
dialog: you'd never have mentioned the
dialog: weather. In fact I'm Belgian but I
dialog: went to boarding school in England.
dialog: And am quite happy to converse on
dialog: all subjects meteorological.
text: Judging by her stilted choice of words this is code.
text: A WAITER comes out and flicks a cloth over the table. It's
text: nearly midday and the sun is hot. He speaks with a tired
dialog: voice:
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Buon giorno. Desidera?
text: He's addressing the WOMAN.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Una spremute di limone. Per favore.
text: Her Italian accent is perfect.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Signore?
text: The WOMAN looks at JACK for the first time, studying him,
text: awaiting his answer as if a great deal depended on it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Una gelata alla fragola. Per
dialog: favore.
text: The final fail safe.
dialog: Now they can introduce themselves:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Edward.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Mathilde.
dialog: The identification process over, there is nothing more to do
text: but get down to business- and conversation becomes suddenly
dialog: awkward.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: It's hot. My car has no air
dialog: conditioning. I asked for it,
dialog: but...
text: She trails off.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What car did they give you?
text: Her HAZEL eyes flick over the crowd in front of the cafe.
text: She doesn't answer.
text: JACK clears his throat.
dialog: Then says quietly:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Range?
text: She takes a long time to answer. When she does, she does so
text: over the rim of her half-empty coffee cup, scanning the crowd
text: like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by
dialog: her husband.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: One fifty to one seven five meters.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Time?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
text: Five seconds. Seven at the most.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Targets?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: One.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fire rate?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Rapid.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Magazine capacity?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
text: Large. Preferably 9mm Parabellum.
text: The WAITER delivers the Spremuta and the raspberry ice-cream.
text: The glass of lemon juice twists in MATHILDE's slender
dialog: fingers.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
text: The weapon must be fairly light.
dialog: And compact. Possible to be broken
text: down into its constituent parts.
speaker_heading: L'AMERICANO
dialog: How compact?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: As compact as possible.
text: JACK clears his throat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You want a submachine gun to fit in
dialog: a lady's purse?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: A small vanity case would be
dialog: permissible.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A small briefcase would be
dialog: possible.
text: A beat.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: X-rays? Camouflage: lap-top, DVD
dialog: player, MP3 or digital camera?
text: She's not sure if he's joking or not. Neither are we.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Not necessary.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Noise?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Silencer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No such thing. You'll have to make
dialog: do with a suppressor like everyone
dialog: else. It'll dampen the decibels,
dialog: dislocate the sound source and
dialog: reduce muzzle flash. I can't make
dialog: you silent but I can make you
dialog: invisible as the Finnish phrase
dialog: goes, but only as long as you're
text: prepared to lose some range.
text: JACK scans the crowd.
text: On the other side of the square he spots a YOUNG MAN in his
text: mid-thirties with short blonde hair and slight sunburn,
text: hovering by a stall. Average height, slim, athletic build;
text: sunglasses, stone-washed designer jeans very neatly pressed
text: with a sharp crease.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Two o'clock.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: By the clothes stall. Light blue
text: shirt, open at the neck, expensive
dialog: buff suede shoes. Is he with you?
text: The YOUNG MAN has disappeared into the crowd.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I didn't see him. In any case, I'm
dialog: alone.
text: A pause.
text: JACK's jaw muscles grind.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I can accept a slight loss of
dialog: range.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You want a weapon with the firing
text: capacity of a submachine gun and
text: the range of a rifle.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Can you do it?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Give me a month. To trial. Then a
dialog: week for final adjustments.
scene_heading: 41 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, LANDSCAPE- TWILIGHT 41
text: The sun is sinking.
dialog: It's hunting hour.
text: A FALCON hovers on the wind above the town, looking for prey.
scene_heading: 42 INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT 42
text: JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed but fast
dialog: asleep.
text: His eyes roll left and right beneath his lids.
text: He's dreaming.
text: In his right hand is a book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART &amp;
text: ARCHITECTURE.
text: Twitching in his sleep, JACK's grip on the ART &amp; ARCHITECTURE
text: BOOK slowly loosens...
speaker_heading: THUD!
text: As the BOOK hits the floor JACK opens his eyes, sits up and
text: rips the taped WALTHER from beneath the bed, pointing it at
dialog: the door.
dialog: Silence.
text: JACK's heart is beating.
scene_heading: 43 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- MORNING 43
text: JACK is looking through his BINOCULARS.
speaker_heading: JACK'S POV:
text: ...of a small yellow and blue Italian POST OFFICE VAN heading
text: up the winding alpine road towards CASTELVECCIO.
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: 44 EXT. CASTELVECCHIO- DAY 44
text: With the market gone, the town is once more dead.
dialog: And provides no cover.
text: JACK parks his car not far from the town square, turns off
text: the engine and gets out.
scene_heading: 45 EXT. CASTELVECCHIO, TOWN SQUARE, CAFE- DAY 45
text: JACK is sitting in the CAFE where he met Mathilde.
text: He is watching the entrance to the local POST OFFICE.
text: He studies his WATCH.
text: It's been an hour and no one has come or gone from the tiny
dialog: rural branch of the Poste Italiane.
text: JACK puts the correct amount of change on the table and gets
dialog: up...
scene_heading: 46 INT. CASTELVECCHIO, POST OFFICE- DAY 46
text: The shop is small and dusty.
text: So is the POSTMASTER.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Buon giorno.
text: The POSTMASTER grunts his reply, jutting his chin.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Il fermo posta?
text: The POSTMASTER turns to a rack of pigeonholes behind a sack
text: of mail hanging in a metal frame like an old person's walking
text: aid. From one pigeonhole he draws a bundle of general
text: delivery envelopes held together by an elastic band. Some
dialog: have been there for weeks. Months even.
speaker_heading: POSTMASTER
dialog: Nome?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Clarke.
text: Deftly, like a teller counting through a thick wad of
text: banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin, wasted
dialog: fingers.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: POSTMASTER
dialog: Clarky?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Clarke. Una pacchetto.
speaker_heading: POSTMASTER
dialog: Pacchetto!
text: This makes all the difference. The POSTMASTER clicks again,
text: disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes...
speaker_heading: POSTMASTER
dialog: Clarky, Clarky, Clarky. Ecco.
text: ...and reappearing with a PACKAGE.
text: The PACKAGE is from an Italian PHOTOGRAPHIC SUPPLIERS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Grazie.
speaker_heading: POSTMASTER
dialog: Identificazione.
text: JACK flicks his eyes downwards. He has already put his
text: PASSPORT on the counter.
text: The POSTMASTER scoops it up with bony fingers.
text: Looks from the picture to JACK.
text: JACK bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face.
scene_heading: 47 INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ARBRUZZO- EVENING 47
text: JACK unwraps the PACKAGE.
dialog: He removes:
dialog: -film
dialog: -photographic paper
dialog: -development fluids
dialog: -fixing solutions
dialog: Then:
text: -a solid, monolythic rectangular receiver made out of a
text: single piece of lightweight alloy.
dialog: -a bolt assembly.
dialog: -a barrel.
dialog: 28.
text: Only with this final piece is the puzzle complete.
text: Laid out on the floor is a SOCIMI 821 SUB-MACHINE GUN.
text: Without touching it, JACK studies the weapon like a
text: connoisseur looking at the hue of a wine. In particular he
text: notices that the SERIAL NUMBER has been scratched off.
text: Then he moves slowly, assembling the weapon with precision
dialog: engineered expertise:
text: -inserting the barrel into the front of the receiver and
dialog: securing it with the nut,
text: -opening the sidefolding tubular stock and engaging the
dialog: buttpad,
text: -snuggling the buttpad to his shoulder,
text: -looking down the barrel,
text: -and slowly squeezing back the finger-grooved TRIGGER as we
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 48 INT. L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA, CLARA'S ROOM- NIGHT 48
text: Our beautiful twenty four year-old Italian girl enters.
speaker_heading: CLARA.
text: She sits on the edge of the bed, whose ageing metal springs
text: squeak slightly, and puts her smoking cigarette in an ashtray
text: on the bedside table.
text: She kicks off her slip-on shoes.
text: Slips off her panties.
text: Lifts her light cotton dress over her head and lies back on
text: the bed in one practised motion.
text: JACK sits on the bed beside her.
text: He doesn't look at her.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN GIRL
dialog: Amore?
text: She reaches up to touch JACK as we cut to:
scene_heading: 49 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PAY PHONE- DAY 49
text: JACK is scanning the town square with his usual cautiousness.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your source in Rome.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Clean bill of health and no OC.
dialog: This was a straight favour with a
dialog: dollar chaser, Jack. The guy's got
dialog: a second cousin in NOCS on the
dialog: graft who filched him the Socimi.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I hope you paid below the odds. The
dialog: more you pay them the more cops
text: gossip in the locker room.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: No one's gossiping, Jack.
text: JACK watches FATHER BENEDETTO waving at him from the other
text: side of the square.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yet.
scene_heading: 50 EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY 50
text: FATHER BENEDETTO is sitting in his API three-wheeler.
text: This comical and endearing method of rural transportation is
text: a cross between a moped and a miniature pick-up truck.
text: In the back of the truck are a mass of writhing SNAKES.
text: The API is turning over but it won't start.
text: The bonnet is open. JACK is fixing the engine.
text: He gives a signal and FATHER BENEDETTO turns the ignition key
dialog: again.
text: This time the engine starts. FATHER BENEDETTO claps and
text: cheers.
scene_heading: 51 INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING 51
text: Sixteenth century. Sombre wood panelling stained dark with
text: polish and smoke. Two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique
text: sideboard, their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the
dialog: life of Our Lord.
text: The room is filled with a dining table: a massive black
text: edifice of oak, five inches thick with six legs fluted like
text: the columns of cathedrals.
dialog: 30.
text: Using antique crockery, ancient copper pots and utensils like
text: old fashioned instruments of torture FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: performs culinary alchemy: transforming flesh into meat,
text: dough into bread, hard earth nuggets into vegetables.
text: He hums as he cooks: Opera arias. And Johnny Cash.
text: JACK sips from a glass of wine and watches FATHER BENEDETTO
text: potter around the wood fired stove. The priest has his own
text: wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming.
scene_heading: 52 INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING 52
text: JACK eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in
dialog: silence.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO watches him, pleased to see his guest so
dialog: absorbed.
text: As soon as JACK has finished, FATHER BENEDETTO invites him to
text: help himself from the ancient tureen.
text: Then he bustles over to the stove, humming again.
text: JACK eats, studying a framed photo of FATHER BENEDETTO with
text: his arm around a tough, corpulent Italian man in his mid-
text: twenties. FABIO.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO returns to the table with a large covered
text: dish issuing steam into his face.
text: He notices JACK's eye-line.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: All the sheep in my flock are dear
dialog: to me, but some are dearer than
dialog: most. Especially those that have
text: strayed from the fold.
text: Off JACK's intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies:
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car
dialog: doctor'. But I suspect his practice
dialog: is not entirely sound. Ecco!
text: FATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish
text: revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
text: Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of
dialog: orange juice, orange peel,
dialog: chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine
dialog: and... Come si dici in Inglese?
dialog: Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth.
dialog: 31.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO serves each of them with a complete bird and
text: pours white wine into fresh glasses.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Also: salsify in garlic butter.
dialog: Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms
dialog: with truffle.
text: JACK helps himself to vegetables.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first taste.
text: JACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine.
text: The two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a
dialog: verdict.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sinful.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO shrugs.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: The Holy Father eats better than
dialog: this.
text: The flash of a smile crosses the priest's face.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Have you ever wanted to be anything
dialog: other than a priest?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Have you ever wanted to be anything
dialog: other than a... come se dice in
dialog: Inglese...?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Photographer?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Photographer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I do what I'm good at.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I'm sure you have other talents.
dialog: You have the hands of a craftsman,
dialog: not an artist. You are good with
dialog: machines. Yet you told me just the
dialog: opposite when we first met.
text: JACK hides his unease from the watchful priest.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Journalism cannot make you a rich
dialog: man.
dialog: 32.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO's eyes flick over the ROLEX.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Perhaps you are rich already?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not a young man. I have my
dialog: savings.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
speaker_heading: (in ITALIAN)
dialog: My meagre income is subject to the
dialog: vagaries of the stock market and
dialog: with church attendance declining
dialog: there's less and less money in the
dialog: offertory. But if a man has God in
dialog: his vaults...
text: He looks searchingly at JACK.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't think God is interested in
dialog: me. Father.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
speaker_heading: (in ENGLISH)
dialog: I know better than to try to make a
dialog: convert over pheasant and
dialog: Trebbiano.
text: JACK is silent.
text: The two men continue eating.
dialog: Then casually:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are the snakes for, father?
text: FATHER BENEDETTO taps the end of his nose in the universal
dialog: sign for secrecy.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: "The grave soul keeps its own
dialog: secrets, and takes its own
dialog: punishment in silence."
text: He has a twinkle in his eye. The priest is on a mission to
dialog: extract the truth... and JACK knows it.
scene_heading: 53 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- DAY 53
text: JACK is driving.
dialog: 33.
text: He checks the rear view mirror.
text: All clear.
text: JACK accelerates the CAR, driving it hard at the sidewalk.
text: The vehicle slams into the curb, mounting the pavement with a
text: thump of crunching metal.
scene_heading: 54 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE- DAY 54
text: Just east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders
text: downhill through a series of small holdings, allotments and
text: scrap metal yards.
text: The CAR moves slowly. We can hear the scrape of trailing
dialog: metal.
text: JACK pulls up beside a high chain fence.
text: The DOGS on the other side start barking. This sets off other
text: dogs in other scrap yards.
text: JACK gets out of the car and approaches a makeshift hut
text: beside the fence. Before he's a metre from the door it opens
text: and a tough, well-built, unshaven Italian man in his mid-
text: twenties looks him up and down.
speaker_heading: FABIO.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto.
text: Suspicion gives way suddenly to warmth:
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: L'Americano?
text: JACK smiles politely.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Buon giorno.
scene_heading: 55 INT. WORKSHOP- DAY 55
text: The metal door slides open. FABIO leads JACK inside.
text: At the back of the cluttered workshop is a blue ALFA ROMEO
text: being resprayed white. Beside it, one half of a LANCIA is
text: being welded to another.
text: JACK knows better than to stare. He follows FABIO through
dialog: to...
dialog: 34.
scene_heading: 56 INT. BACK OFFICE- DAY 56
text: Girly calendars, Italian style.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm taking pictures forty minutes
dialog: north of here. Right up in the
dialog: mountains. Father Benedetto said
dialog: you might be able to help.
speaker_heading: FABIO
speaker_heading: (in ITALIAN)
dialog: You need models. For your
dialog: photographs? Italian girls?
text: He winks at JACK. He's being friendly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My publisher wouldn't stretch to a
dialog: four by four and the park trails
dialog: are playing havoc with my chassis.
text: The technical English is slightly beyond FABIO's grasp.
dialog: This suits JACK.
speaker_heading: FABIO
speaker_heading: (in ITALIAN)
dialog: Want me to take a look?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not really. I just need something
text: to work on a ruptured driveshaft.
speaker_heading: FABIO
speaker_heading: (in ITALIAN)
dialog: You're a mechanic?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just a hobby. I tinker.
text: JACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering
dialog: the work benches.
text: FABIO shrugs.
speaker_heading: FABIO
speaker_heading: (in ITALIAN)
dialog: Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My
dialog: garage is your garage.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I appreciate that.
text: FABIO gets on with work, sliding himself beneath the
text: resprayed Alfa Romeo.
dialog: 35.
text: JACK picks out various implements, laying them on the work
text: surface: drill, hacksaw, lathe, vice, mallet.
text: Behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers
text: several GEAR WHEELS with the teeth sheared off. He holds the
dialog: biggest one up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bene?
text: FABIO is engrossed his work.
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Si! Si! Va bene!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Quant'e?
text: FABIO grins and growls. A gearwheel with no bite is useless
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Niente!
text: JACK wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and
text: puts it in the sports bag with the tools.
text: At the door, he pauses.
text: That's when JACK sees it on the notice board. A PHOTOGRAPH of
text: FATHER BENEDETTO and FABIO. FABIO is much younger in this
text: photo: fourteen or fifteen years old. He's wearing an AS Roma
text: football strip. Again: the priest has his arm around the boy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ciao. Grazie.
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Ciao, Americano!
scene_heading: 57 INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY 57

scene_heading: 58 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH TOWER- CONTINUOUS 58
text: THREE CHURCH BELLS ringing: large, medium and small.
text: As the CLAPPERS hit the SOUNDBOWS we smash cut to:
scene_heading: 59 INT. JACK'S ROOM, PENSIONE ABRUZZO- CONTINUOUS 59
text: JACK has laid out his newly acquired tools on the flag stone
text: floor of his room.
dialog: 36.
text: Beside them is the SOCIMI SUB-MACHINE GUN.
text: Using the CHURCH BELLS as sound cover...
text: ...JACK puts the GEARWHEEL on a flag stone tile and smashes
text: it into five pieces with a four pound MALLET.
scene_heading: 60 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT 60
text: By torchlight, JACK is fashioning CONNECTORS from the smashed
dialog: steel gear.
text: It's very, very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor
dialog: light.
scene_heading: 61 EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY 61
text: JACK is wearing a knapsack. He's crossing a MEADOW and making
text: his way towards a RUINED HAMLET. His manner is dark,
text: purposeful, alert.
text: The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade. JACK stops.
text: Everywhere there is a profusion of wild flowers.
text: His guardedness begins to evaporate. He has never seen
text: anything so beautiful or utterly uncorrupted. He looks
text: around, transfixed by delicate yellows and mauves, brash
text: whites, harsh and brilliant crimsons, exquisite blues. The
text: air is humming with insects, bees and butterflies.
text: JACK is transfixed.
scene_heading: 62 EXT. RUINED HAMLET- DAY 62
text: JACK scrambles up towards the abandoned houses, sweating in
dialog: the heat.
text: His original cautiousness has returned. Carefully, he checks
text: the area for signs of recent disturbance. From the foot of
text: the deserted hamlet he surveys the VALLEY with binoculars,
text: monitoring every square on an imaginary grid for human
text: activity. Satisfied that he's alone, he takes a deep breath
dialog: of mountain air.
text: And scrambles back down to the valley.
scene_heading: 63 EXT. WOODS- DAY 63
text: JACK has parked his CITROEN in the shade of a squat but ample
text: WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a LAKE.
text: JACK crunches over half-formed walnuts until he reaches a
text: patch of soft grass beside the water.
dialog: 37.
text: This, he decides, is the perfect spot. He unrolls a blanket,
text: kneels, and from his KNAPSACK he produces:
text: -a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
dialog: chilled bottle of Frascati
dialog: -a loaf of course bread
dialog: -50 gms of pecorino
dialog: -100 gms of proscuitto
text: -a small jar of black olives
dialog: -an orange
text: -and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of
text: the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.
text: JACK sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten ROLEX.
text: It takes approximately thirty-four seconds to assemble the
scene_heading: bastardised SOCIMI- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND
text: SUPPRESSOR- and a further six seconds to press TEN ROUNDS
text: into the magazine, slot it into the base of the hand grip,
text: snuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the
text: rubber cup on the sight.
dialog: He's fast.
text: Carefully he surveys the lake. Settles on a CLUMP OF REEDS.
text: And with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon, concentrates
text: until his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still.
dialog: A beat...
text: ...as JACK holds his breath. Then squeezes the trigger.
speaker_heading: CHOOP!
speaker_heading: CHOOP!
speaker_heading: CHOOP!
text: Not the conventional "phut, phut, phut" of a movie silencer,
text: but the genuine dampened sonic boom of a TAC 65 sound
dialog: suppressor.
text: Through the sight we see the water churn at four o'clock to
text: the REED CLUMP and four metres off.
text: From the knapsack, JACK takes a watchmaker's steel-handled
text: screwdriver and adjusts the sight, then loads another ten
text: rounds in the magazine.
text: CHOOP! CHOOP! CHOOP!
dialog: 38.
text: The reeds are clipped, the bullets slapping into the bank
text: behind, mud spurting.
text: JACK adjusts again and reloads.
scene_heading: CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!
text: The reed clump is shot to shit.
scene_heading: 64 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- DAY 64
text: The sound of CHURCH BELLS.
dialog: JACK is at work:
text: -modifying the SOUND SUPPRESSOR to make it more efficient
text: -filing the CONNECTORS until the trigger squeeze is softer
text: -adjusting the position of the TELESCOPIC SIGHT mountings
dialog: And finally:
text: -checking the balance of the weapon: JACK poises it on the
text: edge of a ruler over the pencil mark he has determined to be
text: the gun's centre of gravity.
text: The SOCIMI balances perfectly.
text: By now the sun is low and the light fading. JACK's eyes are
text: sore and his fingers aching.
text: He sits on his bed with his hands on his knees, silent in the
text: dying light.
scene_heading: 65 INT. BROTHEL, VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT 65
text: We're in the living room of a small apartment. It's simply
text: and attractively furnished. There are 2 GIRLS: not obviously
dialog: hookers.
text: The FIRST GIRL is on her mobile phone. Every now and again
text: she glances at JACK. The SECOND GIRL approaches him for a
dialog: light.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: E Clara qui?
dialog: [Is Clara here?]
speaker_heading: SECOND GIRL
dialog: Non e stasera qui.
dialog: [She's not here tonight.]
text: She loops her arm through JACK's.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: SECOND GIRL
dialog: Volete una bevanda?
dialog: [Would you like a drink?]
text: JACK shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forse un altro tempo.
dialog: [Perhaps another time.]
scene_heading: 66 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- NIGHT 66
text: JACK parks in his usual hiding spot and heads for his
dialog: pensione.
text: A hundred yards ahead of him on the other side of the street
text: is the same YOUNG MAN he spotted in Castelveccio.
text: Cautiously, so as not to spook him, JACK continues walking,
text: passing his pensione and heading for the town square.
text: The YOUNG MAN is four parked cars away, leaning against a
text: Fiat parked in front of a small pharmacy, his right hand on
text: the roof, bending over as if speaking to the car's local
text: occupant who appears to be giving him directions.
text: Twice he looks up and gazes along the street in both
text: directions, casually, as if keeping an eye open for passing
text: traffic in the narrow street.
text: ...JACK side steps swiftly into the local bar.
scene_heading: 67 INT. BAR- DAY 67
text: Crowded with locals. JACK orders a coffee.
text: Through the window he tries to keep an surreptitious eye on
text: the YOUNG MAN. But the darkness outside throws back
text: reflections of the bright neon-lit bar within.
text: One reflection catches our attention.
text: The Italian girl. CLARA.
text: She is drinking and laughing with friends, young Italians
text: like her. She catches sight of JACK.
text: He turns away.
scene_heading: 68 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- NIGHT 68
text: JACK comes out of the bar with his hand in his pocket.
text: No sign of the YOUNG MAN.
dialog: 40.
text: He slips down a side street.
scene_heading: 69 EXT. SIDE STREETS- NIGHT 69
text: JACK slips from one side street to another taking full
text: advantage of short-cuts, alleyways and crumbling walls. His
text: route is circuitous. It betrays a perfect knowledge of the
text: maze-like back streets of the town.
text: Eventually JACK peeps out of a tiny passageway half-way down
text: his own street and on the opposite side of the road from his
speaker_heading: PENSIONE.
text: The entrance to the PENSIONE is clear.
text: JACK crosses the street and slips inside.
scene_heading: 70 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT 70
text: We're in the corridor outside JACK'S ROOM.
text: JACK takes his right hand from his pocket.
text: He's clutching the WALTHER.
text: Slowly, he reaches his left hand upwards, towards the lintel
text: above the door where he finds...
text: ...a single FEATHER.
scene_heading: 71 INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 71
text: From the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned
text: deadbolt locks slide open. Each lock is new and home made.
text: JACK enters, shuts the door, locks all four bolts. And sits
text: on the bed.
scene_heading: 72 EXT. ROADSIDE PAY PHONE- MORNING 72
text: A cluster of houses by the side of a main road: a bar, a
text: restaurant, a phone box.
text: JACK puts a coin in the slot. Two rings.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've got company.
text: JACK scans the area outside.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If he's not baby-sitting the
dialog: Belgian contract then he's either a
dialog: Joe, a cop or a shooter. He's not
dialog: with The Company, they're fast:
dialog: it's been three days and no TA.
dialog: He's not intel: they're deep
dialog: background and he wants to be
dialog: noticed. He might be a cowboy but
dialog: he can't be a cop: they work in
text: pairs and he's alone. Strike Guarda
dialog: di Finanza, State Police and NOCS:
text: he's not Italian- he doesn't look
dialog: like one, dress like one or behave
dialog: like one. So who the hell is he?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Larry?
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: You got a long list of enemies,
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's he waiting for?
text: JACK hears the sound of an engine.
text: His hand moves to his pocket.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Jack?
text: He watches a black VW SHARON pass. There's a family inside.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Want me to help take care of this?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can handle it.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: You sound spooked.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's a bad line.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I appreciate the value of a pre-
dialog: emptive strike in circumstances
dialog: like these, I really do, but if
dialog: you're going to go Generation Kill
dialog: then do me a favour, OK, because
dialog: I'm running out of bribe money. [A
dialog: BEAT] Make it look like an
dialog: accident.
scene_heading: 73 EXT. TRAIN STATION- DAY 73
dialog: Little more than a halt: one platform, one track, one station
text: building- locked and shuttered.
text: JACK steps out of his car.
dialog: No one around.
text: He checks his watch: it's exactly noon.
text: A TRAIN approaches.
text: It's a three-carriage local. It rattles round the bend in the
text: track up the valley, diesel fumes pluming. There are no more
text: than a dozen passengers on board.
text: MATHILDE is the only one to alight.
text: Her once brown hair is now BLONDE. She's wearing a light
text: summer skirt and carrying a navy blue canvas sports bag.
text: They shake hands as the train pulls away, belching and
text: honking as it rattles over the girders of an iron bridge and
text: crosses some alpine rapids.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Mr. Clarke. How good to see you
dialog: again.
text: Something quaint, old fashioned in her diction. English with
text: the hint of a Belgian accent.
text: JACK opens the boot of his car and she places her sports bag
text: beside a WICKER PICNIC HAMPER.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Refreshments?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The Carabinieri around here like
text: roadblocks. It's cover.
text: She nods.
text: They get into the car.
dialog: 43.
text: As the JACK's door slams we smash cut to:
scene_heading: 74 INT. CAR- DAY 74
text: MATHILDE's sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You picked a beautiful spot.
text: She takes off her shades.
text: Her once hazel eyes are now GREY-BLUE.
text: She glances round the hire car's drab plastic interior.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You would be hard pressed to make a
dialog: fast get away in this.
text: Perhaps she's nervous. Her attempt at humour isn't working
text: and she stumbles slightly on her grammar:
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I would have thought you to have
dialog: had at least an Alfa Romeo.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: This attracts less attention.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Is it far?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Fifty minutes.
text: She looks up through the sun roof at the high mountains over
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Up there?
text: JACK nods.
text: She eases herself back, resigned to a long climb.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: The train was tiring. One has to
dialog: keep alert so much in cities.
text: Her eyelids are drooping.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll wake you before the turn-off.
text: She smiles gratefully. But does not shut her tired eyes.
text: The CLOCK on the dash reads 12:17
dialog: 44.
scene_heading: 75 INT. CAR- DAY 75
text: JACK negotiates the alpine road, leaning into the steering
text: wheel, shifting up or down a gear and glancing from the
text: mirror to the road and back again
text: MATHILDE is asleep.
text: JACK scans her, taking in every detail: her low-heeled shoes
dialog: are expensive but she wears no jewelry except a Seiko wrist-
text: watch on a metal strap and a thin gold chain at her throat.
text: Her tan is light, her breasts neat and her legs shapely and
dialog: recently waxed.
text: But JACK doesn't look at her like an object of desire. He
text: looks at her cautiously, with an expression that says: "this
dialog: young woman is ruthless. If she were not, she wouldn't be
dialog: alive."
text: That's when he notices the CAR in his rear view mirror.
text: It's too far behind to decipher the make or model and it
text: weaves in and out of frame as JACK negotiates the alpine
dialog: road.
text: MATHILDE wakes with a start. The CLOCK on the dash reads
dialog: 13:05.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Are we nearly there?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: The turn-off's up ahead.
text: His eyes flick to the rear view mirror. Hers to the wing.
text: She spots the CAR behind. JACK catches her eye questioningly.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I told you I work alone.
text: JACK slows just before the turn off and pulls over.
text: Then stops.
text: Now its MATHILDE's turn to look questioning.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just a precaution.
text: He gets out of the car and pretends to urinate.
text: The CAR behind passes at speed.
text: A blue Seat. The driver neither slows down nor looks in their
dialog: direction.
text: JACK gets back in the car.
dialog: 45.
text: And turns off up a dirt track that disappears into the
dialog: meadows.
scene_heading: 76 EXT. WOODS- DAY 76
text: JACK parks his CITROEN in the shade of the squat but ample
text: WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a large LAKE. This is
text: the exact spot where he came to test the weapon.
text: MATHILDE gets out of the car and stretches.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Are those houses occupied?
text: JACK looks at the RUINED HAMLET on the hillside.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Derelict. I checked three days ago.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: We should check again.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll check alone. There are adders
dialog: the mountains. And vipers. Your
dialog: shoes.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I'll be careful.
text: Her voice is curt. The trust she showed him in the car is
dialog: gone now.
scene_heading: 77 EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY 77
text: They cross a meadow and make their way towards the RUINED
text: HAMLET. The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade.
text: JACK walks in front to ward off any snakes.
text: Everywhere there is a profusion of wild meadow flowers.
text: MATHILDE has never seen anything so beautiful. Overwhelmed,
text: she stops.
text: JACK stops. And watches her.
text: She undergoes the same transformation that he did.
text: Then she comes to, remembering herself... and walks on.
text: Suddenly... a four foot ASP VIPER slithers across JACK's
dialog: path.
text: He claps his hands and the SNAKE writhes for cover.
dialog: 46.
text: JACK walks on. MATHILDE follows, pretending not to be
text: frightened but walking closer to JACK now, scanning the long
text: grass warily.
scene_heading: 78 EXT. RUINED HAMLET- DAY 78
text: JACK scrambles up towards the houses, checking the area for
text: signs of recent disturbance. MATHILDE follows.
text: From beside the end building JACK surveys the valley with a
text: tiny pair of binoculars, monitoring every square on the
dialog: imaginary grid for human activity.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You have tested the gun here
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes.
text: Satisfied that he's alone, he lowers his binoculars. MATHILDE
text: takes a deep breath of mountain air.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: It's beautiful here.
text: She is sitting on a loose stone wall at the edge of what was
text: once a terraced field. Her dress dips between her legs as she
text: leans forward and rests her forearms on her knees, tired from
text: the journey and the long, hot climb.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I wish everywhere could be this
dialog: tranquil.
text: JACK looks at her, sensing a kindred spirit.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You'd be out of a job.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You don't like the peace?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's hard to like something you
dialog: know nothing about.
scene_heading: 79 EXT. WOODS- DAY 79
text: The WICKER PICNIC HAMPER is sitting on a rug by between the
text: parked car and the lake. From the hamper, JACK removes:
text: -a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
dialog: chilled bottle of Aspirinio
dialog: -a loaf of course bread
dialog: 47.
dialog: -two clods of mozarella
dialog: -150 gms of proscuitto
dialog: -100 gms of parma ham
text: -a large jar of pitted green olives
dialog: -a Thermos of sweet black coffee
text: -and, wrapped in cloth squares, the disassembled parts of the
text: improved SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.
text: As MATHILDE starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill,
text: JACK checks the stopwatch on his ROLEX.
text: It takes her approximately twenty-eight seconds to assemble
text: the bastardised gun- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND
text: SUPPRESSOR- and a further three seconds to slot the empty
text: magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to
text: her shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the
dialog: sight.
text: She's almost ten seconds faster than JACK.
text: He stares at her: not an alluring young woman with good legs
text: and nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and
dialog: everything it means.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Rounds?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've made up two sorts.
text: He reaches into the PICNIC HAMPER.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Thirty lead and thirty jacketed.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I should like a hundred of each.
text: It's an order: her voice is emotionless.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: And fifty explosive.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not a problem.
text: He hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge
text: boxes: the shells snug in little plastic trays.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Will mercury do?
text: She smiles almost imperceptibly.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Mercury will do very nicely.
text: She puts the gun down butt-first, leaning it against the side
dialog: of the car.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I have made my own targets.
text: She reaches into her BLUE CANVAS SPORTS BAG and removes
text: several pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split
dialog: bamboo cane.
text: Without speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms. In
text: her wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass
text: crickets, honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer
text: skirt sweeps across the flowers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Watch out for vipers.
text: He keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless, waving
text: with her right hand: the hand holding the AMMUNITION BOXES.
dialog: She's no fool.
text: Neither is he. He has the gun.
text: At ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth
text: stones- a boundary cairn- overgrown with little purple
text: trumpet blooms.
text: She unfolds the cardboard. At this distance all we can make
text: out is a silver-grey shape against the stones.
text: Returning to the car she picks up the weapon.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Muzzle velocity?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: At least three hundred and sixty
dialog: miles per hour. That's including
text: twenty off the top for the sound
dialog: suppression.
text: Impressed, MATHILDE looks at the marks on the metal where the
text: serial number has been removed with acid.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Socimi?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Eight-two-one.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I've not had one before.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You'll find it easy. I've re-
dialog: balanced it for the longer barrel.
text: The fulcrum is two centimetres
dialog: forward of the grip now. Which
dialog: won't matter if you're firing- and
dialog: I'm guessing you are- from a fixed
dialog: position.
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No major recoil issues. You should
dialog: be able to hold onto any target.
dialog: Even the smallest.
text: MATHILDE puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and
text: stands with her feet apart, braced. The breeze beneath the
text: walnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against
dialog: her legs.
text: CHOOP! CHOOP!
text: For a moment longer she holds on the target then lowers the
text: gun, holding it under her arm like a lady on a shire hunt
dialog: would hold a 12 bore.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You've done a good job, Mr. Clarke.
dialog: Thank you. Thank you very much.
text: She makes a minute adjustment to the telescopic sight, with
text: her fingernail. She can't have turned the vertical screw more
dialog: than one notch.
text: Then she fully loads and fires again.
scene_heading: CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!
text: JACK lifts his binoculars and looks at the target. It's the
text: unmistakable outline of a BOEING 747-400, about one and a
text: half metres long. Painted against the cut-out is the upturn
text: at the end of the wing. The front doorway is shaded in.
text: Standing in it is the SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. In the centre of
text: his head are three small HOLES.
text: With the magazine containing the remaining 28 jacketed
text: rounds, MATHILDE takes aim again.
scene_heading: CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!
text: Through his binoculars, JACK can see the empty space where
text: the target's head used to be, the scarred stones behind and
text: the little scraps of cardboard floating on the warm air.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good shot.
dialog: 50.
text: MATHILDE says nothing. She fills the magazine with lead
text: rounds, snaps it in place and hands the weapon to JACK.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Go to the stones and fire near me.
text: He's taken aback.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Say...
text: She looks round for a target.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: ...into the bush with the yellow
text: flowers. Two bursts. Five seconds
dialog: apart.
text: Slowly, JACK walks down to the stones, turns and looks back.
text: The CITROEN is well hidden in the deep shade of the walnut
text: tree. So is MATHILDE. In the poor light all he can see is her
text: dress and her blouse. He wipes the sweat from his eyes and
text: shuts them tightly.
dialog: This is not just a weapon test... it's a test of trust.
text: He opens his eyes again.
text: MATHILDE turns to face him as he shoulders the weapon.
text: He aims the SOCIMI at the YELLOW FLOWERS right beside her.
text: Holds his breath.
text: And pulls the trigger.
text: CHOOP! CHOOP!
text: MATHILDE remains untouched.
text: So do the YELLOW FLOWERS.
text: Troubled, JACK blinks rapidly and counts to five.
text: Then he fires again.
text: CHOOP! CHOOP! CHOOP!
text: Through the sight, we see two stems of YELLOW BLOSSOM fall
dialog: sideways.
text: Relieved, JACK walks slowly back to the car.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: The sound suppression is superb. I
dialog: couldn't place the direction of
dialog: fire.
dialog: 51.
text: From her sports bag she removes a plain brown MANILLA
speaker_heading: ENVELOPE.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I shall require the rounds and the
dialog: weapon by the first of next month.
dialog: In the meantime would you tighten
text: the adjusting screws on the sight,
dialog: they are too loose. And lengthen
dialog: the stock by three centimetres. I
dialog: also want a sixty round magazine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You'll upset the balance.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I'm prepared to accept that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Then I'm happy to oblige.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: What about the a case?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A briefcase. Samsonite. Standard
dialog: pattern in black with combination
dialog: locks. Is there a number you'd
dialog: prefer?
dialog: She thinks.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Eight-two-one.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Eight-two-one.
text: MATHILDE hands him the ENVELOPE and disassembles the weapon.
text: JACK wraps the SOCIMI parts up in their cloth squares and
text: places them in the bottom of the PICNIC HAMPER.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: What do you want done with these?
text: She has collected up the spent CARTRIDGE CASES.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Throw them in the lake.
text: She walks down to the water and hurls the brass cases in.
speaker_heading: FISH rise.
text: Again, the beauty of the place transfixes her.
text: By the time she turns back, JACK has laid out the picnic.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: How thoughtful.
text: She picks up a bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I don't know Italian wine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Aspirinio. Like Mosacata but
dialog: frizzante.
text: Deftly he uncorks a bottle.
text: And pours it into the grass.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It wouldn't look right if the
dialog: picnic wasn't touched.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You chilled the wine. I thought...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It had to be chilled. They're
dialog: Italian cops.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: You think of everything.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm paid to. Don't move.
text: She freezes.
text: JACK points slowly.
text: On her tanned forearm is a BUTTERFLY.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Wow.
text: They both stare at the insect, transfixed.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: It's so beautiful.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Parnassius apollo. It's endangered.
text: She looks up at him. Like it's a revelation she says:
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You like coming here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It serves its purpose.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You've never taken a woman here
dialog: before?
text: JACK is momentarily taken aback.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: The BUTTERFLY flits away.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Perhaps you do not have a woman in
dialog: your life. It is not easy for us to
dialog: keep relationships. Not in our
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I have an acquaintance.
text: A beat.
text: She waits for him to say more.
text: He doesn't.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Friendships are transitory. It
dialog: is...
text: Suddenly, there's movement in the bushes.
text: JACK snatches up his BINOCULARS. MATHILDE scans the tree
dialog: cover.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Wild boar.
text: He hands her the binoculars. And hurriedly packs up the
dialog: picnic.
scene_heading: 80 INT. CAR- DAY 80
text: Her sunglasses back on, MATHILDE watches the meadows slip
text: backwards in the nearside wing mirror as the car bumps back
text: down the alpine track.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I wish you hadn't brought me here.
dialog: Again... a real sadness.
text: JACK glances at her.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: This is the sort of place I wish
dialog: I'd discovered by myself. Then
dialog: maybe one day I could have retired
dialog: here. But you already know it.
text: JACK is touched.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm much older than you. By the
dialog: time you've retired I'll be dead.
scene_heading: 81 EXT. RURAL TRAIN STATION- DAY 81
text: The CITROEN pulls up.
scene_heading: 82 INT. CITROEN- DAY 82
text: The YOUNG WOMAN's manner is once more tense and formal.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: We will meet as before?
text: JACK nods.
text: The distant sound of a DIESEL ENGINE. The train is
dialog: approaching.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: On the first of next month?
text: He nods again.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Around noon?
text: Not even a nod this time: just a slow blink.
text: MATHILDE opens the door, runs around to the boot and grabs
text: her canvas sports bag. Then returns to the passenger side of

dialog: Thank you for a lovely day. Mr.
dialog: Butterfly.
text: She leans in..
text: ...and kisses him lightly on the cheek, her lips light and
text: quick on his stubble.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You must take your mistress to the
dialog: meadow for a picnic.
dialog: 55.
text: She closes the car door, walks onto the platform and vanishes
text: onto a waiting carriage. The TRAIN honks and belches, moving
text: off down the track in the direction from which it came.
text: JACK watches it go.
text: And drives off.
text: Confused.
scene_heading: 83 INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, LOCAL BAR- NIGHT 83
text: Two OLD MEN drinking beer at the bar. Two more at a table,
text: playing Scopa with old fashioned Trentine playing cards.
text: Sitting at the back of the room, JACK stares at a shot of
dialog: Grappa.
text: Above him, mounted on the wall, is a TELEVISION. On the TV is
text: a Western: Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda in ONCE UPON A
text: TIME IN THE WEST.
text: JACK downs his shot, gets up and walks over to the bar. Pays.
text: The BARMAN nods at the screen.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Sergio Leone. Italiano.
text: JACK turns and looks.
text: HENRY FONDA in close-up, is about to shoot a red headed BOY
text: of seven in the head.
text: JACK stares. Just at the moment that the gun goes off...
text: ...JACK turns away.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
speaker_heading: (in poor ENGLISH)
dialog: You like cow boy movie?
dialog: JACK thinks.
text: Then shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hokey.
scene_heading: 84 INT. BROTHEL, VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT 84
text: CLARA and JACK are naked.
text: JACK tries to kiss her on the lips but CLARA turns away: just
dialog: enough to let him know this is against the rules.
dialog: 56.
text: JACK kisses her neck. Her breasts. Her stomach.
text: As he moves his head between her legs, her fingers (already
text: ensnared in his hair) tighten their grip, stopping him from
dialog: going further.
text: JACK looks up at CLARA, across her belly, and she looks back
text: at him, her expression fixed yet curious.
dialog: Against her rules but not, we sense, against her wishes, JACK
text: kisses CLARA softly, tenderly, deeply until she is moving
text: against his tongue, using her sex like a mouth to kiss him in
dialog: return.
text: They make love, breaking each of Clara's two remaining rules
text: in turn. First: JACK puts her in a position she initially
text: resists. Then: he kisses her.
text: CLARA comes, not wanting to.
text: Suddenly, preoccupied, JACK does not.
scene_heading: 85 INT. BROTHEL, VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT 85
text: JACK is in bed with CLARA.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Morboso?
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (with certainty)
dialog: Morboso.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Morboso?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Morboso is like... when you can't
dialog: stop thinking about something.
text: He stares back at her: wordless.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Or someone.
text: A long pause: her eyes searching his. JACK sits up, lights a
text: cigarette and stands by the window, looking through the
text: blind, down into the street.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You needn't act.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Act?
dialog: 57.
text: CLARA watches him, confused but fascinated.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You might have to act with your
dialog: other clients but you don't have to
dialog: pretend anything at all with me.
text: She lights herself a cigarette.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I want you to be yourself with me.
dialog: Be as indifferent as you like. I
dialog: came here to get pleasure, not to
dialog: give it.
text: He hands her CASH.
text: She counts it.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Maybe I pretend very well. I got
dialog: more tip than the other girls
dialog: usually get.
text: He walks to the door.
dialog: Pauses.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't sleep with the other girls.
dialog: And leaves.
scene_heading: 86 INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 86
text: JACK is asleep.
text: He is not alone.
text: In the bed beside him:
speaker_heading: INGRID.
text: Pale as death.
text: Eyes rolled back in her sockets.
dialog: ***
text: JACK wakes up suddenly, gasping.
text: The bed is empty, the sheets twisted and damp.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: 87 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAWN 87
text: SUNRISE...
text: ...over one of the most desolate and beautiful landscapes in
dialog: all Italy.
scene_heading: 88 INT. JACK'S ROOM- DAWN 88
text: In the gun-metal light of dawn, fiddly work:
dialog: -cartridges taken apart
text: -tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely 3mm
dialog: -the hole half-filled with mercury
text: -and plugged with a drop of liquid lead.
text: JACK is converting jacketed ammunition into EXPLOSIVE
speaker_heading: BULLETS.
scene_heading: 89 INT. CHURCH- DAY 89
text: Outside, the sun is merciless. Inside, JACK has taken refuge
text: in the cool of the church. He is alone. He is not praying.
text: Just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion: at the
text: thorns and the nails and the running blood.
text: Footsteps. JACK checks for reflections in his watch.
text: It's FATHER BENEDETTO: dressed for Mass.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I've been looking for you.
text: He mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his Soutane,
text: takes JACK by the arm and leads him to one side, away from
text: the light of the candles.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: A man was here asking questions
dialog: about you.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: He came to the church this
dialog: afternoon.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What did he want?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: To know where you live. He said he
dialog: was a friend from Switzerland.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Switzerland?
dialog: JACK thinks.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And you told him?
text: The priest looks at with complete disdain:
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Of course I do not tell him. How do
dialog: I know him? He is maybe the police.
dialog: Certainly he is no friend. A friend
dialog: would know your pensione.
dialog: Besides...
text: FATHER BENEDETTO leans close and whispers:
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Friends do not carry guns.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO glances shrewdly at JACK, his eyes searching
text: into him.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: If you live in Italy, and you are a
dialog: man of the cloth, you meet many
dialog: people. Besides, I lived once in
dialog: Naples. If you live in Naples you
dialog: know the difference between a fat
dialog: wallet and a... custodia per armi
dialog: di spalla. How you say in English?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Shoulder holster.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Si.
text: JACK glances up and down the aisle.
text: OLD LADIES are dribbling into church in twos and threes.
text: The BELL for mass starts ringing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a true friend, father.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I am a priest.
text: JACK turns to go.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Signor Clarke?
text: Again the priest leans close, holding JACK by the elbow in a
text: gesture of austere confidence.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I make a mistake. He did not say he
dialog: was from La Svizzera: Switzerland.
dialog: He said- forgive me the names in
dialog: Italian are so similar- La Svezia:
dialog: Sweden.
scene_heading: 90 EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- DAY 90
text: THREE BELLS are ringing in the tower. Beneath them, a row of
text: mediaeval GARGOYLES (dragons, griffins, dogs and devils) look
text: down over the little town, their faces frightening or
dialog: frightened.
text: JACK is among the gargoyles, leaning over parapet, his eyes
text: made huge by a pair of tiny binoculars, surveying the town
text: below, checking each square of the grid for a glimpse of the
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN.
text: Nothing. Then he notices:
text: Parked in the shadow of a spreading chestnut tree not far
text: from the main square. An AUDI...
dialog: ...with the YOUNG MAN we spotted in Castelveccio market
text: sitting at the wheel.
scene_heading: 91 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, STREET- NIGHT 91
text: The YOUNG MAN comes out of a shop.
dialog: This is the first time we've seen him up close. In his early
text: thirties, he's wearing a dark brown leather jacket and
text: expensive jeans. His blonde hair is cropped short, and
text: there's the hint of a botched prison-cell tattoo visible just
text: beneath the collar of his shirt.
text: The YOUNG MAN opens a small silver tin and a single deft
dialog: movement removes a portion of SNUS (Swedish chewing tobacco)
text: and inserts the it between his top lip and gum.
text: It is a strangely sinister act.
text: Then he blends in with the tourists, milling down the Corso
text: and round the square heading towards...
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: 92 INT. BAR- NIGHT 92
text: JACK is sitting in the window, making himself as visible as
dialog: possible to the world outside.
text: He downs a Grappa: then gets up to pay for it. His movements
text: are slow and leisurely.
text: The BARMAN hands him his change. And a small white ENVELOPE.
text: JACK is not expecting this.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
speaker_heading: (in ITALIAN)
dialog: Someone left this for
dialog: "L'Americano". This afternoon.
text: JACK looks at the ENVELOPE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Grazie.
text: He turns casually away from the BARMAN's prying eyes and
text: opens the envelope with extreme caution.
text: Inside is a folded CUTTING. It's from the Swedish Daily
scene_heading: newspaper ÖSTERSUNDS-POSTEN.
text: JACK unfolds the cutting. We catch a glimpse of:
dialog: -Ingrid's dacha.
dialog: -A police line.
text: -Three dead bodies in the snow: the two hitmen and the girl.
text: Heart racing, JACK slips the cutting in his pocket.
text: Grabs three SUGAR CUBES from a silver bowl on the bar.
dialog: And leaves.
scene_heading: 93 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- NIGHT 93
text: The YOUNG MAN is watching a PUPPET SHOW in the middle of the
text: square. The PUPPETEER is using glove puppets and the Punch
text: and Judy style performance involves Punch fucking Judy with a
text: grotesquely carved, outsize sex organ. There is a large crowd
dialog: gathered.
text: JACK leaves the bar, turning left and walking purposefully
text: down the street.
text: The YOUNG MAN follows.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: 94 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT 94
text: It's a hot summer night and there are more tourists than
dialog: usual.
text: The YOUNG MAN uses them as cover.
text: JACK turns down a dark, deserted alleyway.
text: The YOUNG MAN hesitates.
text: His right hand moves casually to his jacket pocket.
text: And he follows.
scene_heading: 95 EXT. ALLEYWAY- NIGHT 95
text: We're with the YOUNG MAN as he stalks his prey through the
text: mediaeval maze of streets...
text: We end up in the narrow alleyway that JACK photographed on
dialog: his first day in town.
text: Up ahead, disappearing round a distant bend, we catch a
text: glimpse of JACK, his heels CLACKING on the cobbles.
text: The YOUNG MAN follows swiftly, his trainers silent. He gets
text: to a crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS- all identical-
text: converge. The YOUNG MAN is unsure which alleyway to take.
text: The streets are empty.
text: He listens.
text: From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a late
text: night film on television. It's a romantic film, the violins
text: muffled and sad with longing.
text: From another alleyway comes the sound of SAVAGE BARKING. The
text: YOUNG MAN looks around for the source of the barking, but the
text: streets are empty.
text: Suddenly, the barking stops.
text: The YOUNG MAN looks confused.
text: From his right hand jacket pocket we hear the unmistakable
text: CLICK of a cocking mechanism.
scene_heading: 96 EXT. COURTYARD- NIGHT 96
dialog: We're recognise the secret courtyard: the one reached by
text: means of the hidden archway.
text: With one hand, JACK feeds another SUGAR CUBE to the MONGREL.
dialog: 63.
text: With the other hand, he holds his WALTHER behind his back...
text: ...and cocks it.
scene_heading: 97 EXT. ALLEYWAY- NIGHT 97
text: The YOUNG MAN is waiting at the far end of the alleyway,
text: hugging the wall, scanning the CROSSROADS ahead, unsure which
text: of the four possible alleyways holds his prey.
text: JACK emerges from the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and walks quickly up
text: behind him.
text: JACK has removed his shoes and his bare feet are silent.
text: He has thirty metres to cover. The gun hangs heavy in his
text: right hand. It's fitted with a TAC 65 SOUND SUPPRESSOR. He
text: raises his right hand.
dialog: Twenty metres.
text: The gun is pointing at the YOUNG MAN.
dialog: Fifteen metres.
text: His finger takes up the slack of the trigger.
dialog: Ten meters.
dialog: Then:
text: A DUCATI turns into the alleyway behind JACK, its headlights
text: on full beam.
text: JACK drops his right hand and thrusts his silenced WALTHER
text: deep into his jacket pocket.
text: The YOUNG MAN looks his way.
text: JACK is outlined by the moped's beam of light.
text: The two men are face to face, within spitting distance.
text: The DUCATI hurtles towards the YOUNG MAN.
text: The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a tinted BLACK CRASH HELMET.
text: The YOUNG MAN's eyes widen with fear.
dialog: BANG!
text: The DUCATI misfires.
text: Mistaking the sound for gunfire, the YOUNG MAN drops, rolls
text: and fires back.
text: We hear the sound of a single suppressed shot: CHOOP!
dialog: 64.
text: The BULLET grazes the FRONT SUSPENSION of the DUCATI and
text: lodges in the REAR COWLING.
text: The MAN ON THE DUCATI swerves and crashes, hitting a stone
dialog: staircase.
text: JACK looks around.
text: The YOUNG MAN has disappeared.
text: The MAN ON THE DUCATI is out cold.
text: The front wheel of his DUCATI turns slowly, squeaking.
speaker_heading: CHOOP!
text: A bullet hits the road not far from JACK.
speaker_heading: CHOOP!
text: Another bullet hits the wall behind him.
text: Swiftly, JACK grabs hold of the battered 1970s DUCATI...
scene_heading: 98 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, MEDIAVEVAL MAZE- NIGHT 98
text: JACK rides the classic DUCATI, turning left and right without
text: hesitation, through archways, down steps, dropping level by
text: level, cursing in time with his jagged breathing until...
scene_heading: 99 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- NIGHT 99
text: JACK emerges from the bottom of the town and races away on
text: the winding road.
text: Silence. All we can hear are the crickets.
text: Then the sound of a car.
text: An AUDI tears past us, following JACK out of town.
scene_heading: 100 EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT 100
text: JACK is heading for the mountains. He takes the first corner
text: at 70 MPH.
text: The AUDI gleams black in the moonlight. Gaining on him.
scene_heading: 101 EXT. ANOTHER ANGLE- NIGHT 101
text: JACK takes the next bend at top speed, his classic 1970
text: 1000cc engine howling.
text: The AUDI slows, then powers through the bend, accelerating.
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: 102 INT. AUDI- NIGHT 102
text: The YOUNG MAN puts his foot down.
text: The SPEEDOMETER climbs.
scene_heading: 103 EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT 103
text: The AUDI comes up swiftly behind Jack's DUCATI and tries to
dialog: ram him.
text: JACK dodges the AUDI, swerving from one side of the road to
dialog: another.
scene_heading: 104 EXT. VIADUCT- NIGHT 104
text: A soaring concrete bridge spans a plunging alpine valley.
text: The AUDI overtakes the DUCATI, then swerves left, trying to
text: crush JACK against the concrete barrier that masks a three
text: hundred and fifty foot fall.
text: JACK breaks hard and the AUDI misses him, smashing into the
text: concrete barrier amidst a shower of sparks and screeching
dialog: metal.
text: The AUDI follows the DUCATI into...
scene_heading: 105 EXT. ALPINE TUNNEL- NIGHT 105
text: Long, dark, neon-lit... and blind curved.
text: The AUDI comes up fast behind the DUCATI.
text: Jack swerves the DUCATI onto the other side of the road.
text: The AUDI swerves left and tries to crush JACK into the left-
text: hand wall of the tunnel.
text: Suddenly, a CAR comes round the bend.
dialog: What happens next happens fast:
text: JACK swerves left and skids into a SERVICE LAY-BY, narrowly
dialog: avoiding the CAR.
text: The lay-by is small and JACK has to slide the DUCATI on it's
text: side as he crashes it into the box-like space.
text: The lay-by is too small for the AUDI.
text: The AUDI and oncoming CAR collide.
text: The AUDI's crumple zones buckle as both vehicles' bonnets
text: concertina like a road safety test.
dialog: 66.
text: The AUDI has air bags. The oncoming CAR does not.
text: On impact, its DRIVER goes through the windscreen of his own
text: car and onwards, through the windscreen of the AUDI.
dialog: The wreckage is awesome.
text: Deep within the mangled metal of the two cars...
text: ...the YOUNG MAN groans and twitches.
text: JACK appears at the crumpled window of the AUDI.
text: He reaches through the broken window, grabs the YOUNG MAN by
dialog: the head...
text: ...and breaks his neck.
scene_heading: 106 EXT. WOODS- DAWN 106
text: JACK washes away the worst of the dirt and the blood in a
scene_heading: MOUNTAIN STREAM.
scene_heading: 107 EXT. ROAD- DAY 107
text: JACK on the DUCATI.
text: Turns off at a sign for L'AQUILA.
scene_heading: 108 EXT. L'AQUILA- MORNING 108
dialog: L'AQUILA is the nearest and largest town in the region. It's
dialog: also the location of the Via Lampedusa brothel.
text: JACK comes out of a pharmacy and quite literally bumps into
speaker_heading: CLARA.
text: He winces with pain.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Buon giorno!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Buon giorno.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You are hurt?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: What's wrong with you?
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's nothing really. Just a broken
dialog: rib. Un costollo rotta?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Stronzo! Let me help you!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I came off my bike.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: But you have to go to the hospital!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, no, no. I have pain killers. I
dialog: just need a strong cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I know a place which make the
dialog: strongest coffee in L'Aquila.
text: Her limpid brown eyes twinkle.
scene_heading: 109 INT. CLARA'S APARTMENT- DAY 109
text: A small, simply furnished bedroom with a bed, a desk and a
dialog: chair.
text: As he sips a large cup of strong black coffee, CLARA cleans a
text: vicious welt on his right shoulder blade.
text: As the dirt and blood come away she reveals an exquisite
dialog: tattoo...
text: ...of a BUTTERFLY.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Ve bene. Tutto posto. Signor
dialog: Farfalla. [Good. Everything's OK.
dialog: Mr. Butterfly.]
text: His eyes open wide and he turns to her quickly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why d'you call me that?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You have a tattoo. On your back.
dialog: Of course.
text: He relaxes.
dialog: But not completely.
dialog: 68.
scene_heading: 110 EXT. CASTELVECCHIO- DAY 110
text: The situation at the beginning of the movie is perfectly
dialog: reversed.
text: From the relative safety of CASTELVECCHIO, JACK watches
text: CASTEL DEL MONTE through binoculars:
dialog: -The Phone Box.
dialog: -The Bar.
dialog: -The pensione D'Abruzzo.
text: No sign of the police. No sign of any Shadow Dwellers.
scene_heading: 111 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- SUNSET 111
text: JACK is in his usual phone box. His manner is quietly
dialog: purposeful.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How did he know I was here, Larry?
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: You think I hired him?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Are you out of your fucking mind,
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: After everything I've done for you?
dialog: The car, the cell phone (which you
dialog: threw away), the safehouse, the
dialog: fake passport? Someone has to pay
dialog: for this shit, Jack! I have to pay
dialog: for this shit. It comes out of my
dialog: commission. You're my lousy profit
dialog: margin. Why the fuck would I take a
dialog: contract out on my own profit
dialog: margin? You're not thinking
dialog: straight. I was the one who told
dialog: you to leave town! I told you to
dialog: come to Rome! God damn it you've
dialog: got a job to do! Why the Hell would
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: WHAM!
text: Something smacks into the phone box at high speed.
dialog: 69.
text: JACK drops to his knees and reaches for his WALTHER.
text: Outside the phone box three TEENAGERS are kicking a FOOTBALL
dialog: around.
scene_heading: 112 INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 112
text: TINS of fruit drops: three kinds: black cherry, pineapple and
text: lemon. Each tin is emptied of its fruit drops.
text: Twenty rounds of ammunition- each round packed in silica- fit
dialog: exactly into each tin.
text: Lead rounds in the black cherry, jacketed in the pineapple
dialog: and explosive in the lemon.
text: JACK re-seals each tin with sellotape.
scene_heading: 113 EXT. L'AQUILA, CORSO FREDERICO II - DAY 113
text: The colonnades of this popular pedestrain street are crowded
text: with window shoppers, tourists taking coffee, old men
text: discussing politics and office girls walking hand in hand and
text: chattering like songbirds.
text: JACK is in dark glasses. He's sitting in a coffee shop under
text: the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of Il
dialog: Messagiero.
text: C.U. we see he's studying a small column concerning the
text: murder of two prostitutes in the nearby city of Chieti.
text: JACK spots CLARA walking along the corso. She's with a girl
text: he has not seen before. ANNA. ANNA is small town girl with a
text: keen sense of fashion. She and CLARA are hand in hand.
text: CLARA sees JACK and speaks to her friend.
text: They cross through the throng of boulevardiers.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: My friend Anna. This is my friend
dialog: Signor Farfalla.
text: CLARA's eyes twinkle mischievously.
text: The girls cease to hold hands and ANNA offers hers to JACK.
text: JACK half rises like the perfect gentlemen, folding his
text: newspaper and accepting ANNA's greeting.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: I am very well thank you.
dialog: 70.
dialog: Ah. This is to be an impromptu English lesson. JACK
text: acquiesces gracefully.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Will you take a coffee with me?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: That would be very good.
text: He indicates two empty chairs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Prego.
text: CLARA moves her chair to sit closer to JACK. Under the table,
text: her knee presses against his.
text: ANNA also moves her chair nearer to JACK: but her motive is
text: to move it out of the sun. She is not flirting.
speaker_heading: CLARA
text: Anna is learning English.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Have you been to England?
text: ANNA seems momentarily confused.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: But you are...
text: She looks at CLARA.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Lui Americano?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I am.
text: JACK glances at CLARA.
dialog: How much has she told her friend?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ah. I have not been to England only
dialog: to France. But I would love to go
dialog: to America.
text: The WAITER comes over.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Due cappuccini e un cafe corretto.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Anna is like all Italians. She
dialog: thinks America is like in the
dialog: movies. Little Italy, "West Side
dialog: Story", "Chicago".
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CLARA (cont'd)
dialog: I tell her in these times America
dialog: is like here, there, anywhere. The
dialog: streets are not... pave-ed with
dialog: gold.
text: She beams happily at JACK. He smiles back at her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If not with gold, than at least not
dialog: with enough medieval cobbles to
dialog: loosen every-self tapping screw in
dialog: a Fiat.
text: JACK beams. Neither girl understands. But everyone smiles
dialog: happily.
text: The WAITER brings the coffee and CLARA insists on paying.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where do you come from, Anna?
text: ANNA frowns. JACK plays teacher.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Dove abita?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Ah, yes! I live in Via dell'
text: Argilla. Nearby to Clara.
text: JACK briefly wonders what else he could teach her. He scans
text: both girls and decides CLARA is the prettier. CLARA seems to
text: sense this. She smiles to herself.
text: JACK is touched.
scene_heading: 114 EXT. CORSO FREDERICO II, L'AQUILA- DAY 114
text: We cut wide and watch JACK talk inconsequentialities with the
text: girls. They stand to go. JACK rises.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Perhaps we will have a drink
dialog: together soon? I am free...
text: Her words sound rehearsed. She considers a crowded timetable.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: ...on Monday.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Great. I'll see you then.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: But Eduardo... Where would you like
dialog: to meet?
dialog: 72.
text: Again: rehearsed. JACK is not expecting this. CLARA looks at
text: him mischievously. ANNA is listening.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How about our usual place?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Our usual place?
text: She feigns complete perplexity.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I forgot. Where is our usual place?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You've forgotten?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Remind me.
text: The twinkle in her eye. She's testing him. JACK is the
dialog: perfect gentleman.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe we should try something
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Where would you like to try,
dialog: Eduardo?
text: A beat. JACK spots a restaurant on the opposite side of the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Locanda Grapelli?
text: There is no warmth in his suggestion. But CLARA doesn't care.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Locanda Grapelli! Si!
text: She looks genuinely delighted.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: This is the best food in the area.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good.

dialog: Seven?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Seven.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Locanda Grapelli.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Locanda Grapelli.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You'll be there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll be there.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: See you then, Eduardo.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: See you then, Clara. It was a
dialog: delight to meet you Anna.
dialog: Arrivederci.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Arrivederci, Signor Farfalla.
text: There is an unmistakable twinkle in ANNA's eye. How much she
text: knows is uncertain. She kisses him swiftly and softly on the
dialog: cheek.
text: CLARA does the same on the lips. Behind the mischief in her
text: eyes is something doubtful. Has she gone too far?
scene_heading: 115 EXT. DOWNTOWN L'AQUILA- DAY 115
text: JACK visits three stores:
text: -In a PHOTOGRAPHIC SHOP he buys half a dozen FILM PROTECTION
speaker_heading: BAGS.
text: -In a HABERDASHERS he purchases several packets of HOOKS and
dialog: EYES like the kind you find on brassieres.
text: -In a OFFICE SUPPLY SHOP he buys some custom made headed
text: notepaper, invoice books, notepads, envelopes, metal pens, a
text: calculator and a mobile phone.
scene_heading: 116 INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 116
text: JACK opens a black combination lock SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE and
text: lines the bottom and sides with the lead-lined film
dialog: protection bags, cut to fit.
text: Into the base of the briefcase he glues pre-shaped pieces of
text: firm grey plastic foam. These form the pockets into which he
text: slots the constituent parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.
dialog: They fit perfectly.
text: Over this JACK uses the HOOKS and EYES to clip a false
text: bottom: a tough card cover onto which are pasted the custom
text: made headed notepaper, invoice books, notepads and envelopes.
dialog: 74.
text: To the briefcase's central divider he adds the metal pens, a
text: calculator and a mobile phone. He sets the combination to
text: 821. Then shuts and locks the BRIEFCASE.
text: This done he sits on the bed and stares at the case. With his
text: work complete, he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness.
scene_heading: 117 EXT. PARCO DELLA RESISTENZA - JUST BEFORE DAWN 117
text: A small park not far from Castel Del Monte's town square.
text: It is just after dawn. The pine trees and the poplars are
text: silent. The sun is not yet up but the day is light. Sparrows
text: hop about, searching for crumbs.
text: JACK, ravaged by lack of sleep, wonders about like the demon
text: of a lost darkness, looking for his hole down to the
dialog: underworld.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Buon giorno!
text: He's twenty meters away, his hand raised in half-welcome,
text: half-benediction.
text: They greet one another and FATHER BENEDETTO falls into slow
text: step with JACK. The priest walks with his hands behind his
text: back. JACK with his hands in his pockets.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I walk here to meditate. Once a
dialog: week, Wednesday, the farthest one
dialog: can travel in the week from the
dialog: Sabbath. The trees are like the
dialog: Stations of the Cross: by certain
dialog: trees I thank God for certain
dialog: favours he has granted me, or
dialog: certain gifts he has made to me and
dialog: all men. For example, here by this
dialog: pine, I thank him for the many
dialog: friendships I have and ask him to
dialog: look after those of my friends who
dialog: are troubled.
text: They reach a Cypress tree and FATHER BENEDETTO bows his head
text: in prayer. After a while he says:
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Some walk here in the cool of
text: evening. Others come at night.
text: There is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to himself:
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I wonder how many bastards have
dialog: been made here?
dialog: 75.
text: He gives a small sideways glance at JACK.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Perhaps you'll stay and settle here
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What makes you think I'm leaving?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: You told me as much when we first
dialog: met. Besides, those who seek for
dialog: peace seldom find it. They're
dialog: always moving on, looking
dialog: elsewhere. [A BEAT] And they are
dialog: usually sinners.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All men are sinners.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Some are greater sinners than
dialog: others. And those who seek peace
dialog: have much sinning in their history.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't seek peace. I never have.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Until now.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The
dialog: valley. The villages. The
dialog: mountains.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Forgive me. This is the priest in
dialog: me speaking. And the friend. But
dialog: you have done much sinning, Signor
dialog: Clarke. You still do.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I see a whore. She's young enough
dialog: to be my daughter.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I do not refer to the sins of
dialog: carnality. But to the deadly
dialog: sins...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Aren't all sins equal?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: We are not discussing theology, my
dialog: friend, but you. You like this
dialog: town, this valley.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO (cont'd)
dialog: You should like to remain here and
dialog: find your peace at last. Yet you
dialog: cannot. There is something you
text: cannot ignore. Some force. Some
dialog: enemy.
text: JACK is silent.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: You want to speak but you dare not.
dialog: You know no one sufficiently well
dialog: to share your history with them.
dialog: You know I am trustworthy yet still
dialog: you are cautious.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO stops, compelling JACK to stop too- and face
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: What job do you do, Signor? Are you
dialog: on the run, as they say?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who says?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: It's an expression, no?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Everyone's on the run from
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
text: Some men watch some of the shadows.
dialog: You watch them all.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've done nothing I didn't have
dialog: good cause to do.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Do you wish to tell me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: For what reason?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: For your own sake. Perhaps I can
dialog: pray for you?
dialog: A change of pace.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I make things. Artifacts.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Counterfeit money?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: You work in metal. You are given
dialog: some steel by Fabio, the car
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know a lot about me.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I know only what you do in the
dialog: town. People talk to me. I am their
dialog: priest and they trust me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And I should too?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Of course.
text: They stare at one another.
text: JACK wants to confess. He does not know why.
text: But he doesn't. He does something we're not expecting:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he
dialog: conceived here father?
text: FATHER BENEDETTO is motionless.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Why do you ask me that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He looks like you. Even more than
dialog: he does in the photos you keep of
dialog: each other. Where was he conceived,
dialog: father? Under one of these trees?
dialog: At night? Like all the other
dialog: bastards?
text: There is a very, very long pause. FATHER BENEDETTO stares up
text: at JACK with extraordinary intensity.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I do not remember, Signor. It was
dialog: twenty-five years ago.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO walks. JACK follows. A gust of wind makes
text: dust swirl from the gravel path. The two men do not speak
text: again until they reach the next set of Cyprus trees.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: In the end it is I who confesses to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Expecting me to reciprocate?
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Perhaps. For your own good. You
dialog: cannot doubt the existence of Hell.
dialog: You live in it. It is a place
dialog: without love. As for me, I go about
dialog: my daily duties because the town
dialog: requires it of me. Some know what
dialog: you know. Perhaps I have no right
dialog: to wear these robes. But I do have
text: a heart full of a father's love.
dialog: Something close to His heart! And
dialog: for that I am both grateful and
dialog: happy.
text: On JACK.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: What do you have, my friend?
text: Another gust of wind. The priest looks up into JACK's face.
text: The assassin's eyes are red and stinging. Perhaps its from
dialog: the dust.
scene_heading: 118 INT. JACK'S ROOM- EVENING 118
text: JACK dresses very carefully for dinner.
dialog: It is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon
speaker_heading: CLARA.
scene_heading: 119 EXT. LOCANDA GRAPELLI- NIGHT 119
text: Stone steps lead up from the street to large paved veranda
text: that overlooks the town. Overhead a canopy of vine and
text: jasmine. Above that a sky full of stars.
text: Of the thirty or so candle-lit tables that dot the veranda,
text: more than half are occupied by romantic couples.
text: JACK scans the tables and checks his watch. It's shortly
text: after seven pm and there's no sign of CLARA.
text: He waits. Then turns to leave.
speaker_heading: CLARA (O.S.)
dialog: Ciao.
dialog: 79.
text: She kisses him once on the lips. She's hot and flustered.
text: She's been rushing.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I did not think you would come.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I wasn't sure you meant me to.
text: CLARA looks doubtful. It's the same look she gave him at the
text: cafe. She is breaking the golden rule of prostitution.
text: Getting involved. Her heart is pulling one way and her head
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Certo.
text: A WAITER approaches.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Per due?
text: Judging by his disapproving tone, the WAITER seems to know
text: what CLARA does for a living. CLARA senses this immediately.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Si.
scene_heading: 120 EXT. LOCANDA GRAPPELLI- NIGHT 120
text: CLARA and JACK sit at a table overlooking the town.
text: The WAITER lights their candle and deposits two menus
text: peremptorily.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Una botiglia di acqua minerale non
dialog: gasata et... una Parasini, per
dialog: favore.
text: Completely ignoring her, the WAITER addresses JACK with a
dialog: wink.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Menu in Inglese?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, grazie.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Tedesco? Olandese?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (to the WAITER)
dialog: He speaks Italian. So do I. Listen:
dialog: 80.
text: She repeats her order, articulating each word emphatically,
text: like a teacher to a slow school child:
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Una botiglia di acqua minerale et
dialog: una Parasini, per favore.
text: She isn't upset. It's just her way of letting both men know
dialog: that she's in charge.
text: The WAITER turns to her, deferring to her strength of
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Gasata?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Non gasata.
text: He nods with some genuine deference and leaves.
text: CLARA sighs.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (mostly to herself)
dialog: Cittadina.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Small towns.
text: JACK smiles. CLARA smiles back. They have this contempt in
dialog: common.
text: The WAITER reappears and pours a thumbful of wine. It is pale
text: red in colour and frizzante. At CLARA's insistence, JACK
text: tastes it. It is dry and has a tar-like aftertaste.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Parasini. From Calabria. It is
dialog: good, you will agree?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It is. Very good.
text: He looks at her and- for a brief moment- he undergoes what is
dialog: a unique experience for him: a positive longing to repeat
text: this brief moment many times in the future.
text: CLARA catches the glow of his warmth and blossoms.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Can I ask you something, Eduardo?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You are married?
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I doubt any of the couples here
dialog: are. With the exception of the
dialog: Germans at table seven. She's
text: wearing a wedding ring and they
dialog: haven't spoken a word to each other
dialog: for eight and half minutes.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I was sure this was your secret.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What makes you think I have a
dialog: secret? I'm an ordinary man. I
dialog: cough. I fart. I earn a living.
text: JACK observes a GYPSY selling roses.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I do not think you are an ordinary
dialog: man. I think you are a good man.
dialog: But you have a secret.
text: The GYPSY approaches, offering CLARA a ROSE. She refuses
dialog: firmly.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: He thinks we are a couple.
text: JACK signals to the GYPSY and buys CLARA a ROSE.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why spoil the illusion?
text: She looks at him and smiles.
speaker_heading: CLARA
speaker_heading: (in ITALIAN)
dialog: As long as we know it is an
dialog: illusion.
text: Her smile is only a little bit sad.
text: Still, JACK doesn't know what to say.
text: They are saved by the appearance of the WAITER.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Buona sera. Desidera?
text: CLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his
text: ease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and
dialog: moves.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: 121 EXT. CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT 121
text: JACK and CLARA are walking. He has a cigarette in his mouth.
text: They look like film stars. CLARA slips her arm through his.
text: They say nothing. The pedestrian shopping street is thronging
dialog: with other couples.
scene_heading: 122 EXT. COFFEE BAR- NIGHT 122
text: The coffee bar has an outside section. CLARA and L'AMERICANO
text: are seated in a throng of happy youngsters Clara's age. JACK
dialog: is the oldest person there.
text: The WAITRESS brings two glasses of PROSECCO. She puts a small
text: silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of JACK. In
text: front of CLARA she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae.
text: CLARA grins at her sundae like a little girl. She's a bit
dialog: drunk.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Woooow!
text: She eats, savoring the ice cream. JACK watches, savoring her
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How is it?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Bitchin'.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Bitchin'?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: It's- come se dice- `slang', no?
dialog: Eco.
text: She scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce
text: and holds it out to JACK.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Come on, Eduardo!
text: He hesitates. He eats.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: It is good, you will agree?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (his mouth full)
dialog: I will agree.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (sensing his teasing)
dialog: My English is nice!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's bitchin'.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (defending herself)
dialog: You know how to swear in Italian?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: "Imbecile?" Eduardo! Try: Mangia
dialog: merde e morte: tuo cazzo un
dialog: brufolo.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Eat shit and die, pimple dick?
text: CLARA hiccups.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Perdone!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I guess I've led a sheltered life.
dialog: Of sorts.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Shell-tered?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Too much work.
text: CLARA's CELL PHONE starts to ring. It's on silent, but the
text: screen is flashing, just visible where it sticks out of her
text: handbag. CLARA looks down at the phone.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Too much work.
text: She turns the phone to silent. And looks up at JACK.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I don't apologise, Eduardo.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: For this I do. My job.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Never apologise.
dialog: 84.
dialog: He means it.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Except this job is full of testa di
dialog: cazzo.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mine too.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Lei?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Si.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: But you are too young to...
dialog: pensione?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Retire.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Si.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Liar.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Would you be flattering me if I
dialog: wasn't a client?
text: He's put CLARA on the spot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Am I a client?
text: CLARA takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: This say yes.
text: She points at her head.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: This...
text: She points at her heart.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: This cannot be for sale. But I am
dialog: not want to... come se dice?
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Give it away.
text: She looks at him.
text: JACK studies her, searching for his own feelings.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Stronzo! I buy you a present!
text: She fishes about in her handbag...
text: ...and produces a SILVER BOX.
text: JACK unwraps the shiny paper. Inside is a plastic case like
dialog: the sort you put engagement rings in. Inside the case is a
text: BADGE, hand-painted, depicting the symbol of the region: the
text: eagle of L'Aquila. JACK sticks the BADGE in his lapel.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Grazie.
text: An embarrassed beat.
text: CLARA kisses him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Grazie, Clara.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Prego. Eduardo.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: My apartment is not far from here.
scene_heading: 123 INT. CLARA'S APARTMENT- MORNING 123
text: JACK opens his eyes.
text: Sits up.
text: He's shocked to have slept so deeply.
text: CLARA must be in the shower.
text: He looks around at the little room casually, like a curious
dialog: lover.
text: Opens the top drawer of the bedside cabinet.
text: Finds a VIBRATOR.
text: Opens the bottom drawer.
text: Finds a RED PURSE.
dialog: 86.
text: Inside the RED PURSE...
scene_heading: Finds a BERETTA DOUBLE-ACTION MODEL 21A BOBCAT.
text: Just at that moment CLARA comes out of the bathroom.
text: JACK shuts the drawer and pretends to be asleep.
scene_heading: 124 EXT.PAY PHONE- DAY 124
text: JACK has driven to the remotest phone box he can find: not
text: far from the entrance to one of the region's four national
text: parks: beside a lake, below a mountain range and approached
text: by a long, straight, empty road.
dialog: No one could possibly creep up on him here. Nevertheless, as
text: he talks, JACK makes his habitual and continuous 360 scan of
dialog: the area.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: We're moving the drop.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: We don't know yet. I'll call you
text: ten am on the day with a venue.
dialog: Give you enough time to make the
dialog: noon delivery.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't deliver, Larry. I never
dialog: deliver. It's too dangerous. She
dialog: comes to me. I know the town.
dialog: That's what we agreed.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I told `em. I told `em if there was
dialog: even the slightest chance security
dialog: had been breached, you'd have dealt
text: with it immediately.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Breach? What breach?
text: For the first time in the movie we cut to LARRY at home:
scene_heading: 125 INT. LARRY'S APARTMENT, ROME- DAY 125
text: LARRY is sitting in a high back leather office chair before a
text: large, imperial mahogany desk. In front of him are two banks
dialog: of screens.
dialog: 87.
text: The first bank displays 3 CCTV views: (1) the entrance to his
dialog: apartment block (2) a staircase and (3) the entrance to his
dialog: apartment itself.
text: Another bank of screens shows 3 NEWS CHANNELS: (1) CNN, (2)
text: BBC WORLD and (3) AL JAZEERA.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Our pretty young Belgian client and
dialog: her associates think someone on
dialog: your long list of enemies might
dialog: have put a tail on you.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Not possible.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Course not, Jack. But if, for the
dialog: sake of argument, it was possible-
dialog: I'm thinking it could be Galazzo.
dialog: Or Simenov. Or Italian undercover.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Cops?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: The crooked kind.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: How come I'm still here?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: The Belgians think they're planning
dialog: to wait for the drop and
dialog: exterminate you and Mathilde in one
dialog: swoop.
text: With the help of his DESKTOP computer LARRY is comparing the
text: scrolling share prices on CNN with the fluctuating value of
speaker_heading: the US DOLLAR.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Where the hell's this information
dialog: coming from?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm fucked if I know, Jack. If you
dialog: want my opinion, they're just being
dialog: jittery. I told `em you were the
dialog: most security conscious
dialog: professional I know. I told `em no
dialog: one gets close to you.
scene_heading: 126 EXT.PAY PHONE- DAY 126
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They don't.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: I told `em if we couldn't trust you
dialog: to keep a tight lid on operations
dialog: the who could we trust?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They can. They can trust me and so
dialog: can you.
text: JACK is tense. Every word is carefully enunciated:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've never jeopardised an operation
dialog: in my life.
speaker_heading: LARRY (V.O.)
dialog: You don't have to tell me that,
dialog: Jack. For Christ's sake, you closed
dialog: your own girlfriend's account...
speaker_heading: ECU on JACK.
scene_heading: 127 INT. LARRY'S APARTMENT, ROME- DAY 127
text: The words are out before he can stop them.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry.
text: He rubs his eyes, wearied by his own insensitivity.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That was, um.... I'm just saying
dialog: you can be relied on.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: CLICK.
scene_heading: 128 EXT. PAY PHONE- DAY 128
text: JACK has hung up.
text: He is lost in fearful thought, jaw muscles grinding.
scene_heading: 129 EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- NIGHT 129
text: Amongst the GARGOYLES...
text: ...JACK, looking through his miniature binoculars.
speaker_heading: His POV:
dialog: 89.
text: Of CLARA seated in a cafe talking to a slick, tough YOUNG
text: ITALIAN MAN in a suit.
text: He is showing her photographs. Of what- we cannot see. CLARA
text: looks very, very serious.
text: The YOUNG ITALIAN MAN leaves. JACK watches him get into a
text: smart black ALFA ROMEO containing two other ITALIAN MEN. Rome
dialog: plates.
text: When he looks back at the cafe, CLARA has gone.
scene_heading: 130 INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY 130
text: JACK opens his PICNIC HAMPER and in it he puts:
text: -a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
dialog: chilled bottle of Aspirinio
dialog: -a loaf of course bread
dialog: -two clods of mozarella
dialog: -150 gms of proscuitto
text: -and his WALTHER PPK/S.
scene_heading: 131 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY 131
text: CLARA is waiting on the Via Strinella near the entrance to
text: the Parco della Resistanza, sheltering in the shade of a
dialog: tree.
text: She is holding the RED PURSE. At her feet is blue plastic bag
text: rounded out by a watermelon.
text: JACK pulls his CAR into the curb.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Ciao, Eduardo!
text: She opens the passenger door, leans in and kisses JACK long
text: and full on the lips.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Put them in the back. We've got a
dialog: way to go.
text: She puts the plastic bag in the trunk.
text: Inside the trunk is the PICNIC HAMPER.
scene_heading: 132 INT. CAR- DAY 132
text: CLARA climbs in and fastens her seat-belt.
dialog: 90.
text: She puts the RED PURSE between her legs. JACK glances at the
scene_heading: RED PURSE.
dialog: And drives.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Where we go?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Swimming.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: How far do we go? To Fanale?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: An hour. And we're not going to the
dialog: sea, we're going to the lakes. In
dialog: the mountains.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: For a... come se dice... you have
dialog: in the back...
speaker_heading: JACK
text: A picnic.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: A pick-nick! We are going for a
dialog: pick-nick. Just the two of us.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I have practise my English,
dialog: Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick.
dialog: It is a beautiful day, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It is.
scene_heading: 133 EXT. ALPINE ROAD- DAY 133
text: The CAR negotiates a familiar hairpin bend.
scene_heading: 134 INT. CAR- DAY 134
text: CLARA is station hopping.
text: She finds some LOU REED. She loves LOUD REED.
text: JACK is concentrating on the road.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Is it more far?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ten kilometres. Another twenty
dialog: minutes.
text: She pauses to work out the mathematics. She's smart. And
text: puzzled. But she's not frightened. Not yet.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Twelve kilometres? In twenty
dialog: minutes?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're going off the beaten track.
text: She looks confused.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Lontano. Fuori mano.
text: CLARA laughs.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You will speak Italian. One day, I
dialog: will teach you.
scene_heading: 135 EXT. ALPINE TRACK- DAY 135
text: JACK turns off the main road and onto an alpine track.
text: This is the same route he took with the Belgian woman.
text: The CAR bumps and tilts on the rough terrain.
scene_heading: 136 INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS 136
text: CLARA is startled by such an insignificant track.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Where are we going?
text: Now she's anxious. This is not what she expected.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You shall see.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I think it is good we should stay
text: close to the road.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There's no need to worry. I've been
dialog: here before several times. Taking
dialog: photographs.
text: He swings the wheel suddenly to avoid a large boulder and the
text: Citroen pitches as if struck by a wave.
dialog: 92.
text: CLARA clings to the door with her right hand, her left hand
text: dug deep into the fabric of the seat to steady herself.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're not afraid of coming into
dialog: the wild with me, are you?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: No!
text: She laughs tensely.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Of course I am not. Not with you.
dialog: But this...
text: She snaps her fingers.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: ...sentiero!
text: She waves her hand in the air.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You should have a jeep. A Toyota.
dialog: It is not good for a... berlina.
text: It's as if the increased danger of the track diminishes her
dialog: English.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is a Citroen!
text: He strikes the steering wheel hard with the palm of his hand.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This was made by the French for
dialog: taking potatoes to market. Besides,
dialog: I always come here in this car.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Of course. I don't want to walk
dialog: back to town any more than you do.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I think you are crazy. This will go
dialog: to nowhere.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I assure you it does.
text: She pouts her reply. The TRACK disappears into a WOOD and
text: runs out altogether, giving way to grass.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Now there is no road!
text: JACK stops the car and turns the engines off.
text: Sudden silence.
text: CLARA lets go of the seat.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Is this where we go?
text: They are surrounded by trees.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. Not quite. We go another
text: hundred metres, through the wood.
dialog: But from here we just roll forward.
dialog: No motor. No sound. And you'll see
dialog: a wonder.
text: She grips the seat again.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You won't need to hold on. I'll go
dialog: slowly. Just relax and look.
text: He eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move
text: forward, the springs squeaking slightly. After 50 metres JACK
text: twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes.
text: They roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and
text: come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample WALNUT
speaker_heading: TREE.
text: Beyond them is the LAKE, the MEADOWS and the RUINED HAMLET.
text: The hidden valley is a riot of colour, the blooms and
dialog: blossoms more brilliant than we've ever seen them. By the
text: edge of the lake stands a HERON, still as fence post.
text: CLARA gets out of the car, dumbstruck. JACK gets out too. He
text: watches her... then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through
text: his miniature binoculars. Deserted. By the time CLARA turns
text: towards him, the binoculars are hidden.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: No one comes here?
text: She speaks so quietly JACK can barely hear her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Just you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 94.
text: CLARA turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the
text: grass. She is wearing no bra. On her back dapple the shadows
text: and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut.
text: She kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air... and
text: unzips her skirt. It falls to the grass. She bends and steps
text: daintily from her knickers. Then turns to face JACK.
text: JACK cannot take his eyes off her. Dizzy, he steps forward
dialog: without meaning to.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Well?
text: She is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I am going to swim in the lake. Are
dialog: you coming?
text: She doesn't wait for his reply, but turns and runs through
text: the grass towards the water.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso!
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Maybe! But I am lucky!
text: The HERON flies off, rising from the reeds with an ungainly
text: flapping.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: He is an Italian bird! We disturb
dialog: his siesta!
text: Quickly, JACK glances inside the CITROEN.
text: The RED PURSE is nowhere to be seen.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Come, Signor Farfalla!
text: JACK undresses. As he removes his clothes, he stalls for
text: time, using the cover of undressing to search for the RED
text: PURSE.
text: We can see it wedged under the passenger seat.
text: Due to the design of the car, JACK cannot.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Come!
text: JACK turns to face the lake. He is naked. Yet with the
dialog: caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he
text: reaches the water's edge.
dialog: 95.
text: CLARA is standing in the middle.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Stand by me.
text: He obeys her order. He walks out to her and she takes his
text: hand under the water, holding it out in front of them.
text: JACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed.
text: Brassy and gleaming. A SPENT SHELL. He covers it with his
dialog: foot.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Keep still. Watch.
text: As the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds, TINY
text: FISH appear in a shoal to gather about their hands. They
text: hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move
text: in to nibble at the skin on their fingers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If we stay here for a year, they'll
dialog: devour us.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: It is said that if these fishes
text: bite at two hands holding, then
dialog: love is good for the people.
text: He looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in
text: his head.
text: She kisses him, pressing herself against him, her skin and
text: body as pure and warm as the water.
text: He tries helplessly to pull away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe we should...
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Do you make love in the water?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I haven't.
text: She places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from
text: the smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. She
text: tries to push herself onto him but he resists.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: What's wrong?
text: He doesn't know what to say. She looks at him: confused,
dialog: searching.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's eat.
dialog: 96.
text: He walks towards the bank. She follows. The tiny fish dart
text: around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds,
text: travelling with the waves made by their departure.
scene_heading: 137 EXT. LAKESIDE- DAY 137
text: CLARA is lying naked on a blanket.
text: Beside her is the RED PURSE.
text: Through sleepy, half-closed eyes she is watching L'AMERICANO.
text: From her POV, JACK is kneeling behind the open PICNIC HAMPER,
text: unpacking the food and wine. The LID of the basket obscures
text: his hands.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Eduardo.
text: JACK looks at her.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Is this your real name?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is Clara yours?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Si. Yes.
text: She looks at him. Waiting for his reply.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Edward is my real name.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Ed-ward.
text: She doesn't believe him.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You are sure you are not married,
dialog: Eduardo?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Quite sure.
dialog: About this he's telling the truth.
text: CLARA reaches for the RED PURSE.
text: From behind the picnic hamper lid we hear the CLICK of a
text: cocking mechanism.
text: CLARA hesitates for a moment.
dialog: 97.
text: JACK watches her intently.
text: She reaches into her purse.
text: JACK is expressionless.
text: When CLARA withdraws her right hand she is holding a tube of
scene_heading: SUNTAN LOTION.
text: A beat.
text: JACK watches as she commences smoothing it into her skin,
text: rubbing it around her breasts, pushing them aside, pressing
text: them upwards. Then she caresses the lotion into her belly and
text: down her thighs, bending at the waist as she works it into
text: her shins.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Will you put this on my back?
text: She proffers him the SUNTAN LOTION.
text: JACK stares at her baking body, transfixed by its terrible
dialog: and perfect beauty.
text: Hidden behind the LID of the picnic hamper...
text: ...his trembling right hand grips tightly to his WALTHER.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Eduardo?
text: He's frozen.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Amore?
text: Time seems to stop.
speaker_heading: ECU on JACK.
text: Suddenly, CLARA sits up.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Eduardo, what's wrong?
text: JACK swallows.
text: When he speaks his mouth his dry.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing.
text: When he moves towards her, he is holding nothing in his
dialog: hands.
dialog: 98.
text: He takes the tube of SUNTAN lotion.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Father Benedetto...
text: And begins to run it into CLARA's back.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I promised myself that I would
dialog: write to you- as your friend- to
dialog: say goodbye.
scene_heading: 138 EXT. WOODS- DAY 138
dialog: SLAM!
text: JACK shuts the boot of the car.
text: He scans the lakeside.
text: No sign of the picnic.
text: No sign of CLARA.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Everything I've ever done...
text: Then he spots something.
text: On the ground, not far from the car.
text: He walks over and picks it up.
dialog: It's one of CLARA's shoes.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I've done for a reason.
text: JACK is staring at the SHOE.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I never thought the day would come
dialog: when I'd run out of reasons.
dialog: Reasons to worry. Reasons to run.
dialog: Reasons to pull the trigger.
text: JACK turns and walks over to the car.
text: CLARA is in the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe that day's come.
text: JACK gets into the Citroen.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Or maybe I've just found a reason
dialog: to change.
text: And hands CLARA her shoe.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Grazie, Eduardo.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I still don't understand. What's
dialog: the point of a gun if it's not
dialog: loaded?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: One of the girls borrow it to me
dialog: after the second hooker in Chieti
text: is murdered. With some of the
dialog: clients it make me feel safe. I
dialog: don't tell the police, of course,
dialog: but... Madonna, Eduardo. How they
dialog: do to these two women! A police
dialog: agente from Rome show me
dialog: photographs. They show photographs
dialog: to everyone in Via Lampedusa.
text: CLARA shivers with disgust.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Non capito... how one person hurt
dialog: another in this way.
text: JACK looks lost, like a man drained of all resolution.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Does the gun make you feel safer
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You are not a client.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Then why's it in your purse?
text: CLARA looks unhappy.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I have to work tonight, amore.
dialog: Silence.
text: JACK looks away.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe this is suicide. Cops often
dialog: put the graft on working girls.
dialog: Perhaps the girl I told you about,
dialog: Clara, has sold me out.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: Maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe
dialog: she's a hired gun. Then again,
dialog: maybe Clara is who she says she is
dialog: and my Belgian clients will take
dialog: the gun, shoot me themselves and
dialog: keep the money. Always a risk in my
dialog: profession. Or perhaps my trusted
dialog: colleague in Rome no longer trusts
dialog: me. Perhaps even you, Father, with
dialog: your connections in Naples...
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: What will you do?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I guess I'll go to work too.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: And after that? Tomorrow and the
dialog: next day.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can't stay here forever.
text: As the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he
dialog: could.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: It's not that I've given up on
dialog: life, Father. Just the way that I
dialog: was living it. If you can call it
dialog: living.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I want always to stay here.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's time to go home.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Let me come to your home.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can't, Clara. One day...
text: She's upset but decides not to press her demand.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: If I had one request, Father, it
dialog: would be this. That it's not Clara
text: who finally pulls the trigger. But
dialog: whoever it is...
text: CLARA kisses him and simply says:
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Stay forever here.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: ...by this time tomorrow I'll be
dialog: dead.
dialog: Fade to black.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 139 EXT/INT. CHURCH- DAY 139
text: A POSTMAN hands the mail to FATHER BENEDETTO.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Ciao Fabio, come stai?
speaker_heading: IL POSTINO
dialog: Bene grazie, Padre.
text: We follow FATHER BENEDETTO inside as he rifles through a
text: bunch of church circulars. One LETTER catches his eye.
text: He opens it and starts to read aloud:
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Dear Father Benedetto. I promised
dialog: myself that I would write to you-
dialog: as your friend- to say goodbye...
scene_heading: 140 INT. JACK'S ROOM- DAWN 140
text: JACK stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit, the
text: black SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE in his hand.
text: He surveys his room. All evidence of his existence has been
text: meticulously tidied away.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.)
dialog: Everything I've ever done...
text: JACK leaves.
dialog: Only thing is left behind:
text: The book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART &amp; ARCHITECTURE on the
dialog: bedside table.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.)
dialog: I've done for a reason.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: 141 EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY 141
text: The sun is shining. The mountains young and sharp and
text: beautiful. The CAR moves swiftly across the viaduct that
text: spans a spectacular gorge and plunges into a long tunnel.
scene_heading: 142 INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS 142
text: JACK watches the road. On the long straights he looks
text: backwards and forwards.
scene_heading: 143 EXT. SERVICE STATION- DAY 143
text: JACK comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a
text: forecourt consisting of several rows of Agip and Q8 pumps, a
text: convenience shop, a repair garage and a cafe.
text: The car park is not large. JACK parks the Citroen facing the
text: EXIT. There is a single bar across it but this is raised.
text: JACK double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and
text: slips his WALTHER into his jacket pocket.
text: Stepping out of the car he looks around the car park. It's
text: only a quarter full and ominously quiet. Somewhere in the
text: distance we can hear a sound: creak, creak, creak, creak...
text: JACK takes the BRIEFCASE from the rear seat and walks away.
text: He makes a show of locking the car but doesn't.
text: As he approaches the CAFE he passes the GARAGE. We see the
text: source of the creak, creak, creaking sound: a SIGN for engine
text: oil, on hinges, revolving slowly in the breeze.
scene_heading: 144 INT. AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY 144
dialog: Empty.
text: JACK sits at a table at the back of the cafe. From here he
text: can see both entrances: the public entrance and the service
text: entrance and also the door to the bathrooms. Through the
text: window, he has a good view of the garage forecourt and the
text: slip road to and from the autostrada.
text: JACK places the BRIEFCASE on a chair beside him and puts a
text: PAPER BAG on the table next to the sugar dispenser. He checks
text: his watch. It is two minutes before noon. He orders an
dialog: espresso.
text: His nerve-heightened senses take in everything: the sound of
text: the cicadas, the buzz of the neon strip-lights and the creak,
text: creak, creak of the engine oil sign outside, endlessly
text: revolving.
text: JACK's eyes flick outside to the forecourt.
dialog: 103.
text: We hear the cafe door open.
text: And in an instant, MATHILDE is at his table.
text: She is dressed in a tight black skirt, a simple blue blouse
text: and a dark blue jacket. Her hair is neatly styled, her make-
text: up immaculate and heavier than we've seen her wear before.
text: She looks exactly like the kind of woman who might carry a
dialog: Samsonite briefcase.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Hello. I see you have brought it in
dialog: from the car with you.
text: She speaks quietly: her voice low and attractive.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All there, as agreed.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: What's in the paper bag?
text: The WAITRESS comes over with Jack's coffee. MATHILDE orders
dialog: another for herself.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sweets. For your journey.
text: She opens the bag and takes out one of the TINS.
text: She can immediately feel that it's heavier than it should be.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: That is most thoughtful of you.
text: The polite phrase sounds even more polite with her slight
dialog: Belgian accent.
text: The WAITRESS returns with the second espresso and MATHILDE
dialog: pays for them both.
text: JACK watches as she stirs her coffee to cool it. She's
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I suppose I'll read about this in
dialog: the Times or the International
dialog: Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.
text: For a moment she is pensive.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Yes, I expect so.
dialog: 104.
text: She drinks her coffee, holding her cup in mid-air and looking
text: out the window.
text: JACK follows her eye-line to check she's not signalling to an
dialog: accomplice.
text: The FORECOURT is still empty.
text: Creak, creak, creak, creak...
text: MATHILDE looks at JACK. Her expression is impossible to read.
text: Perhaps it's tinged with sadness. She drinks the rest of her
dialog: coffee.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I'm just going to the ladies. Wait
dialog: here.
text: She picks up the CASE.
dialog: There is nothing JACK can do about this. She has taken him
text: off guard and grasped the initiative.
text: All he can do is wait.
scene_heading: 145 INT. AUTOSTRADA BATHROOM- CONTINUOUS 145
text: MATHILDE enters a cubicle, opens the CASE, bypasses the
text: stationary, lifts the false bottom and checks the SOCIMI
dialog: parts are present and correct.
text: Then she loads a magazine.
scene_heading: 146 INT. AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY 146
text: MATHILDE returns from the bathroom.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Shall we go.
dialog: Not a question, a command.
text: JACK is obliged to stand up.
scene_heading: 147 EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAR PARK- DAY 147
text: MATHILDE walks towards a large FORD.
text: She is carrying the BRIEFCASE.
text: JACK has his right hand in his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: You won't need your piece.
dialog: 105.
text: The slang word belies her. For an instant she has forgotten
text: her Belgian accent. She sounds American.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You never know.
text: She stops beside the FORD.
text: JACK still has his hands on the Walther.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: OK?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure. You?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Everything's just fine.
dialog: She definitely sounds American now.
text: Her RIGHT HAND slips into her pocket.
text: JACK twists his wrist upwards and thumbs the cocking lever.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Final payment.
text: She hands JACK an ENVELOPE.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Buy yourself a retirement clock.
text: Her American accent shows that she's letting her guard down.
dialog: Maybe it's designed to make JACK do the same.
dialog: It doesn't.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How do you know I'm retiring?
text: She leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on
dialog: the lips.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Have you taken your girl up to the
dialog: meadow yet?
text: JACK doesn't answer. His whole body is tense for the bullet
text: that he knows his coming. Perhaps there is a second person in
dialog: the car.
dialog: Just then...
text: ...a COACH pulls into the car park.
text: It stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of TEENAGE KIDS
dialog: descend.
dialog: 106.
text: MATHILDE looks both irritated and relieved.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: (whispers to JACK)
dialog: Do it.
text: She gets into the driver's seat of the FORD and swings the
text: BRIEFCASE into the back.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.
text: JACK tenses as MATHILDE raises her hand in farewell.
text: The FORD pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto
dialog: the autostrada.
text: JACK watches it go.
text: Thumbs back the lever on his Walther.
text: Gets into his Citroen.
text: And opens the ENVELOPE.
dialog: -No wires.
dialog: -No tricks.
text: -Just a HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS.
text: JACK stares at the money. He isn't supposed to be alive. For
text: a while he stays put. He shuts his eyes in the sunshine and
text: listens to the laughter of the teenage kids. To a girl
text: calling: "Amore!" To the cicadas. To the distant rush of
text: traffic on the autostrada.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 148 EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY 148
text: JACK drives fast...
text: ...turning off the highway beneath a sign for L'AQUILA.
scene_heading: 149 EXT. L'AQUILA- DAY 149
text: At the end a small street, JACK parks his car like a true
dialog: Italian: illegally.
text: Runs towards CLARA'S APARTMENT.
text: And rings the buzzer.
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 107.
text: JACK rings again.
dialog: Still nothing.
text: Shouts up at her window:
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: CLARA!
scene_heading: 150 EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAFE- DAY 150
text: We're at another roadside service station.
text: LARRY comes out of a Kentucky Fried Chicken.
text: He climbs into the passenger seat of the FORD.
text: MATHILDE drives off.
scene_heading: 151 INT. FORD- DAY 151
text: LARRY is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt.
text: He's about to get his hands dirty and he doesn't like it.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Not only did you not kill him, you
dialog: gave him my fucking money?
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: What else could I do? There were
dialog: kids everywhere. Besides he's
dialog: suspicious.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: He's paranoid. That's why I'm
dialog: paying you the GDP of a small
dialog: country to get close to him. You
dialog: could have got him in the sack. You
dialog: should have got him in the car
dialog: park. Now you're going to have to
dialog: take him out long range!
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: I prefer it that way.
text: She is a trained assassin. She respects JACK.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: The Socimi is the perfect weapon.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Let's hope his workmanship is up to
dialog: scratch.
dialog: 108.
text: He slams a full magazine into the butt of a STERLING
scene_heading: SUBMACHINE GUN.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Sweden turned Jack into a
dialog: liability. Three stiffs: two
text: shooters and an innocent civilian.
dialog: I can't afford a mistake like that
dialog: again. Europol are crooked but they
dialog: aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to
dialog: make me money. Not run up cleaning
dialog: bills.
speaker_heading: MATHILDE
dialog: He made short work of the last guy
dialog: you hired.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Never mind Larson. He didn't stand
dialog: a chance, not against someone as
dialog: paranoid as Jack. The Swede was
dialog: only there to take Jack's heat off
dialog: you. So don't fuck this up again.
text: He grabs a TIN of fruit sweets.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Mind if I help myself?
text: LARRY opens the tin to find it full of AMMUNITION.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Shit.
text: He looks around the Ford.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Is there any actual candy in this
dialog: gas guzzler?
scene_heading: 152 EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY 152
text: JACK turns off under the sign for CASTEL DEL MONTE.
scene_heading: 153 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH STEPS- DAY 153
text: The town square is jam-packed with cars and coaches.
text: Hundreds of tourists and locals have gathered on the church
text: steps. There is even a camera crew.
text: The church doors open and FATHER BENEDETTO steps out to a
text: huge cheer.
text: Behind him, LOCAL MEN are carrying a larger than life painted
text: wooden STATUE OF SAINT DOMINIC.
dialog: 109.
text: Draped over the saint's shoulder and wrapped around his neck
dialog: are around twenty five or thirty live SNAKES- local Viperi-
text: each one several feet long and as thick as a skinny forearm.
text: A local BAND strikes up as the STATUE is carried down the
text: steps, FATHER BENEDETTO leading the strange annual religious
text: parade around the town square, followed by a group of ALTAR
speaker_heading: BOYS.
scene_heading: 154 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, STREET- DAY 154
text: The giant FORD pulls up outside the town's only proper HOTEL.
text: MATHILDE gets out carrying the SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE.
scene_heading: 155 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY 155
text: JACK is looking for someone. The square is so tightly packed
text: it's hard to see, let alone move.
text: Then he spots her.
speaker_heading: CLARA.
text: She's on the other side of the square, standing on the stone
text: steps beneath a STATUE OF AN EAGLE. Her friend ANNA is beside
text: her, taking photographs of the parade with a small digital
text: camera. JACK moves towards CLARA.
text: ANNA, through her viewfinder, is the first to notice him. She
text: points JACK out to CLARA. CLARA waves at him. She says
text: something to ANNA and descends into the crowd. JACK and CLARA
text: squeeze their way through a sea of bodies towards one another
dialog: as we cut to...
scene_heading: 156 EXT. HOTEL ROOF- DAY 156
text: MATHILDE emerges through the fire escape door and walks to
text: the edge of the roof.
text: She opens the black SAMSONITE CASE and unpacks the top layer
text: of office paraphernalia to reveal the disassembled parts of
text: the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.
text: Expertly she assembles the bastardised gun- including
text: TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- slotting a full
text: magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggling the butt
text: to her shoulder and placing her eye beside the rubber cup on
dialog: the sight.
scene_heading: 157 EXT. POV FROM TELESCOPIC SIGHTS- DAY 157
text: In the centre of the CROSS-HAIRS:
dialog: 110.
text: JACK and CLARA meet.
text: She kisses him. It is a long and loving kiss.
text: The CROSS-HAIRS find the centre of JACK's head.
speaker_heading: 158 INSERT: 158
text: MATHILDE'S FINGER... taking up the trigger slack.
scene_heading: 159 EXT. TELESCOPIC SIGHTS- DAY 159
dialog: Other HEADS...
speaker_heading: -TOURISTS
speaker_heading: -LOCALS
scene_heading: -KIDS on their PARENTS' SHOULDERS
dialog: ...keep blocking our view of JACK.
speaker_heading: 160 INSERT: 160
text: The TRIGGER FINGER, hesitating.
scene_heading: 161 EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY 161
text: We're right in the midst of the crowd.
text: JACK and CLARA have to shout at one another above the noise
dialog: of the band.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: When can I see you?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I have to work tonight.
text: Their happiness clouds over. But the clouds pass quickly.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You come to my apartment after.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I asked you would you come away
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Come away with you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Together?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Together.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wherever. Then when we're through,
dialog: we could come back here. For good.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: To live?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where else?
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Forever?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forever.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Unless you have other plans.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Other plans?
text: She swears in Italian. Obscenities. Then throws herself
text: around JACK and squeezes him with all her strength. There are
text: tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I love you, Signor Eduardo
dialog: Farfalla.
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: 162 INSERT: 162
text: The TRIGGER FINGER squeezes.
text: The SOCIMI SUBMACHINE fires.
text: An EXPLOSIVE BULLET travels down the chamber at approximately
text: 360 miles per hour headed straight for JACK's temporal lobe.
dialog: Only it never gets there.
dialog: 112.
text: The gun jams.
text: A chamber explosion is a nasty thing. Instead of shooting out
text: of the barrel, the round explodes in the cannon's chamber.
text: Hot shrapnel fragments like a land mine, ripping into
text: MATHILDE's hands, forearms and face...
scene_heading: 163 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY 163
text: A loud BANG pulls JACK and CLARA apart. Amidst the noise of
text: the festival, no one else seems to notice.
text: JACK looks in the direction of the HOTEL ROOF.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Someone got what was coming to
dialog: them.
text: He turns to her:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go to your apartment and pack. Wait
dialog: `till I get there. Don't answer the
dialog: door to anyone but me.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Eduardo, please?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Trust me.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I trust you.
text: She wants to, but she doesn't.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Clara. My name is not Eduardo.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My name is Jack.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Jack.
text: She looks worried.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: You promise you're not married?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I promise. Take this.
text: He hands her an ENVELOPE. It contains his final instalment.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look after it. In case.
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: (perplexed)
dialog: In case?
text: He wants to say it but he can't bring himself to.
dialog: In case this is goodbye.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Now go.
scene_heading: 164 EXT. STREET- DAY 164
text: LARRY is waiting on the corner of the town square.
text: He is dialling and re-dialling a number in his mobile phone,
text: scanning the crowds around him.
text: In the two seconds it takes the TAXI to pass by, JACK steps
text: free of a row cars on the other side of the street.
text: As LARRY comes into view again, JACK sees the STERLING
text: SUBMACHINE GUN in his hands.
text: And LARRY sees JACK.
text: LARRY'S FINGER tightens on the trigger.
text: L'AMERICANO throws himself to one side.
text: There is a quick burst of popping explosions: ripping along
text: the line of parked cars.
text: PANIC erupts.
text: JACK is about to fire back at LARRY but LARRY takes cover
text: behind a TOURIST and fires back another brief burst.
text: JACK is hit in the shoulder. He drops his gun...
text: ...and retrieves it just as LARRY fires again.
text: SCREAMS spread through the holiday crowd like a wave of fire
text: moving down the street and spilling into the town square.
dialog: 114.
scene_heading: 165 EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY 165
text: JACK runs into the square.
text: LARRY pursues him, firing for a third time.
text: The buzz of spent rounds and the crack of muzzle fire echo
text: around the square, bouncing off the walls and confusing the
dialog: crowd.
text: People start to run in different directions- everyone heading
text: for the maze of alleys that surround the main square.
text: ALTAR BOYS scatter. So do the LOCAL MEN carrying the STATUE
text: OF SAINT DOMINIC. The STATUE tumbles and smashes. Escaping
text: SNAKES writhe. FATHER BENEDETTO takes cover.
text: The two LOCAL CARABINIERI in their Land Rover get caught up
text: in the chaos. Confused, they turn on their SIRENS.
text: LARRY spots JACK in the crowd and fires a fourth time.
text: One TOURIST is killed outright, another injured
text: JACK dives for cover behind the STATUE OF THE EAGLE where he
dialog: spotted Clara.
text: Bullets ricochet.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You're too old for this life, Jack.
text: LARRY struggles for breath as he reloads.
dialog: This is JACK's chance.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You get sentimental then you fuck
dialog: things up.
text: Rolling along the steps to the statue of the eagle, JACK
text: spreads his legs, faces LARRY and fires the customary TWO
text: PRECISION-ENGINEERED SHOTS that make up a military-style
dialog: execution:
text: The first shot hits LARRY in the heart. LARRY is thrown
text: backwards against a parked car, accidentally altering his arc
text: of fire as slugs bounce off the steps beside JACK, chips of
text: marble stinging against his calves.
text: Again, JACK takes aim.
text: A beat as his finger tightens on the trigger.
text: HEADSHOT. Half LARRY'S FACE is wiped out of existence. What's
text: left of him slides down the parked car onto both knees. His
text: hand flashes to his mangled throat then drops. He falls
text: forwards and his STERLING clatters on the cobble stones.
dialog: 115.
dialog: Complete silence.
text: Not even the sound of a siren.
text: The town square is empty.
text: Except for FATHER BENEDETTO hiding in the wreckage of the
text: broken STATUE.
text: Jack's WALTHER hangs ominously by his side.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO stands unsteadily.
text: Like lightening JACK spins, instinctively raising his WALTHER
text: and zeroing in on FATHER BENEDETTO. His face is devoid of all
text: emotion. He is a bloody machine looking at a potential
dialog: target.
text: We hear SIRENS.
text: Across a slew of dead bodies, JACK keeps the gun pointed at
scene_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO stands stock still, facing JACK.
text: The SIRENS get louder.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What will you tell them?
text: A beat.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO takes something from inside his Soutane.
text: And holds it up with a trembling hand.
scene_heading: JACK'S LETTER.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: I will them that the man who wrote
dialog: this letter is my friend.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO smiles sadly.
speaker_heading: FATHER BENEDETTO
dialog: Jack.
text: FATHER BENEDETTO shuts his eyes, muttering a quiet prayer.
text: The SIRENS get closer.
text: We hear Carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering out
text: of their cars, cocking submachine guns.
text: When FATHER BENEDETTO opens his eyes again...
text: ...JACK has disappeared.
dialog: 116.
scene_heading: 166 EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY 166
text: Using his meticulous knowledge of the alleyways and lanes
text: that make up the medieval heart of the town, JACK avoids the
text: CARABINIERI and, stealing a bicycle, makes it onto the main
text: road before a road block has been set up.
scene_heading: 167 EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION, LEFT LUGGAGE- DAY 167
text: JACK collects a sports bag from a LOCKER.
scene_heading: 168 EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION, BATHROOM- DAY 168
text: JACK washes the blood from his hands.
scene_heading: 169 EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION, MAIN HALL- DAY 169
text: When he emerges from the bathroom JACK is wearing the clothes
text: of a fifty year-old American tourist from the mid-West with
text: glasses and a baseball cap.
text: He checks the time of next bus to Rome.
text: Then glances at his watch.
text: He has thirty minutes.
scene_heading: 170 EXT. L'AQUILA, STREET- DAY 170
text: JACK walks towards Clara's APARTMENT BUILDING.
text: Two hundred metres up ahead, two OFFICERS of the Guardia di
text: Finanza wait in an unmarked car.
text: JACK walks past Clara's APARTMENT BUILDING.
dialog: And keeps walking.
scene_heading: 171 EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION- DAY 171
text: The BUS for Rome is barely half-full.
text: Blending in perfectly with a group of middle aged American
text: tourists, JACK boards the steps, purchases a ticket and takes
text: a seat at the rear.
scene_heading: 172 EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY 172
text: A long tunnel: one of the longest in Europe.
text: JACK alone at the back of the BUS.
dialog: 117.
text: It seems like night: red stripes, strip lights, shadows.
text: Vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes.
text: A button of light, expanding...
dialog: ...as we burst into daylight.
speaker_heading: THE END.
