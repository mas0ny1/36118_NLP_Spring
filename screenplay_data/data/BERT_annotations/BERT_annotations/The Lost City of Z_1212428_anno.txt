text: GRAY AND WHITE.
text: Our opening image is uneven lines of gray and white,
text: beautiful and abstract.
dialog: We HEAR WIND.
text: The CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL:
scene_heading: EXT. IRISH LANDSCAPE - LATE DAY 1
text: A desolate-seeming, visually magnificent landscape. We were
text: looking at clouds, and they form glorious patterns in the
text: lowered sky. Like a painting by Lorraine, or Corot, or
dialog: Turner.
text: The horizon is dark, almost charcoal black.
text: A thin layer of fog drifts slowly across that abstract
dialog: surface.
text: As the FOG MOVES, it reveals: a MAN.
text: He has been running towards us. A silhouette. Like the rest
dialog: of the opening image, his appearance to us should conjure the
text: PRIMAL, the MYTHIC, the ELEMENTAL. It is as though he were
dialog: born out of this fog, this cosmic force.
text: He emerges from the fog.
text: It is PERCY HARRISON FAWCETT.
text: Thirties and handsome. Not exactly a youngster, but not
text: creaky and old, either. Strikes us as cheerful. A gentle
text: voice, an even manner. Despite his cheer and charm, however,
text: there is something steely about him, resolved, committed.
text: His eyes reveal a far more complex person than the exterior
text: might first allow; behind their twinkle there lurks a
dialog: capacity for furious wrath and implacable resolution, the
dialog: more dangerous because they are held in leash...
text: Over the wind now, we begin to HEAR CHURCH BELLS RINGING.
text: Fawcett himself gets closer and closer to us... We HEAR a

text: The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a SILHOUETTE in the
text: foreground, through a doorway. A WOMAN’S FORM.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER 2
text: Outside a rural church. A woman steps toward the outer
text: fence, holding a small baby. She is waiting for Percy, it
text: seems. The WOMAN is NINA FAWCETT. The baby is JACK FAWCETT,
dialog: their newborn son.
text: Nina Fawcett, thirties, is bubbly and flighty, but also
text: highly cultured. Brash at times, a woman of independent
dialog: curiosity.
text: There are a few other people, of varying ages and shapes and
text: sizes, right behind her. All look happy, very happy. Among
scene_heading: them: JAMES BERNARD, 4th EARL OF BANDON ("LORD BERNARD”),
text: seventies, piercing eyes, intense.
text: Percy ARRIVES AT LAST. He meets her and the child. He
text: embraces her, and the couple look ecstatic, glowing.
speaker_heading: NINA FAWCETT
dialog: We’d no doubt you’d be here--
dialog: (to the baby)
dialog: DID we, Jack.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: The men made a complete hash of

dialog: (looks at the other
dialog: people)
dialog: Good afternoon all... We're very
dialog: grateful for your attendance today.
dialog: (back to Nina)
dialog: Shall we, darling?
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - LATER 3
dialog: It is a rural Irish church, lovely, with history. We are
text: toward the end of a CHRISTENING CEREMONY.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: “CORK, IRELAND, 1903”
text: A MINISTER is here, putting the christening robe on the boy.
text: He anoints him with oil, and as he does he speaks. While he
text: speaks, we have a CLOSE SHOT on the INFANT’S HAND. Percy's
text: hand caresses it. Then a CLOSE SHOT on PERCY--a smile, then
text: a kind of regression into thought. HE GETS EMOTIONAL...

dialog: Lost City of Z Blue Revision Set 8/19/15 3.
text: WHILE HE IS FINISHING HIS SPEECH: NINA WITHDRAWS AN ELABORATE
text: MANDALA NECKLACE, which she HANGS AROUND the CHILD'S HEAD.
text: The others nearby who see this are flummoxed for a moment.
text: Except for Percy, who touches the mandala with a surprising
dialog: reverence...
text: Those IN ATTENDANCE finish things with an “AMEN”. The
text: Minister then turns to Percy and Nina and the others:
speaker_heading: MINISTER (CONT'D)
dialog: As this is a private ceremony, I
dialog: shall take the liberty to welcome
dialog: Jack’s parents back from Ceylon,
dialog: where they have been stationed for
dialog: three years. I know Major Percy
dialog: Fawcett and his lovely wife, Nina
dialog: to be fine people, who, though they
dialog: have often pursued their own path,
dialog: remain committed to making their
dialog: family a true support of our
dialog: Christian community.
text: A “HERE HERE” from those in attendance. All converge on
text: Percy and Nina and baby Jack. James Bernard, 4th Earl of
text: Bandon ("LORD BERNARD”) approaches Nina and Percy:
speaker_heading: LORD BERNARD
dialog: What a beautiful ceremony. Such a
dialog: precious child--congratulations to
dialog: you both. And no doubt, great
dialog: comfort after such a difficult
dialog: birth.
speaker_heading: NINA FAWCETT
dialog: Thank you, Lord Bernard. It WAS a
dialog: very near thing, and there was much
text: concern. But all is well now.
speaker_heading: LORD BERNARD
dialog: Of course, of course!
dialog: (turns to Percy)
dialog: A word to the wise--been very
dialog: difficult for many of the men at
dialog: the Fort to find a nanny of good
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: We intend to raise the boy
dialog: ourselves, Lord Bernard--we don’t
dialog: wish for our children to be
dialog: strangers.
dialog: (to Nina)
dialog: Our children will become our
dialog: dearest companions.

dialog: Lost City of Z White 7/31/15 4.
speaker_heading: LORD BERNARD
dialog: (as though they were insane)
dialog: Ah... I see...very well, then...
dialog: I...wish you the very best...
text: Fawcett nods to Bernard, then, beaming, turns back to his
dialog: wife. With great expectation and tenderness, to his wife:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Our lives begin anew today...
text: We begin to HEAR: a GALLOPING HORSE: THUMPITY THUMPITY
scene_heading: THUMPITY... LOUDER AND LOUDER...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CORK HARBOR, IRELAND - LATE DAY 4
text: A Fort: large and foreboding.
text: SILHOUETTED, the sun behind: MOUNTED SOLDIERS ON HORSES,
text: galloping in circles. PERCY FAWCETT is dressed impeccably
text: atop his horse; he wears a crisp uniform with gold buttons
text: and a spiked helmet strapped under his chin.
text: NEAR A WALL AT THE CHURCH: a GROUP OF OLDER MEN, standing,
text: and WOMEN, seated, with their children. With umbrellas above
text: their heads, fans in hand. NINA is here, holding JACK, NOW
text: AGE 3. IRISH BAGPIPES and DRUMS are playing; children are
text: dancing. LORD BERNARD is here, standing near NINA.
text: ANGLE ON: a HUNT LEADER, late forties. He is surrounded by
text: the mounted soldiers, ready for a big moment. LOUDLY:
speaker_heading: HUNT LEADER
dialog: Gentlemen! I expect you to behave
dialog: with distinction on this hunt! The
dialog: deer will be delivered to the
dialog: Archduke Ferdinand at the gala!
dialog: Remember: honor, duty, and good
dialog: sportsmanship are the cornerstones
dialog: of our proud civilization! Good
dialog: luck and godspeed!
text: Fawcett sees them in the distance. They wave to him. In
text: return, he explodes in warmth, waves. OTHER SOLDIERS circle
text: FAWCETT, ribbing him in their soldierly way:

text: Fawcett and the REST OF THE MEN ON HORSEBACK break out with
text: great determination. Fawcett YELLS at, KICKS, his horse...
scene_heading: EXT. CORK HARBOR - FIELDS 5
text: A WILD DEER, a buck with big antlers, speeds through the
text: grass. Hounds BARK, running through the terrain...
text: The PACK OF HORSES, FAWCETT AMONG THEM, chases behind. We
text: HEAR the distant WHOOPS, the CHEERS, the HORNS, the
text: EXULTATION of the MOUNTED TROOPS charging in pursuit of the
dialog: deer...
text: PERCY FAWCETT is on his horse, HOOTING, as are the others.
text: The Other Soldiers RIDE NEXT TO HIM--COMPETITIVE and SOUR-
text: FACED that he rides off in a different direction:
speaker_heading: OTHER SOLDIER #1
dialog: Fawcett! There’s no path there!
dialog: FAWCETT! You’re mad!
text: FAWCETT RIDES OFF into another direction--where there is no
text: path. THE HOUNDS run as though their lives depend on it,
text: BARKING rabidly in pursuit... THE DEER is running because
text: its life DOES depend on it... The horses are kicked until
dialog: bloody...
text: HORSE after HORSE tumbles from rough terrain, and many of the
text: MEN--UNLIKE FAWCETT--are not able to continue...
dialog: 
text: FAWCETT kicks/whips his horse with astonishing drive, and
text: does an end-run around many of his competitors, cutting them
dialog: off.

text: The deer, meanwhile, enters a nearby area of dense, tall
text: grass. It runs in a circle, entangled by the weeds. FAWCETT
text: approaches the animal.
text: Fawcett takes out his RIFLE... HE FIRES. The deer stumbles
text: to the ground. JUST THEN, YOUNG SOLDIERS ARRIVE AT THE
text: SCENE, hounds too. Fawcett watches the animal die.
text: One of the soldiers examins the deer and calls out, “DEAD!”.
text: A CHEER. The men pass a FLASK to Fawcett, who takes a swig:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: To death--the best sauce to life!
text: Some of the men let out another LOUD CHEER as others are
dialog: considerably more disappointed...
scene_heading: NEAR THE CHURCH
text: Fawcett goes to his BABY SON and beaming Nina. He kisses
text: Nina, then HOLDS THE CHILD HIGH, kisses him. A HUGE GRIN
text: from the happy father amidst cheers.
text: Music up: “Avrem Lieta,” from Giuseppe Verdi’s LA TRAVIATA, a
text: forceful and upbeat waltz:
scene_heading: EXT. FAWCETT RESIDENCE - ARMY BARRACKS - NIGHT B6

dialog: We're going to be late.
text: Nina fixes herself for another beat, then:

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Rather lovely.
speaker_heading: NINA FAWCETT
dialog: “Rather lovely”. Thank you! You

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT

text: A beat. Then:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: (more serious now)
dialog: I’m getting older, Cheeky. And

speaker_heading: SECRETARY BRYCE
dialog: (comprehending somehow)

scene_heading: FAWCETT AND NINA DANCE
text: Around and around. Fawcett SEES the OFFICERS STARING AT HIM,
dialog: and he can TELL they are talking about him--and not ina
text: flattering way, either. A LAUGH, a SNICKER...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: HE IS DISRESPECTED, AND HE KNOWS IT.

speaker_heading: TADJUI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN
dialog: Major--I’m not one for speeches.
dialog: And if I should die here, I know my

scene_heading: DRIZZLING RAIN. CLOSE SHOT ON FAWCETT. HE’S GOT A WIDE-EYED
scene_heading: STARE, with DARK and DEEP-SET EYES.
text: Fawcett may be frail, but he is at least mentally in control
text: of himself--unlike the others. Costin is either unconscious
dialog: or DEAD.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Mr. Costin...? Mr. Costin?
text: Fawcett is visibly upset that Costin does not answer. Tadjui
text: prays aloud... Manley is shivering terribly and covered with
text: maggots; HE IS STICKING HIS TONGUE OUT, TO CATCH THE RAIN AS
text: IT FALLS FOR HYDRATION. Dan is muttering to himself, aloud;
text: he also sticks out his tongue for the rain’s water. Even the
text: dogs have gone totally lethargic, and the carcass of one of

text: Willis rummages through the food baskets. Nothing but a
text: couple of rotten fruit. He begins to cry:
speaker_heading: WILLIS
dialog: No more food! Ain’t nothing left--
speaker_heading: NOTHING--—
text: ONLY A ROTTEN BANANA REMAINS. Willis charges for it; Dan and
text: he FIGHT OVER IT BRIEFLY. SEEING this: Fawcett gets up,
text: approaches the men:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Stop it--get--we’re not savages!
text: Tadjui stops playing the zampona. He stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're leaving our bones here! And
dialog: for what?!? A map??? We’re not
dialog: even lookin’ for gold!
text: Dan STEPS BACK, ARMED. He approaches Fawcett, dangerously

text: Lost City of Z Buff Revisions (10/25/15) 45.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)

dialog: Let’s have at him!
text: Fawcett looks at the others. With the exception of Costin
text: and Manley, both of whom now LOOK UNCONSCIOUS if NOT DEAD,
text: they all SEEM READY TO CHARGE AT HIM. Fawcett seems to steel
dialog: himself.
dialog: 
text: Dan TAKES A STEP FORWARD, and Fawcett’s eyes widen. Then
text: FAWCETT CATCHES SIGHT OF COSTIN--WHO HAS TURNED TOWARD US,
text: HOLDING HIS PISTOL! (Dan has his back to Costin and cannot
dialog: see.)
text: Dan takes a step TOWARD Fawcett, ready to do away with him,
text: when--COSTIN FIRES! Dan CURLS OVER with a STUNNING VIOLENCE,
text: BLOOD POURING FROM HIS EAR. Dan CUPS his ear with his hands,
text: howling in pain.
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN
dialog: The next one I’1l1 put between your

text: AND THEN: wordlessly, TADJUI POINTS. The others turn to

scene_heading: EXT. LAND NEAR THE SOURCE OF THE VERDE RIVER 44
text: The water dribbles from a small cliff, down into the base of

scene_heading: FAWCETT SPINS AROUND. TADJUI IS INDEED GONE. As are the *

text: Fawcett stops him.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Mr. Manley! He got us here, didn’t *
dialog: he...?
text: Fawcett hears a subtle CRUNCHING NOISE in the brush. ALL ARE
text: STARTLED. Takes a quiet step forward.
text: FAWCETT holds his finger to his lips--"QUIET!” And then ducks
text: into the brush. Costin approaches, sees something, or at
text: least thinks he does. Turns to Manley, who is standing next
text: to him. Whispering:
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN
dialog: Am I dreaming it? *
speaker_heading: ARTHUR MANLEY
dialog: No--I see it too. *
text: LONG-LENS CLOSE SHOT on a DEER.
text: SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, about 30, deeper into the forest. The

text: The men now surround Fawcett with the gun. Fawcett is
text: silently getting ready to fire. The deer is chewing grass.
text: Manley is praying to himself. Dan, also praying but aloud,
text: is still panicking:
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Please... Lord... It’s our only
dialog: chance!
speaker_heading: WILLIS
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Shut up!
text: CLOSE SHOT ON FAWCETT’S EYE as he readies the shot. CLOSE

dialog: 
text: FAWCETT WALKS TO IT. REACHES OUT. TOUCHES IT.
text: THEN TAKES SEVERAL STEPS FORWARD, as if to continue the
text: MISSION DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE.
text: HE SEES: PAINTINGS, on ROCKS. He looks to the ground,
text: SPOTTING SHARDS OF POTTERY, STATUES. He SEEMS ALMOST LIKE A

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
dialog: Good Christ--

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER B6él
text: Then: THE ARROWS AND SPEARS STOP. Fawcett opens his eyes.
text: The sound returns--except that it’s gone quiet. A GUARAYO
text: INDIAN peers out from the forest.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER 61
text: Paddling out toward Fawcett in a raft, the GUARAYO takes the
text: handkerchief from Fawcett; Fawcett motions to be taken
text: across, and the two go to the Indian side with Fawcett
text: kneeling humbly on the flimsy float.
text: The whole group waits in silence for Fawcett, who disappears

speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: (to the others, loud)
dialog: All of you! Should the red man

scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK —- MOMENTS LATER 62

text: Lost City of Z Green Revision Set 09/30/2015 69A.
text: Fawcett emerges too, smiling. He waves to his men.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Good God.
text: The group, including Murray, all venture across the river.
scene_heading: EXT. GUARAYOS CAMPFIRE AREA 63
text: The men slowly approach the area. Human skulls abound. A
text: HUMAN BEING’S BODY is BEING COOKED on a SPIT. The troops are
text: spooked. Murray, in particular, seems appalled.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: I recognize a bit of the chief's
dialog: language. It’s safe for us.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY

dialog: engage.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: They've cooked a body, for
dialog: chrissakes! Have you gone insane?
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: It’s a dead member of the tribe--
dialog: his spirit will enter them if they
dialog: eat it. It’s their custom.
dialog: (to the whole group)
dialog: They may have critical information
dialog: about our destination.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: They’1l kill us, these savages!
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I refuse this madness. I refuse

text: Manley, Costin, and the others look at Fawcett as though he

speaker_heading: FOREST.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY (CONT’D)
dialog: Madness!
text: Fawcett sees the others agree with Murray to a degree. He
text: doesn’t respond, and a brief look of madness, of possession,
text: flashes across his face. So instead he walks to:
scene_heading: INT. GUARAYOS TENT 64
text: The other men eventually, reluctantly follow Fawcett into the
text: tent--though conspicuously missing is MURRAY. Packed with
text: both our guys and the Guarayos now. A beat of silence, then,
dialog: to Costin:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Can you give them something?
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN
dialog: Yes--yes, of course.
text: Costin stupidly strikes _a_match, and though panicked, the
text: Indians calm quickly when Fawcett takes out a glittering
dialog: necklace:
text: Lost City of Z Green Revision Set 09/30/2015 70A.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE)
dialog: No--it’s a gift! A gift! For you.
dialog: And your--your son?
dialog: Lost City of Z White 7/31/15 71.
text: The Chief Guarayo, sitting next to a boy, gestures to him.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
dialog: Yes, wonderful... I have sons,
dialog: too.
text: The Chief smiles, points to Costin, Manley. Fawcett laughs:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
dialog: No no, my sons are far away.
speaker_heading: CHIEF GUARAYO (SUBTITLE)
dialog: How can you be so far from them?
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: (his smile disappears)
dialog: Our world is not like yours...
text: ANOTHER GUARAYO, A WOMAN, responds:
speaker_heading: GUARAYO WOMAN (SUBTITLE)
dialog: All people are made of the same
dialog: clay.
text: The Chief takes a crushed BERRY COMPOUND and gestures to
text: FAWCETT around his EYES. FAWCETT COMPLIES, spreading the
text: DARK RED MIXTURE ON HIS FACE.
text: Then one of the GUARAYOS reaches for Costin’s ARM. At first,
text: Costin has trepidation, then allows the man to grab his
dialog: forearm.
text: THE GUARAYO WHISTLES LOUDLY, in a STRANGE PITCH. And the
text: MAGGOTS in Costin’s arm STAND UP. The Guarayo simply
text: squeezes gently and the maggots fall on the ground. Costin’s
dialog: arm_is cured of the maggots--!
text: Costin TRIES TO WHISTLE like the GUARAYO but cannot:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Not sure we have the touch.
dialog: (back to the Guarayo;
speaker_heading: SUBTITLE)
dialog: We're looking for old houses, many
text: houses, many many people, deep into
dialog: the forest. Do you know of this?
text: The Guarayo speaks in his native tongue. Then, to Costin:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
dialog: He’s heard rumors, but is
text: uncertain. Further down the river,
dialog: he believes there’1l be others who
dialog: can help us.

dialog: 66
dialog: Lost City of Z Green Revision Set 09/30/2015 72.
text: Then another Guarayo motions to his mouth. Food.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
dialog: Food--yes--thank you!
text: ANGLE ON THE CHIEF as we GO TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK 65
text: A Guarayo crushes a plant with a stone and lets the juice
text: spill into the water. A milky cloud forms. After a moment,
text: DOZENS OF FISH RISE TO THE SURFACE, gasping. A Guarayo boy
text: wades into the water and pulls out the biggest. Fawcett, who
text: had been making his own face up with beads, bows his head in
text: thanks as he takes the fish.
text: Fawcett turns and looks at the water.
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN
dialog: MY GOD! It’s only stunned them!
dialog: They don’t kill any more than they
dialog: have to! ‘S remarkable!
text: The other fish that the boy didn’t withdraw from the water
dialog: swim away.
scene_heading: EXT. GUARAYOS TENT —- CLEARING 66
text: A thunderstorm is coming. Fawcett, with his makeup looking
text: native now, walks into the clearing, and in front of him he
text: sees that here are THOUSANDS of Indians living about. An
dialog: astonishing discovery. And they are not just savages. They
dialog: have advanced methods of farming; MAIZE GROWS AS FAR AS THE
text: EYE CAN SEE. Costin approaches:
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN
dialog: We seem to have lost Mr. Murray.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: They've made the jungle into
dialog: farmland somehow. All the families
dialog: are working together--and there is
dialog: no rank or superiority among them.
dialog: It’s truly humbling.
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN

dialog: (to Costin)
dialog: Can you imagine what our lost city
dialog: must be like...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN
dialog: Chief, did you hear me about Mr.
dialog: Murray? Your great polar
dialog: explorer’s gone lost in the trees--
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Mr. Murray is an accomplished man--
dialog: we're not to fret over him. And
dialog: anyhow, he can’t have gone very
dialog: far. Tell the men I’ve designed
text: new rafts--the canoes are riddled
dialog: with arrows and useless now. We’1ll
dialog: be off on foot in the morning...
text: Fawcett walks into the field of MAIZE. The wind blows the
text: plants, and Fawcett is an incongruous figure amidst the
text: Guarayos, who tend to the crops.
text: Costin watches as Fawcett approaches the LEADER OF THE
text: GUARAYOS and teaches him to HANDSHAKE. A GOODBYE OF SORTS...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF GUARAYO (SUBTITLE)
dialog: You may stay here with us. Join

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (SUBTITLE)
dialog: (a beat; awe)
dialog: You honor me beyond words. But it
dialog: is not yet time for me to rest.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING 67
text: Murray is asleep on the ground. He has gotten lost. Strewn
text: nearby: his machete, all the photos of his family. Sitting
text: in the mud. Food eaten, the wrappings all over. Turkish
dialog: cigarette butts...
text: He awakens to see FAWCETT AND THE REST OF THE GROUP,
text: approaching him. Fawcett sees all the food’s been eaten. To
text: Murray, Fawcett must appear a strange figure--with his FACE
text: PAINT, now slightly streaked from the rain like tears...
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: Thank God you’ve found me--I--I got

dialog: My clothes and mouth--full of grit!
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: You'll be looked after. We must be
dialog: on our way now--
text: BUT THEN: Fawcett reaches down, finds: AN EMPTY BOX OF
scene_heading: CARAMELS. INSIDE THE LID: “For your journey, darling, I love
text: you. Nina”. A FAWCETT FAMILY PHOTO IS INCLUDED.
text: Something changes in Fawcett. DARKENS.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
dialog: This...was from my wife and
dialog: children...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: For all of us.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: Yes--I know--I was hungry! It was
dialog: supposed to be just a short rest.
dialog: The scrub’s incredibly dense and I
dialog: fell. I think I’ve a terrible
dialog: fever...
text: A BEAT. And then Fawcett looks like he is about to EXPLODE.
text: His EYES BULGE WITH RAGE:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Get up.
text: Fawcett turns, ferociously hacks a branch with a machete.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: Mr. Fawcett--just one more moment
dialog: of rest... I’m very tired--
text: Fawcett FREEZES. SPINS BACK AROUND. Raging:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: You're tired? You have no right to
dialog: be tired!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My own sons--at their tender ages--
dialog: could be counted on more than you.
dialog: I could be with them at this very
dialog: moment, yet I am here with YOU, to
dialog: attempt great things.
dialog: 
text: He collects himself, bends down again. Privately:

text: Lost City of Z Green Revision Set 09/30/2015 75.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
dialog: You stole from the group and
dialog: violated our trust. I won't have
dialog: this again.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: How dare you speak to me that way!
dialog: Have you seen my leg? HAVE YOU?!?
text: Fawcett looks down: Murray’s leg has a gash. Fawcett bends
text: down, looks at the wound. The other men surround Murray.
text: Murray's things have scattered all over the jungle.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: It’s not yet infected, but if blood *
dialog: poisoning should set in, you'll be
text: a dead man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If you’d stayed with the group and

speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: (at a loss for words)
dialog: Yes, well, I’1l, I’11l do that!
text: ANGLE ON MURRAY as FAWCETT walks away. He is STEAMING.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER 68
text: They are rafting. Dizzying. Murray is SHIVERING, VERY SICK,
text: a mess. Maggots have overwhelmed his legs. Fawcett and
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Costin are maneuvering the raft. *
text: BUMP! The rafts shift with the river’s flow. Murray and *
text: Costin fall off the raft. Costin knows what to do; he starts *
dialog: swimming to shore. Murray does not. *
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT *
dialog: Swim to shore! The water’s too *
dialog: rough for piranhas! *
text: Instead, Murray attempts to hold onto the raft and threatens *
dialog: to capsize it.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D)
dialog: I said, swim to shore!
text: The raft starts to shift. Fawcett is enraged:

text: The raft tips, and TWO CRATES OF SUPPLIES GO TUMBLING *
text: OVERBOARD. Manley tries to stop them, to no avail... *
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE 69
text: Fawcett directs the raft to the shore using a bamboo pole.
text: The raft bumps up against the riverbank. Everyone has

speaker_heading: ARTHUR MANLEY *
dialog: We've just lost a third of our *

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT *

speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: For heaven's sake, I was drowning!
dialog: Didn't you SEE?!?
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: There was no chance of that! And
dialog: this after you took our food!
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: I suppose the honorable course of
dialog: action would be for me to starve,
dialog: then? Is that it? Is that what
dialog: you wish for? My death?!?
dialog: Fawcett, to Costin:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Where are we now, do we know? Are
dialog: we behind our schedule?
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN *
dialog: Yes. We are-- *
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: You're entirely without mercy! You
dialog: could at least slow down to give a
dialog: lame man a chance for his life!
text: Still not paying attention to Murray, Fawcett remains fixed

speaker_heading: CREWMEMBER
dialog: Horse down!
text: The Crewmember takes out his gun, SHOOTS THE HORSE.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE FIRE:
text: Murray has a fever. Truly sick: swollen, distended, in
text: terrible shape--covered with maggots. A colorful snake hangs
text: from a tree over his head. He moans over and over,
text: shivering. To a noncomprehending Indian, he gets delirious:
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: I’m going to die too, just like
dialog: that horse. I’m a man of
dialog: property...now worth as much as
dialog: that horse...
scene_heading: SEEING THE MAGGOTS, TEARS COME TO MURRAY’S EYES. COMPLETELY
scene_heading: SICK, DYING, DELIRIOUS:
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY (CONT’D)
dialog: The affrontery of this upstart, and
dialog: his vulgar quest for glory... Like
dialog: a Judas...delivering me over to
dialog: this jungle when he handed over our
dialog: Lord, to be crucified... Father,
dialog: forgive me this trespasses,
dialog: As we forgive them that trespass
dialog: against us... But...but let me not
dialog: compare myself to thee, my Lord.
dialog: You have delivered me from other
dialog: evils, Lord. The fierce cold in
dialog: Antarctica, was I weak then?
dialog: (strained smile through
dialog: tears)
dialog: He is not even worthy to kiss the

speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN

speaker_heading: + eH
text: Fawcett moves closer. Sotto voce, looking at Murray:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: I fooled myself for some time, but
dialog: no longer--the man is a cancer. If *
dialog: we keep him with us we won’t
dialog: survive, much less reach the city
dialog: and return to our families.
speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN
dialog: I say we ditch him, leave him to
dialog: rot. I’ve wanted to from the
dialog: beginning. His Lordship’s a coward
dialog: and a thief. *
speaker_heading: ARTHUR MANLEY
dialog: I’m in agreement, Major--there

speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER

text: eyes Fawcett suspiciously:
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: What is it...?
dialog: Lost City of Z Green Revision Set 09/30/2015 79.
text: Fawcett speaks deliberately, almost as if proving a case ina
text: courtroom. In measured and careful tones, like a speech he
dialog: has prepared:
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: When traveling in the jungle
dialog: without other resources, every man
dialog: must realize that if he falls sick
dialog: and cannot move with the others
dialog: that there must be consequences.
text: The others cannot wait and die with
dialog: him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you understand?
text: Murray seems to get it. An awkward beat, then: Murray starts
text: to grip his revolver.
speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: You’re only here--all of you--
dialog: because of the funds I provided!
text: Costin whips his shotgun out, points it directly at Murray.
text: Pushes the shotgun up against his cheek. A tense moment.
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Many of us have families back home.
dialog: And I cannot allow you to further
dialog: jeopardize the welfare of our

dialog: (to Costin)
dialog: Mr. Costin.
text: As Costin takes Murray’s revolver from him:

speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: You don’t care one whit about me or
dialog: the rest of our party, Mr. Fawcett.
dialog: You don’t even care about returning
dialog: home--you only care about finding
dialog: your bloody city!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: There are some in our group that
dialog: would have me abandon you here and
dialog: leave you to die. But I will not.
text: There are mining encampments south
dialog: of us, along the river. In the

dialog: You'll pack me off with a bloody

dialog: (beat )
dialog: This calm willingness to abandon me
dialog: is a queer thing to hear from an

scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - MORNING 71

speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: (interrupting, with rage)

speaker_heading: HENRY COSTIN

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: To be sent to the R.G.S.: Mr.

scene_heading: INT. ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY - HALLWAY 77

scene_heading: SIR JOHN SCOTT KELTIE
dialog: Major. You know many of us here.

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: No, it is not. He was sent back

speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: He also tried to kill me, Sir

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: That’s absurd. We almost killed

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: When I last saw you, Mr. Murray, I
dialog: was putting you on our only
dialog: remaining horse and giving you more

speaker_heading: JAMES MURRAY
dialog: Saved my life, did you?!? You left

dialog: (to Keltie)

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: Yes. I should apologize.
dialog: (looks to Costin, Manley)
dialog: To my crew. I’m sorry that I ever

speaker_heading: PERCY FAWCETT
dialog: When I was younger, I ventured all
dialog: for King and Country, for place,
dialog: and rank. I believed that to be
dialog: the makings of a man. But my
dialog: travels have taught me that such

dialog: Phantoms that exclude humanity from

dialog: friends, what DOES matter--the only

text: others kiss small bibles; others look at family photos which
text: they kiss and place in their breastpockets. Others are
text: merely still, awaiting almost certain death. Fawcett takes a

text: Almost like he’s praying to it. Then pockets it.
text: We SEE: ROWS OF HORSES, getting GAS MASKS put on their heads.
text: INDIAN TROOPS are getting ready to mount them, and are
text: adorned in the most elaborate and absurd manner...
scene_heading: EXT. TRENCH - BATTLEFIELD - DAY 94

text: FLAMETHROWERS.
text: EXPLOSIONS ALL AROUND. Mines. Shells. Brutally loud.
text: THEN: THE TWO INDIAN CAVALRY REGIMENTS GALLOP out of the

dialog: Darling, it is I. We’re here--the
