text: He is 28. Handsome. An all-American face. Bright, green and

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NINTH FLOOR HALLWAY - MORNING

text: Matt arrives at a paint-chipped door at the end of the

scene_heading: ECU -- THE KEY
text: slightly larger than a regular key -- with a series of

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT —- CONTINUOUS
text: An alarm BEEPS. Matt punches in a five-digit code -- shutting

text: -- SILENCE. The whole world just seems to DISAPPEAR.
text: As he steps further inside, first thing we notice about the
dialog: apartment --
dialog: -- how little there is to notice: bare walls; bare floors; no
dialog: windows; no real furniture.
text: It looks like it was robbed but since Matt isn’t worried, we
dialog: can only assume this is how it always looks.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Matt opens the fridge and tosses in the fruit he bought. It

scene_heading: INT. UNIDENTIFIED ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Pitch black until a light flickers on and a dozen monitors

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: Then why aren’t you following them?
speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: I’m not your handler, Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: As you’ve told me.
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: Several times.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'll be quick. I just wanna know:
dialog: what did Harlan think of my report?
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: Which report is that?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Key Surveillance Threats. I put it
text: in an overnight pouch. He read it,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: Matt --
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You gave it to him, right?
text: Barlow sighs.
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No? Why?
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: Because I didn’t need him giving it
dialog: back to me, asking why I gave it to
text: him in the first place.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're saying he wouldn’t read it?
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: I’m saying no one would read it.
text: It’s unsolicited.
text: Barlow arrives at a fortified gate. Stops at the security
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What does that mean?
text: A MARINE GUARD approaches his window. Barlow hands over his
dialog: ID: David Barlow - South America - Central Intelligence
dialog: Agency.
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: It means you’re not an agent, Matt.
dialog: You're just a housekeeper. Stick to
dialog: keeping houses. Operational intel
dialog: is about eight rungs above your
dialog: head.
text: Matt -- stung. He’s ready for more responsibility, but isn’t
text: getting the chance. The guard hands Barlow back his ID.
speaker_heading: BARLOW (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I gotta go. Don’t call me

speaker_heading: TOBIN FROST

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- THE BUILDING ACROSS FROM HIM
scene_heading: INT. DIM ROOM - SAME

dialog: clientele; the public drug use; needles; coke.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Can we move this along? Before I
dialog: need a tetanus shot.
text: Maxim tosses back two of the drinks, lights up a cigarette,

scene_heading: HALLIBURTON ZERO STEEL BRIEFCASE
text: He sets it between them. Blows smoke up into the air.
speaker_heading: MAXIM

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: How'd you get it?
speaker_heading: MAXIM
dialog: Who cares. Only thing that matters
dialog: is I came through, yes?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Not if it’s tagged.
speaker_heading: MAXIM
dialog: Impossible. It came from a clerk in
dialog: their Haifa office. Look for
dialog: yourself.
text: Frost unlocks the case. Pops it open.
text: INSIDE THE CASE: rubbing alcohol, cotton swabs, a tiny pod
text: and something that resembles a STAPLE GUN.
speaker_heading: MAXIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Some of your old bosses aren’t

text: We follow him out -- past drunk men, clawing at women.
text: Disgusting assholes.
text: Frost spies -- tucked into the corner -- a DRUNK. About his
text: size. SLAPPING a stripper across the face. Frost stops,
text: sizing the guy up. He turns to Frost. Locks eyes.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: The fuck you looking at, puto?
text: Frost refuses to look away. Instead, he calmly reaches into

speaker_heading: PHFT!
text: A bullet rips into his head. He drops to the ground -- blood

text: Bystanders SCREAM -- race away -- freaked. Except one: a
text: LOCAL. He RUSHES up to the body -- grabbing the briefcase and
text: popping it open right there.
text: It’s EMPTY.
text: Local quickly looks to the body. Shirt’s a different color.
text: Continues up to the face -- wait -- NOT FROST -- it’s THE
text: DRUNK ASSHOLE -- BILLS sticking out of his pants pocket.
text: Local peers up the window across the street but --
dialog: 12.

scene_heading: INT. STRIP CLUB - BATHROOM - SAME
text: Frost at the mirror. In front of him: the rubbing alcohol,

scene_heading: EXT. STRIP CLUB - MOMENTS LATER
text: The back door of the strip club swings open. Frost moves

scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - SAME

scene_heading: INT. CAB - SAME
text: Frost JERKS forward -- SLAMS his head against the partition.
text: Dazed, he shakes his eyes clear as -- PHFT! -- a bullet
text: spider-webs the glass behind him -- just whizzing past his
dialog: head.
text: He peers through the cracked glass. Looks up. Just catches a

dialog: the other side as:
speaker_heading: VARGAS
text: takes aim -- PHFT! -- thisclose to hitting him.
text: Frost continues on -- never breaking stride -- SLAMMING INTO
text: PEOPLE -- knocking them aside like a pinball.
text: Vargas races after him. But when he rounds the same corner
dialog: Frost just did --
text: -- Frost has VANISHED. Replaced by a STREET FAIR. Packed with
text: people. Loud. Noisy.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- FROST
text: hiding behind a vendor's booth, watching Vargas search for

speaker_heading: BLOOD
text: drips onto his shoes. HIS BLOOD. Coming from A BULLET WOUND

text: Applies pressure. Winces.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Shit.
text: POP! POP! POP! POP! Frost whirls --
text: -- just tiny firecrackers that kids are throwing nearby,
dialog: watching explode. Fuck that sounded just --
text: -- PHFT! PHFT! -- BULLETS -- whizzing by his head again,
text: missing by mere inches.
text: He doesn’t know where they’re coming from, but they’re

dialog: Frost takes off. Books --
scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - CONTINUOUS

text: at him and the vehicle -- PHFT! PHFT!
text: A bullet STRIKES the back tire -- causes it to SKID -- and

text: behind a tree -- directly across from:
speaker_heading: THE AMERICAN EMBASSY

dialog: fuck could he go there? He can’t go there right? But he’s not
dialog: armed and --
text: -- oh shit -- he’s bleeding bad now. He could pass out. Gotta
dialog: make a move. Fuck it. Better an embassy with plenty of exits
text: than an exposed area with a sniper gun aimed at your head.
text: He looks down the street. A VAN is driving up. He has to time
dialog: this just right.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- VARGAS
text: looking through the scope. He knows what Frost is gonna do.
text: Knows he has one shot.
text: The van drives up. Perfect cover. Frost times it right. Races
text: out from behind the tree.
text: Vargas can’t get a shot off -- view of Frost blocked by the

speaker_heading: SECURITY OFFICER
dialog: Passport please.

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- FROST’S PASSPORT
text: Except the picture, nothing about it is real. Phony name.

dialog: continue.
text: He steps to the metal detector. Empties out his keys, phone

scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sparse: just a table, sofa, two chairs. Matt occupies one of
text: them. In front of him: six steel gun pieces and a stopwatch.
text: Matt clicks the stopwatch. Shuts his eyes and starts putting
text: together the pieces -- forming a Sig-Sauer pistol. He clicks
text: the stopwatch again, opens his eyes and checks his time: 13
dialog: seconds. A good time -- unless you’re Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shit.
text: He frowns. Knows he can do better.
speaker_heading: LATER

scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

speaker_heading: MATT

scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM (FORMERLY UNIDENTIFIED
scene_heading: ROOM) -— CONTINUOUS
text: Matt steps inside -- gives a quick once-over of all the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE — HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -- and gets four steps away before -- the intercom BUZZES.
text: Loud. Ear-piercing. Matt turns around -- curious.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM — MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Matt steps back inside. Sees -- on one of the screens:
speaker_heading: KIEFER
text: standing outside, pelted by rain, ringing the apartment. Matt
text: hits a talk switch.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: I need a room.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Do you have an account?
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: Daniel Kiefer, Atwater Insurance.
text: Matt picks up the secure phone. We hear a familiar voice:
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Satcom ten.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: South America.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Designator?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Echo Bravo two three.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)

scene_heading: Kiefer. K-I-E-F-E-R.

scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE —- SURVEILLANCE ROOM — SAME
speaker_heading: LANDLORD (V.O.)
dialog: Account confirmed.
text: They hang up. Matt looks at a screen. Kiefer’s CIA dossier

dialog: 22.
text: This guy’s serious. He hits the talk button. Looks at Kiefer
text: on the monitor.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How many beds?
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: Six.
text: Matt looks at another screen.
scene_heading: EXT. SAFE HOUSE - SAME
text: We PUSH IN on a street lamp. Inside: a concealed camera.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE —- SURVEILLANCE ROOM — SAME
dialog: 
text: A screen shows that camera’s vantage point: a BLACK VAN is
text: parked in front.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Luggage?
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: Just a bag.
text: Matt hits another switch -- BUZZ! -- and hurries out the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: ON A MONITOR:
text: Kiefer swings open the door and holds it open for FIVE MORE
text: FIGURES -- rushing up. They’re part of a CIA EXTRACTION TEAM.
text: Serious guys with serious gear. JARHEADS. They DRAG in with

text: -- A LIMP BODY WEARING A HOOD.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE —- BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER
dialog: 
text: Matt punches in a lock combination on the closet, slides the
text: drawer open and withdraws a FIELD BOX. He slips in a key,
text: opens up the box and withdraws A RED BACKPACK.
text: He zips it open, revealing CASH, a PASSPORT, a SECURE CELL
text: PHONE and a Sig-Sauer .9mm. He takes the gun. Slides it back.
text: Leaves the bag. Tucks the weapon behind his belt, pulling his
text: shirttails over it.
text: Loud KNOCKING draws his ear to:
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - FOYER —- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Matt opens the door to revel Kiefer, wet with rainwater.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: You the housekeeper?
text: Matt nods.
speaker_heading: KIEFER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m Kiefer. Where’s the guest room?
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE —- KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: A steel bucket is thrown into the sink. A hand flicks the
text: faucet. Water fills up the bucket.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - GUEST ROOM —- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A padded room. Sound-proof. A single steel chair and table. A
text: body gets thrown onto the chair. Hard. Makes a sound.
text: Immediately gets cuffed and shackled. Hands and feet.
text: A bag is removed from his head:
speaker_heading: FROST
text: He locks eyes with a one-way mirror. A steely resolve.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Matt looks at Frost through the mirror -- taken aback.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That’s Tobin Frost.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yes, sir. He was my case subject my
dialog: first year at the Farm. Ex-
dialog: intelligence officer. Veteran agent
dialog: of a six year undercover tour in
text: the Soviet Union. A spy’s spy.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: Until he went black in 2000. Since
dialog: then, he’s given up assets; sold
dialog: military intel to anyone with
dialog: money: China, North Korea, al-Qaeda
dialog: splinter groups, terror cells. The
dialog: damage he’s done to our country is
dialog: in the billions.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - GUEST ROOM —- SAME
dialog: 
text: Frost stares directly ahead -- unfazed. Been here before.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: MATT (V.O.)
dialog: How'd you find him?
speaker_heading: KIEFER (V.O.)
dialog: The only way you a find an
dialog: operative like Frost. Luck. His
text: face got scanned at the embassy.
speaker_heading: RESUME:
text: Matt reacts. Something about that doesn’t track.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
text: Langley wants him debriefed before
dialog: check out.
text: Matt finds that notion insane.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Excuse me sir, but an ex-field
dialog: officer like Frost is not just
dialog: gonna open up to you without some
dialog: incentive.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: I couldn't agree more.
text: Just then, two Jarheads -- BECK and GREER -- cross up to the
text: room, toting the bucket filled with water and --
scene_heading: -- a_CAR BATTERY.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: Incentive.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Frost's shoes are removed. Socks too. His tie is loosened and
text: his shirt torn open. Buttons fly. Electrodes are attached to
text: his chest and neck. His feet are placed in the bucket --
text: water spills out.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME
dialog: 
text: Matt -- watching this unfold through the glass -- horrified.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You can’t do this. There are rules.
text: But when he turns -- Kiefer is already heading inside.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: As long as he’s in my house, he’s
dialog: in my care -- Kiefer!
text: Kiefer ignores him, SHUTTING the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - GUEST ROOM — CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
text: Frost looks up. Eyes Kiefer stepping inside. He slides the
text: chair out across from him. Takes a seat.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME
dialog: 
text: Matt watches them through the glass -- two pros regarding
text: each other. Respect there. But not much.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: I’m Daniel Kiefer, Mr. Frost. I’m
dialog: here to make you aware of your
dialog: rights.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - GUEST ROOM —- SAME
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: You're being held under National
dialog: Security Directive 72-C which means
dialog: you have none. Per the Directive, I
dialog: could literally lock you in a room
text: and throw away the room.
dialog: Frost -- unintimidated.
speaker_heading: KIEFER (CONT'D)
dialog: But before that happens, you’re
dialog: gonna give us the names of all your
dialog: resources, contacts and assets --
dialog: everyone you’ve done business with,
dialog: traded intel with, sold secrets to,
dialog: in the fifteen years since you
dialog: turned traitor.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: That’s gonna be a long list.
dialog: Promise not to tell anyone?
text: Kiefer -- annoyed -- maintains his composure.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: I know you've read the books on our
dialog: interrogation methods. Hell, you’ve
dialog: written some of them. There’s no
dialog: need wasting time with coercion;
dialog: intimidation; bullying. You and I
dialog: both know they won’t work on you.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: KIEFER (CONT'D)
dialog: What will, I suspect, is tolerance.
dialog: How much I have for you -- and how
dialog: much you have for this.
text: Greer cranks a dial on the car battery -- a current SURGES
text: through Frost -- body ARCHING back in agony.
scene_heading: INTERCUT MATT:
text: watching this, horrified. He knows Kiefer’s got a job to do,
dialog: but doesn’t have the stomach for it.
speaker_heading: RESUME:
text: With another twist of the dial -- the current abates. Frost
dialog: sags.
speaker_heading: KIEFER (CONT'D)
dialog: We think there are at least three
dialog: separate operations in the works
dialog: that you may have compromised. We
dialog: need to know how badly our
dialog: security's been breached. We’re not
dialog: gonna lose any more lives because
dialog: of you.
text: Again, Greer wrenches the dial. Electricity STREAMS. Frost
text: HOWLS as power COURSES through his body. He LASHES around in
text: the chair, but gets SNAPPED back to it by the shackles.
speaker_heading: KIEFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your contacts, Frost. I want the
dialog: names.
text: Another twist of the dial.
speaker_heading: KIEFER (CONT'D)
dialog: The names!
text: The power shuts off. Frost, spent, but defiant.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You smell that?
text: He spits on the floor. Looks up.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it’s me.
text: He laughs. Kiefer -- pissed -- turns at Greer. Nods: again!
text: He cranks the dial. Frost WAILS, FLAILING, SCREAMING, IN
dialog: AGONY, until --
dialog: -- Kiefer SEES something.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- HIS POV
text: on Frost’s arm: the INJECTION SCAR.
text: He turns to Greer. Signals him to cut the power. He obeys.
text: Frost is slumped over in the chair by now, exhausted. Kiefer
text: grabs his arm. TWISTS it. He looks over the mark. Blinks.
dialog: Realizes what it means.
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: Get me a knife.
dialog: But before anyone can do anything --
text: -- the lights SHUT OFF -- plunging the room into DARKNESS.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME
dialog: 
text: Black here too. A beat and the emergency back-up lights hum

speaker_heading: KIEFER

dialog: Greer, ordering Matt to:
speaker_heading: KIEFER

scene_heading: EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A van with tinted windows screeches to a stop out front.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM — MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Jarheads CRAIG, VIRKLER and VELEZ are at the bank of

speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: What the hell’s going on?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I don’t know -- we’re dark. Whole
text: building’s gone black.
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The back of the van EXPLODES OPEN.
text: TEN MERCENARIES bomb out. All heavily armed with machine

speaker_heading: RESUME:
speaker_heading: KIEFER
dialog: Motion sensors?

scene_heading: INT. VOLKSWAGEN - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - SAME

scene_heading: INT. VOLKSWAGEN - SAME

speaker_heading: THE SEAT BELT

speaker_heading: FROST

text: About to lose consciousness -- Matt spots --
scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - SAME
text: -- an underground parking garage whipping by.
scene_heading: INT. VOLKSWAGEN - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE — SAME

scene_heading: INT. VOLKSWAGEN - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE — SAME
text: For a second: silence. Then -- the driver's side door swings

text: Frost out of the car -- hurling him to the ground.
text: Matt takes out his gun and aims it at him.
text: Frost shakes the cobwebs from his head as Matt looks to the
text: Volkswagen -- now totalled -- engine busted -- steam shooting

text: Matt looks back at Frost.
speaker_heading: FROST

speaker_heading: MATT (V.O.)

speaker_heading: LANDLORD (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MATT (V.O.)

speaker_heading: WHITFORD

scene_heading: INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM —- SAME
speaker_heading: BARLOW

speaker_heading: LINKLATER

scene_heading: FULL SCREEN -- MATT’S CIA BIO AND FILE PHOTO

speaker_heading: GRAFF (V.O.)
dialog: Father dead: car crash. Mother,
dialog: dying: cancer of the lung.
dialog: Recruited into the program out of
dialog: Harvard Law.
scene_heading: RESUME INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: GRAFF
dialog: Speaks three languages, no accent.
dialog: Average training level. Weapon and
dialog: vehicle ready. But he has zero
dialog: field experience. The Rio house is
dialog: his first assignment.
scene_heading: INT. JEEP - SAME
text: Matt pulls out ignition wires -- crosses them.
speaker_heading: ANALYST #2 (V.O.)
dialog: Hell of a way to lose your cherry.
speaker_heading: RESUME:
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: LINKLATER
dialog: Well, if he does have Frost, it
dialog: won't be for long.
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: He’ll be safe as long as he gets to
text: the other house.
speaker_heading: LINKLATER
dialog: What? You really think he’s gonna
dialog: make it?
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: He made it out of this one, didn’t
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: WHITFORD
dialog: Only by sheer luck and luck runs
dialog: out. We’re hypothesizing a scenario
dialog: in which a basement level
dialog: housekeeper manages to get Tobin
dialog: Frost from A to B.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - SAME
text: Matt successfully hot wires the Jeep. The engine ROARS and
text: Matt peels out of the garage.
speaker_heading: RESUME:
speaker_heading: WHITFORD
dialog: Anyone here besides Barlow have
dialog: trouble seeing that as anything
dialog: short of improbable?
text: No hands go up.
scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - NIGHT
text: The Jeep cruises past, neon lights of the city blurring by.
scene_heading: INT. JEEP - NIGHT
text: Matt stares ahead, trying to ignore Frost, who has other
dialog: plans.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: What’s your name?
text: Matt is silent, hesitant to share anything.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re not a NOC. What’s it matter?
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Matt.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Matt what?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Matt Weston.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You know who I am?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah. A traitor.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: It’s not so black and white.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What, right and wrong? Actually it
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: So you’re one of those.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: An idealist.
text: Matt says nothing.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: How long have you been an agent?
dialog: Matt doesn’t want to engage him, but --
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’m not an agent.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Housekeeper then.
dialog: A beat, then:
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Twelve months.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Happy birthday.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: So what did you do wrong?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: That you’re stuck in your post.
text: Housekeeper’s a low-level detail.
text: Straight off the farm work. Six to
dialog: nine months tops. You should be
dialog: outta here by now.
text: Matt shifts -- uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Maybe I requested the assignment.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Or more likely Langley doesn’t
dialog: trust you with anything else. Seems
dialog: the agency doesn’t think too highly
dialog: of either of us, Matt. Perhaps
dialog: we're not so different after all.
text: Matt spins to him. Hates that idea.
scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - NIGHT
text: The Jeep turns a corner.
scene_heading: INT. JEEP - NIGHT
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: So, what exactly is your plan?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Follow protocols. If evicted, bring
text: the guests to another house and
dialog: wait for extraction.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You get that from the manual?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: The second safe house is only four
dialog: hours away. It can’t be opened
dialog: without the key. We’re gonna wait
dialog: for the key and then we’ll go.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: And you think I’m just gonna let
dialog: you take me there?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Thought never crossed my mind.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You know what else hasn’t? Just
dialog: exactly how your house was crashed
text: in the first place.
text: Matt pauses. Hadn’t considered that yet. He thinks. A beat,
dialog: then:
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: They followed Kiefer from the
dialog: extraction site.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You don’t really believe that do
dialog: you?
dialog: No -- he doesn’t.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: That house was a secure location.
dialog: The people who crashed it didn’t
dialog: stop at the gas station to ask
dialog: directions to the nearest CIA safe
dialog: house. They were invited. Someone
dialog: told them where the house was.
dialog: Someone you know. So you have to
dialog: ask yourself: how much do you trust
dialog: your landlord?
dialog: 
text: Matt considers that. Then realizes the source.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: This is just misdirection. You just
dialog: don’t want me reaching out to
dialog: anyone.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You have another theory then?
dialog: Matt -- no.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: Your house went from a sanctuary to
text: a mortuary in less than an hour.
dialog: That doesn’t happen without
dialog: intervention. I’m not your only
dialog: enemy tonight.
text: Matt considers that. Worries he’s right.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING - NIGHT
text: In disrepair. Covered with scaffolding. Somehow standing. But
text: isolated. Remote. Quiet.

scene_heading: INT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING - NIGHT

speaker_heading: VARGAS

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- THE MONITOR
dialog: (Vargas’ writing in green; his collaborator -- designated
text: “AVNER” -- appears in red).
text: AVNER: WHAT HAPPENED AT THE HOUSE?
text: Vargas types: A MISTAKE. WILL BE CORRECTED.
scene_heading: AVNER: NO FILES. NO PAYMENT.
text: Vargas: NEED MORE INTEL. WHO IS THE HOUSEKEEPER?
text: A beat, then a document file downloads:
speaker_heading: MATT’S DOSSIER
dialog: his bio; operations record; official assets.
scene_heading: AVNER: RETIRE THEM BOTH.
dialog: Vargas double clicks on “official assets” and:
scene_heading: A PICTURE OF ANA
text: pops up. Her student ID photo. Vargas looks at her address.
dialog: Commits it to memory.
text: Somewhere -- water runs.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Matt -- at the sink -- cups some water in his hands. Splashes
text: his face. Lets the water drip down. He’s scared -- with good
text: reason. He gathers himself. Leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. DIVE HOTEL - NIGHT
dialog: A real shithole. The type you pay for by the hour but they
text: don’t ask questions. Matt appears in a top-floor window,
text: peeking through the shades.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE HOTEL - NIGHT
text: A dingy room. Rats. Stained sheets. Slow moving ceiling fan.
text: Matt looks up and down the street. Sees nothing but shifting
dialog: shadows.
speaker_heading: FROST (0.C.)
dialog: Don’t they teach anyone anything
dialog: anymore?
text: NEW_ANGLE -- Frost handcuffed to a chair.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t have to keep looking over
dialog: your shoulder if you have eyes in
dialog: the back of your head.
text: Matt shuts the curtains close and turns around, crossing up
dialog: to Frost.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You said you weren’t my only enemy
dialog: tonight. The hit squad from the
dialog: house. Who were they?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You’re the field officer now. You
dialog: figure it out.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: If they are trying to kill you,
dialog: there must be a reason.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: With a mind like that, you’1l make
dialog: section chief before you're thirty-
dialog: five.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Curb that temper, son. You don’t
dialog: have the pedigree for it.
text: Matt’s phone buzzes. He fishes it out of his pocket. Checks
text: the display -- ANA (CELL). She sent him a text: WHERE ARE
text: YOU? His face falls -- shit -- he forgot all about her.
text: Can’t deal with her now. He hits ignore and puts the phone
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: She know what you do for a living?
dialog: 46.
text: Matt looks at Frost -- surprised.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Ana. You tell her about your work?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How'd you --
text: Then he realizes -- the cell phone display was REFLECTED in
text: the window behind him.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t say her name.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Why not? Afraid she'll like me?
text: Matt steams.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: Relax. It’s good to have something
dialog: on the side. Housekeeping can be
dialog: dull, pedestrian work. I remember.
dialog: I used to do it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You were a housekeeper?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Berlin ‘79. My house catered eight
dialog: defectors a month.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Really?
text: Frost nods.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: East or West?
text: Frost's turn to simmer. Matt turns his back on him, returning
text: to the window -- looking out.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: She’s gonna leave you.
text: Matt looks back.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: They always do. Ask my wife.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Exactly my point.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: She's different.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Then you’re gonna have to leave
dialog: her.
text: That gives him pause.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: You can’t expect to have a real
dialog: relationship in our line of work.
dialog: It’s not that business and pleasure
dialog: don't mix. It’s that business is
dialog: our pleasure. There’s no room for a
dialog: personal life. Take it from me.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’m not you.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I know. You still have the Kool-Aid
dialog: on your lips. I died from it a long
dialog: time ago. But trust me. In the end -
dialog: - this job of ours -- there’s no
dialog: loyalty.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Spoken like a true traitor.
text: Just then, his watch BEEPS. Matt checks the time -- the key
dialog: should be there by now.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s go.
text: He helps Frost up from the chair by his arm, as we CUT TO --

speaker_heading: BARLOW

speaker_heading: WHITFORD

dialog: did he find out about the safe

dialog: No one has an answer for that.
speaker_heading: WHITFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, let’s try an easier one:
dialog: What in God’s name is so important
dialog: about ten year-old Israeli
dialog: intelligence records in the first

dialog: (off silence)
dialog: Find out.
text: Just then, the door BUZZES open. Linklater rushes inside,

text: Looks up -- serious.
speaker_heading: WHITFORD
dialog: Post this on the grid immediately.

speaker_heading: BARLOW

text: Keeping the gun on Frost, Matt reaches across and unlocks one

speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now cuff your hands together.
text: Frost eyes the gun -- then obeys -- cuffing his wrist.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You don’t think this is gonna raise
dialog: a red flag? Me handcuffed?
text: Matt agrees. Looks around. Sees a light jacket in the
text: backseat -- grabs it -- and throws it over Frost’s hands,

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hey, who’s in handcuffs here?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You say that like you were the one
dialog: who slapped them on me in the first
dialog: place. You're nothing but a
dialog: substitute teacher here, Matt. Yes,
dialog: you're doing your job, but you’re
dialog: not gonna get my respect.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Wasn’t looking for it.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Yeah, you are.
text: Matt reacts -- maybe he is a little.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s all over your face. But don’t

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're right -- the second I walk

speaker_heading: A COP

text: Frost gets an idea -- continues forward with Matt -- and
text: covertly BUMPS a passing SOCCER FAN, causing him to drop the

text: The Security Head HITS the table -- out COLD.
text: Cop #2 goes for his gun. Matt RAMS his head in his stomach --
text: then HURLS it upwards into his CHIN -- CRACKING his jaw. He

speaker_heading: BARLOW

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- MATT

scene_heading: DARIO -- VILLAR'S WIFE

speaker_heading: RESUME:

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: This professional enough, for you?

speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MATT

scene_heading: INT. VILLAR'S APARTMENT - SAME

dialog: 76.
text: -- and exploding out the front door.
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: FROST!
text: Too late. He’s gone. Matt pushes off the floor, rushes to the
dialog: front as --
text: -- a MERC CHARGES INSIDE. They COLLIDE. Go CRASHING INTO EACH
speaker_heading: OTHER.
text: The merc’s gun gets knocked out of his hands. Matt LANDS a
dialog: punch.
text: The merc KICKS Matt off of him. He FLIES BACK. Lands hard
text: onto a coffee table -- SHATTERING it.
text: The hitman retrieves his weapon -- aims to fire -- when --
text: -- BANG! BANG! BANG! -- he gets tagged three times in the
text: chest. Goes down. Matt looks over. Sees:
speaker_heading: DARIO

dialog: Bullets just miss Matt --
scene_heading: -- LEAPING OUT THE WINDOW --
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAR’S APARTMENT - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. DONA MARTA —- SAME
text: With Frost -- booking -- tearing between houses.
text: NEW ANGLE -- MERCS on roof-tops -- running after him --
text: firing like mad.
speaker_heading: RESUME:
text: Frost -- racing -- PLOWING through trash cans like a
text: linebacker -- as bullets pockmark around him. He takes cover
text: underneath tin terraces -- as rounds RIP through them.
text: Sparks all around -- Frost makes three hard turns into the
text: back alleys of the favela before making a quick left --
dialog: rounding the corner --
text: -- arriving at another street. Ducks behind a bar. Quiet
dialog: here.
dialog: 77.
text: He catches his breath. Pauses. Harder to do than usual. He
text: stares down at his shirt.
speaker_heading: BLOOD
text: seeps out of his clothing. He tore open his bullet wound.
dialog: Fuck.
text: The sound of a bottle getting KICKED. Rattling around. No
text: time for pain. Frost draws his gun and spins around the
text: corner, sticking the gun in the face of:
speaker_heading: TWO PROSTITUTES
text: who WAIL their heads off. Frost pockets the pistol and turns
text: around -- comes face to face with:
speaker_heading: VARGAS
text: popping up behind him -- swinging the rifle. Frost grabs the
text: barrel of the gun. YANKS it away from his face.
text: Vargas pulls the trigger. The gun starts unleashing bullets
text: into the clouds.
text: Frost HOWLS as the gun goes off close to his face -- hands
text: BURNING from the heat of the gun barrel unloading.
text: In a last-ditch move, Frost KICKS Vargas back and draws his
dialog: gun.
text: Vargas SWINGS the rifle. KNOCKS the gun from Frost's hands.
text: THROWS it back the other way.
text: Frost CATCHES the gun again. Uses the momentum to SPIN Vargas
text: around -- HURLING his ass against a concrete wall. He tries
dialog: to throw up his knee --
text: -- but Vargas BLOCKS the move. Unleashes FURY. He takes Frost
text: and SLAMS his head against the wall. SWINGS down his hand --
text: KNOCKING Frost to the ground. He reaches into his pocket.
dialog: Withdraws:
speaker_heading: A GARROTTE
text: He slips over Frost’s neck. Frost raises his hand up. CATCHES
text: the wire before it catches his throat.
text: Vargas PULLS it taut. The wire CUTS into Frost’s hand. Blood
text: POURS out -- a deep, seething STING.
text: Frost kicks up his legs. PUSHES his body back. RAMS Vargas

text: BUCKS him again. THROWS him over his shoulder.
dialog: 78.
text: Vargas rolls off. Frost INHALES air. Vargas lands next to his
text: gun. Grabs it. SPINS -- about to fire.
text: THE YUGO ROARS UP BEHIND HIM
text: like a bull at Pamplona. Matt at the wheel, heading straight
dialog: for Vargas.
text: Vargas has to move. Does a quick Parkour-move. LEAPS to his

text: SPEEDING UP.
scene_heading: INT. YUGO - SAME
text: Matt -- acting fast -- SLAMS on the breaks.
scene_heading: EXT. DONA MARTA - SAME

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Get in the car!
text: Frost is shocked to be seeing Matt again but he isn’t about
dialog: to get in the car with the CIA. But then --
text: -- the sound of approaching SIRENS. He looks over.
speaker_heading: POLICE CRUISERS
text: tear up the alley.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now!
text: Frost has no choice. Hops inside. Matt doesn’t even wait for

dialog: 79.
text: Matt carves a path between two shacks. PLOWS through laundry
text: hanging from wires. EXPLODES through people’s backyards.
text: SHOOTS AHEAD.
text: The pace couldn't be faster and more kinetic -- TEARING
text: across muddy back roads -- past bars -- nearly CLIPPING
text: people spilling out, drunk.
scene_heading: INT. YUGO - SAME
text: Matt maneuvers around bodies.
scene_heading: EXT. DONA MARTA —- SAME
text: A cruiser roars alongside Matt. Cop leans out the window with
text: a shotgun -- about to fire.
scene_heading: INT. YUGO — SAME
text: Matt tries to out race him. Frost -- fuck that -- reaches
text: over and grabs the wheel. YANKS it.
scene_heading: EXT. DONA MARTA —- SAME
text: The Yugo SLAMS into the side of the cruiser. Sends it
text: CRASHING into a wall.

scene_heading: INT. YUGO - SAME
text: Matt and Frost JERK FORWARD. Frost sees:
speaker_heading: MATT’S GUN

text: Starts UNLOADING out the back of the car.
text: Bullets EXPLODE out the back window --
scene_heading: EXT. DONA MARTA - SAME

dialog: Just as --
text: -- CRASH! The car hits a wall. EXPLODES upon impact! Fireball
text: SHOOTS UP.
text: The Yugo doesn’t stop. And neither do we. Moving too fast for

dialog: 80.
text: -- GO TEARING DOWN A HILL, running down bushes, before --
scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: -- CRASHING down onto asphalt, ROARING onto a highway, almost

scene_heading: INT. YUGO - SAME

scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - SAME
text: The Yugo SWERVES out of the way of all the cars -- except one
dialog: -- BAM! -- They get CLIPPED!
scene_heading: INT. YUGO — SAME
text: The glass EXPLODES besides Frost’s head. He gets ROCKED.
text: Drops the gun.
scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - SAME
text: The Yugo SPINS. Stops. Out of commission.
scene_heading: INT. YUGO - SAME
text: Frost -- dazed -- drops the gun. Matt -- whiplash -- but
text: quicker to react. He peers out the window.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- THE CAR THAT HIT THEM
text: A Ford Bronco. TWO FIGURES step out:
speaker_heading: THE FREELANCERS!
text: The Albanian and the African -- their faces bloodied and
text: bruised from fight club.
text: Matt locks eyes with them. Might not know who they are, but
dialog: knows they aren’t friendly -- especially when they reach into
text: their jackets -- drawing IMI UZI’'S.
text: Matt reacts ——
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shit --
text: -- as the Freelancers raise up their guns. Start SPRAYING.
text: Matt grabs Frost’s gun from the car floor. Takes Frost. YANKS
text: him out the driver’s side door.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on!
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: EXT. RIO STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Matt and Frost quickly duck up to a nearby abandoned
text: building. Slip between two chained doors.
speaker_heading: THE FREELANCERS
text: maintain pursuit, charging after them.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Under construction. Scaffolding everywhere. Matt and Frost
text: race across, throwing away tarps hanging down from beams --
text: in their way.
text: The two men reach an exit door. Matt tries to pull it open.
dialog: Can't. CHAINED. Shit.
text: Frost pitches. Matt almost has to catch him. Sees why: his
text: STOMACH -- bleeding in the moonlight -- torn open.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Jesus.
text: Frost -- clutches his stomach -- in pain -- but shrugs it
dialog: off.
text: MACHINE GUNFIRE EXPLODES AT THEIR HEADS!
text: They dash away -- bullets just missing as:
speaker_heading: THE FREELANCERS
text: run up -- take up position around some columns. Whip around.
dialog: Fire their UZI's.
text: A bullet STRIKES a PROPANE TANK. It IGNITES -- VOMITS FIRE --
text: nearly catches Matt -- DIVING behind CONCRETE SLABS that
text: instantly get RIDDLED by rounds. Cement dust SPRAYS.
speaker_heading: FROST
text: books for a nearby wooden staircase, hustling up the steps
dialog: as:
speaker_heading: THE ALBANIAN
text: takes aim. Shoots in his direction. SPLINTERS the steps. They
speaker_heading: COLLAPSE.
text: DROP Frost with them -- landing him on the ground in an
text: explosion of dust and debris.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- THE AFRICAN
dialog: 82.
text: He focuses on Matt, now shooting back at him. The Freelancer
text: ducks down -- behind a cement mixer -- looks up -- sees:
speaker_heading: STEEL BEAMS
text: suspended above Matt's position, attached to a cable -- tied
text: to a pulley -- connected to the wall. He turns his uzi,
text: unleashing a storm of bullets.
text: The cables get SHREDDED. SNAP! RELEASE the beams. They come
text: CRASHING DOWN above Matt’s head. He SCURRIES out of the way.
dialog: LEAPS just in time before --
scene_heading: -- A MASSIVE IMPACT. LOUD. BLARING. We can’t see what
dialog: happened to Matt -- but judging by the destruction, can’t be
dialog: good.
text: The Albanian heads over. Investigates. Doesn’t see Matt at
text: all. Assumes there’s nothing to see. He spins, leaving.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- MATT
text: trapped in between a tiny crawl space -- between two walls,
text: just a few feet away from where the beams fell.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- THE AFRICAN
text: rushing up to the broken staircase, searching for Frost.
text: Doesn't find him. Instead, sees his FOOTPRINTS on the dust-—
text: covered floor. He follows them:
scene_heading: INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER ROOM — CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Occupied by WOOD CUTTING TOOLS -- saws -- staple guns --
text: cutting boards. The African looks around -- on the hunt --
dialog: catches sight of:
speaker_heading: A SILHOUETTE
text: behind a tarp -- hanging from the ceiling. He starts SHOOTING
text: -- bullets kicking up the sheet -- revealing:
scene_heading: A CONSTRUCTION WORKER’S COAT AND HAT
text: hanging off a hook behind it. The African -- feeling foolish -
dialog: - turns -- finds:
speaker_heading: FROST
text: EXPLODING AT HIM! They CRASH into each other -- go flying.
text: The collision KNOCKS the gun from the African’s hand -- as
text: they both go BARRELLING INTO:
speaker_heading: AN ELEVATOR
dialog: 83.
text: The African SPINS Frost at the final second -- using his
text: momentum to SLAM him against the elevator wall.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- THE ALBANIAN
text: charging into the room. It’s about to be two against one but
dialog: Frost --
text: -- KICKS the African back. He hits the elevator controls. The
speaker_heading: door CLOSES --
text: -- just as the Albanian reaches them -- left watching as the
text: lift rises up to another floor. He then turns -- seeing:
speaker_heading: AN ACCESS DOOR
text: He heads for it.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR — SAME
text: A DEATH MATCH -- as the two men SLAM up against the walls of
text: the confined space -- TRADING PUNCHES.
text: The African THROWS his knees up into his ribs -- HURLS a
text: fist. Frost BLOCKS -- returns a LEFT. Lands the punch behind
text: the Freelancer’s right ear -- DISORIENTS him -- then SWINGS
text: down both down like a mace -- CATCHING the African across the
dialog: nose.
text: Bones BREAK -- blood SPLATTERS! The African stumbles back.
text: Frost CHARGES. The African HURLS a PUNCH --
text: -- but in a LIGHTNING FAST MOVE -- FROST DUCKS and GRABS the
text: African by the larynx -- SLAMMING his head hard against the
text: wall -- while TIGHTENING his grip and SQUEEZING the life out
dialog: of him.
text: HIS FACE -- turns blue. HIS EYES -- roll back. HIS LEGS -- go
dialog: limp.
text: The kill couldn’t be more up close and personal. Frost drops
text: him like dead weight -- catches his own breath -- hits the
text: elevator stop button.
text: It JERKS to a halt.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER FLOOR - SAME
dialog: 
text: The elevator door slides open. Frost steps over the African
text: and heads out onto the floor.
text: A DOOR SWINGS OPEN WITH A CLANG! Frost whirls -- sees:
speaker_heading: THE ALBANIAN
dialog: 84.
text: now behind him -- coming out of the access door -- sweating --
text: keeping his gun aimed. The Albanian advances -- then sees:
speaker_heading: HIS PARTNER
text: dead -- sprawled on the ground -- elevator door trying to
text: close -- but keeps getting caught on his leg -- sticking out.
text: He reacts -- seething. Frost -- capitalizes -- takes off. The
text: Albanian OPENS FIRE -- shooting the shit out of the room.
speaker_heading: FROST
text: rushes behind a beam -- taking fire -- but keeping out of the
text: Freelancer’s line of sight.
text: He considers his position -- there’s no where to go. A door --
text: but he’d have to step out into the open. Stairs -- but in the
text: other direction. He’s trapped.
text: The Albanian swings around a work table -- about to get the
dialog: drop on him -- when --
dialog: -- WHAM! --
speaker_heading: MATT
text: -- SLUGS the freelancer with a pipe. The Albanian CRASHES to
text: the ground -- gun spilling out of his hand.
text: Matt sweeps it aside with his foot -- directs his weapon at
dialog: the freelancer.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Frost!
text: Frost walks out -- sizes up the situation.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think he’s one of them.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: He’s not. He’s a freelancer.
text: Matt reacts -- unnerved.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That true? You a freelancer?
text: The Albanian says nothing.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Did the agency order you to come
dialog: after us?
dialog: 85.
text: Matt COCKS his gun -- repeats the question. In Albanian; not
dialog: subtitled:
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Po ju a freelancer?!?
text: A beat. The Albanian nods. Matt lowers his gun. Frost reacts
dialog: to this -- curious.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Matt throws open a back door -- exiting quickly out into an
text: alley with Frost -- re-cuffed.
text: Matt KICKS a trash can aside -- boiling over in frustration.
text: The trash goes flying.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Dammit!
text: He grits his teeth -- thinking -- head spinning.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: If the CIA is sending freelancers
dialog: after you, how safe do you think
dialog: that house is?
text: That stops Matt. Frost just gave him something serious to
text: think about. A beat -- he shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Doesn’t matter. It’s my only shot.
dialog: Where else am I gonna go? At least
dialog: the safe house gives me a chance to
dialog: prove I’m not bent.
text: He signals with his gun for them to move.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. We can’t stay here. We
dialog: gotta go.
text: Matt heads away -- but Frost doesn’t move. Realizing this, he
text: turns back -- Frost is propped up against the wall.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: Frost holds up his hand -- which was on his stomach -- to the
text: moonlight -- now stained with BLOOD.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I’m not going anywhere.
dialog: 86.
dialog: Off Matt -- we CUT TO --
scene_heading: EXT. CIA HEADQUARTERS -— NIGHT
speaker_heading: WHITFORD (V.O.)
dialog: We just heard from Brazil.
scene_heading: INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM — NIGHT
speaker_heading: WHITFORD
text: The freelancers dropped the ball.
dialog: We’re gonna switch it up. I want
dialog: someone senior in Rio tonight.
text: He turns to Barlow.
speaker_heading: WHITFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: You placed Weston at that house.
dialog: You're elected. There’s a jet
dialog: waiting. Get your ass on it and
dialog: bring this one home.
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Linklater -- concerned -- speaks up --
speaker_heading: LINKLATER
dialog: Sir, I’m the one running with the
dialog: theory that Weston’s a double. If
dialog: anyone should bring him in, it’s
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BARLOW
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: Harlan, I don’t need --
speaker_heading: WHITFORD
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: Fine. The two of you go.
text: Linklater shoots Barlow a look -- not so fast, pal.
scene_heading: EXT. PHARMACY - NIGHT
text: Tomblike silent. Matt and Frost arrive at the front door and
text: jimmy the lock.
scene_heading: INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT
text: Rows of MEDICINE and SURGICAL supplies. Moonlight spills

dialog: and other supplies.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Matt looks on as Frost opens up capsules of penicillin --
text: pours the powder onto his stomach. Begins treating himself.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Have you done this before?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: First time.
text: Matt scoffs. Frost ties another suture.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s the head?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'll live.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: That was the point.
text: SIRENS WAIL in the distance. Matt looks out the window -- on
text: high alert. Cruisers roar past. Matt breathes easier when
text: they don’t stop.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry about Ana.
text: Matt turns back around -- surprised.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How'd you --
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: After I shot you, you needed a
text: place to mend. Some place quiet.
dialog: You've never been shot before. You
dialog: were confused. Scared. So you did
dialog: what all people do when they are
dialog: confused and scared. You retreated
dialog: to some place familiar. It was
dialog: late. She was probably home. You
dialog: had to explain away the blood and
dialog: there are only so many lies for why
dialog: you didn’t go to the hospital when
dialog: a bullet kisses your skull. I never
dialog: met Ana but I don’t peg you as the
dialog: type of guy who dates a girl who
dialog: takes news like that well.
text: Jesus, he’s good. He finishes up.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: It's for the best though. Like I
dialog: said, there’s no real loyalty
text: anymore. Everyone betrays everyone.
text: He walks over to a sink -- runs the water -- cleaning the
text: blood off his hands.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That why you went black? Burn them
dialog: before they could burn you?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You don’t know what you’re talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I know you weren’t always like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Is that what you wrote in your case
dialog: study?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Maybe. You didn’t have money
dialog: problems. Or drug problems -- sex
dialog: problems. You weren’t a deviant. So
dialog: why’d you do it? Why’d you turn?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You think it was one thing? It’s
dialog: never one thing. Like you, I joined
text: the agency bright-eyed and
dialog: innocent. Wrapped myself up in the
text: flag. Got weepy at the memorial
dialog: wall. But over time, the game
dialog: changed. I lost track of the lies.
dialog: The politicians took over. No one
dialog: believes in anything anymore. It
dialog: was all bullshit. We weren't
dialog: solving problems. We were creating
dialog: them. And I wasn’t gonna be a part
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So why not just walk away clean?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: And let all that training go to
dialog: waste? At least now I get to pick
dialog: the assignments I want -- when I
dialog: want -- and get paid a shit load
dialog: more for it.
dialog: 89.
text: Matt’s face registers disappointment.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: Please. Don’t look at me like I
dialog: just told you there was no Santa
dialog: Claus. Believe me, no one’s soul,
dialog: no matter how decent at first, can
text: stay intact after being chiseled
dialog: away at for so long.
dialog: Matt considers that -- as we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - PARKING LOT — NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Linklater crosses the lot, footfalls ECHOING. He has his

speaker_heading: LINKLATER
text: It’s me. I’m on my way to the
dialog: airport now.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: The problem isn’t Weston. It’s
dialog: Barlow. I gotta find a way not to
text: feel his breath on my neck so I can
dialog: finish this on my own.
text: He pulls out his keys, shutting the alarm to his parked
dialog: Mercedes S-Class.
speaker_heading: LINKLATER (CONT’D)
dialog: Yeah, I know he’s a hard-ass but so
dialog: am I.
dialog: (listens; gets to his car)

speaker_heading: BARLOW

scene_heading: INT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING - NIGHT
text: A cell phone VIBRATES across a table. Vargas, smoking,

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE -- THE DISPLAY

scene_heading: INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS —- PARKING LOT - SAME

scene_heading: INT. BUS - SAME
text: A cattle car packed with travelers. Some sleeping. Some

text: IN THE BACK:
text: Matt rides with Frost in silence. Frost watches the scenery
text: whip by the window: a beautiful vista. Quiet, until:
speaker_heading: MATT
text: That still doesn’t look too good.
text: Frost turns to him, then looks down at his stomach wound.
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I'll survive.
text: He stares back out.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You know something, Frost: I don’t
dialog: think you're half as cynical as you
dialog: make yourself out to be.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Is that what you think?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah. Remember, I’ve read your op
dialog: reports. I think if someone gave
dialog: you a clear directive -- something
dialog: you knew to be the right thing --
dialog: you'd do it today.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: But whose to say what the right
dialog: thing is? The same people who think
dialog: you're a terrorist?
text: Matt doesn’t have an answer.
text: Matt nods.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you wanna make agent?
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: Then let me be your best friend in
dialog: the world and tell you something
dialog: you need to know: you never will.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: You don’t have the skill set for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: I'm bringing you in, aren’t I?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I didn’t say you didn’t have any
dialog: skills. Just not the right one.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Detachment. You’re too invested.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And that’s a bad thing?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: For an idealist? No. For a field
dialog: officer, there’s nothing worse. And
dialog: you know it too -- or else you
dialog: would've killed him.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: The freelancer. You could’ve killed
dialog: him, you should've killed him, but
dialog: you didn’t kill him.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That’s because I didn’t have to.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: And you think that makes you noble?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I think it makes me not you.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Exactly. Don’t make the same
dialog: mistakes I did, Matt. You’re too
dialog: good a man for this work of ours.
text: He turns forward -- looking ahead.
speaker_heading: FROST (CONT'D)
dialog: Go back to Ana. Get out before you

speaker_heading: THE SAFE HOUSE

scene_heading: EXT. SAFE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: Matt and Frost walk over gravel and up a long private road,
text: past fields of crops, to an iron gate. Matt pushes it open
text: and continues on toward the drive-way, passing --
text: -- horses grazing in the adjoining stable. Matt looks up at
text: the house, taking it all in.
dialog: Frost too. But looking at other things: the layout; the
text: openness. Seeing how vulnerable they are. Exposed.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Hope you trust whoever set this up.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It was my recruiter.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Yeah? You certain he hasn’t
dialog: recruited anyone since?
text: Matt looks at Frost. Shrugs him off. More misdirection.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER:
text: Matt leads Frost up onto the porch and up to the door. Frost
text: peers back, spying -- the terrain -- wind -- everything. Matt
text: takes the doorknob. Cranks it. The door POPS. Creeks open.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE —- CONTINUOUS
text: Stark contrast from the Rio apartment: there’s furniture but
text: it hasn't been used in years. Cobwebs. Ratty rugs. Dust-
dialog: covered wood floors.
text: Mice scurry as Matt and Frost move inside, eyes scanning.
text: Shadows everywhere.
text: Only light comes from whatever sun can breach the WOODEN
text: PLANKS covering up the windows.
speaker_heading: FOOTFALLS

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Show me your fucking hands right
dialog: now!
text: The figure throws up his hands.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Step forward.
text: The body moves into a slit of light. His name is KELLER, late-

speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: You Weston?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: I’m Keller. I’m a housekeeper.

speaker_heading: KELLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me show you to the guest room.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: be someone else.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE —- LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Matt sits down in a chair -- finger nervously tapping the

dialog: beer.
speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: Langley’s sending an extraction
dialog: team. They should be here soon.
text: Keller hands Matt the beer bottle.
speaker_heading: KELLER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (sips)
speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: Are you...?
text: He indicates his head.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It’s alright.
text: Keller plops down in a chair across from him -- two strangers
text: talking shop.
speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: I’m sorry about the Rio house.
text: Mat nods, appreciative.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: How long have you been a

dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: Five months.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: KELLER
dialog: Berlin for one. Rome for two. Here
dialog: for two.
text: Something about that causes Matt to flinch -- but he buries
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KELLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. Tobin Frost. Guy’s a fucking
dialog: legend. Hope you picked up what you
dialog: could. You’re not gonna get a
dialog: better education.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No. Not likely.
text: He polishes off the drink. Sets it down.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: You got a bathroom here?
text: Keller nods in the direction of the hallway. Matt excuses
text: himself -- walks off.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE —- HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Matt finds the bathroom and steps inside, shutting the door
text: behind him.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE — BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUICK SHOTS:
text: Matt locks the door. Runs the faucet. Uses the noise to mask
text: his movements. He takes out his gun. Checks the chamber. Sees
text: how many bullets are left: only two. Fuck. He loads it back
text: in. Tucks away the gun. Checks himself in the mirror, gearing
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: PHFT!
text: A bullet snaps through the door. CRACKS the mirror -- just
text: kissing Matt’s cheek. He turns -- surprised.
speaker_heading: PHFT! PHFT!
text: Two more shots rip through the door -- spraying splinters.
dialog: 97.
text: BAM! The door BREAKS OPEN!
speaker_heading: KELLER

text: grabs his arm.
text: They WRESTLE for control of the gun. The fight is CHAOTIC.
text: Visceral. Instinctual.
text: Matt ELBOWS Keller in the face. KNOCKS the gun from Keller’s
text: hand. Keller counters. FISTS Matt in the jaw. Throws him off.
text: Keller takes his head. SLAMS it toward the sink.
text: Last second -- Matt THROWS up his hands. Catches the
text: porcelain. PREVENTS impact.
text: Keller DRAWS back Matt’s neck. As his body shoots up, Matt
text: pulls back on the sink drain.
text: Water starts FILLING up the sink.
text: Keller TOSSES Matt hard against the wall. HURLS a punch. Matt
text: sidesteps. SPINS. SLAMS Keller against the back of the head.
text: THROWS his arms over his neck -- PULLS BACK -- holds him
text: TIGHT.
text: Keller FLAILS. Matt TOSSES his head into the sink -- FACE
text: FIRST into the water. Holds him there -- DROWNING him.
text: Keller FIGHTS. Matt fights HARDER -- keeping his head in the
text: water -- until his body stops writhing and kicking.
text: A beat. Matt lets go -- breathing heavy. He’s never killed
dialog: anyone before. Hates how it makes him feel.
text: Keller's lifeless body hits the ground -- water spilling over
dialog: him.
text: Matt -- breathing heavy -- considers him. Jesus. It’s never
dialog: been so real for him.
text: But no time for that. He sees -- beside Keller -- the fallen
text: gun. He picks it up. Backtracks out of the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Matt makes his way toward the guest room when:
speaker_heading: KELLER
text: SLAMS into him from behind -- still alive. The two CRASH to
dialog: the ground.
dialog: 98.
text: Keller’s gun goes FLYING. Slides across the wooden floor.
text: Keller CRAWLS for it -- GRABS it.
text: Matt LEAPS -- THROWS Keller in a head lock. Keller fires over
text: his shoulder -- bullets just missing Matt who uses everything
text: he has left to force the gun up to Keller’s head -- pull the
dialog: trigger.
speaker_heading: PHFT!
text: Blood SPRAYS Matt’s face. Keller slumps. Matt kicks his body
text: aside -- panting for air. He gets to his feet as we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - GUEST ROOM —- SAME
dialog: 
text: The door swings open. Frost snaps his head up. Matt bombs
text: inside -- rushed and panicked.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We're not safe.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Barlow set us up. The Landlord said
dialog: this house was still under contract
dialog: -- which means it wouldn’t have a
dialog: housekeeper yet -- let alone one
dialog: who has been here for two months.
text: Frost is impressed. Matt levels the gun at him.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)

dialog: Why’d you come to Rio?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Slow down --
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're hiding something from me.
dialog: WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!?!
text: That’s when he sees Frost’s injection scar on his arm. He
text: immediately starts patting him down, locating:
speaker_heading: THE ENVELOPE
dialog: 99.
text: concealed inside his back pocket -- the one Carlos gave him.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: FROST

text: He rips it open. Looks inside. Finds the microdot.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What are they -- files? Is this
dialog: what tonight's about?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: It’s over your head.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Stop with that crap. You tell me
dialog: now. What do these files have to do
dialog: with David Barlow?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: I don’t know. I didn’t get to read
dialog: all of them but clearly there’s
dialog: something on it he doesn’t want
dialog: anyone knowing.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What the hell are these?
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: It’s a dirt laundry list.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: FROST

text: Frost nods.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: What were you gonna do with them?

speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Same thing Mossad was gonna do:
dialog: trade the secrets for favors when I
dialog: needed them.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: As it all comes together for Matt --
text: -- THE HORSES OUTSIDE GO WILD. Matt pauses. Not good. He

dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: FROST
dialog: Matt!
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

text: Matt goes ghost white.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shit.
text: As he whirls around -- he STUMBLES -- DISORIENTATED. He
text: BLINKS. Things are losing FOCUS. He tries to shake it off,
text: face sweating. Then he notices:
scene_heading: THE BEER BOTTLE
text: on the floor. The one Keller gave him. Matt fights the urge
text: to pass out, moving on with unsteady legs.
scene_heading: INT. SAFE HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Matt stumbles inside -- bleary-eyed -- heart pounding.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We gotta move.
text: He manages to get out the handcuff keys. Gets one of Frost’s
dialog: hands free before --

text: tasked him with its retrieval.
dialog: After Barlow found out the deal was
dialog: going down in Brazil, he enlisted
