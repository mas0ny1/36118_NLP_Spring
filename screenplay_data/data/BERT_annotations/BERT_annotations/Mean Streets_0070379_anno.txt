text: CHARLES CAPPA JR. (CHARLIE) is 25 of Sicilain origin. He
dialog: was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one
text: year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised
text: sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected
dialog: many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and
text: has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His
dialog: favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and
text: Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more.
dialog: He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges

scene_heading: TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They
dialog: are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian-
dialog: American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from
dialog: these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people
dialog: to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family,

text: He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts.
text: His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part
dialog: of the city and owns several night club type discotheques

text: MICHAEL LONGO is 26 years old. He lives in a different

dialog: 
text: A deserted warehouse area in lower Manhattan. Prominent in

dialog: 
text: JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera. JOHN
text: CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old. He is an only child
text: and lives with his mother, a divorcee. He is clean cut
text: looking, yet slightly radical in dress. He was expelled
dialog: from high school for vandalism and consequently spent
text: several months in reform school. He is reckless,
dialog: unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-
text: F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next
text: door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own
text: and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.
dialog: 
text: JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper
text: under his arm, and he is smiling. He drops the package into
text: the mailbox and keeps walking. But he is moving a little
text: faster now and smiling a little more.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the mailbox explodes. Dozens of red, white and
text: blue fragments shower down on the street. The impact of the
text: blast knocks JOHNNY down. TITLE APPEARS on bottom of frame:
scene_heading: JOHNNY BOY.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He is up in a moment. The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he

dialog: literally - like crazy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH
dialog: 
text: WE SEE CHARLIE full face. Behind him is a Confessional
text: Booth. The church is very old, quiet, and dark. The CAMERA
text: ZOOMS OUT to reveal rows of Holy Candles lit in the
text: foreground. CHARLIE suddenly begins to speak softly and
text: confidentially to an unseen entity that is OFF SCREEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (CONFESSION)
dialog: A...As you know, I've just come out
dialog: of Confession. And as a penance
dialog: they gave me ten 'Hail Marys' and
dialog: ten 'Our Fathers'...
dialog: 
text: THE CAMERA BEGINS TO TRUCK OUT. IT MOVES AROUND CHARLIE AND
text: AWAY FROM THE HOLY CANDLES REVEALING CHARLIE'S PROFILE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: ...Now, between you and me... You
dialog: know how I feel about such things...
dialog: 'Hail Marys'...'Our Fathers'...No
dialog: imagination...
dialog: 
text: THE CAMERA HAS NOW TRUCKED BEHIND CHARLIE AND WE SEE over
text: his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the
text: crucified body of Christ, eyes closed reclining in his
dialog: sepluchure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: ...If I'm going to do penance at
dialog: all, I'll do it the way I think it
dialog: would be done...by me, that
dialog: is...according to my own trespasses.
dialog: You know what I mean.
dialog: 
dialog: This conversation of Confession will occur from time to time
text: in other parts of the story as CHARLIE will periodically try
text: very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his
text: "God." The images accompanying these monologues are to be of
dialog: free association almost documentary in nature.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The club is dark and noisy and smokey when CHARLIE enters.
text: He greets TONY who is sitting on a bar-stool. TONY directs
text: CHARLIE to a corner of the club where the rest of the group
text: is now getting boisterously drunk.
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE joins in, immediately taking on the mood of the group.
dialog: 
text: The rest of the club is filled with many different types of
text: customers: teenagers, adults pretending to be teenagers,
dialog: sailors, male and female gays, and "the boys from the
text: neighborhood." The music is loud and the lights are flashing
text: but the strippers have not yet appeared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
text: TONY is at the bar. He is approached by GEORGE one of the

dialog: seriously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's ten o'clock and they're like

speaker_heading: GEORGE
speaker_heading: (GENUINELY)
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Too bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs. There
dialog: is no particular logical sequence except that events are
text: suited to the rythmic pattern of the music.
dialog: 
text: 1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the
dialog: music.
dialog: 
text: 2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a
text: filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the
text: bar. He fails.
dialog: 
text: 3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's
text: table without moving the glasses or bottles. This also
dialog: fails.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: 4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the
text: puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the
dialog: darkness.
dialog: 
text: 5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes
text: obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE. He shouts to
text: her, tosses things, and calls her names. She tries, half
text: amusedly to ignore him but she can't.
dialog: 
text: 6. TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a
text: chaser swigs down Aqua Velva.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE sitting at an empty table watching DIANE, the
text: stripper, perform again. He stares glassy-eyed and then
text: begins to speak softly, continuing his Confession.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Y'know...she's really good-looking...
dialog: really good-looking. I've gotta
dialog: say that again. She's really good-
dialog: looking...but she's black... You
dialog: can see that real plain.
dialog: (as an afterthought)
dialog: When you get down to it though...
dialog: there's not much of a difference,
dialog: is there?
dialog: (He waits for an answer)
dialog: Well...is there?
text: (He smiles and begins
dialog: chewing on an ice

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: For these prices don't be particular.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Michael, nobody's out to screw you,
dialog: I guarrantee that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I know that Charlie but look at my
dialog: side. You undersigned the loans.
dialog: You vouched for him. What happens
dialog: if this kid don't pay me? I gotta
dialog: collect from you? I don't want to

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (PATRONIZING)

dialog: What do you think? 'If a man have

speaker_heading: (ENTERING CAGE)
dialog: Really wanted to get a little tiger
dialog: Charlie, y'know...a little William
dialog: Blake and all that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Be careful.
dialog: 
text: TONY ignores CHARLIE's warning as he crouches and allows the

dialog: 
text: The BOYS watch in silence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TONY'S PLACE - CORNER TABLE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Italian song "Malafemina" (a tango-like rythmn) is heard
text: coming from the juke-box. It is near closing time and there
text: are only a few customers left in the club, including MICHAEL
text: and two gays, BENTON and SAMMY, who is getting very drunk.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE is at the corner table with TONY and JOHNNY BOY.
text: CHARLIE is washing JOHNNY BOY'S face with cold water from a
text: basin. Some of JOHNNY'S blood has mingled with the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm surprised at you Tone. I mean
dialog: you've had the place for over a
dialog: year now. Nothing different...same
dialog: old place...ordinary...flat...no
dialog: imagination.
dialog: 
text: TONY ignores CHARLIE's half-joking, drunken remarks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUES)
dialog: For instance, the difference
dialog: between me and you is this...you
dialog: take that panther back there. I'd
dialog: put him right up here above the
dialog: bar...nice cage, you know? Nothing
dialog: ordinary in my place. What good is
dialog: it? You get robot customers. They
dialog: come in, drink beer, go to the
dialog: bathroom, and go home. No sir.
dialog: 
text: One of the BOYS more casual acquaintances is lying on the
text: bar, drunk. He begins to sing along with the Italian
dialog: music - but very badly.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: We're closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: I'm just waiting for Joey.
dialog: 
text: The BOY walks over to a bar stool and sits down. Nobody
text: acknowledges his presence.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the DRUNK on the bar stops singing and sits up,
text: dazed. His sudden silence causes CHARLIE and the others to
text: look up at him. The DRUNK stares ahead for a minute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRUNK
speaker_heading: (MUTTERS)
dialog: I...I gotta go to the bathroom.
dialog: 
text: EVERYONE laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

text: The Big Bopper - "Chantilly Lace" in playing on the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE

speaker_heading: (MORE CONFIDENTIALLY)
dialog: I'd call it something like SEASON
dialog: OF THE WITCH... get it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: You are with out a doubt the
dialog: biggest, most pretentious bullshit
dialog: thrower I know. Like to see what
dialog: kind of business you'd do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look who's talking. Pretentious
dialog: bullshit. Who's the guy with
dialog: William Blake and the tigers, eh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHNNY BOY
dialog: Will you guys shut up with the
dialog: witches and tigers. Tony, you
dialog: gonna close the place, we get out

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: We'll close up as soon as everybody
dialog: leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't forget what's-his-name there

dialog: 
text: EVERYONE laughs. JIMMY is drawing on a table top. CHARLIE
text: wanders over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Wanna see your picture?

text: CHARLIE leans over. OVERHEAD VIEW shows large crude swastika.

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (ADDRESSING THE
speaker_heading: ENTIRE BAR)

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MENS ROOM - TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The BOY slowly swings the door open and stares at the DRUNK
text: leaning over the urinal, half asleep. He takes out his
text: pistol and calmly shoots the DRUNK three times in the back.
text: To the BOY's surprise the DRUNK does not immediately fall
text: dead. Instead, he turns and grabs the BOY by the throat.
text: They struggle in the open doorway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Italian music is still playing. Everyone in the bar has
text: frozen in position as they watch the scene.
dialog: 
text: In his astonishment CHARLIE allows the cards to fall from
text: his hands.
dialog: 
text: The YOUNG BOY breaks away from the DRUNK and runs towards
dialog: the exit.
dialog: 
text: The DRUNK, running only on sheet determination, stumbles
text: along after the boy.
dialog: 
text: The people in the bar, including CHARLIE, dash behind tables
text: and jump behind the bar for cover.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TONY'S PLACE - STAIRWAY EXIT
dialog: 
text: The BOY reaches the exit and fires at the DRUNK from the top
text: of the stairs. The DRUNK still follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK &amp; WHITE
dialog: 
text: The BOY runs down the street and disappears into the darkness.
text: The DRUNK staggers out into hte cobblestone street. His
text: mind is gone, it is now just a physical matter of the body
text: being stopped by the presence of a stationary object.
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He staggers straight across the street at tremendous speed
text: smashing directly into a parked car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TONY'S PLACE - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT BLACK &amp; WHITE
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK &amp; WHITE

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: OK, get in.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BENTON
dialog: Michael...wait.
dialog: 
text: It is obvious that MICHAEL does not want to take them but he

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Get in, get in.

scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S CAR - NIGHT BLACK &amp; WHITE
dialog:

speaker_heading: BENTON

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can't get over the way he just

speaker_heading: JOHNNY BOY

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: (IN ITALIAN)

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment.
text: Each room is painted a different pastel color. It is
text: furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on
text: the wall and various knick-knacks around the rooms it is
text: evident that this is a family apartment rather than a
dialog: bachelors pad.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE is helping his mother pack a suitcase. Through out

speaker_heading: JOHNNY BOY
dialog: We'll get some food from my aunt's.

dialog: She's always got something.
dialog: 
text: JOHNNY BOY leaves the kitchen and walks towards the bedroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't do that. You'll scare Teresa
dialog: if you try to sneak in.
dialog: 
text: JOHNNY BOY is now by the window looking out at the fire
text: escape mischieviously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHNNY BOY
dialog: Yeah...you're right. Maybe she'll
dialog: have a seizure and we can watch.
dialog: 
text: He laughs. CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's not funny. You gonna be a
dialog: jerk-off all your life. Grow up.
dialog: You want something to eat from your
dialog: aunt's house you go knock on her
dialog: door, understand?
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHNNY BOY
dialog: I'm not hungry anymore. I'm going

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAYBREAK

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAYBREAK
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE returns to the bedroom. JOHNNY BOY appears to be

dialog: 
text: A SERIES OF DISSOLVES. TERESA is going through the various
text: stages of getting dressed.
dialog: 
text: TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and
text: intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she
dialog: makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically
text: supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented
dialog: her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious
dialog: relationships with men. She has however, been having an
text: affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept
dialog: secret from both families because the families regard each
dialog: other as blood relations.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has
text: begun to dial the telephone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHNNY BOY
dialog: (pretending to be angry)
dialog: Hello...fifth precinct? Yeah...I
dialog: want to report a disturbance. Yeah
dialog: this man and woman next door are
dialog: disturbing the peace. They're
dialog: keeping me awake all night now.
dialog: What the hell is this. What?
text: Well... yelling, fighting, throwing
dialog: things. Uh-huh. If they don't
dialog: kill each other soon I'm goin' over
dialog: there and do the job myself. Yes -
dialog: the address is 270 Mott street. I
dialog: think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah,
dialog: right... thanks. Look, I demand
dialog: immediate action. Never mind my
dialog: name I don't like getting involved
dialog: in things like this.
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed.
text: CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this
text: was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at
text: TERESA but she is no longer in her room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TERESA'S BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE is dreaming this sequence. He and TERESA are both
text: nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and
text: ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate
text: sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on
text: the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out
dialog: in pain.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - MID-DAY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well...with the hotel that's ten...
dialog: fifteen...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Here.
dialog:

speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Please take it.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: I don't mind.

dialog: Sure...it's not that...I mean...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: (touching his face)
dialog: It's all right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, if things go the way I hope

speaker_heading: (ASIDE)

speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: An apartment uptown? Downtown?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: know...at your place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Anything specific?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know...like restaurants, night

speaker_heading: TERESA
speaker_heading: (AFFECTIONATELY)
dialog: What is it now?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Alright... Hey, did you hear any
dialog: more about what happened last night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: CHRIST, you should have seen it.
dialog: Unbelievable. The kid would turn
dialog: around and fire and he would just
text: keep coming at him like Rasputin.
dialog: That kid was scared. Not half as
dialog: much as we were though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
text: It doesn't make any sense. He
dialog: wouldn't shoot him just because he
dialog: insulted a racket guy...not unless
dialog: it was personal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You missed the point. The kid's a
dialog: climber...not very bright...but if
dialog: you get down to his level to look
text: at it his way; he kills a guy who
text: insulted a big man - he gets a
dialog: reputation. He thinks he's in good
dialog: standing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: It's still sick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not sick...just stupid. Speaking
dialog: of stupid, your cousin last night
dialog: was feeling so good he decided to
dialog: break into your mother's house...to
dialog: get some food.
dialog: 
text: TERESA laughs at this story but her mood changes suddenly.

speaker_heading: TERESA

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - MID-DAY
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant.
dialog: This restaurant was considered an above average business
dialog: with quality and prices to match when it was first opened
dialog: three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices
text: remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE
text: is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up
text: a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it.
text: He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She
text: apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on
text: the table. He takes a menu.
dialog: 
text: A chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He
text: is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his
text: shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That bad, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I can't make this week's payment

scene_heading: INT. SMALL ITALIAN CAFE - DAY
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to
text: some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the
text: room. This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy
text: store, luncheonette, and meeting place for CHARLIE'S uncle
text: GIOVANNI and his associates.
dialog: 
text: GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and
text: powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. He became a
dialog: head figure not by being introduced formally as was the
text: custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the
text: organization. GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype
text: of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man.
dialog: 
text: GIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian.
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thanks!
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining
text: room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at
text: the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle.
dialog: 
text: MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest
dialog: associate, brought into the organization in the traditional
dialog: manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders).
text: He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to
text: GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE.
dialog: 
text: MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are
text: deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by
text: unnoticed and walks into the bathroom.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He
text: shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the
dialog: conversation.

speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (in Italian with
speaker_heading: ENGLISH TITLES)
dialog: What I'm telling you is that he did
dialog: it for Mario's honor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: But you don't understand. I knew
dialog: the kid. He was drunk. He made of
dialog: fool of himself...not me.
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (in Italian with
speaker_heading: ENGLISH TITLES)
dialog: Giovanni - an insult to Mario is an
dialog: insult to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: There was no insult.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (in Italian with
speaker_heading: ENGLISH TITLES)
dialog: The boy only did what was right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Your son only did what was stupid.
dialog: We have enough down here without
dialog: something like that. And what for?
dialog: ...Nothing...no reason. Protect
dialog: him? Why? I didn't tell him to do
dialog: anything for me. He's going to
dialog: Miami? Good...keep him in Miami
dialog: for six months...a year...a good
dialog: long time. After everything's
dialog: forgotten then I see what I can do
dialog: for him. Right now...keep him away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LUNCHEONETTE AREA - DAY
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE is seated at a table. The waitress, MARIE,
text: approaches and gives him his cup of coffee... The following

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Marie, are there Columbian coffee
dialog: beans in this coffee?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I dunno.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just a second. Let me taste it.
dialog: 
text: He pauses to sip the coffee, then shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, I'd say there are some
dialog: Columbian coffee beans in this
dialog: coffee, but only about 39%.
dialog: 
text: MARIE is disinterested. CHARLIE continues.
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You see. You probably don't notice
dialog: this Marie, but Colombian coffee
dialog: beans are rich coffee beans.
text: Bursting with that good, deep
dialog: coffee flavor. Picked when they
dialog: are ripe to the point of perfection.
dialog: The beans of course, are protected
dialog: by the tall South American Guama
dialog: trees.
dialog: 
text: MARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table.
text: CHARLIE'S monologue continues and gradually he falls back
text: into his CONFESSION. As he talks, the CAMERA PICKS UP
text: DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Then the bean pickers come down and
dialog: pick each bean by hand. Bean by
dialog: bean, all heavy with flavor. And
text: they load them into boxes, one box
text: at a time, box by box.
dialog: 
text: From time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who
text: is busy with her work.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BLACK &amp; WHITE &amp; COLOR
dialog: 
text: The images now move out of the cafe and the CAMERA REVEALS
dialog: aspects of the neighborhood - LIVE ACTION and STILLS:
text: stores, people, streets, buildings, in short; a concise
text: vision of the neighborhood. All this is intercut with
text: CHARLIE mentally stripping MARIE's clothes off with his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: Like, looking at my uncle back
dialog: there. One way is the obvious;
dialog: ...man outside the law. On the
dialog: other hand, instead of a breakdown
dialog: of order there is a creation of
dialog: order and instead of the breakdown
dialog: of law, there is the creation of
dialog: law...In this society which needs

text: One wears a sheet made up to be a Roman Toga. The girls are
text: in costumes also. All of the costumes are makeshift.
text: MICHAEL is made up as Dracula, sporting a large cape, semi
text: tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his
text: mouth. His hair is slicked back to give him a "Bela Lugosi"
text: look. He is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys,
text: proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest. TONY
text: comes out of the bathroom and passes by. He takes the photo
text: from MICHAEL. Group attention focuses on TONY now. He
text: stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer
text: to his face, then sideways and finally upside-down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Oh sure! I know her Michael...In
dialog: fact, I saw her a few days ago

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: Scotch and water please.
dialog: 
text: They all laugh. The rock music blares as CHARLIE walks to
text: and fro blessing all in the room. TONY is delighted with
text: the scene. CHARLIE sits at the kitchen table, TONY opposite
text: him, and the others gather around. The party is getting
text: noisier. TONY gives CHARLIE a glass of ice cubes. CHARLIE
text: plays the part of a priest, during the Mass when the chalice
text: is filled with wine and water, TONY pours the scotch over
text: his fingers first.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest
text: would. He signifies that there is enough in the glass.

text: fun with each other. TONY pulls down his mask, revealing a
text: skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his
text: mouth. It completes the Dough-boy uniform quite well.

dialog: 
text: TONY leans over towards CHARLIE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: 'What is the truth?'

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Prophesy to us, oh Christ! Who is

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (putting the bill
dialog: back into his pocket)
dialog: How much was the original loan again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: $500. He borrowed that because he
dialog: wanted to pay off his other loans...
dialog: now, counting the interest...it's
dialog: almost $3,000.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: $3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: JOHNNY BOY
speaker_heading: (COAXING)
dialog: If you had a little talk with your

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That'll help you out fine. That's
dialog: the best way for you, not for me!

dialog: Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's what I get for getting

dialog: meet him, ok? This way he doesn't

speaker_heading: JOHNNY BOY

text: totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in
dialog: the distance.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take
text: them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a
text: sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his
text: attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top
text: floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is
text: having a party. The sound echoes through the streets.
text: Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open
text: windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of
text: the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the
dialog: fire escape.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard
text: and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find

text: ENGLISH TITLES. They are discusssing GROPPI'S suicide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I really couldn't believe it when

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Well, he was always a little

speaker_heading: (HE SMILES)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was

dialog: Groppi, that's for sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: (laughing to MARIO)
dialog: You know, this boy over here, once,
dialog: long time ago, tried to enrich my

dialog: read it.
dialog: 
dialog: 63.

speaker_heading: IN ITALIAN.

speaker_heading: MARIO

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (POLITELY)
dialog: Oh yes, he's pretty good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: What I don't understand is why you
dialog: have to go to college to read these
dialog: books that you're gonna read anyway.
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's only a couple of courses...just
dialog: for the draft.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: Charlie, couple of courses isn't
dialog: enough to get you student deferred...
dialog: I mean if they wanted to draft you,
dialog: you would've been drafted by now.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE feels that it would be better not to pursue the point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: What Mario's trying to tell you,
dialog: Charlie, is that you're wasting
dialog: your time with those "couple of
dialog: courses" ...you don't need them.
dialog: There are a lot of things that can
dialog: be taken care of...you know what I
dialog: mean?
dialog: 
text: They all laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

dialog: These politicians...they talk nice.

speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
speaker_heading: (CONTINUING)
dialog: ...but it's the same thing, all the
dialog: same...they're in there by having
dialog: something on somebody...and when
dialog: that doesn't work...they fight...Our
dialog: life has honor...we have no show to
dialog: put on because we do what we have
dialog: to do. They know where to come
dialog: when they need us. I realize this
dialog: during the war...World War II...Vito
dialog: Genovese... during WWII he worked
dialog: with the government, taking care of
dialog: the docks...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What did he do?

dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: What did he do? He was there...
dialog: that's what he did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIO
dialog: In the fifties when the communists
dialog: started in with this country and
dialog: they tried to clean them out, we
dialog: offered to do it for them...but
dialog: they didn't want us to...so we kept
dialog: out of it.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)

dialog: This Johnny Boy, you know, he's
dialog: named after me...
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: nice, eh? This Johnny Boy is like
dialog: your mister Groppi...a little crazy.
dialog: It's nice you should help him out

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do they expect you to say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIOVANNI
dialog: Who knows? It's not hard to figure
dialog: out what she'll wind up like. When
dialog: the respect for parents breaks
dialog: down, that's bad...you know I'm
dialog: "cumpari" with them...so I take an
dialog: interest. You live next door, keep
dialog: an eye open...but don't get involved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: All right.

scene_heading: INT. TERMINAL - DAY
dialog: 
text: The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement.

text: destination. He makes his way toward the large flight board
text: that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce
text: planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight
dialog: board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin
text: and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines
text: and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman
text: calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE
text: continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses
text: and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy
text: dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't know what to say to you...
dialog: 
text: The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually
text: works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Sir, may I help you?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
