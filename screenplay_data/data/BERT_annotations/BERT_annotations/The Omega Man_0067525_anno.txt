speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT
text: WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed.
dialog: MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON
text: ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a stun gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA.
dialog: REVERSE SHOT - DARKENED BALCONY WINDOW OF HOUSE
text: CAMERA ZOOMS IN from MED. LONG to MED. CLOSE SHOT of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses. Bullets smash into the frame of the window, tear out chunks of the stucco.

Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building.

text: He lifts up a sardine can, oil drips from it. Neville smiles viciously.
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - WASTE BASKET
dialog: In it are empty bottles, trash. It is not dusty or old looking.
dialog: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT DOOR OF OFFICE
text: Door is large, paneled. Obviously the entrance to very plush executive office. Neville puts ear against door, listens, stands back, kicks door open.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT - OFFICE - PAST NEVILLETS SHOULDER
text: It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Nevilles response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED. SHOT, figure in chair, it stirs.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (O.S.),
dialog: All right, Dracula. Wake up. You've got company.
text: Figure does not move. WE SEE BARREL of stun gun poked toward him from BOTTOM OF FRAME.
dialog: We cannot see eyes of figure.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (O.S.),
dialog: Where's Matthias? Where does he stay?
dialog: Figure does not move.
dialog: MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He shrugs, sighs.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: I always ask, and I always get the same answer
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Once more: where's the hive? Where does the king bee stay?
dialog: MED. CLOSE SHOT - FIGURE IN CHAIR
text: As Neville finishes speech, he pokes figure with barrel of gun. It falls forward, hood coming off. It Is dead and Disintegrating. SHOT HOLDS. We HEAR Neville's VOICE into tape recorder.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (O.S.),
dialog: 6806 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. Found another. Matthias' crowd is dying from the plague, one by one. Sweep continues.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: FADE IN:
dialog: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING ALONG STREET
text: He walks, one hand in pocket, a stun gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. A liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is VOICE OVER. He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: You dumb bastard, why did you ever bother to wash these things? Youre the only consumer left in town.
dialog: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN MENIS CLOTHING DEPARTMENT
text: He takes a garment from the rack, looks at it, drops it then frowns, picks it up and re-hangs it on the rack. He draws out a beautiful brocade tuxedo jacket, turns it, smiles, hangs it back.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: The Officers club is closed, isn't it?
dialog: Permanent undress is the correct uniform.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING THROUGH DARKENED STORE
text: Away from windows, it is shadowy in-the store, and we watch Neville walking, some clothes over his arm. SHOT is PAST HEAD AND SHOULDER OF A MANNIKIN.
dialog: CUT TO:
dialog: LONG SHOT - THE SAME - ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Again POINT OF VIEW of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his stun gun is in his right hand.
dialog: MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: THIS SHOT is from between the upraised arms of a manikin.
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - FACE OF MALE MANIKIN
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER MANIKIN
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE
text: He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence.
dialog: MED. UP ANGLE SHOT - FEMALE MANIKIN
text: This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles.
dialog: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING UP AT MANIKIN
dialog: This SHOT is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands.
dialog: It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen.
speaker_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE - SIDE VIEW
text: He is I still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there
text: Is a small indefinite SOUND. He pauses, his jaw tightens. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO MED. LONG SHOT
dialog: as Neville whirls, stun gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire.
dialog: MED. SHOT - GROUP OF MANNIKINS AND LISA
text: These are female manikins including some with Negro features, In various dress, various poses. CAMERA FINDS LISA AMONG THEM, MOVES IN SUDDENLY TO MED. CLOSE SHOT. WE SEE the "manikins" mouth open In horror.
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW - LISA
dialog: Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes into the shadows of the store.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
text: He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand.
text: He stands thus for a long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: Wait...come back...wait... Youre real! Youre not...
dialog: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH STORE
text: Again, this SHOT is through a group of male manikins, well dressed, grinning at Neville as he runs.
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEVILLE RUNNING
text: He gets another glimpse of the girl as she runs out a side door of the store.
dialog: MED. SHOT EXT. STORE
text: This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT, still focused on Neville. When CAMERA STOPS, the SHOT is FRAMED by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her.
dialog: SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK
text: In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon.
dialog: MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH
text: He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: Does it begin this way? Is two years alone too much?
dialog: Then his head comes up. He has control again.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: No. you silly bastard, it doesn't begin this way, and two years alone is all right. The way it begins is asking yourself idiot questions. Now, let's find a drink before it's time to go home.
dialog: He stands up, stretches, looks refreshed.
dialog: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - CANDLE GUTTERING IN HOLDER
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK, showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, stun gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as CAMERA TURNS for LONG SHOT of BUILDING, Neville In RIGHT SIDE of FRAME.
dialog: MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE BACK INSIDE
text: He puts down empty glass, starts to pick 'up his equipment. Suddenly pauses as he HEARS a CRASH from a breaking bottle. His jaw tightens, he becomes tense and turns toward sound.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - WINE KEG DISPLAY
dialog: Sign reads "Visit Our Wine Cellar -- For the Experience of a Lifetime"
dialog: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE
dialog: He squints at sigh, heads for the stairway with candle.
dialog: MED, SHOT - NEVILLE GOING DOWN STAIRS WITH CANDLE
dialog: MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CELLAR
text: This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an "authentic" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. SHOT is from BEHIND wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine
scene_heading: MED. REVERSE SHOT - WINE RACKS, NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
scene_heading: MED. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING AT WINE RACKS
dialog: His flashlight probes here and there along walls. Stops on a. particular area of one of the racks.
dialog: VERY CLOSE SHOT SIDE VIEW OF WINE BOTTLES IN RACK
text: Neville's light falls on bottle. Behind rack we SEE another HAND at back. CAMERA HOLDS. The hand is still when light first strikes it, then it comes to life, moves, clenches.
speaker_heading: MEDIUM SHOT - BEHIND RACK OF BOTTLES
text: We SEE a FAMILY MEMBER who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar.
dialog: NEVILLE - CLOSE SHOT
text: From the shadows to his left rear. Also made from behind wine rack. CAMERA RISES from near floor level to five feet or so, following POINT OF VIEW of Family member.
dialog: MED. WIDE ANGLE SHOT - WINE RACK
text: From behind Neville. As he approaches rack, the entire Rack tilts and slowly falls toward him.
dialog: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE
text: throws himself back, trying to avoid the rack, but as he does so, he looks up.
scene_heading: MED. CLOSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - CREATURE ON TOP OF WINE RACK
dialog: hood flaring behind, arms outstretched
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION
dialog: MED. SHOT - RACK FALLING ON NEVILLE
dialog: bottles falling out of rack and exploding on floor. Creature jumps free from top of rack,
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM STAIRS
dialog: Three more of the creatures pile-out from behind barrels, wine racks, wherever they've been sleeping.
dialog: MED. SHOT NEVILLE UNCONSCIOUS UNDER WINE RACK
dialog: CLOSE SHOT CREATURE'S FACE
dialog: Shook as CAMERA SNAPS IN for very CLOSE SHOT: dead white face, Its mouth open, twisted with
dialog: hatred and anger, eyes still obscured by hood.
dialog: FADE OUT.
dialog: SLOW FADE IN:
text: As light begins to fill the SCREEN again, BLURRY, without FOCUS, WE HEAR, as from a great distance, TINY in sound, the VOICE of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last TV appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As he goes on, his voice RISES, moves toward HYSTERIA.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: ...and, oh, brothers and sisters, I ask you to look at him. Does he have the Marks? Do you see them?
dialog: (muffled answers of "no, no.")
dialog: You see him as we were before the Punishment, before we gained grace. You see lying there, the last of scientists and bankers and business- men...the users of the wheel! Do we use the tools of the wheel, as he does?
dialog: ("no, not.")
dialog: Is he of The Family?
dialog: ("no, not")
dialog: Is he of the Sacred Society?
dialog: (no, not.")
dialog: Then ... what is he?
dialog: (confused mumbling, anger)
dialog: CAMERA CLEARS VERY SLOWLY TO AN UP SHOT NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
text: WE SEE the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY, APPEARING TO SEEK FOCUS. THEN IT SNAPS INTO FOCUS IN ZOOM - VERY CLOSE SHOT of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low.
dialog: He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him.
scene_heading: LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE TIED ON FLOOR MATTHIAS POINT OF VIEW
text: Neville is regaining consciousness. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN on him as Matthias talks.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS (O.S.)
dialog: He is part of the dead...he has no place here. He has the stink of oil and electric circuitry about him. He is obsolete...
dialog: ( ...yes, yes.")
dialog: WIDE ANGIE SHOT CHAMBER IN FEDERAL COURT BUILDING
text: Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: And what shall we do with old machinery...?
scene_heading: ZOOM CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
dialog: He points at Neville.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: ... you are discarded. You are the rubbish of the past...
dialog: MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
dialog: His initial horror and fear past, he LAUGHS aloud.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: This is a bloody Halloween party...
dialog: Youre all sick ... You need...
dialog: Those nearest, knock him back down, silence him.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS
text: He smiles, shakes his head. His voice becomes soft with false compassion. He leans down over his pulpit.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: How hard it is to admit the truth.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Take him to the little room. For the Questioning...
text: MED. SHOT - CREATURES DRAGGING NEVILLE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they take Neville into a smaller room.
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT - THE LITTLE ROOM - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE
text: This room resembles the small chambers in which private questioning took place during the Inquisition. The table is long and there are candles and books on it. The scene should be Gothic and just this side of a put-on. Taste here, as elsewhere, must be exquisite so as to tread the line between the grotesque, the demented, and the Camp.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: Well, now, Mr. Neville, we can talk for a little while. It's been a long time since you've talked -- except to yourself.
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION
dialog: Neville is surprised. He has assumed Matthias was truly and completely insane.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: So you dont rant all the time? Why bother with it at all?
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS
dialog: He LAUGHS, walks around the dark room.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: Yes, you were a scientist. The kind of man who understood nothing until there was almost nothing left to understand.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: (surly)
dialog: I'm getting along...
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: You're getting dead, Mr. Neville -- or doctor or colonel, whatever they called you. I have responsibility for the last tiny remnant of mankind ... I have that responsibility.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: Then why the hell dont you live up to it? Why don't you throw away the costumes and get these people organized, try to work on a cure...
dialog: Matthias turns on him angrily.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: Oh. we are organized. You know that well enough. A cure? There is none. In the early days ... Have you seen the ruins of the general hospital? Thousands of bodies littering the corridors, rooms jammed with the dead ... and finally... those pitiful few who were left, hopeless, going mad, lynching the doctors, the technicians who had betrayed them... By the way, why weren't you there... Doctor?
speaker_heading: REACTION SHOT - NEVILLE
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: I tried. There was a crash...
speaker_heading: TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE,
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: It doesn't matter. There was no cure. Is none. The curse you people created, couldn't stop, is... forever. So I've turned that curse into a blessing.
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS (O.S.)
dialog: No. now the Family has found its way. It can bear the burden -- the only curse left is -- you.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: You are insane. And before very damn long, youll be dead -- can't you see that?
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: last night you killed how many? Three of us? And today We don't know yet. And before that? You've killed dozens...Youre the messenger of death, Doctor, not us.
dialog: TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND MATTHIAS
text: OTHERS come INTO the room now, and Matthias manner changes. Once again he adopts the portentous pose of judge-prophet.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: I was defending myself ... You lunatics came after me...
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: He's confessed all, Brothers. Murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of proscribed rites. He admits 'science, medicine, weapons, machines, electricity. He has not shared the Punishment; he does not bear the Marks...
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: What is the Punishment? The Marks?
dialog: WIDE ANGLE GROUP SHOT - MATTHIAS AND GROUP OF FAMILY
text: As Neville speaks, the group stares at him. This is the first group appearance of the Family. WE SEE that they are of both sexes and all races. Some seem fairly young, however there are no children. In addition to the hoods, we find some wearing goggles, some helmets with dark visors, etc. Obviously, all these forms of eye guards have been scavenged in the empty city.
scene_heading: SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS - INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBERS
text: As CAMERA PANS from one to another, each removes his or her glasses, goggles, etc. revealing blank white eyes. CAMERA completes pan, stops on Matthias. He removes glasses, shows his own white eyes. For the first time, WE SEE the OPAQUE EYES of the Family.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: These are the Marks, Mr. Neville ... The Punishment is what you and those like you brought upon us...
text: CAMERA CLOSES on Matthias, closes slowly on his face, eyes, as he talks.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: In the beginning, we tried to help one another, those that were left. We tried to clean things up, set them straight. We buried and burned. And it came to us that we were spared for just that work...
scene_heading: PAN SHOT - FAMILY MEMBERS LISTENING TO MATTHIAS
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS (O.S.)
dialog: ... to bury what was dead, to burn what was evil, dangerous...
dialog: Neville's VOICE breaks in harsh, angry.
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (O.S.),
dialog: So you burned libraries, laboratories...You wrecked computer centers, engineering facilities ... a herd of insane barbarians. Every night you go on burning.
dialog: PAN SHOT ENDS ON MATTHIAS. He still speaks very quietly.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: You call us barbarians, Neville'. Very well, it's an honorable name. We mean to cancel the world you made. We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons began to threaten more than they offered.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: You'll play hell...
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: No, you've played hell you and your dead kinsmen of the car and the plane and the tank and the bomb ... and when you die, the-last living reminder of hell will be gone ... forever.
dialog: As he speaks, CAMERA PULLS OUT TO GROUP SHOT. The Family RS assent.
dialog: Matthias turns to Zachary.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: Brother Zachary?
speaker_heading: ZACHARY
dialog: We got everything ready.
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT - EXT. - NEVILLE, MATTHIAS, ETC.
text: An alley or narrow street. There, a cart has been brought. It has high sides and two solid wooden wheels about five feet in diameter. It is filled with old newspapers, books, files, broken pieces of wooden furniture, etc. SHOT is made BETWEEN Neville and Matthias. Matthias and Family have glasses or shields back on. Zachary comes over, jerks Neville roughly toward cart. Matthias stops him.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: One thing, Neville, now that its over...
dialog: Neville stares back at him.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: why didn't you leave? Why didn't you get out of the city...?
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: I wasnt sure about that ... until now.
dialog: MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CART
text: On his head is a conical cap obviously made of computer printout paper. This scene echoes the burning of heretics. Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. HOWLING members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle. The lighting is weak, bizarre.
text: CLOSE SHOT OF OLD WOMAN in hood, eyes opaque, LAUGHING insanely, throwing objects at Neville.
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - HANDS
dialog: trying to reach through the slats of the cart to scratch Neville. They are dead white.
dialog: MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE
dialog: over a wave of candles, the flames flickering Insanely.
dialog: LONG SHOT - THE CROWD
dialog: filling a narrow street from Neville's POINT OF VIEW.
dialog: CAMERA TRANSITION TO NEVILLE
text: who stands tied to the cart, wood and paper and books piled around him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT. We find that we are in a VAST EMPTY STADIUM. In the midst of the field, THE FAMILY, all
text: carrying candles, are gathered around the stand from which Matthias preaches. The cart has been turned upside-down
text: and the technological debris it contained is piled below one of the wheels, to which Neville Is bound, spread-eagled. It stands in a large circular burned area. This is where Matthias and the Family have burned bodies after the plague's onslaught.
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: Here Is evil...
dialog: MATTHIAS past Neville's profile. As Matthias speaks, CAMERA FOCUS ALTERS FROM MATTHIAS to NEVILLE.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: Is this not the place where all the dead burned? And this
dialog: (pointing to Neville)
dialog: Is the last of the dead...And what will we do with this corpse?
text: As Matthias asks his question and the Family HOWLS for Nevilles death, CAMERA PULLS OUT VERY QUICKLY TO WIVZ ANGLE LONG SHOT as stadium LIGHTS COME 0N. At first flickeringly, then with a BURST of fall power. All the lights do not come on. Some bulbs ate burnt out or have failed over the past year or so, but still the field la flooded with light.
text: MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS AND OTHERS OF THE SOCIETY falling back from their stand, trying to cover their eyes despite their sunglasses.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS

speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - STADIUM
text: Neville still staked out in center of stadium. Last of the creatures Is crawling or hobbling away out of the light. After a long moment the are-lights begin to fade, wink, and finally go out. CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN TO CLOSE SHOT of Neville struggling, trying to get loose. Then he pauses, fear in his expression, He HEARS someone COMING.
scene_heading: NED. SHOT - BLURRED IMAGE OF SOMEONE MOVING ACROSS FIELD
text: walking swiftly across the empty field, Neville tries to twist his head around to see, but it is too dark down in the bowl of the stadium to see more than a shadowy figure.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - HANDS UNTYING NEVILLE - SEMI-DARKNESS
dialog: WE SEE HANDS quickly loosening the ropes on Neville's ankles and hands.
dialog: MED. SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW
dialog: Shadow of someone above him.

dialog: Find him. Search the Corridors... the storerooms...everywhere...
dialog: CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE
text: Figure behind pushes him through a door, slams it closed. Neville falls to his knees, shakes his head, trying to get his bearings. A beam of light from an electric torch sitting on a box dimly illuminates the room. He rises, starts to turn. Then, from shadows behind
dialog: him, between lockers he HEARS:
speaker_heading: LISA (O.S.)
dialog: All right, son of a bitch. Just hold tight...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Uh-uh, dont turn. Stand. When I want you turned, Ill turn you. on or off or around.
dialog: Lisas voice is low, smooth, sophisticated, but there is in It the sound of a profound self-confidence.
scene_heading: MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE - REAR VIEW AGAINST LIGHT
text: Lisa slowly drifts INTO FRAME LEFT. FOCUS is on Neville. Lisas head, right shoulder are blurred. Her hand comes up holding a .45 automatic. FOCUS MOVES TO GUN, Neville still In B.G.
dialog: LISA
dialog: Thats fine. Now put your hands out... way out, shoulder high. Like they were going to crucify you.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - NEVILLE
text: looking AT CAMERA, his head and shoulders in LEFT HALF OF FRAME. In shadows behind, WE SEE LISA vaguely, the .45 VIVID in SHAFT OF LIGHT from torch.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: As a matter of fact, they were going to roast me. Why did you stop them?
text: Lisa comes closer. We can SEE HER. She Is beautiful, and black. She Is wearing a shirt, tails tied, and long shorts, with cycle boots. Her face is composed, almost amused as she moves up behind Neville.
dialog: LISA
dialog: We've got a reason,
dialog: Neville's eyebrows rise. He is setting himself to turn on her.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: My name is Robert...
dialog: LISA
dialog: Your name's mud, Mister.
dialog: Neville whirls, CAMERA FOCUSES on Lisa who lifts the .45, brings it chopping down with moderate force.
dialog: MED. TWO-SHOT - NEVILLE AND EISA
text: Lisa is breathing a little harder, but her composure is fine. She cooks pistol. Neville is getting off floor staring into muzzle of .45, rubbing his head, looking at the girl with grudging respect.
dialog: LISA
dialog: ...and youre not going to need a name if you fool with me again.
text: She nudges Neville toward the door. He raises his hands automatically. They walk.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: Where did you pick up that cute way of saying stop?
dialog: WE SEE LISA still behind, looking from one side to the other as they traverse corridors.
dialog: LISA
dialog: Oakland. I was a Raider. Anyhow, I only said slow. You know how I say stop?
dialog: The pistol nudges Neville's ribs. Neville keeps walking.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: You keep clowning around, and those spooks out there are going to...
dialog: LISA
dialog: Shut up. Dutch is taking care of the honks.
dialog: LONG SHOT - FROM CORRIDOR OF STADIUM LOOKING OUT ONTO FIELD
text: WE SEE MATTHIAS' PEOPLE running closer toward the corridor, This shot, we discover, Is from POINT OF VIEW of the shadowy figure, Dutch, who now stands in darkness. WE HEAR Dutch fumbling with something. CAMERA FOCUSES now on F.G. Dutchs hand rises, holding cylindrical container. Matthias' people still in B.G. reach corridor entrance. Dutch throws container.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT - CORRIDOR FROM MATTHIAS' POINT OF VIEW
text: As they try to enter, there is a blinding explosion of LIGHT, only moderate SOUND, as a phosphorus grenade explodes. SHOT should capitalize on diffusion, refraction of phosphorus blow-up, its brilliant blue-white glare.
speaker_heading: MATTHIAS
dialog: No, no ... get back ... The next entrance...
dialog: MEDIUM TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA
dialog: Neville is in F.G., Lisa behind with pistol. They are trotting.

dialog: The ramp.
dialog: SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE IN CORRIDORS
text: Lisa yells directions to him as Neville skids bike around corners, in and bat, around obstacles like heaps of cushions, piles of coke cases, etc, Shot should take advantage of bike light, refractions, shadows, veering off bike, near collisions.
dialog: LISA
dialog: Left, left, goddamn It.

dialog: Hell be the source of more antibodies. The more people we can inject, the more we'll have serum for...the others. And when thats done, we'll pull out. We'll take what we need, and head for the mountains and the valleys ... think of what's out there...
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT - LISA

speaker_heading: EXT. PLAZA - DAY
text: empty and the fountain splashes untended. We SEE a small FIGURE on a bicycle pedaling across the far side of the open space. It is the child we met in the house with Al and Richie and the Others. She conceals her bicycle at the edge of the plaza and scurries fearfully across the open space to the fountain. On the edge of its lowest basin, she lays out a pitiful array of flowers and an apple or two from a paper shopping bag she carries. She crouches, kneeling with her hands clasped, hardly daring to look up at Neville's tower.
dialog: GIRL
dialog: Please...I brought you this stuff. Don't let them take me either, and put me in a bag. Please.
text: She HEARS the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring closer and races terror-struck, for her bicycle. As she DISAPPEARS, Neville's car crosses the plaza at speed, slowing only enough for the garage doors to open and ENTER. The girl's offering lies unheeded on the fountain.

dialog: Lisa bristles at this.
dialog: LISA
dialog: What do you mean "things Arent they human, too?
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: Yeah ... I guess you could call them that. How many are there? Forty? ... Fifty? The last of those four billion steamy bodies that were crawling around last time somebody took a count. They were a dandy bunch weren't they?
dialog: LISA
dialog: They did the best they could. Who the hell are you to put down the human race?
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: Me? I'm nobody, baby ... but at least I know it. I was just part of the crowd, and I didn't think much of it.
dialog: LISA
dialog: Well I do! They made the world...that's what it was all about.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: No, honey...they RUINED it ... we're living in what they made of it, and God help us. Pretty soon those sick animals out there'll be gone, and then we will be too and all that'll be left is this
dialog: (points to his collection of cultural artifacts)
dialog: That one Rembrandt's worth more than everyone left alive in this stinking city! Maybe in a hundred years or so Godll get around to kicking through the ashes down here and read Shakespeare and say, "Well ... maybe it was worth it."
dialog: LISA
dialog: I've heard that kind of talk before, you uppity, honky pig...and I HATE IT!
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: Ohhh, lovely! Yeah ... I've heard THAT kind of talk before, too, and that got everybody a hell of a long way, didn't it? There're just about enough of us here to go through all that again, right?
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: NEVILLE (CON'T)

WE SEE now that she is walking in a cemetery. The graves are overgrown, some of the stones fallen. The place is in general disrepair.
dialog: MED. SHOT - LISA AND GRAVE
text: She pushes aside some tall weeds and stands before a place relatively cleared, where someone has put gravel to keep down the weeds and has carefully outlined a large grave-site with coke and seven-up bottles by burying them in the ground neck down. There is a faded plaque of wood, probably the bottom of an orange-crate or something more substantial. On it are the names and dates of her parents:

text: Suddenly, above her monologue, she HEARS a SOUND. A SOB. It .is not the sound of an animal, but a human sound, She whirls, a copy of Neville, the stun gun she is carrying ready to fire. She cocks it as she turns, and her face is hard. She sees nothing.

dialog: MED. CLOSE  WOMANS FACE - SLIGHT DOWN ANGLE
text: Her face is dead white, white hair straggled around it. Her eyes are the blank white of all Matthias' people. And there are tears running down her cheeks. In B.G. but clearly visible, WE SEE THE FACE of the dead child, its eyes, too, are white, blank. It is obviously a newborn infant.

She is absorbed in thought, stops a little behind Neville on the far side of fountain. She wears sunglasses and a scarf though it is not bright. Her hair has a few subtle streaks in it and her skin has lightened also. Neville has glanced at the car as it arrived, is now turned back to fountain.
dialog: NEVILLE
dialog: It's an illusion, you know. It looks like a tapped spring, but theres nothing new ... the same water coming up over and over again...
