text: ...then WORDS appear, twisting and vaguely transparent,
text: reflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he
text: reads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: 'The young girl sat perfectly still in the
dialog: confessional...
scene_heading: 1	INT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON
text: Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is
text: in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college
text: STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: ...listening to her father's boots scrape like
text: chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then
dialog: grow faint, then disappear altogether.'
text: As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN,
text: perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE
text: BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:
scene_heading: WELCOME TO WORDFEST
text: GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if
dialog: they've been on a field trip to the DMV.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: (a wave of the pages)
dialog: So. .Anyone?
text: A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN
text: sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES
text: LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the
dialog: window.
scene_heading: CARRIE MCWHIRTY
dialog: Let me get this straight. The girl with the
text: big lips is depressed because, each night, when
text: her father goes off to work at the bakery, her
text: mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the
dialog: house. Not only does this girl have to listen
dialog: to her mother working this guy in the next
dialog: room, she has to wash the sheets each morning
text: before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of
dialog: this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy
text: takes her to confession--only, once she gets in
text: the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and
text: realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is
dialog: that it?
text: James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY
text: OVERCOAT he wears.
scene_heading: CARRIE MCWHIRTY
dialog: I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: All right. Let's try to keep it constructive,
dialog: shall we? Howard, what about you?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I hated it.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That's not exactly what I meant by
dialog: constructive, Howard.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I think James should try to be more
dialog: constructive. This is my second semester with
dialog: him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me
dialog: want to kill myself.
text: GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive.
text: Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the
text: raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yes, Hannah?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: I think maybe we're missing the point. It
dialog: seems to me James' strength as a writer is that
dialog: he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us
dialog: like adults. He respects us enough to forget
dialog: us. That takes . . . courage .
text: GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I
dialog: think.
dialog: (as the students rise)
dialog: Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And
dialog: remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to
dialog: tonight's cocktail party need to have them at
text: the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.
text: Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Thanks for that. He all right?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: I think so. ..What about you?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Me? Sure. Why?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Just checking.
text: GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY
text: BOOTS, then starts to exit himself.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Turn out the light, please.
text: GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back
text: of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the
text: wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.
scene_heading: 2	INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)
text: GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL,
text: 45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful
text: of SLICK PROGRAMS.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (calm but firm)
dialog: No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for
dialog: today. This means we have no programs for the
dialog: weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at
text: 9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw
dialog: Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are
dialog: going.
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.
text: GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him.
text: There is the slightest of hesitations, then....
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Professor Tripp.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Chancellor.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I got the message you called.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I got the message you called too.
text: This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and
text: continue on, without so much as a backward glance.
scene_heading: 3	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING

scene_heading: 5	INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT
text: GRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half
dialog: the length of the terminal, until...
scene_heading: 6	INT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT
text: ...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the
text: tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black
text: dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.
text: Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the
text: woman's ear, then spots Grady.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Tripp!
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: How are you, Crabtree?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss
dialog: Antonia. . .uh. . . .
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Sloviak.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to
dialog: tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you.
dialog: Trip? ?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (a slight beat)
dialog: The more the merrier.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Terry was telling me about you on the plane.
dialog: It was ail so interesting.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes
dialog: to be published. What you do as a writer, what
dialog: I do as an editor...
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I sweat blood for five years and he checks for
dialog: spelling.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: (indicating Crabtree)
dialog: That's exactly what he said.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: We know each other pretty well.
dialog: (to Grady)
dialog: So where's Emily?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Emily?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Your wife.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Perfect. Well then, shall we?
text: GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the
text: architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in
text: her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.
scene_heading: 7	INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
text: GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak
text: sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Do you know how many times I've boarded an
dialog: airplane praying someone like her would sit
dialog: down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my
dialog: way to Pittsburgh.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great
dialog: cities.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no
dialog: argument from me.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: She's a transvestite.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: You're stoned.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: She's still a transvestite.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Isn't she?
text: Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he
text: watches the carousel spin.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: So how's the book?
text: GRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so
text: soon. He tries to act casual.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort
text: of. ..tinkering with it.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it
dialog: sometime this weekend. Think that might be
dialog: possible?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . .
dialog: juncture .
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I thought you were tinkering.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I just mean. . .
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you,
dialog: Tripp. But...
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
text: GRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's
text: face brightens again.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would
dialog: be?
text: GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto
text: the carousel.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That would be a tuba.
scene_heading: 8	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON 8
text: As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the
text: great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance,
text: then glances in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It
dialog: wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Why yes. How did you know?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Lucky guess.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: You didn't actually purchase this car, did
dialog: you. Trip??
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: He owes God money. You know, he queered
dialog: himself for good with Esquire.
text: GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto
dialog: butane.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He said something about being between things.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
text: Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken
dialog: legs.
scene_heading: 9	EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
text: A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS
text: UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in
text: front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her
text: face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hi, Tanya.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: This is Tanya. My wife's secretary.
text: CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and
text: nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Grady.. ..Emily's not here.
text: GRADY just smiles, nods.
speaker_heading: TANYA (cont'd)
dialog: Is there anything I can do for you?
text: GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through
text: Tanya's sad umbrella.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You're leaking, Tanya.
text: Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Trip? ?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: She left me. Crabs.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Left you...? Who? Emily?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I
dialog: mean, what are we doing here?
text: GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his
text: windshield, turns on the ignition.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I thought maybe I made it all up.
scene_heading: 10	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING
text: Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and
text: select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of
text: cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching
text: halt across the street, parks in front of another fire
text: hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a
text: GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: That's a nice greenhouse.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby,
dialog: Tripp.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always
dialog: do.
scene_heading: 11	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE
text: As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears,
text: riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to
dialog: wonder if you were ever going to--oh!
text: As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches
text: forward ...into Grady's arms.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Easy there.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't
dialog: know how anyone actually walks in these things.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Practice.
text: Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific
text: curiosity in her eye.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I don't believe we've met...
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Antonia. Antonia Sloviak--
text: Just then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES
text: skitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general
dialog: direction of Grady.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Poe!
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: (mildly)
dialog: This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?
text: Poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the
text: hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around
text: and is barking at the living room.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Who ' s he barking at now?
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: He's still barking at me. He's blind.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Poe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.
text: As Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.
dialog: (strategy in her tone)
dialog: Perhaps you could put some of these coats in
text: the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (reading her)
dialog: I don't believe I know where the upstairs
text: guest room is.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Well then. I'd better show you. Terry--
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: We'll just make ourselves at home.
dialog: (kneeling by Poe)
dialog: Won't we, Poe? Yes, yes....
scene_heading: 12	INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM
text: GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA.
text: AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of
text: famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN
text: IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with
text: PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As
text: Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S
text: PENNANT hanging over the mantle.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: New?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Walter just got it back from the framer today.
text: Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the
text: pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You go first.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: All right. This morning--
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm pregnant.
text: A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living room below.
text: GRADY starts to speak.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm sure.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I think Walter would find this a little more
dialog: than surprising.
text: GRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Emily left me this morning.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: She's left before...
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: She's left the room before. She always came
dialog: back.
text: Sara nods. Considers this.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry
dialog: each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Simple.
text: GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat
text: lying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Is that Cristaile?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hm.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (weary)
dialog: My God, I wear the same scent as a
dialog: transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't:
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is
text: by the end of the evening.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Has he asked to see the book yet?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: And? Are you going to tell him?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm
dialog: going to do.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (distantly)
dialog: Neither do 1.
text: GRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I guess you're going to have to chew it off
dialog: then.
scene_heading: 13	INT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE
text: Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by
text: Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree,
text: returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds
text: MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Walter! I see you've met my friend.
speaker_heading: WALTER GASKELL
dialog: Yes . She' s charming.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: (taking her drink)
dialog: Walter's been telling me the most fascinating
dialog: things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?
speaker_heading: WALTER GASKELL
dialog: Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my
dialog: contention that their marriage tapped into the
dialog: very id of American popular culture. Joe
dialog: DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking,
dialog: the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be
dialog: controversial, I personally believe every
dialog: woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn
dialog: Monroe.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Oh, I couldn't agree more.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and
text: changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN
dialog: ("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's
text: clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting
dialog: the make on Hannah Green.
dialog: Q
dialog: And while my latest has been on the New York
dialog: Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't
dialog: help but lament that my first book, which
dialog: contains what I consider my finest writing, was
dialog: remaindered in less than five. So, I find
dialog: myself conflicted.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in
dialog: the Hamptons.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: Grady.
text: Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.
dialog: Q
dialog: Hello.. .Professor.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The
dialog: Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A'
dialog: material for her.
text: As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the
text: other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN
text: TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.
speaker_heading: MAN IN TWEED
dialog: (to short man)
dialog: A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm
dialog: telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob
dialog: laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa?
dialog: Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot
dialog: bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
speaker_heading: (as GRADY passes)
dialog: Grady!
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hello, Nathan.
speaker_heading: MAN IN TWEED
dialog: My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The
dialog: PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for
dialog: you, Grady.
dialog: (to his friend)
text: GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,
text: The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.
speaker_heading: SHORT MAN
dialog: Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I
dialog: say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon
dialog: of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it
dialog: on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years
dialog: running.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (pulling away)
dialog: No wonder it's still in print.
text: As GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette.
scene_heading: WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
dialog: ...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy
dialog: fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to
dialog: deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover
dialog: the cancer in your heart every time, but God
dialog: forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.
scene_heading: 14	EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT
text: GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from
text: his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around
text: the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE
text: accosts him.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: There you are.
text: GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he
text: sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the
text: person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in
text: the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in
dialog: here. You haven't seen it, have you?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if
dialog: I was sitting on it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I doubt it, darling.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (angling &amp; bottle to the light)
dialog: Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he
dialog: will be addressing 500 people in little over an
dialog: hour...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You want to keep him happy.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: If he' s happy. . .
dialog: (kissing her as he exits)
dialog: I'm happy.
text: As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in
text: the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally,
text: she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off,
text: returning to the clamor inside her house.
text: GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of
text: LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching
text: him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's
text: garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught
text: eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the
dialog: porch.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James?
text: James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a
text: GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at
text: what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's fake.
text: James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY
text: peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The
text: sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED
speaker_heading: PISTOL.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It was my mother's. She won it in a penny
dialog: arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's very convincing.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It used to shoot these little paper caps, but
dialog: they don't make them anymore. The caps.
text: GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers
text: and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry
dialog: rabbits' feet...
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: ...You carry firearms.
text: As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass
text: briefly over the jay. GRADY
text: notices, offers.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of
dialog: my emotions.
text: GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were
dialog: wondering. I crashed. I mean, not
dialog: intentionally...
text: James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be
text: seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER (cont'd)
dialog: ...but the other night, Hannah and I were
dialog: together, at the movies, and she asked me.
dialog: Since she was coming. So I ended up coming.
dialog: Too.
text: GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: No! What gave you that idea?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent
text: her a room.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
dialog: (glancing back at the window)
dialog: Besides, she doesn't really know me. She
text: thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's
dialog: because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she
dialog: knows it and try as she might to not let that
dialog: screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in
dialog: some way.
text: James looks away from the window, at Grady.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You're not like my other teachers, Professor
dialog: Tripp.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You're not like my other students, James. So
dialog: what was the movie you two saw?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and
dialog: Frances Farmer.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Sounds like a good one.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (a crooked smile)
dialog: It's not bad.
text: GRADY considers James' fragile face.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Listen, James, about this afternoon. In
dialog: workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a
text: bit out of control.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: They really hated it. I think they hated it
dialog: more than any of the other ones.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to
dialog: write.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (truly impressed)
dialog: Really? That's remarkable.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in
dialog: bed I figure them out. The stories.
text: As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY
text: looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat.
text: Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against
text: the modest bulk of the cap gun.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You cold, James?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (distant)
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: So what are you doing out here?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's colder in there. -
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You're right.
text: James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that
text: he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought
dialog: ...I thought I'd come out here and take a look
dialog: at it. You don't see one of those every day. It
dialog: looks like heaven...
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Heaven?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in
dialog: heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in
dialog: crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the
dialog: way I remember it...
text: Abruptly, James glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I should be going.
text: James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a
text: moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER (cont'd)
dialog: Goodbye, Professor Tripp.
text: GRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off
text: then, leaving the light of the house behind.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James.
dialog: (as he stops)
dialog: Don't leave just yet. There's something I
dialog: think you ought to see.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'll miss my bus.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: This is worth it.
text: James looks conflicted.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: Trust me.
scene_heading: 15	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: It's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past
text: the departing guests and toward the stairs.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Hey, you two.
text: GRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)
dialog: Are you riding with me, James?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: No, I'm going ho--
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his
dialog: friend. All right?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know.
dialog: Where are they exactly?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Here we are!
text: CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss
text: Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: (spying James)
dialog: Nell, hello there.
text: CRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James
text: Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: James'll know about George Sanders.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: George Sanders?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders
dialog: killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel
dialog: room.
text: The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but
text: Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: How comprehensive of you.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie
dialog: suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: There's so many...
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Just a few then. The big ones.
text: James glances at the loose group of people around him,
dialog: watching, then...
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles
dialog: Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth,
dialog: 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an
dialog: accident, but, you know. . .
dialog: (a trace of irony)
text: He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took
dialog: pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he
text: hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in
text: lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more
dialog: pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget
dialog: when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot
dialog: himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979.
dialog: Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret
dialog: Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills.
text: Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in
dialog: 1978. There are more but I don't know if you
dialog: would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara
dialog: Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: I haven't heard of half of those.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: You did them alphabetically.
text: James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James
text: blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs
text: shyly, looks away.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: That's just how my brain works, I guess.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out
dialog: with us after the lecture. There's a place on
dialog: the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Actually. ..I just want to go home.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants
dialog: to go home. Besides, faculty will be present.
dialog: Just think of it as a field trip.
text: As he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if
text: to say: "Bring him." MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James
text: glacially as we CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK
text: The dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR
text: opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of
text: MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.
scene_heading: 16	INT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE
text: GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the
text: photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
text: STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN
text: JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Is that really it?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That's really it.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: The one she wore on her wedding day?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: So I'm told.
text: James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide
text: garments, stands speechless.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Really.
text: James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he
text: reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar,
text: barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: They're glass. The buttons.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Like the lady herself.
text: GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a
text: bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the
text: jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: She was small. Most people don't know that.
text: The shoulders are small.
dialog: (touching the satin)
text: It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time
dialog: she wore it. That day. She must've felt so
dialog: ...happy.
text: GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket,
text: lifts it lightly.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or...
dialog: something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth
dialog: about how much he pays for these things.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You're really good friends with the
dialog: Chancellor, aren't you?
text: Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains
text: unchanged, consumed with the jacket.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I guess you must be, if you know the
text: combination to his closet and he doesn't mind
dialog: your being here in their bedroom like this.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Right.
text: A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The
text: CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom
text: window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN
text: DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: We, better skedaddle. Close that closet--
dialog: James? You ail right?
text: James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed,
text: knapsack between his knees, head in hands.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing
dialog: that jacket that belonged to her. It just
text: looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a
dialog: closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail?
dialog: (off Grady's look)
dialog: Hannah mentioned something about it. About a
dialog: note.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we
dialog: should go now.
text: Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light,
text: leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.
text: James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.
scene_heading: 17	INT. HALLWAY
text: A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY
text: as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to
text: the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in
text: Grady's direction.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .
text: GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward
text: and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Jesus!
text: GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the
text: ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his
text: head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!
text: Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his
text: head back and forth, back and forth, over and over,
text: growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his
text: throat, until there is a sharp...
dialog: CRACK! CRACK!
text: Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily
text: onto Grady's legs. GRADY
text: turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the
text: little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.
text: GRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I had to. Didn't I?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1
dialog: thought --
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on
dialog: me.
text: GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through
text: life with a slight overbite.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see
dialog: if someone's breathing.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead
dialog: dog when I see one.
text: James looks miserably at Poe.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: What are we going to do?
text: GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: First you're going to give me that little cap
dialog: gun of yours.
scene_heading: 18	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING
text: GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yea, James.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: What are we going to do with...
text: James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange
text: blue eyes gleaming.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out
dialog: how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her
dialog: husband's dog.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Trust me, James, when the family pet's been
text: assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear
dialog: one of her students was the triggerman.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Does she want to hear it was one of her
dialog: professors?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I've got tenure.
scene_heading: 19	EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS)
text: As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of
text: Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a
text: space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Okay.
text: James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs
text: looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps
text: forward, and takes the hind legs.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: He's still a little warm.
text: They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until
text: there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Yuck.
text: GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a
text: suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost
dialog: perfectly.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (searching)
dialog: That's just what they used to say in the ads.
dialog: Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Whose tuba is that anyway?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Miss Sloviak's.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Can I ask you something about her?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: She is. Ah. Here we go...
text: GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-
text: size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of
dialog: boxers.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
dialog: gay?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Most of the time he is, James. Some of the
dialog: time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
text: GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a
text: pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That
dialog: should take the pinch out of my ankle.
dialog: (handing the bottle to James)
dialog: Have one.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: No thanks. I'm fine without them.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Right. That's why you were standing in the
text: Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap
dialog: gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right,
dialog: you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
text: GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth,
text: drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.
text: Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth,
text: and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later,
text: he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill
text: from the lapel of his jacket.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: How 'bout we try that again.
scene_heading: 20	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
text: On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...really needs no introduction. Walk down the
dialog: aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any
dialog: hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at
dialog: you. You all know the name, you all know the
dialog: books, so welcome if you will, the man those of
dialog: us who know him simply call.. .Q.
text: As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the
text: auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an
text: open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID
text: with a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
dialog: 
dialog: Q
dialog: Good evening.
text: GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him,
text: watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting
text: until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory
text: hush. Finally, he speaks again.
dialog: Q
dialog: I am a writer.
text: As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He
text: glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a
text: similar look of bafflement.
speaker_heading: Q (cont'd)
dialog: As a writer, one thing you learn is that
dialog: everyone you encounter has a story. Every
dialog: bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an
dialog: idea or a. story that would make a "great book"
dialog: or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has
text: an idea. (gestures to the audience)
dialog: But, how do you go from there to here? How do
dialog: you go from having an idea to having a book?
dialog: How do you get across? What is the bridge, the
dialog: bridge that allows you to walk on air from the
text: shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of
dialog: accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is
dialog: worth the telling, faith that you have the
dialog: wherewithal to tell it, faith that the
dialog: carefully woven structure you create won't
dialog: collapse beneath you...
text: GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking
text: and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far
text: EXIT. A blink later, she is gone.
speaker_heading: Q (cont'd)
dialog: ...and faith that when you get to the other
dialog: side someone will be waiting who gives a damn
dialog: about the tale you have to tell.
text: GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own
text: HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a
text: thread forty feet above his head...
text: Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement:
text: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the
text: auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn,
text: James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows
text: away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.
text: GRADY blinks, turns to James.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'll be right back.
scene_heading: 21	INT. LOBBY
text: GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the
text: lobby. A PAIR. of local BOOKSELLERS, chatting quietly
text: behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors,
text: glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms.
scene_heading: 22	INT. CORRIDOR
text: GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor
text: begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his
text: cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes....
speaker_heading: BLACK FOR A
text: MOMENT AND THEN....
speaker_heading: SARA'S VOICE
dialog: Grady? Grady?
text: GRADY opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above
text: him. He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy
text: blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You had another one, didn't you? You have to
dialog: see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday
dialog: morning. All right?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Is the thing-is it over?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Almost. Wane to sit up?
dialog: (as he winces)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Nothing. I think I twisted my--
text: GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I have to tell you something. Something..
dialog: .hard.
text: Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Then stand up. I'm too old for all this
text: roiling around on the floor.
text: GRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Don't. I know what you're going to say.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No, really, Sara, I don't think you--
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You love Emily. I know that. And you need to
dialog: stay with her.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't think I really have a choice in, that.
dialog: Emily left me.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: She'll come back. That's why I'm going to.
dialog: ..to not have this baby.
text: GRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette
text: to her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Not have it.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think
dialog: there's no way?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well, no, I don't see any way.
dialog: (taking her hand)
dialog: And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose
dialog: this chance.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (jerking away)
dialog: No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do.
dialog: And fuck you for "saying. . .
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: ...for saying there's just no way. Because
dialog: there could be a way, Grady.
text: Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (composing herself)
dialog: He must be finishing. We should go.
text: GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his
text: coat. As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS
text: to the floor.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Who's gun is that?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
text: Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.
speaker_heading: SARA
text: Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Caps.
text: She points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Pow.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You got me.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I love you, Grady.
text: GRADY places his fingers gently over Sara's... and
text: removes the gun from her hand.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I love you, too.
scene_heading: 23	INT. LOBBY
text: The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges,
text: arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Woah! The doors made so much noise!
text: As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry
dialog: me out.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Is he ail right?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
text: He's fine. He's narrating.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: We're going to the men's room. Only we might
dialog: not make it in time.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you
dialog: to make that mistake, wait here.
text: As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the
text: lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: I need a ride.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm your man.
scene_heading: 24	EXT. STREET 24
text: As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK
text: stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: There's an explanation.
text: MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in,
text: unzips her suitcase.
scene_heading: 25	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING
text: As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top
text: button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered
text: COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the
text: glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL
text: POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the
dialog: poor thing?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James is. ..I don't know...
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets
dialog: done with him, he's going to be even more
dialog: disturbed.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm not sure that's possible.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Sure it is.
text: GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Listen, Antonia--
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Tony. Now that I'm home.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so
dialog: well for you tonight. With Terry.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: Forget it. I should've known better. Your
dialog: friend is just, I don't know, into collecting
dialog: weird tricks. Mind?
text: Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: He's writing his name in water.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Like most editors, he really wants to be a
text: writer, but he's too busy living a novel to
dialog: bother writing one.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the
text: feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
text: Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: You mean because his career's ruined and all?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Jesus. Is that what he told you?
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: He said he hasn't had a success in ten years
dialog: and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of
dialog: .a. . .
text: As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse
text: of his own swollen eyes.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: ...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good
dialog: that he'll be able to keep his job.
text: Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: Turn here.
scene_heading: 26	EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE
text: GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front
text: lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a
text: little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese
dialog: beetle trap.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
text: It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
text: The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN
text: squints through the screen door.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: There's Pop.
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Let me see it. The gun.
text: GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony
text: smirks.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
text: Figures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis
dialog: would carry. In a little beaded purse?
text: GRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the
text: front screen door. Pop is still there.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue
dialog: James Leer.
text: MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and
text: peers in at Grady.
speaker_heading: MISS SLOVIAK
dialog: You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think
dialog: about going home. You look like you need a
dialog: little rescuing yourself.
scene_heading: 27	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB
text: GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS
text: stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron
text: in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then
text: slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.
scene_heading: 27A	EXT. ENTRANCE - HI-HAT CLUB
text: As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a
text: perfunctory pat-down.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: (kidding him)
dialog: Clean tonight, hub, Professor?
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: As a whistle.
scene_heading: 28	INT. HI-HAT CLUB
text: Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY
text: enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons
text: with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her
text: glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated
text: shrug and she points.
text: CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James
text: slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the
text: general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath
text: the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap.
text: Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing
text: WAITRESS.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: Double Dickel on the rocks.
scene_heading: 29	INT. BOOTH
text: As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately
text: and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Is that just beer?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a
dialog: little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You
dialog: missed a few bottles, by the way.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm sure. Where is everyone?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to
text: go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
text: GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's
text: copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts
text: back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Jesus. He's out.
text: CRABTREE glances over, nods.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: He has a book.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I know. He started it Fall semester.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: He finished it Winter Break.
text: GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise. He
text: glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: So. Is he any good?
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: No. Not yet he isn't.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one o£
dialog: my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure
dialog: if he's-
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: He is. Take my word for it.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I think it's more complicated than that.
dialog: Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost
dialog: ...did something stupid tonight. At least, I
dialog: think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual
text: confusion thrown into the stew right now.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (ducking in)
dialog: Double Dickel.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Thanks.
text: GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes
text: she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear
text: beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah
text: Green's slinky form seizes his attention.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Shut up and drink.
text: CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?
text: GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but
dialog: it's not Oola CRABTREE
text: is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: President of the James Brown Hair Club For
dialog: Men.
text: Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with
text: big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most
text: noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (initiating an old game)
text: He's a boxer. A flyweight.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis..
dialog: .Curtis Hardapple.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Not Curtis.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
text: Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are
text: from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and
dialog: got trampled.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: And now he's addicted to painkillers.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
text: He can't piss standing up anymore.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: He lives with his mother.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: And he had a younger brother who . . .was . .
dialog: . a. . .
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames
dialog: Vernon for his death.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: (stumped)
dialog: Because. . .because. . .
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (sleepily)
dialog: .. .he was killed, when a gangster named
text: Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite
text: horse. He took the bullet himself.
text: GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens
text: one bloodshot eye to regard them.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.
text: James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: That was good.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He heard everything we were saying.
text: Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me.
scene_heading: 30	INT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER 30
text: GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the
text: jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a
text: sexy, measured blues.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's
dialog: so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail
dialog: your sentences always existed, just waiting
dialog: around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to
dialog: fetch them down.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I thank you.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: And I love the inscription you wrote to me.
dialog: Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy
dialog: innocents we can get.
text: GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say
text: something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair
text: from James Leer's forehead.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: So what are you going to do?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Do?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to
dialog: be there when you get home.
text: GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then
text: catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The
text: tile that would reflect his head is missing.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Are you holding me up or am I dragging you
dialog: down?
text: Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Shush.
scene_heading: 31	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM)
text: Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to
text: Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make
dialog: sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: I would if I knew where I was taking him.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hannah, are you telling me you don't know
dialog: where James Leer lives?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That strikes me as odd.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: James is odd. I know he has an aunt in
dialog: Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once,
dialog: but...
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's
dialog: house. He said she worked there. Or something.
dialog: I don't remember.
text: James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: What's he saying?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's
dialog: always carrying around. He must've left it
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
text: GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
text: and Q huddle inside.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the
dialog: auditorium.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (delirious, but insistent)
scene_heading: Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!
text: GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: All right. Take him to my place. He can crash
text: on the sofa.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: The one in your office? It's the best one .for
dialog: naps.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We
dialog: could probably stand him up in the garage with
text: the snow shovels at this point.
text: As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls
text: into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Ail right. In my office.
text: As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.
text: GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and
text: drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has
text: his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.
dialog: Vernon Hardapple.
speaker_heading: VERNON HARDAPPLE
dialog: You driving this car?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: VERNON HARDAPPLE
dialog: This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving
dialog: this car?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's mine.
speaker_heading: VERNON HARDAPPLE
dialog: Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You must be mistaken.
speaker_heading: VERNON HARDAPPLE
dialog: Bullshit.
text: GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Go home to your mother, Vernon.
scene_heading: 32	INT. GALAXIE
text: GRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and
text: starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees
text: CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: All right, what's the matter?
text: CRABTREE just keeps smiling.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do?
text: The kid's practically in a coma.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Tripp.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Hit your brakes.
text: GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a
text: SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break
text: pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield.
dialog: Q
dialog: (squinting)
dialog: Oh my God! What is that?
text: It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the
text: beams of light.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: What's this guy's problem?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Just go around him.
text: GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances
text: back in front of Grady's grille.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Back up. Go out the other way.
text: GRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then
text: turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind
text: the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches
text: in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high
text: wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.
text: As GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Now what?
dialog: Q
dialog: (mischievously)
dialog: You could always go over him.
text: Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his
text: heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto
text: the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides
text: smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the
dialog: night.
dialog: Q
dialog: What just happened?
text: GRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I just had my car jumped on.
scene_heading: 33	EXT. THAW HAIL - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER)
text: Grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Wait here. I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Where would we go?
scene_heading: 34	INT. LOBBY
text: The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging
text: the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky
text: FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps
text: his hand against the glass.
speaker_heading: JANITOR
text: It's open.
text: GRADY pushes on the door and it opens.
speaker_heading: JANITOR (cont'd)
dialog: Hey, Professor Tripp.
dialog: (off Grady's look)
dialog: Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year.
dialog: Then I dropped out of school.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I hope it wasn't my fault.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: (taking him seriously)
dialog: No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh.. .yeah.
scene_heading: 35	INT. AUDITORIUM
text: The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding
text: chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: I saw the manuscript inside. So when you
dialog: showed up, I figured. . .
text: GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title
text: page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and
text: then, halfway down, TEXT.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: Is it good?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: I don't know. It might be...
speaker_heading: 36 CUT
scene_heading: 37	EXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER
text: GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and,
text: hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops.
text: Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone.
scene_heading: 38	INT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT
text: Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the
dialog: original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The
text: backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true
dialog: about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on
dialog: his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last
dialog: longer?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: Well, jeez, you're reading his biography,
dialog: aren't you?
text: Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on
text: the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S
text: PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub
dialog: ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground
dialog: lamb.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: Sick.
scene_heading: 39	EXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
text: Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street
text: from the Gaskell's house.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your
dialog: wife?
text: GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No, my wife's out of town.
text: Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom,
text: then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway.
text: Walter appears on the front steps.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER (cont'd)
dialog: Who's that guy?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Her husband.
text: Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: What exactly are we doing here, Professor
dialog: Tripp?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (staring at Sara)
text: Taking the long way home.
scene_heading: 39A	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER
text: As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James
text: Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above
text: the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with
text: only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He
text: takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.
scene_heading: 40	INT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE
text: GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.
scene_heading: 41	INT. LIVING ROOM
text: The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes
text: of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he
text: finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-
text: shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling
text: hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet
text: Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but
text: his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He
text: steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his
text: disappointment--only the red cowboy boots.
text: He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.
scene_heading: 42	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE
text: James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old
text: sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James'
text: knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects
text: his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.
text: Something yellow. Something soft.
text: GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing
text: a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET
text: from James Leer's ratty green knapsack.
text: GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking
text: very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the
text: light on the both of them.
scene_heading: 43	EXT. FRONT PORCH - SATURDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY)
text: GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and
text: plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch
text: step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it,
text: then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.
scene_heading: 44	INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: As CRABTREE SNORES thunderously, GRADY eases open the
text: door, spots the CAR KEYS on the dresser, grabs them.
scene_heading: 44A	INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS
text: GRADY eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops,
text: his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from
text: Crabtree's room.
scene_heading: 44B	INT. EMILY'S OFFICE
text: GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers,
text: lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and
text: well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of
text: Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER,
text: pads and pens neatly arranged alongside.
text: A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate
text: mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS,
text: framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's
text: DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's
dialog: Daughter.
text: There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck
text: with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing
text: Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR of
text: YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan.
text: Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.
scene_heading: 45	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE
text: GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the
text: sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (without waking)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You're welcome.
text: GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee
text: from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center
text: of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a
text: clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual
text: precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP
text: that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.
dialog: All net.
text: A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without
speaker_heading: further ceremony, GRADY
text: turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC
text: and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:
dialog: (beat) 2611
dialog: In other words: Page 2611.
text: CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS,
text: the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that
text: grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James I
text: GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's
text: quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I put you on the floor.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow
dialog: your tongue or something.
dialog: (nodding to Grady's robe)
dialog: I guess you really miss her, huh?
text: GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets
text: of the robe, its overall fuzziness.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I guess there's probably a story behind that.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: There is, but it's not that interesting.
text: James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the
scene_heading: TELEPHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Want me to get that?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Sure.
text: As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises
text: delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to
text: see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (returning)
dialog: He didn't give his name.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: The guy on the phone.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here
text: and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500
text: with black interior.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: What'd you tell him?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be
text: sure to mention the back door pops open with a
text: couple hard shakes to the right.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or
dialog: something. Is that single-spaced?
text: James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on
text: Grady's desk.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Afraid so.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: That's a big book you're writing.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I think it's sort of writing itself at this
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Wow, Hannah always swore you were working,
dialog: but--
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: But . . . ?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been
dialog: awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some
dialog: people--some of the kids in workshop--thought
dialog: maybe you were...
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Washed up?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Blocked.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
text: James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: No kidding.
text: A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch
text: Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers,
text: materialize in the hallway.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Good morning, boys. James.
text: James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (re: James' "attire")
dialog: If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast,
dialog: I'd put on something a little less comfortable
dialog: if I were you.
text: As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the
text: page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare
text: into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE
text: seems to have made him suddenly queasy.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Professor Tripp?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hm.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: How did I get here last night?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No one seems to know where you live, James.
dialog: Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: And ...and before that. Did I do anything?
dialog: Anything bad?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the
dialog: English Department's dog and steal his most
text: prized piece of memorabilia.
text: As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY
text: looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now
text: parked at the bottom of his driveway.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.
scene_heading: 46	EXT. FRONT PORCH
text: A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the
speaker_heading: door opens, GRADY
text: appears.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK
dialog: Good morning...
dialog: (eyeing Grady's robe)
dialog: Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but
dialog: I understand you attended an event at Sara and
dialog: Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one
dialog: of the last to leave...
scene_heading: 47	INT. LANDING - SAME TIME 47
text: James lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the
text: sleeping bag, straining to hear.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)
dialog: ...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone.
dialog: Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of
dialog: place. Suspicious maybe...
scene_heading: 48	EXT. FRONT PORCH
text: GRADY is scratching his head in mock thought.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well, there's always people you don't know at
dialog: these things, but I can't say there was anybody
dialog: particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one
dialog: guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK
dialog: A jockey? You mean, like--
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Horses, right. Vernon something...
dialog: (thinking... )
dialog: Hardpple
text: Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK
dialog: Hardapple?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK
dialog: Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&amp;E on Dr. Gaskell's
text: closet. And the dog's missing.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That's weird.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK
dialog: We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's
dialog: blind and we figure he just wandered off and
dialog: got run over.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: The perpetrator.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK
dialog: No, the dog.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Just kidding.
text: Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing
dialog: With Assholes."
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK
dialog: One other thing. About this kid, this student
dialog: of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know
dialog: how I could get in touch with him, would you?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I might have his number on campus.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PUPCIK
dialog: That's all right. We'll find him.
text: Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and
text: turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN (O.S.)
dialog: There you are...
text: GRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across
text: the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy-
text: eyed and delectable.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh. Well. I...
text: Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up
text: her thighs.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.
text: GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes
text: through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is
text: heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down
text: the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik
text: drive away in his big police car.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: What do we do now?
text: #####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him
speaker_heading: #####RINGS.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: SARA'S VOICE
dialog: Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You
dialog: won't believe what's happened.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Could you hold on a minute, honey?
text: With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever-
text: so- gently ...hang up the phone.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: How 'bout we get the hell out of here?
scene_heading: 49	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)
text: James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath
text: his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack
text: swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of
speaker_heading: KEYS.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You start her up.
text: As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice
text: blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the
text: keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides
text: behind the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (as the engine roars)
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well done, James.
text: As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the
text: wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: Shit!
text: James blinks, pokes his head out the window.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.
scene_heading: 50	INT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)
text: GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a
scene_heading: neighborhood MARKET. GRADY
text: has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering
text: his ragged thumb.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Where exactly do you live, James?
text: James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of
text: ORANGE JUICE, stops.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as
dialog: to the location of your apartment.
text: GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic
text: hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked
dialog: out. I was asked to leave.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I guess there's probably a story behind that.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: There is, but it's not that interesting.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: So where have you been staying?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (a long pause)
dialog: The bus station.
text: GRADY stares incredulously at James.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor.
dialog: And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (trying to fathom this)
dialog: But James. I mean. ..How long?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had
dialog: the gun. For protection.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't know...
dialog: (unconvincingly)
dialog: Me.
text: GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and,
text: abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling
text: on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is
text: staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST
scene_heading: PAPERBACK. GRADY
text: frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a
text: spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.
text: A thought evolves.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: (the balloons)
dialog: What do you think of these?
text: James takes another chug from his jug, nods.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Nice.
scene_heading: 51	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING
text: Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared
text: ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in
text: front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.
scene_heading: 52	INT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS
text: GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches
text: something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James
text: glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the
text: glovebox, then peers at the house.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (the house)
dialog: Isn't this...?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hm.
text: GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange
text: juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You better ease off that stuff, James. It's
dialog: pretty acidic.
text: James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat,
text: studies it curiously.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I can't help myself. I don't know what's the
dialog: matter with me.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you
dialog: think's the matter with you?
text: As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers
text: the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets
text: the donut in precisely the same place.
scene_heading: 53	INT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER
text: Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the
text: balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the
text: balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.
speaker_heading: SARA O.S.)
dialog: Feeling guilty?
text: GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized
text: behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.
speaker_heading: SARA (cont'd)
dialog: I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this
dialog: morning. Can you talk?
text: Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for
dialog: WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole
dialog: Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I-heard.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: You heard? How?
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house
dialog: this morning.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Did you confess?
text: GRADY looks up, mildly alarmed.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Really? That was fast.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: I'm kidding. Hello?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There
dialog: is something I need to tell...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Are you limping? Why are you limping?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to .
dialog: . .
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall
dialog: somewhere?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I
dialog: don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell
dialog: you something.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: All right.
text: Sara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I...
text: As GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: ...want to be with you.
text: Sara looks at him.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I
text: don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Really, Sara, I...
text: Sara holds up one gloved hand.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I believe you. I believe you want to be with
dialog: me. But this is not just about me anymore.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I know that. I know what's at stake here...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: No, I don't think you do. And besides... I
dialog: haven't decided yet.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: About the baby.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: That ...and you.
text: GRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop
text: them on a table.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm not going to draw the map for you on this
dialog: one, Grady. Times like these you have to do
dialog: your own navigating.
text: Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Who's that sitting in your car?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James Leer.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: What's he doing out there?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm sort of helping him work through some
dialog: issues.
text: Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Isn't he lucky.
text: GRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the
text: house, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers
text: a limp hand in return, but it's too late.
text: She's already gone.
scene_heading: 54	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - LATER 54
text: GRADY cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw, while James
text: sits stiffly, the orange juice jug bobbing between his
dialog: thighs.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: She seemed to take it pretty well.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yeah, well, actually. . .
text: James looks over.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: The moment didn't really present itself.
text: James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window,
text: staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. GRADY
text: glances at him. At the orange juice jug.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: You' re not planning on puking in my car, are
dialog: you, James?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley
dialog: Heights. We could find you a nice golf course
dialog: to barf on.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: No.
text: GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James
text: blinks, looks embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER (cont'd)
dialog: I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...
text: James peers out the window at passing landscape.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER (cont'd)
dialog: I've got a thing about, ..places like this. I
dialog: know what those houses are like. I know what
dialog: the people are like.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Your aunt ?
text: James turns, eyes flashing with surprise.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: Hannah mentioned something about an aunt.
text: James nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes
text: a JOINT between his fingers, sniffs it.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Humboldt County?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Maybe...
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Glaucoma?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Colon cancer.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Jesus, James. Wow.
text: James puts the joint back in the ashtray.
speaker_heading: JAMES' LEER
dialog: It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a
dialog: small town.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Where's that?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Carvel.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Carvel? Where's Carvel?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: Outside Scranton.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I never heard of it.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin
dialog: factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn.
text: She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before
dialog: that, she'd been a dancer.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: What kind of dancer? .
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (in disbelief)
dialog: James Leer, are you telling me your mother was
dialog: a stripper?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle.
dialog: And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's
dialog: clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a
dialog: bad debt.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: When we fall, we fall hard.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Amazing.
text: GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then
text: notices-with surprise--James has his hand out.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: I thought you were the guy who didn't like to
text: lose control of his emotions.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Maybe I just needed the moment to present
dialog: itself.
scene_heading: 55	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER)
text: GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a
text: modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the
text: JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy
dialog: would live. What's it called again?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Kinship.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Kinship. And what's here?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Unless I miss my bet...my wife.
text: James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: The one that left you?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That's right. That one.
scene_heading: 56	EXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE
text: GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against
text: the glass of the living room window, squints inside.
text: Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the
text: hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's
text: sitting in the indentation.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: How can you tell?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: You can see the outline of a butt.
text: As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER (cont'd)
dialog: Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you
text: can start on the box.
scene_heading: 58	EXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER)
text: As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Maybe she didn't come here.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: She came here. We'll just wait. In the
dialog: meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
text: James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since
dialog: she was twelve years old. And your hips are as
text: slim as hers.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you
text: know-of what's in the car. In the trunk.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (a pang of guilt himself)
dialog: Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about
dialog: that.
text: James takes another sad glance at the little door, then
text: drops onto ail fours.
scene_heading: 59	INT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it
text: speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that
text: people will gather together, light a fire, talk.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It feels really... good. ..here.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I know. It's the house you want to wake up in

text: Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a

text: of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a
text: PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.
text: One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and

scene_heading: 61	INT. DEN

dialog: just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you
dialog: to-find someone who knows what they're doing.
dialog: Here. Put your foot up.
text: GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a
text: BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back
text: cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look
text: consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author
dialog: is himself.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: So he's one of your students, this boy?
text: GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene
text: sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James
text: is looking out the window, a curious expression on his
text: face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland
text: sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances
text: back into the living room, he and James make brief eye
text: contact, then blink, look away.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll
dialog: be fine.

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: What made you pull out that old thing?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: I was thinking of you.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Maybe I should read it.
speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot
dialog: of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I
dialog: have the book to finish and--
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Ah, right. The book.
text: GRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something
text: in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks
text: away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James
text: again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I
dialog: didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want
dialog: you to know that.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Why did you come here, Grady?
text: GRADY gestures vaguely.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily.
dialog: And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let
dialog: everyone know that, even though it may be
dialog: difficult to comprehend now, this-everything
dialog: that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't
dialog: mean "Goodbye."

dialog: Give me a break, Grady.

text: against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting
dialog: out any heat.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm having a really good time, Professor
dialog: Tripp.
text: GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a
dialog: favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's
dialog: not for amateurs.
text: James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat
speaker_heading: LEVER.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I just wanted a little sip.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (squinting at him)
dialog: I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James,
dialog: exactly what point was it that you turned into
dialog: Serpent Boy?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Probably about the time you gave me the
dialog: codeine pills last night.
text: GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose
text: face bears not the slightest trace of irony.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: (thinking, then. . . )
dialog: Look, James, you appear to possess-like many
dialog: an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a
dialog: rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which
dialog: dreams are made. However, I 'think it's best
dialog: if, for the moment at least
dialog: (taking the Ziploc)
dialog: ...we abstain.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You're mad at me, aren't you?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's--
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: Who said anything about girlfriend?
text: James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you
dialog: kidding?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my
dialog: girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't
dialog: exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no
text: reason for him to take two in the chest. Still,
dialog: the fact remains that I'm the one who took you
dialog: up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one
dialog: who has to take the blame. I- don't know what
dialog: the hell I was thinking.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap
dialog: gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking
dialog: 'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he
dialog: might never get on the bus again.' You were
dialog: thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract
dialog: this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a
dialog: noble act.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never
dialog: done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever.
text: James looks -out the window, pondering this.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: So, why did you take me up there?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (feeling for the heat again)
dialog: I -don' t know, James . I don' t know why I do
dialog: half the things I do. Who does?
dialog: (looking over)
dialog: Why do you wear that coat?
text: James looks down, a little defensive.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: It's warm.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James, fall semester, first day of class, it
dialog: was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
text: James just blinks, no ready answer-available.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That's why they all give you such a hard time
dialog: in workshop.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Because of my coat?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Because you act like a goddamn spook all the
dialog: time. Not to mention the fact that every last
dialog: one of them is jealous of you.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (smirking)
dialog: Jealous? Of me?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Not you. Your talent.
text: James' face hardens. He looks away.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You're lying.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: The hell I am.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You
dialog: said so yourself.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I never said that.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Yes you did. Last night. To your friend
dialog: Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you
dialog: said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I didn't mean it that way.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard,
dialog: the others--they 're right. My stories are
text: annoying. They go on and on and on, and the
dialog: longer they go on the more annoying they
dialog: become, until finally you just want to grab
dialog: something heavy and--
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and
dialog: Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking
dialog: about, okay? The entire class combined-
dialog: including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one
dialog: tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
text: James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the
text: window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in
text: them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: But, last night...
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I
dialog: was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a
dialog: dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me
dialog: some slack?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares
dialog: what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a
dialog: good writer? You want to be-a great writer?
dialog: Then stop giving a damn what other people
dialog: think. Most of them haven't thought in .years.
text: James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the
text: first headlights of the evening.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books
dialog: don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
text: GRADY smiles contemptuously.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I mean it. It means something to me. It's one
dialog: of the reasons I came to school here. To be in
dialog: your class. To be taught by you.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a
dialog: writer.
text: GRADY stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away

speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You coming?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: In a minute. Get us a table.
text: James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee
text: shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a
text: table with a view of the highway. GRADY
text: watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into
text: the booth and open his big, laminated menu.
text: Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY

speaker_heading: GRADY

dialog: sure. It's outside Scranton.
text: GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by
text: himself on the far side of the coffee shop.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at
dialog: this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a
dialog: resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd
dialog: be pretty interested to learn that the good

speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: Never mind. My mistake.
scene_heading: 74	EXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT 74
text: GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An
text: AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of
text: CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows
text: peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch.
text: He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice:
text: James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it
dialog: says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE
dialog: NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the

scene_heading: 75	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)
text: The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as
text: he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE
text: PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars
text: that whip by on the highway beyond the window.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Want a bite?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: That's why you're having them. Your spells.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like
dialog: we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't
dialog: have spells.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: What would you call them then?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't know. ...'Episodes.'
text: James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's because you don't eat.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I eat.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: When nobody's looking.
text: GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (mouth full, garbled)
dialog: I just worry about you, that's all.
text: ...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks
text: at him.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Okay.
text: Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against
text: the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking
text: lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER (cont'd)
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
text: GRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and
text: his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.
scene_heading: 76	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL
text: As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER
text: MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming

speaker_heading: GRADY

dialog: Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening.
speaker_heading: FRED LEER
dialog: Hardly.
speaker_heading: AMANDA LEER
dialog: We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck
dialog: would have it, the club was on the way, so...
dialog: (snapping shut the visor)
dialog: We were able to put in an appearance.
speaker_heading: FRED LEER
dialog: Otherwise we would've been here earlier.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a
dialog: little dinner.
speaker_heading: FRED LEER
dialog: Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might
dialog: be good for James to be with his family this

speaker_heading: FRED LEER
dialog: Well, of course, we can understand that.
text: GRADY considers the two glittering ghosts before him.
text: They seem to be waiting. Just waiting.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well. Let me go get him.
text: GRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: I "hope you won't consider this forward of me,
dialog: Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you

speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm not going with them..
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James. Listen. Things-things are a little
dialog: weird with me right now and I-- well--I have
dialog: enough blame to shoulder these days without
dialog: having to take the blame if something bad
dialog: happened to you. And if you hang around me long
dialog: enough, something bad is going to happen, trust
dialog: me. That's why I need you to go home.
dialog: Understand?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm not going, with them.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James, like it or not, they're your parents.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Parents? They're not my parents. They're my
dialog: grandparents. My parents are dead.
text: GRADY stares at-James wearily.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I swear. My father had his own airplane he
dialog: used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and
dialog: my mom were flying up to our house in the
dialog: Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in
dialog: the newspaper.
text: GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I 'swear. My father was a senior vice
dialog: president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite.
dialog: Her maiden name was Guggenheim.
text: GRADY starts to protest, then pauses.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I remember that. Five or six years ago.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
text: Six. Their plane went down right outside
dialog: Scranton.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (sardonically)
dialog: Near Carvel?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like
dialog: to talk about my family. They treat me like a
dialog: freak.
dialog: (nodding towards Amanda)
dialog: She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's
dialog: mine. My parents left it to me.
text: GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the
text: contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: James, come on. That man is obviously your
dialog: father. You look just like him.
text: James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and
text: speaks in a voice heavy with implication.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: There's a reason for that.
text: Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little
text: riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Get out of here.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: That's why she hates me. That's why she makes
dialog: me sleep in the basement.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: In the crawl space, with the rats and the
dialog: casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
text: As GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a

speaker_heading: JAMES LEER

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Take care of him.
speaker_heading: AMANDA LEER
dialog: Oh, don't worry. We'll take care of him. You
dialog: can be sure of that.
text: Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in
text: a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee
text: down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at
text: his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hey!
scene_heading: GRADY'S POV - REAR WINDOW

dialog: and-and--I suck.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it

speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would

dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GRADY

speaker_heading: GRADY/CRABTREE
dialog: James Leer.
text: GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass. A moment
text: later, James peeks out. Seeing Grady, his face brightens
text: briefly, unguarded, then quickly resumes its usual Leerian
text: aspect. He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."
scene_heading: 86	EXT. BASEMENT DOOR
text: The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in
text: a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the
text: seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Hey. What are you guys doing here?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on.
text: As they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once-

speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I like what you've done with it. When's
dialog: Captain Nemo moving in?
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: The candelabras were my Gran's.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll

speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the

dialog: believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now

speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Ah, wear whatever you want.
text: James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: So modest.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: So sensitive.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: (nosing around the room)
dialog: Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just
dialog: once I'd like to know if the little bastard is
dialog: telling the truth.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: The-truth. I know that's always been real
dialog: important to you. Key, check this out...
text: CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from
text: the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
text: Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to:
text: see him, shuffling into the room like an aging
dialog: prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.'
dialog: (with an amused smile)
dialog: Sound like anyone we know?
dialog: (resuming)
dialog: But it was later, when the great man squinted
text: into the bitter glow or twilight...
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely
dialog: needs an editor.
dialog: (resuming)
dialog: ...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it.
dialog: Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the
text: boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in
dialog: a darker place. His heart...'
text: CRABTREE stops abruptly.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yes? 'His heart...'
text: CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: 'His heart, once capable of inspiring others
dialog: so completely, could no longer inspire so much
text: as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It
dialog: beat now only because it could. '
text: GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm ready...

speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You all right, Professor Tripp?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol'
dialog: Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming
dialog: down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of,
dialog: check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call
dialog: the police or.. .something.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows
dialog: and one of your teddy bears under the spread
dialog: and she won't know the difference.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use

speaker_heading: GRADY

scene_heading: 90	INT. LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: CRABTREE

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Nothing.
text: The door closes, the LATCH CLICKS, and GRADY is left
text: alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air.
scene_heading: 92	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM
text: Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by
text: little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her,

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: GOATEE KID
dialog: I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at

dialog: well--I was pretty bent in general.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's cool, Jeff. Really.
speaker_heading: GOATEE KID

text: GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in

text: Stenciled on its side panel is:
dialog: Kravnik's Sporting Goods
text: The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past

speaker_heading: MAN (O.S. )
dialog: Hello? Hello...?
text: The VOICE is groggy. It is Walter Gaskell's voice.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE
dialog: Yes?
text: GRADY says nothing, as if wondering what he's doing.
speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)
dialog: Who's this ?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's Grady, Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GRADY

speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm in love with your wife.

speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE
dialog: Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now.

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WALTER'S VOICE
dialog: Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office

scene_heading: GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE
text: It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time.

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I tried to call, but apparently there's
dialog: something wrong...
text: Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone.
speaker_heading: SARA (cont'd)
dialog: ...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was

text: GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure
dialog: it's not good.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: SARA
text: It seems one of our students is - missing and

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (slumping to the porch)
dialog: I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you.
dialog: It's all my-
text: Sara raises her hand, silencing him.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady.
dialog: But more importantly, Walter's not very happy
text: and he's gotten the police involved. They seem
dialog: to think James Leer is somehow responsible for
dialog: all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where
dialog: James is, would you, Grady?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Inside.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: And the jacket?
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: Over there. In the backseat of the...

speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: Someone stole my car.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Grady.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it
dialog: right there last night.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Are you sure you parked it there?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty

text: Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I'll deal with this. You dig up James.
scene_heading: 98	INT. CRABTREE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (swinging in)
dialog: Is he awake?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: Nevertheless. There's a police officer
text: standing on the porch and I don't think he's
dialog: going away.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (from under the covers)
dialog: That same guy?
text: CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: You snore.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: So I hear.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: (studying Grady)
dialog: No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look
dialog: sorta crappy.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: He's right, you look horrible.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Thank you, Frankie and Annette.
text: James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks
text: bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: It's the Chancellor.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: And we both thank you for that, but we're...
dialog: we're... fine.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
text: GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Shut up, James.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: So what's the problem?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (a tad tense)
dialog: There is no problem. Did I say there was a
dialog: problem?
text: As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned
dialog: flannel, he and CRABTREE
text: exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and
dialog: excluding Grady.
speaker_heading: SARA (0. S.)
dialog: How's it coming back there, Professor Tripp?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Who do you think it is?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: The Chancellor's here? Now?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Evidently.
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Coming!
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's Walter's dog and yes, she does. Know. But
dialog: let's spare her the details. Come on, your
text: shoes are in the hail.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: James. This book of yours. It's not bad. Not
dialog: bad at all.
text: James stops, considers this piece of news with a look of
text: deep seriousness, then nods.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: You're welcome.
text: As James shuffles off into the hail, CRABTREE looks at
text: Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I want to publish this. I've got to. I think
dialog: they'll let me. With a little editorial
dialog: guidance it could be brilliant.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out
dialog: there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been

text: GRADY nods, leans in the window to James.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you.
dialog: Professor Tripp?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm a little worried, James.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I
dialog: probably should be expelled.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well, let's see if we can keep that from
dialog: happening.
text: James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Professor Tripp...?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yes, James.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER
dialog: Even if I end up going to jail....
text: James smiles his crooked grin.
speaker_heading: JAMES LEER (cont'd)
dialog: You're still the best teacher I ever had.
text: On this, Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing
text: on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in
text: the rear window of the police car, growing smaller.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: This is not what the university has in mind
dialog: when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Would Walter really press charges?
speaker_heading: SARA
text: It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs
dialog: pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit
dialog: prickly this morning.
text: Grady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches
text: her take a drag on her cigarette.
speaker_heading: SARA (cont'd)
dialog: You didn't happen to call the house last
dialog: night, did you, Grady?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I think I might have.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: And what do you think you might have said?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I think I might've said I was in love with
dialog: you.
text: Sara's face remains .unchanged.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: He told you.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: He told me.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: And what did you say?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I said it didn't sound like you.
text: Sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her

text: turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt
text: which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: So- what do we do now? ,
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Find the jacket.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her

text: Jeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily.
speaker_heading: GOATEE KID
dialog: I'll be ...somewhere else.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in

text: Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He cribbed that from Borges.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: It beats 'What's your major?'
text: GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could
dialog: borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of
dialog: commission.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
text: Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to.
dialog: ..to your book.

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That good, hub?
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: No, it's not that, it's...
text: Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her
text: dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady.
speaker_heading: HANNAH GREEN
dialog: It's just that, you know, I was thinking about
dialog: how, in class, you're always telling us '-that
dialog: writers make choices--at least the good ones.
dialog: And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the
dialog: book isn't really great-I mean, really great-
dialog: but at times it's, well, very detailed, you
dialog: know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses
dialog: and ail the dental records and so on-and I
dialog: don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of
dialog: reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...
dialog: (with trepidation)
dialog: ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was
dialog: wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you
dialog: wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (stung)
dialog: Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as
dialog: shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first
dialog: writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore,
dialog: it might interest you to know that one book I
dialog: wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, '
dialog: happened to win a little something called the
dialog: PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under
dialog: the influence. '

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't

speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: So whose car is it?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: My guess-Vernon Hardapple.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: The hood jumper?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He said a few things that lead me to believe

speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Such as.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: 'That's my car, motherfucker.'
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car.

dialog: I know you. . .
text: Marilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's
text: something wrong with it. This girl's eyes are brown and
dialog: besides, she's ...fat.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (cont'd)
text: Double Dickel on the rocks.
text: The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds-
text: standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn
text: Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from
dialog: the Hi-Hat Club.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oola.
speaker_heading: OOLA
dialog: I never forget a drink.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I never forget an Oola.
text: Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Forget me?
text: GRADY starts to turn, but his head won't move: largely
text: because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his
text: temple. Grady's eyes slide.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Vernon.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: (to Oola)
dialog: Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Who's got a gun?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Relax, Vernon...
speaker_heading: OOLA
dialog: Why's he calling you Vernon?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's
dialog: why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Not true. You're the only Vernon I know.
dialog: Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon
dialog: Peabody at Penguin U.K.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (to Oola)
dialog: Cupcake. Please. Inside.
speaker_heading: OOLA
dialog: You' re not going to shoot him, are you?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that
dialog: gun down.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the
dialog: caps anymore.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And
dialog: that's a gun.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No, really....
text: GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled
text: pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead.
scene_heading: 107	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT
text: CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's
text: arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Holy shit.
scene_heading: 108	EXT. KRAVNIKS
text: Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Are you crazy!
text: The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares
text: at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand.
speaker_heading: VERNON (cont'd)
dialog: Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you
dialog: see the condition my girl's in?
text: As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on
text: Oola's tummy.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You all right, cupcake?
speaker_heading: OOLA
dialog: Who's Vernon?
text: A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching
text: asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah
text: Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What the...?
text: Gears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails
text: wildly, then kicks open the passenger door.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Tripp! Run!
text: GRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as
text: CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then
text: turns back for another pass.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Who the hell is that?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon
text: girl's clutch.
text: The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree--
text: swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken
text: flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady,
dialog: Vernon, and Oola.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Woah.
text: Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine.
speaker_heading: VERNON (cont'd)
dialog: Pull off, you crazy motherfucker!
text: Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and
text: the oncoming Crabtree.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver.
text: CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the
text: passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a
text: FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky.
dialog: Only, these ain't birds.  - ^
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Oh... my... God!
dialog: These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages.
text: CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and
text: smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI
text: painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS.
text: As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free
text: of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail
text: the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the
dialog: Ohio River.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: (to Vernon)
dialog: I take it back. Shoot him.
scene_heading: 109	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING
text: Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE
text: puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly
text: with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED
text: PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Naturally you have copies.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I have an alternate version of the first
dialog: chapter.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle,
dialog: when he lost his luggage.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That was MacCaulay.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those
dialog: stories.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He was never able to reproduce them.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to
dialog: depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a
dialog: sense- this--
dialog: (nodding to the pages)
dialog: is for the best.
text: Grady's eyes shift, study Crabtree.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Kind of a sign, you're saying.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: In a sense.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't think so. In my experience, signs are
dialog: usually a lot more subtle.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Let me get this straight. All that paper that
dialog: went into the river. That was the only copy?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: 'Fraid so.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: (glowering at Crabtree)
dialog: And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What
dialog: the fuck's the matter with you?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I'm just saying that sometimes,
text: subconsciously, a person will put themselves in
dialog: a situation-perhaps even create that situation-
dialog: in order to have an arena in which to work out
dialog: an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you
dialog: will, of addressing a problem.
text: Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if he's from another planet.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I'll tell you the problem. You behind the
dialog: wheel. There's your fucking problem.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights
text: in the middle of the street none of this
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun
dialog: to his head?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: He was trying to steal my car!
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Ail right, all right It's done. There's no
dialog: need to talk about it. It's done.
text: They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns,
speaker_heading: glances at GRADY
text: and his little sheaf of pages.
speaker_heading: OOLA
dialog: So what was it about?
dialog: (as GRADY looks up)
dialog: Your book. What was the story?
text: GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't know...
text: Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend,
text: genuine compassion in his eyes.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: What he means is, it's difficult to distill
dialog: the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in
dialog: the mind.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about,
dialog: right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was
dialog: about, why were you writing it?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I couldn't stop.
scene_heading: 110	EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE
text: Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with
text: CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare
text: to leave in the Galaxie.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Shoot.
text: GRADY glances at little round Oola.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Boy or girl?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: As long as it looks like her, I don't care.
dialog: You know what I'm saying?
text: GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: No sweat. Only do me a favor?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Stop calling me Vernon.
text: CRABTREE leans into Grady, WHISPERS.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
speaker_heading: OOLA
dialog: Yea?
text: GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress,
text: snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had
dialog: small shoulders, like you. Most people don't
dialog: know that.
text: As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty
dialog: motherfucking ride.
text: Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into
text: Grady, and pulls away. CRABTREE stands stunned.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: You mind explaining what you just did?
text: GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping
text: NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Came to my senses. CRABTREE
dialog: Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is
dialog: James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell
dialog: to come to his?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer
dialog: to jail, Crabs. I know that.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Do you know he won't expel him?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No. But I don't think that matters.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: That's very enlightened, Professor. It's
dialog: comforting to know that America's children have
dialog: you for a teacher.
text: GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the
text: buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell
dialog: them what you know. You tell them to find their
dialog: voice and stick with it, because that's all you
dialog: have in the end. You tell the ones who have it
dialog: to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't
dialog: to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way
dialog: to get where you're going.
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: Of course, it helps if you know where you want
dialog: to go.
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--
dialog: that's made the last seven years worthwhile.
text: GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles
text: cryptically as he considers it. -
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...
text: Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: He's got you.
text: CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands,
text: watches GRADY walk away.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Me? What can I do?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Gee, I don't know, Crabs...
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: Improvise. You're good at that.
text: GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as
text: he walks toward the buildings in the distance.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I'm sorry, Tripp.
text: GRADY stops, turns.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You peeked, didn't you?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I peeked.
text: GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter
dialog: anymore
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a
dialog: lot to admire. I've ...never read anything
dialog: quite like it.
dialog: If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit,
dialog: Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place,
dialog: and show. And GRADY knows it.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You're not just trying to make me feel better?
text: CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Scout's honor.
text: CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are
text: acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well, thanks for that, Crabs.
scene_heading: 111	INT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT
text: Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the
text: stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.
scene_heading: 112	INT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks.
text: He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two
text: afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill
text: breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the
text: barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-.
text: turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his
text: pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his
text: manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half
text: length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner
text: down into a triangle along the first crease...
scene_heading: 113	EXT. QUAD
text: A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER
text: AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring
text: then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.
scene_heading: 114	INT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER
text: GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the
text: auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies
text: Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Sara!
text: Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles
text: forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.
dialog: Q
dialog: Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look
dialog: at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's
dialog: a description of a bald cypress that left' me
text: breathless.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (pushing past him)
dialog: Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank
dialog: teller's breasts in your last one.
scene_heading: 115	INT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL
text: GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way
text: behind the back row, scanning the aisles.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICS
dialog: Hey, Professor Tripp.
text: It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop.
text: GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat-
text: next to her.
scene_heading: CARRIE MCWHIRTY
dialog: If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the
dialog: aisle.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: No...
text: But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the
text: aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming.
text: The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.
scene_heading: CARRIE MCWHIRTY
dialog: Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to
dialog: be in workshop?
speaker_heading: GRADY
text: Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango
dialog: dancers.
scene_heading: 116	INT. MAIN STAGE
text: Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And now, as those of you who've been with us
dialog: in previous years know, we have a tradition of
dialog: sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of
dialog: course, of The Plums.
text: An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as
text: Walter begins to read from a separate list.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock,
dialog: found a publisher for her children's book. The
text: Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.
scene_heading: 117	INT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^
text: As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause,
text: GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his
text: surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the
text: front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily
text: complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing
text: CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for
dialog: his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has
dialog: found a home with Putnam for his new Three
text: Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.
text: A SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE
text: takes a shift in tone.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Now, this next one, I think, is especially
dialog: exciting to announce, because it concerns a
dialog: student here at the university. Our own James
text: Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has
dialog: found a publisher for his first novel, which I
dialog: believe is called The Lovely Parade.
text: GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile
text: warmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in
text: the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned,
text: Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.
scene_heading: CARRIE MCWHIRTY
dialog: I have a class with him.
text: James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the
text: APPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.
scene_heading: CARRIE MCWHIRTY
dialog: The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know
dialog: what I mean.
text: Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups
text: Hi his hands around his mouth.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Take a bow, James!
text: James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish
text: grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and
text: takes his first sweet public bow.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Wonder Boy.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And finally--and perhaps not least
dialog: importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has
dialog: also decided to publish my own book--a critical
dialog: exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and
dialog: Joe DiMaggio and its function in American
dialog: mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled
dialog: The Last American Marriage. "
text: Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically,
text: watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.
dialog: . :
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Until next year. Thank you, everyone.
text: The LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE
text: shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah
text: Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms
dialog: around James.
text: GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when
text: suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says
text: something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door.
text: GRADY blinks, scrambles up.
scene_heading: 118	INT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: GRADY bursts into the corridor.'
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Sara!
text: Its empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL
text: DOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.
scene_heading: 119	INT. NEW CORRIDOR
text: Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He
text: moves to it, pushes past...
scene_heading: 120	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
text: ...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans
text: out over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very.
text: steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of
text: basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and
text: a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.
text: GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes
text: against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his
text: ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of-
text: marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating
text: atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The
text: SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're
text: Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.
text: It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Yo, Traxler.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Hey, Professor Tripp.
text: GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Do you get high, Sam?
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: Only when I'm working.
text: GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc. It
text: pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: Holy shit. Are you serious?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: As a heart attack.
speaker_heading: TRAXLER
dialog: Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...
text: GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy
text: now. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on
text: a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...
text: ...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON
text: caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?
text: GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Looking for you.
text: He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL
scene_heading: GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...
text: faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's
text: name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH
dialog: upward until we see that she is...
text: KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.
scene_heading: 121	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue
text: plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the
text: curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips
text: slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW
dialog: fall outside.
text: The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then
text: the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears.
text: His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I passed out.
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I've been doing that a lot lately.
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of
dialog: marijuana, I understand.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Do you think that's why I've been having
dialog: these...
dialog: (grabbing James' term)
dialog: ... spells?
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: How long have you been having them?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: The last month maybe.
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: How long have you been smoking marijuana?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: That's probably not the problem, then. What
dialog: about your lifestyle. Any major changes
dialog: recently?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I've been trying to finish a book...
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: And your wife left you.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Is that in my chart?
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: I spoke with the woman who saved your life.
dialog: You're lucky she came along when she did.
dialog: GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this
dialog: statement
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: (tapping the glucose bottle)
dialog: You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An
dialog: internist. And I think you really ought to
dialog: consider seeing a therapist, as well.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: She told you about. . .
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: Her dog, yes.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Actually, it was her husband's dog...
text: Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the
speaker_heading: first time, and GRADY
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all
dialog: right? On top of that, you have a bite on your
dialog: ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you
dialog: with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another
dialog: day or two and you might have lost the foot. As
dialog: for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result
dialog: of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: They're anxiety attacks? That's a little
dialog: disappointing.
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: Better luck next time.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: So is my friend...is Sara still here?
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: No. There's no one here.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I have to see her. As soon as possible.
text: Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in
text: his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.
speaker_heading: GREENHUT
dialog: Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave,
dialog: I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a
dialog: prescription for a course of ampicillin and I
dialog: want you to follow it to the end-no matter how
dialog: stupid you decide to be with everything else.
dialog: All right?
scene_heading: 122	INT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON
text: GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around

scene_heading: 123	EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: 126	EXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S

text: glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he
text: pulls away, but not before leaving...
text: ...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the
text: frost of the glass.
scene_heading: 127	EXT. STREET 127
text: The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the
text: street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self
text: on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and.
text: ..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little
text: pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol,
text: then looks up into the sky.
scene_heading: GRADY'S POV - of the SKY...
text: ...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters
dialog: the silence.
text: NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (as if addressing God)
dialog: Is that a suggestion?
text: GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO
text: SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen
text: DS23 appears. It passes. Slows. Stops.
text: GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts
text: himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara
text: makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but-
text: not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you
dialog: out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I'm through improvising.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true?
dialog: Did you lose it all?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I lost it ail.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: And you're old.
text: Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her
text: fingers. Yanks.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Ouch. How many?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Dozens. It's very sad.
text: Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes
text: when she looks into his, and-she glances away.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I went and looked at-some babies just now.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (trying to make her laugh)
dialog: I guess you have to go on faith.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (she doesn't)
dialog: Some times...
text: GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the
text: HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Did you tell Walter?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I told Walter.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Does he still love you?
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It didn't come up.
text: GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious
text: profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I
dialog: didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been
dialog: waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're
dialog: who I need. Because nothing makes sense without
dialog: you. Because the best moment of every day is
dialog: the moment I first see your face. And because
dialog: when you leave a room, there's no reason to be
text: in it any more. It's just a room again.
text: Sara cocks her head.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Did you just make that up?
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about
dialog: it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy
dialog: painkillers.
text: She frowns good-naturedly.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: Even so...it's still true. Every word.
text: Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.
speaker_heading: GRADY (cont'd)
dialog: Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might
dialog: tell you...
text: Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.
text: GRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: You don't deserve me, you know.
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: I know, but sometimes...
text: Sara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening.
speaker_heading: SARA (cont'd)
dialog: You just go on faith.
text: GRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too,
text: drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other
text: side of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door,
text: the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft
text: veil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are
text: lost too, nothing more than a blur.
speaker_heading: THE END
