scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - JUST BEFORE DAWN
text: Mail-clad HORSEMEN gallop headlong through the dark, bent
text: low over their saddles. A bestial scream is heard, and
text: suddenly a saddle is empty, the rider sprawled face down in
text: a pool of blood.
text: At the head of the band, COLWYN, a boy of twenty-two, raises
text: his shield to ward off an unseen assailant. We hear a
text: horrendous tearing sound, and Colwyn's father, TUROLD,
text: riding beside him, looks over at the boy. Colwyn is unharmed
text: - but his shield is deeply gouged, as if by a huge claw.
scene_heading: EXT. PARAPET OF WHITE CASTLE - DAWN
text: A GUARD sees the band of warriors emerge from the forest.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Open the gate!
scene_heading: EXT. APPROACH TO WHITE CASTLE - DAWN
text: The warriors gallop toward the main gate of the castle.
text: Though their arms and armor are reminiscent of the Middle
dialog: Ages on Earth, this is not Earth ...
speaker_heading: TWIN SUNRISE
text: Behind the riders, TWO SUNS rise above the horizon.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN GATE OF WHITE CASTLE - DAWN
text: Turold and Colwyn lead their men through the gate and
text: dismount. Waiting for them are LORD ROWAN, a man of Turold's
text: age, and an elderly COUNCILOR. Rowan notices the gouges in
text: Colwyn's shield.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (to Turold)
dialog: You were attacked in the forest?
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: Yes. We lost five.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR IN WHITE CASTLE - DAY
text: Turold and Rowan walk down the corridor, followed by Colwyn
dialog: and the Councilor.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one.
dialog: I led a hundred men to his place in
dialog: Granite Needle, but it was
text: surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it
text: by night and by day they call out
text: the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and
dialog: no one can get in.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: How many did you lose?
speaker_heading: ROWAN
text: Sixty at the needle, another thirty
dialog: in the forest. Only ten of us made
dialog: it back.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: We will have to try again. His
dialog: knowledge is great. Without it, we
dialog: cannot hope to win.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: The QUEEN is propped up in bed, eyes closed, head tilted
text: back. Her crown, a jeweled tiara, rests in her lap. She is
text: attended by two GIRLS-IN-WAITING, one of whom sponges her
text: forehead with a damp cloth. The Queen opens her eyes as the
text: elderly Councilor enters.
speaker_heading: COUNCILOR
dialog: Lord Turold and his son, my lady.
text: The Queen hands her tiara to one of the girls-in-waiting,
text: who places it on her head. Then she nods, and the Councilor
text: admits Turold and Colwyn, followed by Rowan. The three
dialog: kneel.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: He has turned out well.
text: Turold stands and looks down at Colwyn with an affectionate
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
text: Middling well.
text: Colwyn stands and we see that he is several inches taller
dialog: than his father.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: Though a touch too tall for my
dialog: taste.
text: Colwyn smiles somewhat sheepishly.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (to Colwyn)
dialog: My daughter is in the north tower.
dialog: Go to her.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: In my armor?
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: If she's to marry a warrior, she'd
dialog: best get used to it.
text: Colwyn bows his head and leaves. The three men approach the
dialog: Queen.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What news from our friends?
speaker_heading: TUROLD
text: Barak is still strong in the north,
text: and Tendo holds the high passes. But
text: the great desert forts have fallen.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Freylag's stronghold?
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: It has been taken, Freylag and all
dialog: his people slaughtered.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
text: It is only a few weeks and already
dialog: half our strong places have fallen.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
text: The attacks are unceasing: by night,
dialog: the Dark Ones; by day, those of our
dialog: people who have sold themselves to
dialog: them, those traitors who are called
dialog: the Slayers.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: It is the way of all invaders. Those
dialog: they would conquer they divide,
dialog: buying allies with promises of land
dialog: and power.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: We will hold. Their power is not
dialog: unlimited.
scene_heading: EXT. GLOOMY FOREST ROAD - DAY
text: Two mounted SLAYERS ride along the road. Their horses and
text: armor are black, as are their cylindrical, flat-topped
text: helmets, pierced with a T-slot for vision. Their weapons are
text: long-swords and maces.
text: Two more Slayers ride out of the forest and join the black
text: column. At a road up ahead wait three more, who swing in
text: behind the column as it passes.
text: Forest noises die at the Slayers' approach; the only sounds
text: we hear are the clink of metal and the heavy thud of the
text: horses' hooves.
scene_heading: INT. TOWER STAIRCASE - DAY
text: Colwyn mounts a narrow, circular staircase toward a wooden
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. TOWER ROOM - INTERCUT
text: LYSSA, the Queen's seventeen-year-old daughter, stares
text: across the circular room at the wooden door, listening to
text: Colwyn's approaching footsteps.
text: The door swings open and Colwyn enters. They stare at each
text: other for several moments: Colwyn, dusty and disheveled in
text: his armor, Lyssa freshly scrubbed and glowing in a
text: diaphanous gown.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: I'm Colwyn.
text: Lyssa nods, noncommittal. They start to circle the room,
text: eyes fixed on each other, like a pair of nervous cats.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (plaintive)
dialog: Are you Lyssa?
text: She gives him another noncommittal nod. They resume their
text: tentative circling.
text: Suddenly, Lyssa turns away, leaning on the sill of a narrow
text: window. Her shoulders begin to heave, as if she's sobbing.
text: Colwyn is in agony; he rushes across the room to her.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I don't care what arrangements were
dialog: made by our parents. You don't have
dialog: to go through with it!
text: Lyssa continues to heave.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: They can't force you. I won't let
dialog: them!
text: Lyssa turns around, and Colwyn sees that she's not sobbing,
text: but laughing.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: (trying to control her
dialog: laughter)
dialog: I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (taking considerable umbrage)
dialog: I don't have to go through with it
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
text: (still laughing, touches his
dialog: arm)
dialog: You don't understand. I'm just so
dialog: relieved. I was sure you'd turn out
text: to be short and fat and gimpy.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Oh. That.
dialog: (begins to chuckle)
dialog: I know what you mean.
dialog: (sits down on a bench)
dialog: I had nightmares all week.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: (sits down beside him)
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Last night was the worst. I dreamt
dialog: you had one leg shorter than the
dialog: other, and walked like a penguin.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked
dialog: your nose in public.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: That's worse.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: You're really not bad looking.
text: Almost handsome.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Well, you're beautiful.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: You might be handsome. I can't tell
dialog: through all that grime. Besides, you
text: reek of sweat and horses.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (pompously)
dialog: If you're going to marry a warrior,
dialog: you'd best get used to it.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: I have no intention of getting used
dialog: to it.
text: She goes over to a small cistern and fills a wooden bucket.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: Take off your clothes. I'm going to
dialog: scrub you down.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: We're almost married.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: We're not married yet.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: Well, then you can go up to the
dialog: parapet and I'll hand the buckets up
dialog: to you.
text: Colwyn looks at the stone stairs leading to the top of the
dialog: tower.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Do I have to?
text: (looks at Lyssa, sighs)
dialog: I have to.
text: He starts up the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD CROSSING - DAY
text: A column of mounted Slayers waits at the crossing for
text: another column to reach the intersection. The first column
text: falls in beside the second as it passes, forming a double
dialog: column.
text: Farther down the road waits LORD MODRED, a Slayer like the
text: others, but distinguished by the leopard embroidered on his
text: chest and by his lance, which bears a pennon affixed to its
text: head: ermine, a leopard courant sable. As the double column
text: reaches him, he wheels and leads them down the road, lance
dialog: upright.
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Turold and Rowan at the Queen's bedside.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's
dialog: godfathers. He will defend her in
dialog: the ceremony. I wish that Lord
dialog: Modred were here. He is a godfather
dialog: of her own blood.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: Modred has treated with the Dark
dialog: Ones.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: Modred! Impossible!
speaker_heading: TUROLD
text: He leads a group of Slayers, under
text: the leopard banner.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: For some, the lure of power is
dialog: stronger than the ties of blood. No
dialog: matter. I had hoped to have the
dialog: wedding next spring, Lord Turold,
dialog: with all the nobles of the kingdom
dialog: in attendance. But Fate and this war
dialog: have ordained otherwise.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: It is important to assure the
dialog: succession.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Yes.
text: The Queen smiles and beckons Turold closer. He kneels beside
dialog: the bed.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I will tell you something you did
dialog: not know, Turold. Had it been my
dialog: choice, all those years ago, I would
dialog: have chosen you for my king. But my
dialog: parents chose otherwise.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: I knew.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: That I am, my lady.
text: Turold looks out the window at the North Tower.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: And, it seems, so is my son.
scene_heading: P.O.V. - NORTH TOWER - INTERCUT
text: Angle from the Queen's bedroom window. A waist-high wall
text: conceals the bottom half of a naked Colwyn, who stands atop
text: the tower, hugging himself in the brisk wind.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF NORTH TOWER - INTERCUT
text: Colwyn hears Lyssa mounting the stairs and moves to the
text: doorway, reaching around to take the bucket from her.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: (as Lyssa pushes past him)
dialog: Just hand me the bucket! What are
dialog: you doing!
text: He backs away, covering himself with his hands. Lyssa
text: advances on him; tucked in her belt, like a sword, is a
text: long-handled bath brush.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: I don't trust you to wash behind
dialog: your ears.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Never mind my ears! Go away!
text: The Queen and Turold watch the unfolding drama from their
text: window vantage point: a great tongue of water leaps across
text: the tower as Lyssa heaves the bucketful at Colwyn. Dripping
text: wet, he retreats, but is soon cornered and attacked without
text: quarter, Lyssa wielding brush and soap with gleeful
text: enthusiasm. At one point, Colwyn squirms free and, with his
text: head completely enveloped in lather, tries to flee. But
text: since he can't see, he soon fetches up against a wall, and
text: Lyssa continues her scrubbing.
scene_heading: RESUME - QUEEN'S BEDROOM
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: A girl of some spirit, your
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: A match for your son, I think.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: A fine match.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (takes his hand)
dialog: They will have the life that you and
dialog: I might have had.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF NORTH TOWER - DAY
text: Wrapped in a long blue cape, a scrubbed and scowling Colwyn
text: stands with arms folded across his chest. Lyssa is combing
text: his hair.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: (steps back)
dialog: There. Now you look like someone I
dialog: might want to marry.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (surly growl)
dialog: Maybe you'd better look around for
dialog: another candidate. I don't think my
dialog: skin is tough enough to survive a
dialog: lifetime of you and your brush.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: I don't have to look around. I've
dialog: found the husband I want. You can
dialog: kiss me now.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Thank you, but I can wait.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: I can't.
text: She bestows a class-A smack.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I lied.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I can't wait either.
text: They close in a passionate kiss, and begin caressing each
text: other. We see Turold standing in the doorway, watching them.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: You'll both wait. At least for five
text: hours. The wedding is at three.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (acting offended)
dialog: It was a platonic kiss, Father.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: Of course it was.
text: Turold snorts down a laugh. Colwyn and Lyssa begin to
text: giggle. Then all three break into laughter.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY
text: The occupants of the castle - servants, soldiers, minor
text: nobles, and retainers - stand in two parallel lines, forming
text: an aisle.
text: Turold and Rowan, on horseback, face each other at opposite
text: ends of the aisle. Midway between them stand Colwyn and
text: Lyssa, side by side, Colwyn facing Rowan, Lyssa facing
text: Turold. The two fathers are not armored, but they hold
text: longswords balanced across their pommels.
text: Colwyn glances up toward the Queen's balcony.
scene_heading: EXT. QUEEN'S BALCONY - INTERCUT
text: The Queen lies on a couch, attended by her two girls-in-
text: waiting. She answers Colwyn's look with a nod.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (shouts to Rowan)
dialog: I am Colwyn, son of Turold, of the
dialog: eagle's blood, and I am come to take
dialog: your daughter from you.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: You shall not!
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: (shouts to Turold)
dialog: I am Lyssa, daughter of the Queen,
dialog: of the leopard's blood, and I am
dialog: come to take your son from you.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: You shall not!
text: The two men spur their horses toward the wedding couple, who
text: stand perfectly still as the horses thunder down on them.
text: Turold and Rowan swing their swords directly above the heads
text: of the young couple, the blades striking with a clang. Then
text: they wheel their horses to a stop. Colwyn and Lyssa, almost
text: obscured by the whirling dust, have not moved a muscle.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: Let it be done then.
text: He hurls his sword at the ground beside the wedding couple.
speaker_heading: ROWAN
dialog: It is done.
text: He hurls his sword, which sticks in the ground beside
text: Turold's, crossing it. A cheer goes up from the spectators
text: and the guards on the walls.
text: As Colwyn and Lyssa kiss, a crossbow bolt strikes one of the
text: guards, who topples thirty feet to the courtyard below.
text: Slayers appear around the walls, leaping over the parapet
text: and attacking the guards.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Slayers! To arms!
text: Men and women arm themselves as Slayers descend the walls.
text: They mount a fierce counterattack against the Slayers, women
text: fighting beside their men, Lyssa fighting beside Colwyn.
text: But suddenly the main gate is rammed open and a dozen
text: Slayers on horseback, led by Modred, attack the defenders
text: from the rear. In the melee, Colwynn and Lyssa are
dialog: separated.
scene_heading: EXT. QUEEN'S BALCONY - DAY
text: The Queen and her girls hear Slayers forcing the door to her
dialog: bedroom within.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Help me up. I will die on my feet.
text: The two girls help the Queen to stand. She faces the door
text: defiantly as it bursts open. A Slayer steps into the
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: And I will not die alone.
text: She hurls a knife, which pierces the Slayer's throat. But
text: even as he falls, three more Slayers enter the room and
text: advance on the three women, who stare back defiantly.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY
text: Colwyn sees that his father is being pressed by several
text: Slayers and hacks his way to his side. They dispatch their
text: assailants, then Colwyn looks through the courtyard for
text: Lyssa, who has just run a Slayer through with her short
text: sword, when she is felled from behind by Modred's mailed
text: fist. He picks her up and lays her across his saddle.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: They have Lyssa!
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: You can't reach her!
dialog: (opens a door in the wall)
text: Through the door.
dialog: (as Colwyn hesitates)
dialog: Quickly!
text: They go through the door, and are followed shortly by two
dialog: Slayers.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR IN WALL OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY
text: Colwyn and Turold back down the dark corridor, fighting the
text: two Slayers. They kill the Slayers but, in the exchange,
text: Turold is badly wounded. He leans against the wall, holding
text: himself erect by force of will.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: The passage. Open it.
text: Colwyn pressed one of the rough-hewn stones and a door
text: swings open in the wall: A staircase leads to an underground
text: passage. He moves to help his father through the door.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: You will go alone.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I won't leave you here.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: You will do as I tell you. You will
dialog: try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I must follow the Slayers. They've
dialog: taken Lyssa.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: You will not follow the Slayers, you
dialog: will obey my command!
dialog: (softer)
dialog: You have no chance alone, boy. You
dialog: must try to break through to Ynyr.
dialog: He has great knowledge. Only with
dialog: his help can you save Lyssa.
text: They hear footsteps in the corridor.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: Go now.
dialog: (as Colwyn hesitates)
dialog: Go! I command you!
text: As Colwyn enters the passage and begins swinging the heavy
text: door shut, Modred appears, advancing on Turold with drawn
text: sword. Turold places himself in front of the door, but he is
text: weak from his wound and goes down under Modred's first blow.
text: Modred thrusts his sword into the crack of the door,
text: preventing it from closing. Turold, slumped against the
text: wall, looks up at him with pleading eyes.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: Spare him, Modred. Have you never
dialog: loved anyone?
speaker_heading: MODRED
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: If I spare him, they will kill me.
speaker_heading: TUROLD
dialog: He is your godson now. He and Lyssa
dialog: were married.
text: Modred stares at him for some moments, then withdraws his
text: sword, allowing the door to close. Turold flashes a look of
text: gratitude, then dies.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD OF WHITE CASTLE - DAY
text: The castle is in flames, the occupants slain.
text: The Slayers, mounted, wait in a double column for Modred's
text: command. Lyssa sits on a horse in the middle of the column,
text: her hands tied behind her. Modred approaches her with a skin
text: canteen of water, which she refuses by averting her face. He
text: steps back and signals the column, which trots out through
text: the main gate.
text: As Modred mounts his horse to follow the column, the twin
text: suns dip below the horizon. Modred rides through the main
text: gate, disappearing in the shadows. We hear an inhuman
text: scream, amplified by the stone walls of the gate.
text: Modred's riderless horse emerges from the other side of the
text: gate. A new angle shows Modred lying on the stone floor
text: beneath the gate tower, his chest raked by deep gouges.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS NEAR WHITE CASTLE - NIGHT
text: Colwyn stands beside the exit of the underground passage,
text: tears running down his cheeks as he stares at the burning
text: castle in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST NEAR GRANITE NEEDLE - DAY
text: The forest ends abruptly, some distance from the edge of a
text: steep cliff. A natural stone bridge arches from the cliff to
text: the Granite Needle, a cylindrical formation that rises from
text: the floor of the valley below.
text: Colwyn stands at the edge of the forest, looking out at a
text: group of Slayers posted near the stone bridge. Nearby are a
text: pair of black tents housing more Slayers.
text: He hears a noise and turns to see a Slayer behind him,
text: drawing his sword. As the Slayer rushes, Colwyn hurls his
text: knife at the T-slot in the Slayer's cylindrical helmet,
text: striking him between the eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. GRANITE NEEDLE - DAY
text: Colwyn, wearing the dead Slayer's helmet and armor,
text: approaches the group near the stone bridge. The bridge leads
text: to an opening in the side of the Needle, which gives access
text: to a passage which extends some ten feet into the Needle
text: before it takes a right-angle turn.
text: On the floor of the passage are heaped the bodies of half a
text: dozen Slayers; though Ynyr may not be able to get out, he is
text: clearly capable of preventing anyone from getting in.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: The old man must sleep sometime.
speaker_heading: SLAYER
dialog: Yes, sometime. But when?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Perhaps now.
speaker_heading: SLAYER
dialog: Perhaps you'd like to stroll across
text: the bridge and find out.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Perhaps I will.
speaker_heading: 2ND SLAYER
dialog: Go right ahead, brother, and let the
dialog: old man put you to sleep forever ...
dialog: (nods toward bodies)
dialog: ... along with them.
text: The Slayers laugh, but fall silent as Colwyn draws his sword
text: and starts across the bridge.
text: He moves across the bridge into the passageway, stepping
text: over bodies as he nears the right-angle turn.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE IN GRANITE NEEDLE - INTERCUT - DAY
text: Ynyr stares down the passage toward the right-angle turn. In
text: his hand, held out before him, is a silver glaive, a cross-
text: shaped weapon with four equal blades.
text: When Colwyn rounds the corner into view, the glaive leaps
text: from the old man's hand and spins down the passageway.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (pulling off his helmet)
dialog: I am Colwyn, son of Turold!
text: The glaive stops in midair, inches from Colwyn's throat.
text: Realizing they've been tricked, two Slayers start across the
text: bridge to attack Colwyn. But the old man projects his glaive
text: past the boy, where it hangs in midair, spinning and
text: glowing. The Slayers retreat.
speaker_heading: SLAYER
dialog: There is no way out. He will die
text: there with the old man.
text: In the cave, Colwyn stands in front of Ynyr.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: The White Castle has fallen.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Does the Queen live?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: The new Queen lives.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Turold's son was to marry her.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: We were married. Then she was taken
dialog: by the Slayers. You must help me.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: I have lived in this place, like my
dialog: fathers before me, guarding the old
dialog: knowledge. I knew, when I had no
dialog: son, that the Great War would come
dialog: in my time, and that I would be the
dialog: one to pass on the old knowledge to
dialog: a new king. Come.
text: Colwyn glances toward the entrance.
speaker_heading: YNYR
text: It is night. The Slayers have gone
text: to their tents and the bridge is
dialog: guarded by Dark Ones. They will not
dialog: cross, for they have no power in
dialog: this place.
text: Colwyn follows Ynyr through a passageway to ...
scene_heading: INT. TRIANGULAR ROOM IN GRANITE NEEDLE - NIGHT
text: Colwyn and Ynyr sit beside a fire in a triangular pit in the
text: floor. Colwyn has shed the Slayer's armor, and Ynyr holds a
text: black onyx box in his lap.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: This is not the first time the Dark
dialog: Ones have attacked our world. They
dialog: came once before, a thousand years
text: ago. A young king and queen, with
dialog: extraordinary powers, were given to
dialog: us then, to lead the struggle. My
dialog: fore-father was their Councilor, as
dialog: I will be yours.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I have no extraordinary powers.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Your powers are greater than you
dialog: know.
dialog: (indicates his glaive)
dialog: Have you ever seen one of these?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: In the old books. It's called a
dialog: glaive.
text: Ynyr opens the onyx box to reveal a golden glaive.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: This belonged to the young king who
dialog: fought the Dark Ones a thousand
dialog: years ago. Now it is yours.
text: Colwyn picks up the glaive, turns it in his hands, the
text: blades flashing in the firelight.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: With two or three days' practice,
dialog: you'll be able to use it as well as
dialog: I can. Then we'll have a chance of
dialog: fighting our way out of here.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Two or three days! While Lyssa is in
dialog: their hands?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: There is no other way.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (looks at the fire)
dialog: But there is another entrance to
dialog: this place.
text: Ynyr follows Colwyn's gaze and sees that he's judging from
text: the movement of the flames.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL IN GRANITE NEEDLE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: YNYR
text: But it opens onto the sheer wall of
text: the Needle. There's no way down.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: You have rope?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: I am too old to climb down a rope.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: You won't have to.
scene_heading: EXT. OPENING IN WALL OF GRANITE NEEDLE - NIGHT
text: Colwyn inserts his glaive in a crack beside the opening,
text: then ties a rope to the glaive and climbs down the wall.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF GRANITE NEEDLE - INTERCUT - NIGHT
text: Colwyn reaches the ground and signals Ynyr, who unties the
text: rope from the glaive and secures it around his waist. Then
text: he lowers the rope over the glaive, which allows Colwyn to
text: lower him down the side of the Needle.
scene_heading: EXT. NEARBY CLIFF - INTERCUT - NIGHT
text: A Dark One watches them from the top of the cliff, its red
text: eyes peering over the edge. The thing moves quickly down the
text: rock face, with only an occasional scrape or flash of claw
dialog: to mark its descent.
text: At the bottom of the cliff, the red eyes appear above a rock
text: - only a few yards from Colwyn. But before it can attack, a
text: trident flashes through the air and strikes the thing square
text: in the face, the outer prongs of the weapon piercing the red
text: eyes. We hear a death grunt, then the sound of a body
dialog: falling.
text: Colwyn turns, but sees nothing. He lowers Ynyr to the ground
text: and they set off across the valley floor.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - JUST BEFORE DAWN
text: The golden glaive stands upright on Colwyn's outstretched
text: palm. Ynyr kneels beside him.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Focus on the glaive.
text: Colwyn tenses with concentration. The glaive begins to spin,
text: at first slowly, then faster and faster until it's a golden
dialog: blur.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Reach out with your mind. Reach out
dialog: to Lyssa.
text: Colwyn furrows his brow in concentration.
scene_heading: COLWYN'S TELEPATHIC SEARCH - INTERCUT
text: Through a translucent image of Lyssa we see stretches of
text: terrain moving past: bizarre forests and valleys, gargoyle
text: mountains, rainbow lakes.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (sweating)
dialog: There is nothing.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Reach out farther. Call to her.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
scene_heading: EXT. FORTRESS OF KRULL, IN THE MOUNTAINS - JUST BEFORE DAWN
text: A LONG SHOT SHOWS only a series of jagged peaks, but as we
text: MOVE IN, we SEE the outlines of a gigantic fortress,
text: designed to blend into the mountains.
text: Lyssa walks along the parapets of the fortress, a cold wind
text: whipping at her light garments. The occasional glint of
text: talon or beak, the quick flash of a red eye, tell us that
text: she is closely watched and guarded.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: (faintly at first, then
dialog: louder)
dialog: Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: Colwyn.
scene_heading: INTERCUT COLWYN AND LYSSA
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Have they harmed you?
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: No. They watch me closely, but they
dialog: haven't harmed me.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (to Colwyn)
dialog: Where? We must know where she is.
text: Colwyn's face is bathed in sweat, his hand clenched tight.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
text: In a great fortress in the
dialog: mountains. Wait. Something's
dialog: happening.
text: As the twin suns edge above the horizon, the fortress fades
text: and disappears. The whistle of the wind changes to ...
scene_heading: EXT. FORTRESS OF KRULL, IN THE JUNGLE - DAWN
text: ... tropical bird sounds as the Fortress appears in the
text: midst of the jungle, its walls covered with liana vines.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: Everything's changed. Now the
text: fortress is in the jungle.
text: Colwyn's body is shaking from the strain of maintaining
text: contact. Ynyr grips his shoulder.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Enough, boy.
text: But Colwyn continues to concentrate.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Enough!
text: Ynyr slaps him sharply, knocking him backward. The boy lies
text: exhausted, breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You must break when the strain
dialog: becomes too great, or you will harm
dialog: yourself. And you must concentrate
dialog: your powers for when they are needed
dialog: most. What did she answer?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: She was in a great fortress, first
dialog: in the mountains, then in the
dialog: jungle. How is that possible?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: It is the Fortress of Krull. I know
dialog: it only from the stories of wars on
dialog: other worlds. They did not use it on
dialog: our world in the first great war,
dialog: for it costs them enormous power.
dialog: This time they mean to conquer, at
dialog: all costs.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: The Fortress moves?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes. Each dawn it rises in a
dialog: different land: sometimes in the
dialog: mountains, sometimes in the jungle,
dialog: sometimes the desert, sometimes the
dialog: sea. Never in the same place twice.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Then even if Lyssa tells us where
dialog: she is, we'll never be able to reach
dialog: her, for they will never allow the
dialog: Fortress to rise near us.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: No. They occupy the Fortress, but
dialog: they cannot control its movement. It
text: is moved by Fate. And, sooner or
dialog: later, Fate will place it near us.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Then we must be ready. Five leagues
dialog: from here is the Eastern Tower. I
dialog: know the Barons who hold it. Good
dialog: men, and brave. They will help us.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You have not slept in two days.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Nor will I, till my bride is beside
dialog: me.
text: They set off through the forest.
speaker_heading: RESUME - LYSSA
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Colwyn. Colwyn.
text: She hears the scrape of a taloned foot behind her and
text: hurries along the parapet. She stops and looks down at a
text: small clearing in the jungle, outside the walls.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - INTERCUT - DAY
text: A fawn grazes in the clearing, unaware of a white leopard
text: poised on a branch above it. As the leopard is about to
text: pounce, it glances up and sees Lyssa staring down from the
text: Fortress wall. As if in answer to her summons, it jumps to
text: the ground and heads for the wall.
text: The leopard leaps onto the walkway in front of Lyssa, then
text: moves obediently to her side. They set off down the walkway
dialog: together.
text: Suddenly the leopard whirls and roars as it hears the scrape
text: of a taloned foot behind. But other Dark Ones are in front
text: of them. Lyssa is forced to descend a stone staircase. The
text: leopard, acting as rear guard, roars its defiance as it
text: backs down the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST BROOK - DAY
text: Colwyn and Ynyr are about to cross the tiny stream, when
text: suddenly a small white cloud materializes above the water,
text: bulging and gyrating, affording brief glimpses of feet and
text: hands, as if a small man were trying to escape. As Colwyn
text: jumps back, drawing his sword, the cloud vanishes with a POP
text: and the small man, ERGO, is plopped on his seat in the water
text: (which is only a few inches deep).
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Help! Help! I'm drowning!
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I doubt it. The water is only an
text: inch deep.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (stands)
dialog: It could have been quicksand! I
dialog: might have been sucked to my death.
dialog: (jumps out of the water)
dialog: Where is this place?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: A forest near the Valley of Needles.
speaker_heading: ERGO
text: Blast! A thousand miles off course.
dialog: Well, I was rushed. There was a
dialog: certain difference of opinion
dialog: concerning a venison pie. The
text: foolish man left it sitting on his
dialog: windowsill. What did he expect?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Perhaps he expected to eat it.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: For that rudeness, peasant lout, I
dialog: am going to leave you hanging by
dialog: your heels when I depart. Which is
dialog: right now.
text: >From the folds of his voluminous clothing, Ergo produces a
text: tattered spellbook. He peers at a page, mumbles to himself,
text: and pokes his head toward Colwyn - whereupon he vanishes.
text: Colwyn glances around but the little man is nowhere to be
dialog: seen.
speaker_heading: ERGO (O.S.)
dialog: Get me down from here!
text: Colwyn turns and sees Ergo hanging upside-down from a tree
text: limb directly behind him. He lifts him down.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: My spells always go wrong when I am
dialog: observed. Be gone!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: The forest is not safe these days.
dialog: You'd best travel with us.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Me? Travel with you? I am Ergo the
dialog: Magnificent ...
dialog: (flattens hand)
dialog: ... short in stature ...
dialog: (points to the sky)
dialog: ... tall in power ...
dialog: (opposes thumb and forefinger)
dialog: ... narrow of purpose ...
dialog: (shades eyes)
dialog: ... wide of vision. And I do not
text: travel with peasants and beggars.
dialog: Goodbye!
text: We follow Ergo as he sets off down the forest path, heading
text: in the opposite direction from Colwyn and Ynyr. After a few
text: yards, the forest seems to grow darker, the sounds more
text: ominous. Ergo glances around apprehensively. Suddenly,
text: through an opening in the leaves, he sees a face with a
text: single eye in the middle of it.
text: With a yelp, he turns and races back up the path after
text: Colwyn and Ynyr. When he catches up, he wedges himself
dialog: between them to get as much protection as possible.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: I just remembered I have urgent
dialog: business in this direction.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: What business?
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (fearful glance behind)
dialog: Staying alive.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
text: As Colwyn, Ynyr, and Ergo cross the clearing, Ergo steps on
text: a snare-trigger and is suddenly hoisted into the air by his
text: foot. Colwyn draws his sword and turns to face five armed
text: men who step out of the forest. They're a rag-tag bunch,
text: garbed in various kinds of chain-mail and armed with a
text: bizarre variety of weapons.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL (O.S.)
dialog: The lad is quick, very quick.
text: Colwyn wheels to see TORQUIL THE ROBBER leaning against a
text: tree, his huge battle-axe resting casually across his
text: shoulders. His cheek bulges with a wad of chewing tobacco.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
text: But also very young. Six to one is
dialog: no odds, boy.
speaker_heading: ERGO
text: (yelling as he hangs upside-
dialog: down)
dialog: Get me down from here you louts or
dialog: I'll turn you all into pigs!
text: Torquil glances up at Ergo, then spits a stream of brown
text: juice at the ground and steps forward to investigate his
dialog: prisoners.
speaker_heading: ERGO
text: (muttering as he fumbles for
dialog: his spellbook)
dialog: They'll soon learn the price of
text: snaring Ergo the Magnificent.
text: Torquil walks a circle around Colwyn and Ynyr.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: When your enemies outnumber you,
dialog: boy, craft is more profitable than
dialog: courage. Smile and go along and,
dialog: sooner or later, they will grow
dialog: careless. And then ...
dialog: (throat-cutting gesture)
dialog: ... sst!
text: Colwyn sheaths his sword.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (little smile)
dialog: I don't think you'll grow careless.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Smart as well as quick. Now what do
dialog: you have to give us?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Fame.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Fame?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Thank you, no. Fame is the burial
dialog: ground of contentment. Eat it and go
dialog: hungry; count it and go broke; seek
dialog: it and grow mad. Fame is what fools
dialog: yearn for and wise men shun.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Fame is what you leave to your sons.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: How did you know I had sons?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Because you would not rob if you had
dialog: no children to provide for.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Hah! You don't know me, boy.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: (fixes him with a look)
dialog: I know you.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (to Colwyn)
dialog: You choose these?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Yes. They will be more help than
dialog: high-born barons.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
text: They stand at the edge of the grave
dialog: and make jokes.
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Do you know who I am, sprout? I am
dialog: Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men
dialog: follow no man but me, and I follow
dialog: no man at all.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: You will follow me.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (shifts his axe)
dialog: And in the few seconds before I dice
dialog: you to crow-food, tell me why I am
dialog: going to follow you.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: So your sons will speak of you to
dialog: your grandsons, and your grandsons
dialog: to their grandsons.
text: Torquil plunks the handle of his long battle-axe into the
text: ground, then folds his hands across the top of the blade and
text: rests his chin on his hands. He stares hard at Colwyn, who
text: returns his gaze calmly.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: And where do you lead, boy?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: To the place where Death lives.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (grins)
dialog: It should be an interesting journey,
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (answering smile)
dialog: That I promise you.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: I compel no man to follow me on this
dialog: journey.
speaker_heading: KEGAN
dialog: We owe you our lives, Torquil. If
dialog: you follow the boy, so also do we.
text: BARDOLPH, OSWIN, and RUHN nod their agreement. The sixth
text: robber, SWEYN, back away.
speaker_heading: SWEYN
text: I follow the man who follows gold.
text: He who follows glory travels without
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Go then, and let greed be your
dialog: gravestone.
text: Sweyn moves off into the forest. An angry oink causes the
text: others to look up at the snare, which holds a small pig by
text: its foot; as usual, Ergo's magic has boomeranged.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: What have we here?
dialog: (prods the pig with his axe)
text: Roast pork for dinner.
text: The pig squeals his objections. Torquil signals to drop the
text: snare, and picks the pig up under his arm.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: He needs his book.
text: Torquil finds the open spellbook and kneels, allowing the
text: pig to read it. Pop, and Torquil is holding a gyrating cloud
text: under his arm, replete with squeals and yells and pieces of
text: pig and Ergo; pop, and the cloud disappears, leaving Ergo
text: under Torquil's arm.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Put me down, you lout!
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (sets him down)
dialog: You had better manners as a pig.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (haughty)
dialog: I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do
dialog: not travel with thieves and robbers.
text: He takes two steps into the forest, then glances around
dialog: anxiously.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (backing out of the forest)
dialog: Except when necessary.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING VALLEY - SUNSET
text: As the band nears the crest of the hill, Colwyn stumbles.
text: Torquil reaches out to steady him.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: When did you last sleep, boy?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (shaking off the help)
dialog: I'm all right.
text: They top the hill and look out over the valley, dotted with
text: plumes of smoke from burning villages.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: They burn many villages. Even walled
text: cities fall to them.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Why do they burn the villages?
dialog: There's nothing to gain.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: There's terror to gain. Their wealth
dialog: is fear: they get it with fire, they
dialog: spend it to rule.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
text: The band has stopped in the middle of the clearing. Colwyn
text: is swaying, barely able to stand.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: We'll stop here to hunt. Even those
dialog: who don't sleep must eat.
text: Colwyn folds his arms across his chest, tries to stand up
dialog: straight.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (eyes drifting shut)
dialog: I'm not hungry.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
text: (folding his arms across his
dialog: chest)
dialog: Not sleepy, either?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: (eyes almost closed, swaying)
dialog: No.
text: Torquil purses his lips and blows at Colwyn, who falls
text: backward into the arms of Kegan, who lays him gently on the
text: ground, fast asleep. Torquil covers him with his cape. The
text: other robbers string their bows and prepare to hunt.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Bring me a deer! No deer, no supper.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - AN HOUR LATER
text: Torquil and Ynyr talk to several PEASANTS at the edge of the
text: clearing while, in the center, Ergo tends the cooking fire,
text: beside which Colwyn lies asleep. Ergo's face lights up when
text: he sees Kegan arrive with a stag across his shoulders, and
text: he snick-snacks his carving knife in anticipation. But
text: Torquil has Kegan turn over the stag to the peasants, which
text: nearly gives Ergo apoplexy.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (galloping across the
dialog: clearing)
dialog: What are you doing with my dear?
dialog: Stop! Thieves!
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (restraining him)
text: Many villagers are hiding in the
dialog: forest. They need food.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: And do you think I live on air?
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: We have plenty of hares.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (snorts)
dialog: Food for crows.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan
dialog: can make rabbit taste like venison.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: I am being exploited! Where are you
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (moving off with Ynyr)
dialog: I must take the old man to see some
dialog: sick children. Kegan will guard
dialog: you.
text: But Kegan spots a hare and creeps into the forest after it,
text: leaving Ergo and Colwyn alone in the clearing.
text: Suddenly, Ergo hears ominous noises. He peers into the dark
text: forest and his jaw drops as he sees a pair of red eyes
text: staring out of the gloom. He snatches up a carving knife and
text: a frying pan and backs toward Colwyn, holding the pan as a
text: shield. The red-eyed thing moves toward them through the
text: trees, and poor Ergo is unmanned by fear: he drops his knife
text: and ducks his head behind the frying pan in sheer terror.
text: But he hears the thing stop short and raises his head to
text: look behind him, where a CYCLOPS stands with trident poised
text: to throw. The little man assumes that both creatures are
text: trying to kill him and faints dead away. But the trident is
text: aimed at the red-eyed thing, which has no desire to do
text: battle with the Cyclops. The thing retreats, the red eyes
text: fade. The Cyclops comes over to Ergo and kneels to listen to
text: his heart. Then he enters the forest after the Dark One.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The band, including Colwyn, is gathered around Ergo, who is
text: telling his story.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (indicating positions)
text: One with red eyes, the other with
text: one eye, both trying to kill me.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: The one with red eyes was a Dark
dialog: One, the other was a Cyclops, and it
dialog: was not you he meant to kill.
speaker_heading: ERGO
text: He was aiming a huge spear right at
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: If that were so, you'd be dead now.
text: He was aiming at the Dark One, for
dialog: there is ancient hatred between
dialog: them. Once his race had two eyes,
dialog: like other men, until his
dialog: forefathers bargained with the Dark
dialog: Ones: they gave up one of their eyes
dialog: in return for the power to see the
dialog: future. But they were cheated, for
dialog: the only future they were permitted
dialog: to see was the time of their own
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: They know when they're going to die?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Everyone of his race is born knowing
dialog: the day of his death.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Knowledge I wouldn't want.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: No. They are sad, solitary
text: creatures, rarely seen.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Once is enough, thank you.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: He saved our lives.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (glance toward fire)
dialog: But not our supper.
text: Ergo sees smoke rising from a pot on the fire.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (running to the pot)
dialog: Oh, my poor stew!
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Oh, my poor stomach.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - NEAR DAWN
text: The band is asleep, Torquil on guard. As the eastern horizon
text: grows light, Torquil wakes Ynyr and Colwyn.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST, A FEW YARDS FROM CLEARING - DAWN
text: Colwyn sits against a tree, brow furrowed in concentration,
text: the golden glaive spinning in midair in front of him. Ynyr
text: and Torquil look on.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I can't reach her.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: What do you see?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Wait.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR IN KRULL - INTERCUT
text: Lyssa moves down the windowless corridor with the white
text: leopard at her side.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: Lyssa ...
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: Colwyn ...
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Where is the Fortress?
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: I don't know. It's a maze of
dialog: tunnels. I can't see out.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: I will find you. I will be with you.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: I know it.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: (fading)
dialog: I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: Colwyn. Colwyn.
dialog: (in her own voice)
dialog: I love you, Colwyn.
scene_heading: RESUME - COLWYN ET. AL.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: She can't see out. She can't tell us
dialog: where the Fortress is.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes, they knew of your first
text: contact, so they drove her below.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: She was very faint. I was barely
text: able to reach her.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: The deeper she goes, the harder it
text: is to contact her. Once she is below
dialog: the second level, you will not be
text: able to reach her at all.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: (leaps to his feet, shouts
dialog: angrily)
dialog: I will find her!
text: He hurls his glaive at a nearby tree: the weapon bores clean
text: through the trunk, then through two more before it imbeds
text: itself in a fourth. But anger gives way to despair; he
text: buries his face in his hands.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (hand on his shoulder)
dialog: We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They
dialog: have great powers of vision.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: There's an Emerald Circle a few
dialog: leagues from here.
dialog: (moves to Colwyn)
dialog: We'll find her.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (thumbs the tears from
dialog: Colwyn's cheeks)
dialog: Those are not child's tear. A child
text: cries for himself, a man cries for
dialog: those he loves.
speaker_heading: RESUME - LYSSA
text: She and the leopard are forced deeper in the Fortress, down
text: yet another flight of stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL OVERLOOKING STONE LAKE - DAY
text: Colwyn and Torquil top the hill and look down at the lake,
text: the surface of which looks as if it had been instantly
text: frozen in the midst of a great storm.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: We can save half a day by crossing
dialog: the Stone Lake.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (coming up)
dialog: Many have perished in that maze.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (grin)
dialog: No maze to me, my fried. It is where
dialog: we take refuge when they hunt us.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Lead us across.
scene_heading: EXT. STONE LAKE - DAY
text: At the edge of the lake, an enormous wave is poised to
text: break, frozen in blue stone, even to the froth that caps it.
text: Torquil leads the band into the maze.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (walking beside Ynyr)
dialog: I wish you'd tell me why that
dialog: foolish boy decided to join up with
dialog: these thieves.
text: The little man suddenly lets out a yelp and jumps back: He
text: is staring into the jaws of a huge shark frozen in the wave
dialog: (as was all the marine life in the lake, including gulls
text: with one foot touching the water). He steers around the jaws
text: and catches up to Ynyr.
speaker_heading: YNYR
text: He didn't join them. They joined
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: And who is he that they should join
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: He is the King.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Well, at least I'm glad to see you
dialog: have a sense of humor. That's the
dialog: first smile I've seen on that gloomy
dialog: face of your's ...
dialog: (Ynyr is not smiling)
dialog: ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh
dialog: dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
text: He scurries forward and tugs at Colwyn's jacket.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Your kingship ... your lord high
dialog: mightiness ... when I called you a
dialog: ... a ... whatever I called you, I
dialog: didn't realize that you were ...
dialog: were ...
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I was hoping I might be your friend.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (staggered)
dialog: My friend.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I have need of friends.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (flattered nearly senseless)
dialog: No more, my lord - my friend. With
dialog: Ergo the Magnificent by your side,
dialog: your enemies are dead men.
text: The little man pulls out a carving knife and, with a
text: flourish, tucks it in his belt - slicing through his outer
text: garment as he does so. Colwyn glances down and sees red
text: liquid oozing from the cut. Ergo follows his gaze.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (staggering)
dialog: Argh! I'm dying!
text: Colwyn notices seeds oozing out with the liquid and samples
text: it with his finger.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato
dialog: that's dying.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: What? Oh no! Better it was me. There
dialog: isn't another good tomato within a
dialog: hundred leagues.
text: He pulls out the stabbed tomato and kisses it tearfully.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Oh, my poor baby.
text: He looks up to see Ynyr smiling broadly.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (scowling)
dialog: I liked you better gloomy, old man.
text: Colwyn resumes his place beside Torquil, who gives him a
text: sideways glance.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: So. You're something more than a
dialog: seeker of fame.
text: Colwyn shrugs sheepishly.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Well, I'm not impressed.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I knew you would not be. That's why
dialog: I chose you.
text: They reach the end of the lake, which is bordered by a small
text: scarp. Torquil hikes himself onto the scarp and reaches down
dialog: to help Colwyn up.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (grin)
dialog: I'm a little impressed.
scene_heading: EXT. EMERALD STONEHENGE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A circle of stone dolmens, emerald green, in the center of
text: which sits an old man, blind, wearing a green robe: an
text: EMERALD SEER. Sitting across from him is TITCH, his ten-
text: year-old assistant, similarly robed.
text: A green-hued holographic image appears above the emerald,
text: showing Colwyn and his band approaching. The Seer weaves his
text: fingers through the image, reading it by touch.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: Eight come here, Brother. They have
dialog: traveled far. Fetch bread and wine.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: Yes, Brother.
text: The boy fetches a jug of wine and a round loaf of bread, and
text: approaches Colwyn's band as they enter the stone circle.
text: Colwyn waves Titch toward his men and moves with Ynyr and
text: Torquil to the Seer.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: We seek the Fortress of Krull.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: Such a vision will be opposed. Who
dialog: seeks it?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: The new King.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: (little smile)
dialog: With an old voice?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (answering smile)
dialog: You know the voice.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: Yes. You have left your place in the
dialog: Needle. It is the time, then.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: It is the time.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: I will seek the Fortress for you.
text: The Seer presses his fingertips against the rotating sphere,
text: increasing the pressure and friction until small tongues of
text: flame spurt from beneath his fingertips.
text: A holograph begins to form above the sphere: the Fortress in
text: mid-ocean.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: Can you see?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: There is a prisoner there.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: Yes.
text: The holograph dissolves, replaced by a new one which shows a
text: curving Arm of the Vortex, the deep, central parts of the
text: Fortress. Lyssa and the white leopard move down the Arm,
text: pressed by an unseen pursuer.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: Lyssa.
text: As the twin suns dip below the horizon, the flames spurting
text: from the Seer's fingertips begin to leap and lengthen, until
text: the sphere is surrounded by fire, its color changing from
text: emerald-green to crimson. We hear faint, hollow screams of
dialog: rage.
text: The holograph above the sphere begins to waver and blur,
text: then is shattered by a holographic black claw shooting
text: upward from the sphere. The talons of the claw are blood
text: red, its appearance accompanied by a hollow scream.
text: The Seer is knocked backward; the claw disappears; the
text: emerald drops to the ground.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (kneeling by the Seer)
dialog: Are you hurt?
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: No.
dialog: (grim smile)
dialog: The Dark Ones do not like curious
text: Seers poking into their affairs.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Can you tell us where the Fortress
dialog: will rise tomorrow?
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: I cannot see the future, only the
dialog: present. But at dawn tomorrow, I can
dialog: see where the fortress has risen
dialog: that day - and every day thereafter,
dialog: until Fate brings it near us.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: The Dark Ones will appose you with
dialog: all their power.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: They will fail for, during the day,
dialog: the power of the Circle is greater
dialog: than theirs. Only at night can they
dialog: pierce the Circle.
text: Titch approaches Ergo with bread and wine.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (wrinkling his nose)
dialog: Bread is for peasants, and wine
dialog: makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Sugarballs?
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: What kind of a boy are you? Boys
dialog: always have candy.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: I have a cinnamon bar.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: (producing the bar)
dialog: You can have half.
text: Ergo takes the bar and breaks it into unequal parts. He is
text: about to take the bigger piece for himself when conscience
text: gets the better of him; reluctantly, he offers the bigger
text: piece to Titch. But the boy takes the small piece, leaving
text: the delighted Ergo with the lion's share.
speaker_heading: ERGO

dialog: ... short in stature ...

scene_heading: EXT. EMERALD STONEHENGE - NIGHT
text: While Ergo and Titch tend the cooking fire, robbers leave to
text: hunt and others return with small game.
text: Sitting against one of the stone dolmens, Colwyn tries to
text: contact Lyssa, the glaive spinning in midair in front of
text: him. Ynyr and Torquil look on.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I cannot reach her.
speaker_heading: YNYR
text: She is too deep. The curved tunnel
dialog: we saw is part of the Vortex, the
dialog: place of The Beast.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: The leader of the Dark Ones?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (to Colwyn)
dialog: Like you, a King. A King of many
dialog: worlds. All enslaved.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: The first time, when they attacked
dialog: long ago, was The Beast here?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: No. Then they were led by his
dialog: underlings. But I knew he had come
dialog: this time, from the ferocity of
dialog: their onslaught, from their use of
dialog: The Fortress. They use up much of
dialog: their strength to do these things.
dialog: They are taking great risks.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (evasive)
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: But you suspect.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You will know, in good time.
text: At the cooking fire, Kegan arrives with a string of small
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Rabbits and squirrels. Where is my

speaker_heading: KEEGAN
dialog: We saw nothing but does and fawns,
dialog: and we shoot only stags.
text: Kegan lays down the string of game and moves off.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (grumbling)
dialog: Nothing worse than lower-class boors
dialog: with upper-class morals.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS (O.S.)
dialog: Would you settle for a boar?
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (to Titch)
dialog: A boar? Those incompetent louts
dialog: couldn't catch a piglet, much less a
text: boar.
text: He realizes that the voice has come from behind him and
text: turns to see the Cyclops with a huge boar slung across his
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: You!
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: Me.
dialog: (lays down the boar)
dialog: May I eat with you tonight?
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Tonight and every night, my friend,
dialog: for this is the second time you've
dialog: saved my life.

speaker_heading: TITCH

speaker_heading: ERGO

speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: I must fetch my master.

dialog: passes)
dialog: I'm Titch.
scene_heading: EXT. STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE - NIGHT
text: The Seer kneels at water's edge, washing his hands with
text: ritual motions. He hears footsteps behind him.
speaker_heading: SEER
dialog: Is that you, Brother?
text: We see a CHANGELING/SEER standing behind him: an exact twin,
text: except that his eyes are open and red. Changeling reaches
text: down and places his hand on the Seer's neck.
speaker_heading: CHANGELING
dialog: (hiss)
dialog: It is me, Brother.
text: His hand turns into a taloned claw, which tightens around
text: the Seer's neck, throttling him. He lowers the body into the
text: stream, then reaches into the Seer's robe and extracts the
text: emerald, which he crushes in his claw. The green fragments
text: drop into the water, floating downstream behind the Seer's
dialog: body.
text: His bloody claw now reverts to human form, but the fingers
text: remain bloody. He kneels and washes off the blood. When he
text: hears Titch approaching, he closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: CHANGELING
dialog: (in Seer's voice)
dialog: Is that you, Brother?
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: It is me, Brother.
text: He stands and places his hand on the boy's shoulder to be
text: led back to camp. The Cyclops appears, having followed Titch
text: to guard him.
text: The Cyclops glances at the Changeling, but notices nothing
text: unusual. He takes a few steps farther down the path, to
text: check it out - and stops just short of a point that would
text: show him the Seer's body fetched up against a rock in the
text: stream. He turns and follows Titch back to the campsite.
scene_heading: EXT. STONEHENGE - NIGHT
text: The band is seated around the fire, finishing a huge dinner
text: of roast boar. The Changeling/Seer sits slightly apart, his
text: eye-lids lifting occasionally to afford a thin slit, through
text: which he surveys the group with red eyes.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (raising a joint)
text: Passable, pimple, very passable.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: The greatest boon of your otherwise
dialog: worthless life, blockhead, is the
dialog: privilege of dining on boar roasted
text: by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Your boast is a bigger mouthful than
dialog: your roast, Magnificence.
text: He glances over his shoulder at Colwyn, who is leaning
text: against a dolmen, staring gloomily into the darkness.
text: Torquil gets up and goes to him, carrying the joint.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: You've eaten nothing.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (shrug, pause)
dialog: We must try to get horses.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Yes. It will double our range.
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I know at least a dozen ways to get
dialog: horses. All cheap.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (little smile)
dialog: These we'll pay for.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: Lad, you have an unnatural desire to
dialog: pay for things. It stunts the mind
text: and shrivels the imagination.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (thumb in his ribs)
dialog: Hand over your dinner.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (hands it over)
text: A flicker of talent.
text: Colwyn's hunger comes alive as he starts to work on the
dialog: joint.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: But I can't tell yet whether it's a
dialog: talent for theft or gluttony.
text: Ergo, Titch, and the Cyclops, full to bursting, are
text: stretched out together beside the fire.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: If I could wish ...
dialog: (belch)
dialog: ... for anything, I'd wish for a
dialog: venison pie the size of a ...
dialog: (belch)
dialog: ... mountain. No, that's too greedy.
dialog: I'd settle for one the size of a
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: I'd wish for a puppy.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: One puppy? Why not wish for a
dialog: hundred?
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: I only want one.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Ignorance.
scene_heading: EXT. STONEHENGE - NIGHT
text: Bardolph and Oswin stand guard over the sleeping band,
text: stationed at the perimeter of the Circle, looking outward.
text: The Cyclops broods by the fire, his expression troubled. He
text: frowns and looks around, then gets up and moves out of the
text: Circle into the darkness.
text: As soon as the Cyclops is gone, the Changeling/Seer opens
text: his eyes and looks around. He stands and moves toward
dialog: Bardolph.
speaker_heading: BARDOLPH
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Who's there?
speaker_heading: CHANGELING
dialog: (holding out a hand)
dialog: It's me, Brother. I am thirsty.
speaker_heading: BARDOLPH
dialog: Here, I'll guide you.
text: He approaches the Changeling, who places a hand on his
text: shoulder to be led to the stream.
scene_heading: EXT. PATH TO STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE - NIGHT
text: As they move down the path, the Changeling's hand turns into
text: a claw and he throttles Bardolph so quickly he's unable to
text: utter a sound. He tosses the body into the bushes and starts
text: to wipe his bloody hand on the grass - but stands as he
text: hears Colwyn coming down the path.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Where is Bardolph, Brother?
speaker_heading: CHANGELING
dialog: He heard something and went to
dialog: investigate, Brother.
text: Colwyn starts to move past him to the stream.
speaker_heading: CHANGELING
dialog: (reaching out)
dialog: Lead me to the stream, Brother.
text: Colwyn stops and allows the Changeling to place a hand on
text: his shoulder. A close shot of the Changeling's hand shows it
text: still bloody, the blood running onto the cloth of Colwyn's
dialog: jacket.
scene_heading: EXT. STREAM NEAR STONEHENGE - INTERCUT - NIGHT
text: The Cyclops stands near the spot where the real Seer was
text: killed. He moves downstream a few yards - and suddenly sees
text: the Seer's body floating in the water, caught against the
text: rocks. He realizes immediately that the band is in great
text: danger; he races up the path toward the camp.
text: As Colwn leads the Changeling down the path, we see the hand
text: on his shoulder turn into a claw. The claw is moving toward
text: his neck when suddenly the Cyclops bursts from the trees in
text: front of them. Colwyn stares in disbelief as the Cyclops
text: hurls his trident straight at him. The weapon whistles past
text: his ear and slices off the Changeling's arm at the shoulder.
text: Colwyn spins, sees the red eyes, ducks backward as the
text: Changeling swipes at him with his other hand - now become a
text: claw. He draws his glaive as the Changeling reverts entirely
text: to bestial form, its hideous black body bursting the seams
text: of the emerald-green robe.
text: As the creature springs at Colwyn, we see, for an instant,
text: the horrible face: teeth flashing, eyes burning. Then
text: Colwyn's glaive strikes between the eyes. Slit by the
text: horizontal blades of the glaive, the eyes explode in a burst
text: of red and the thing dies with a scream.
text: Torquil, Ynyr, and others run up. The body of the creature
text: has already turned to ash, forming the characteristic Vortex
dialog: of the Dark Ones.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: (to Ynyr)
dialog: A Changeling.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes. It chose the Seer's form so it
dialog: wouldn't have to show its eyes.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (to Cyclops)
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: I found the body of the Seer in the
dialog: stream.
text: They all look up the path at Titch, who is rubbing his eyes
text: sleepily. Ergo goes up to him and puts an arm around his
dialog: shoulders.
scene_heading: EXT. STONEHENGE - NIGHT
text: The band stands beside a fresh grave, outlined by stone
text: markers. Colwyn is kneeling with his arms around Titch,
text: whose face is buried against his chest.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: If he had not agreed to help us,
dialog: they would not have killed him. He
dialog: gave his life for us.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: He was my only family.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: We're your family now.
scene_heading: EXT. STONEHENGE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Colwyn, Ynyr, and Torquil sit by the fire while the others
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: I must go to the widow. Perhaps she
dialog: will help.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: The Widow of the Web?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: That creature helps no one. And none
dialog: who go there return.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: She has the power of vision.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: She has the power to kill.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Perhaps she will not kill me, for I
dialog: know her name.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Her name is Death.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: She had another name once.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (with finality)
dialog: No. We will find another way to
dialog: locate the Fortress.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: There is no other way. You asked me
dialog: why the Beast had come this time.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: He has come for Lyssa.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Lyssa? Why?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Like you, she has extraordinary
dialog: powers. He would make her his Queen.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Can she be forced?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: No. She must agree of her own free
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You are young. You don't understand
dialog: the attraction of great power, and
dialog: you forget the pain of long waiting.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Then we must reach her before she
dialog: feels that pain.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes.
text: On the other side of the fire, Ergo lies awake, watching
text: Titch, who is asleep next to him, his face tear-stained. The
text: Cyclops sits nearby, leaning against a stone, one hand on
text: his trident. His eye is closed; he appears to be asleep.
text: Ergo sits up, takes his spellbook, and sneaks off behind a
text: stone. The Cyclops opens his eye and watches as Ergo thumbs
text: through the book, mumbles a spell, and disappears in a
text: gyrating white cloud. When the cloud disappears, Ergo has
text: transformed himself into a puppy. The puppy trots over to
text: the sleeping Titch and licks his face. The boy stirs, opens
text: his eyes, and hugs the puppy to his chest.
scene_heading: INT. ARM OF VORTEX - NIGHT
text: Red eyes press Lyssa and the leopard down the curving
text: passage-way until they emerge in the center of the vortex.
scene_heading: INT. CENTER OF VORTEX - NIGHT
text: The Arms open into the top of a huge bloodstone funnel, at
text: the bottom of which is the hole of the Beast. Lyssa and her
text: guardian are forced along a spiral walkway that curves down
text: the walls of the funnel to the dark hole at the bottom.
text: We hear a heavy, slithering sound, as of an enormous tail
text: being dragged across stone. A pair of huge red eyes appear
text: in the Beast's hole and we hear a husky whisper: the sound
text: is ominous, but also attractive, in the way that enormous
dialog: power is always attractive.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Do not be afraid. You are safe here.
dialog: You are protected by my power.
text: Lyssa shrinks against the stone. The white leopard roars.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: I am not one of those trivial ones
dialog: who have been guarding you. They are
dialog: my slaves. They are to me as drops
dialog: to an ocean. I rule here.
text: The leopard leaps at the hole, but is frozen in mid-leap,
text: suspended in the air.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: I rule all here.
text: The leopard is suddenly flung backward, hurled with
text: tremendous force against the stone. Lyssa turns to see it
text: embedded in the solid rock, mouth open and eyes glazed.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Nature is my slave here.
text: A stone claw rises from the floor.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Its laws are mine to break.
text: The claw bursts into flame and strikes at Lyssa with such
text: force that the rock around her is shattered, yet she is
text: unharmed. The flaming claw lifts her up and sets her down,
text: then shrinks to a ball of flame and drops into her hand; she
text: looks down to see that she is holding a rose.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Such is my power. It can be yours.
text: When she looks up, the red eyes are gone. She is alone.
scene_heading: EXT. STONEHENGE - EARLY MORNING
text: Before the camp wakes, the puppy crawls out of Titch's arms
text: and trots behind the stone. It scans the spellbook lying
text: open on the ground, then disappears in a gyrating white
text: cloud and becomes Ergo again. As he sneaks back to his own
text: blanket, he sees the Cyclops watching him with a smile.
speaker_heading: ERGO

dialog: I still say it was a foolish wish.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD NEAR SWAMP OF BETRAYAL - DAY

speaker_heading: ERGO

speaker_heading: CYCLOPS

speaker_heading: ERGO

dialog: I'm very glad.
scene_heading: EXT. FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD - INTERCUT - DAY
text: Concealed at the side of the road are ten Slayers and Sweyn,
text: the robber who refused to go along with the band. He points
text: down the road at the approaching band. The Chief Slayer
text: nods, and hands him a leather purse full of gold coins,
text: which Sweyn tucks in his jacket. They mount their horses and
text: start down the road.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Slayers!
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: We must enter the swamp.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Few have survived it.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL

speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Yes, it's our only chance. They
dialog: can't use their horses there.
dialog: Quickly.
scene_heading: EXT. SWAMP OF BETRAYAL - DAY
text: A mangrove swamp, with a lattice-work of gnarled roots
text: hovering above dark waters. The band enters the swamp.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: Do not let the waters touch you.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: What will happen?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You will be devoured by your own
dialog: mind.
text: Colwyn and Torquil help the old man, Ynyr, while the Cyclops
text: takes care of the two little ones, Ergo and Titch, sometimes
text: lifting one in each hand to deposit them on the next root.
text: The Slayers reach the edge of the Swamp and dismount. Sweyn
text: and the Chief Slayer lead them in.
text: The band is halfway across the Swamp when Colwyn suddenly
text: slips and plunges into the water.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (extends a hand)
dialog: Take hold!
dialog: But the waters of betrayal have begun their work:
speaker_heading: COLWYN'S POV
text: He sees Torquil stand and embrace Lyssa, who comes from
text: behind a tree.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Let him drown.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: Yes. Then we'll marry and you will
dialog: be my king.
text: They kiss.
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
text: Colwyn draws his sword and swings at Torquil.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (to Torquil)
dialog: He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.
dialog: (to Colwyn)
dialog: Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
speaker_heading: COLWYN'S POV
text: He sees Ynyr stand and talk to someone behind the tree.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: I have delivered him into your
dialog: hands. Now pay me the price we
dialog: agreed on.
text: A black claw appears, pouring gold coins into Ynyr's hand.
dialog: BACK TO SHOT
text: Colwyn lunges at Ynyr.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I will melt that gold and pour it
dialog: down your throat, old man!
speaker_heading: YNYR
text: He sees betrayal everywhere. He will
dialog: attack us so long as he is
dialog: conscious.
text: They glance anxiously at the Slayers, closing quickly. Titch
text: reaches into Ergo's voluminous coat and pulls out a soup
text: ladle, which he throws at Colwyn. The ladle catches Colwyn
text: in the forehead, knocking him unconscious - but also
text: knocking him backward in the water, out of reach.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (to Torquil)
dialog: Your axe! Lay it out!
text: Torquil tucks the heel of the axe handle under a root and
text: grips it with both hands. Ergo tightropes out the handle and
text: kneels on the axe head, directly above Colwyn.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: I can't hold the weight of both of
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Hush!
text: He squinches his eyes shut and mumbles something to himself.
text: The gyrating white cloud appears with a pop and, when it
text: pops off, Ergo has been transformed into a snake, with its
text: tail wrapped around the axe handle. The snakes plunges into
text: the water and wraps itself around Colwyn's chest. Torquil
text: grits his teeth and pulls up on the axe, lifting the snake
text: and Colwyn out of the water and depositing them on a nexus
dialog: of roots.
text: The white cloud reappears and returns Ergo to human form,
text: barely conscious, coughing and spitting water.
text: Meanwhile, the Slayers are almost upon them. The Cyclops has
text: moved to the rear with Kegan, Oswin, and Rhu. As the Chief
text: Slayer comes within range, the Cyclops lunges with his
text: trident, slicing the root on which the Slayer stands and
text: spilling him into the dark waters. Sweyn kneels to help him
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: CHIEF SLAYER
dialog: Traitor!
text: He stabs Sweyn in the chest, slicing through the purse of
text: gold coins. Sweyn tumbles into the water, blood and gold
text: pouring out of the gash in his jacket. The Chief Slayer
text: attacks the others, wounding some, knocking several into the
text: water - and they, in turn, attack their fellows.
text: The band stares in awed silence as the Slayers massacre each
text: other. The din of battle fades; the Slayers, dead to a man,
text: float in the water.
text: As Colwyn regains consciousness, the others gather round.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Forgive me, my friends. I saw
dialog: terrible things.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: They do not exist, except in the
dialog: waters of the Swamp, where they will
dialog: remain.
scene_heading: EXT. OPPOSITE EDGE OF THE SWAMP - DAY
text: The band emerges from the Swamp, which laps at the foot of
text: the Widow's Mountain. Ynyr faces Colwyn and Torquil.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: From here, I must go alone.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: You will tell me her name and we
dialog: will go together.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (with peculiar emphasis)
dialog: You must never know her name.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: If more than one approaches, she
dialog: will certainly kill them. Alone I
dialog: may have a chance.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (hand on Colwyn's shoulder)
dialog: Each to his fate, lad.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Each to his fate. Wait for me at the
dialog: inn. If I am not back by dawn, you
dialog: will know my fate, and you must go
dialog: on without me.
text: He turns and starts up the mountain.
text: At the rear of the group, the Cyclops heads toward a forest,
text: carrying Titch on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: We'll meet you at the inn.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: Can't I come, too?
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: No.
text: The Cyclops moves off with Titch.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Titch rides on the Cyclop's shoulders, straddling his neck.
text: He holds a small crossbow at the ready.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: (whispers and points)
dialog: Over there.
text: Titch takes aim at a great stag, bracing his arm against the
text: top of the Cyclops's head.
scene_heading: INT. INN - NIGHT
text: Kegan, Oswin, and Rhun are downing flagons of sack and
text: dandling pretty INN-GIRLS on their knees. Torquil eyes them
text: enviously from the fireplace across the room, but can't
text: bring himself to leave Colwyn, who takes no comfort from
dialog: wine or women.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Go, join them.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: What kind of friend do you think I
dialog: am?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: The best. But my unhappiness is not
dialog: made lighter by adding your's to it.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Well, it is true that if I received
dialog: a royal command I couldn't very well
dialog: disobey it, could I?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (little smile)
dialog: Go. I command you.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Yes, my lord.
text: He strides across the room, seizes a pair of Inn-Girls by
text: the waist and swings them around.
text: Ergo, sitting near Colwyn, stares despondently into the
dialog: fire.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Try your tricks on me and I'll turn
dialog: myself back into a snake and bite
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: You and I will guard the fire.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: What else is left for a man without
dialog: friends.
text: Colwyn glances out a back window and sees the body of a stag
text: being carried past on someone's shoulders.
scene_heading: EXT. WIDOW'S MOUNTAIN - NIGHT
text: Ynyr climbs toward the hourglass opening of the Widow's cave
text: above, lit by an eerie light from within.
scene_heading: INT. WIDOW'S CAVE - NIGHT
text: A gigantic web of crystal stretches across a vast, domed
text: cavern, shimmering in the luminescence from below. At the
text: center of the web is a domed cubicle, made of criss-crossed
text: ribbons of mirror glass. Light flashes off the mirrors in
text: such a way that it is impossible to see, through the
text: openings, who or what is within.
text: The blinding effect does not occur inside the cubicle, so
text: that a POV SHOT from inside shows the entire web clearly. It
text: also shows, reflected from hundreds of facets on the inside
text: of the structure, the face of the WIDOW, the old woman who
text: sits at the center: a hideous crone, grotesque and
text: distorted. She sees Ynyr standing at the edge of the web.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: (low)
dialog: Someone comes here.
text: She picks up an hourglass, containing only a handful of
text: sand, and turns it to start the sand running out.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: This is his time.
text: Ynyr is shouting at her from the edge of the web.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: I am Ynyr. I seek the Widow.
text: But sound does not pierce the cubicle. From inside it, one
text: can only see his lips moving.
text: Ynyr steps onto the web and starts toward the center. When
text: he's halfway across, he turns to see a giant black widow
text: spider made of crystal, entirely translucent except for a
text: red hourglass in the center of its crystal abdomen. As the
text: spider approaches Ynyr and prepares to attack, the red color
text: expands, filling the abdomen first, then spreading through
text: the rest of the body.
text: Ynyr holds up his glaive. The spider stops, begins moving
text: sideways; the redness fades. Inside the cubicle, the
text: hourglass sand has almost run out.
text: The spider twitches a crystal strand, throwing Ynyr off
text: balance and causing the glaive to fly from his hand. It
text: sticks in a crystal strand, too far to reach. Ynyr is
text: helpless. The spider advances, reddening.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (desperate shout)
dialog: Lyssa!
text: This name has the power to pierce the soundproof cubicle:
text: the Widow stands as she hears the name, ECHOED by the huge
dialog: cavern.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Who speaks that name!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Ynyr!
text: She watches as the spider looms over Ynyr. Then she reaches
text: behind her and turns the hourglass, just as the last grains
text: of sand run out. This causes the spider to back away,
text: turning translucent again. Ynyr retrieves the glaive and
text: makes his way to the domed cubicle.
text: He enters the cubicle to find the Widow facing away from
text: him, though he can see her hideous face reflected back by
text: the mirrors in front of her.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: It is fifty years since I heard that
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: It is fifty years since I spoke it
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: I was beautiful then.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: The most beautiful woman in the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: But you would not stay with me.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Could not. Could not betray the girl
dialog: to whom I was betrothed.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: She was not as beautiful.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: No, she was not as beautiful.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: She bore you many children?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: We had no children.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: You had a son.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (staggered)
dialog: You said nothing. You told me
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: You had left me! I kept silent out
dialog: of rage.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Where is he? My son.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: I killed him when he was born.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: This place is my punishment.
text: The old man bends his head sadly. When he looks up, he sees
text: in the mirrors that tears are coursing down the Widow's
text: cheek. As he watches the tears, the mirrored face turns to
text: that of a beautiful young girl. And the Widow is stunned to
text: find that she sees the reflections as he sees them: the face
text: of a young girl.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: Do not try your trickery on me!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: It is no trickery.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: Those are reflections.
dialog: (turns to face him)
dialog: This is my face!
text: When she starts to turn, we SEE her as old. But when she
text: faces Ynyr, we SEE her THROUGH HIS EYES: as a young girl.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You see?
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yes.
text: A REVERSE ANGLE explains her smile: she sees him as the
dialog: young man who loved her.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Memory is no trick, it is a power.
dialog: The power to see.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: Power you have given me. What can my
dialog: power give you?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Knowledge.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: The Fortress of Krull. When will it
dialog: come near here?
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: Why must you know?
speaker_heading: YNYR
text: There is a girl there. Her name is
dialog: Lyssa.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: You lie!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (touches her cheek)
dialog: Could I lie to you and still see
dialog: your beauty?
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: (lowers her eyes)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: YNYR
text: A young man seeks her. A young man
dialog: about the age I was when I met you.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will
text: rise with the sun in the Valley of
dialog: Reeds. But the knowledge is of no
dialog: use to you. No man has ever escaped
dialog: the Web. And soon the creature will
dialog: come for you, even here.
text: Ynyr touches his glaive.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: It will not help.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Then the other Lyssa will share your
dialog: fate. She will grow old in the
dialog: Fortress as you have grown old here.
text: The Widow takes a small gold hourglass from a mirrored
dialog: niche.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: Hold out your hand.
text: She breaks the hourglass and pours the sand into his open
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: Those are the sands of my life. So
dialog: long as they remain in your hand,
dialog: the creature cannot harm you.
text: Ynyr closes his hand, but the sand trickles out through his
text: fingers. He tries clenching it tightly, but the sand
dialog: continues to run.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: I cannot stop the sand.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: You cannot stop time. Go now, before
text: it runs out.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You will come with me.
speaker_heading: WIDOW
dialog: There is sand enough for only one
dialog: life. Go now, save the other.
text: She watches Ynyr make his way across the web toward the cave
text: entrance. The ANGLE is BEHIND HER, and we SEE her hands grow
text: gnarled and mottled, her body become that of an old woman
text: once again - but when we SWING AROUND IN FRONT OF HER, we
text: SEE that her face is still that of a young girl.
text: The crystal spider scuttles across the web to attack Ynyr.
text: But the old man holds up his clenched fist and shows the
text: sand running from his fingers.
text: Stymied, the spider crouches and turns blood red. A scream
text: of rage fills the cave.
text: Ynyr reaches the safety of the entrance and looks back: the
text: blood-red spider scuttles to the center of the web and
text: smashes open the cubicle. Ynyr looks at his hand: the sand
text: has run out.
text: As the old man makes his way sadly down the mountain ...
text: A SHOT OF THE WIDOW
text: Shows her encased in a web shroud; and though her body is
text: old, she retains, even in death, the face of a young girl.
scene_heading: INT. INN - NIGHT
text: Torquil and his men dandle INN GIRLS on their knees,
text: laughing, leching, and guzzling. The INNKEEPER bustles
text: about, assisted by a much-abused serving girl named VEELA,
text: whose beauty is concealed by kerchiefed hair, frumpy
text: clothes, and a layer of soot.
text: Across the room, Colwyn and Ergo sit in front of the fire,
text: staring gloomily into the flames.
text: Titch comes in the back door and whispers to Torquil, who
text: signals his men. They get up and head for the back wall,
text: where Cyclops is swinging open a pair of large double doors.
text: Ergo is too glum to notice the sudden diminution of noise,
text: but Colwyn sees Torquil and his men carrying in a giant
text: venison pie, ten feet across and five feet high.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: (comes up to Ergo)
dialog: Ergo?
text: The little man hunches forward, refusing to answer.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord
dialog: Ergo? ...
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: First, you desert me, and now you
dialog: mock me. Go back to your one-eyed
dialog: friend.
text: Titch reaches out and presses the end of Ergo's nose.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: What? Now you poke me in the nose as
dialog: well?
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: I don't think it's working.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Not working? This nose? This nose
dialog: works day and night. This nose has
dialog: never loafed an hour in its life.
dialog: This nose ...
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: What?
dialog: (sniffs again)
dialog: Impossible. This nose asleep while
dialog: venison fills the air?
dialog: (seizes Titch)
dialog: Where is it, boy? Tell me where it
dialog: is and I forgive you everything.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: It's right behind you.
text: Ergo turns and his eyes grow as big as the pie.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (awed whisper)
text: A venison pie as big as a house.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
text: A small house.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: And what do you think a small person
dialog: lives in, you one-eyed fool? Leaving
dialog: me here to mope while you and the
dialog: boy were arranging my assassination.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: We meant only to please you.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: And do you think I'm not going to
dialog: eat myself to death this very night?
dialog: Huh?
text: The dwarf approaches the pie worshipfully.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Look at its beauty. Look at its
dialog: grace.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (holds out a knife)
dialog: Look at its insides.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss
dialog: it a little. Let me run my fingers
text: over its lovely skin.
dialog: (climbs onto the pie)
dialog: Let me climb to the top and sing to
dialog: it.
text: He clambers up the crust and stands on top of the pie.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Henceforth I am Lord Ergo, for now I
dialog: have an estate to rule.
text: He kneels and embraces the crust.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (crooning)
dialog: Let us go then, you and I, my sweet
dialog: and hot and lovely pie ...
text: The crust suddenly gives way beneath him; he plunges into
text: the pie, disappearing completely. The onlookers laugh and
text: applaud. But when he doesn't reappear, they grow worried.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: (knocks on the crust)
dialog: Ergo? Are you all right?
text: Ergo's head pops up through the crust.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Here lies Lord Ergo, drowned in a
text: venison pie. He died with a smile
dialog: and a belch, goodbye, goodbye ...
text: He disappears inside the pie again. The others crowd around
text: and begin dismembering it.
scene_heading: INT. INN - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Colwyn and the Cyclops stand guard over sleeping robbers and
text: inn girls. Ergo floats half-awake in the gravy in the pie
text: shell, a contented smile on his face. He opens his mouth and
text: allows a piece of venison to float into it. Then he hears
text: whimpering and peers over the edge of the crust: Titch is
text: asleep nearby, in the throws of a nightmare.
text: The serving girl, Vella, is still busy cleaning up. As she
text: passes the pie shell, she hears scrabbling and splashing,
text: and stops to see a puppy trying to clamber out.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: Lift him out.
text: Vella lifts out the puppy and sets it on the floor. The
text: puppy shakes itself, then trots over to Titch. The boy hugs
text: the puppy to his chest.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: (to Cyclops)
dialog: It's the little man called Ergo,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: He must care a lot for the boy.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: (coming over)
dialog: You lazy slut! I don't pay you to
text: stand around jawing with the guests!
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Leave her be. She's worked hard all
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: She'll work till dawn if I choose!
text: He cuffs the girl, knocking her to the floor, but backs away
text: as Colwyn approaches.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (an order)
dialog: Her working day is over. She'll rest
dialog: now.
text: The Innkeeper scowls, then skulks off, grumbling. Colwyn
text: helps the girl up and sees that her ankle has been twisted
text: by her fall. He puts an arm around her and helps her toward
dialog: the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. CENTER OF VORTEX
text: Lyssa moves around the walkway, looking for escape, but all
text: the passages leading out of the Center are blocked by red
dialog: eyes.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Have you considered?
text: She turns to see the gigantic red eyes in the Beast's hole.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: I do not want your power. It is
dialog: hideous.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: You know nothing of power, you
dialog: foolish girl. You think power is a
dialog: mighty sword, or a strong castle, or
text: the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer.
dialog: Power is none of these.
text: The red eyes in the hole disappear. Lyssa hears the voice
text: behind her.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Power is beauty.
text: She turns to see a Greek Adonis standing behind her. His
text: naked body glistens with oil; he is incredibly handsome.
text: (But his eyes are red.) She retreats. The Adonis vanishes
text: and Lyssa feels her hand clasped gently. She turns to see a
text: girl of her own age, smiling at her. (But her eyes are red
text: and she speaks with the Voice of Darkness.)
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Power is friendship.
text: When Lyssa pulls her hand away, the girl vanishes.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Power is joy.
text: Lyssa sees herself (but with red eyes) as a young mother,
text: holding a baby and laughing.
text: Then she feels a hand on her cheek and turns to see Colwyn
text: (red-eyes), smiling at her as he caresses her cheek. He
text: speaks with the dark Voice.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Power is desire.
text: She knows, from the eyes and voice, that this is not the
text: real Colwyn. But loneliness and fear and longing are
text: beginning to take their toll. She touches his hand, presses
text: it against her cheek.
speaker_heading: VELLA (OVER)
dialog: The cruelest fate is to be far from
dialog: the one you love, not knowing
dialog: whether you will ever see him again.
scene_heading: INT. VELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Vella sits dejectedly on the edge of the bed. Colwyn stands
dialog: near.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: I was betrothed to a boy from my
dialog: village. We were to be married this
dialog: summer, but he traveled across the
dialog: sea and his ship was lost.
dialog: (bows her head, whispers)
dialog: They say he drowned, but I know he
dialog: is alive. I know he will come back
dialog: to me.
text: Moved by her grief, Colwyn sits on the bed and takes her in
text: his arms to comfort her.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I know the cruelty of such a fate.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: (lifts her head)
dialog: Perhaps you think no man would
dialog: return to me.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I don't think that.
text: Vella stands and slips the kerchief from around her hair,
text: which is long and lustrous. It tumbles loose, falling
text: gracefully around her shoulders. She wipes the sleeve across
text: her face and, almost magically, the smudges and dirt
text: disappear. She steps out of her ungainly shoes, then
text: unfastens her ugly dress; it falls to her feet. She stands
text: barefoot in her chemise, stunningly beautiful.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: Am I not worth returning to?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: Am I not beautiful enough to be
dialog: loved?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: Even by you?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (drops his eyes)
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INT. VORTEX - NIGHT
text: The red-eyed Colwyn holds Lyssa's hand as he makes his
dialog: proposal.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: This I tell you: our children will
dialog: be princes. They will have the power
dialog: of my darkness and the power of your
dialog: blood. They will conquer galaxies.
text: Lyssa back away, shaking her head no.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: They will make you a queen. A queen
dialog: of worlds uncountable.
text: The red-eyed Colwyn waves his hand and a stone wall cracks
dialog: open.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: These are the galaxies you will
dialog: rule.
text: Through the crack, we see galaxies moving toward us, slowly
text: at first, then faster. We see not only the familiar galactic
text: forms - spirals, ellipses, spheres - but shapes and colors
text: never seen from Earth: exploding galaxies of red stars,
text: whirling galaxies of yellow and blue, galaxies writhing as
text: if in pain. They move toward us, faster and faster, until
text: they becomes blurs of light and color. Another wall cracks
dialog: open.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: These are the worlds of your empire.
text: We see planets moving toward us: Earthlike planets of blue
text: and green, volcanic planets spitting flame, gaseous planets,
text: ringed planets, planets with a hundred moons. Another wall
text: cracks open.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: These are the beings who will be
dialog: your slaves.
text: We see crowds of living creatures, some humanoid, others
text: with shapes never seen, prostrating themselves in obeisance,
text: keening their pain and fear.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: I do not want your worlds or your
dialog: slaves.
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Then look!
text: Another wall cracks open. We see Colwyn and Vella in a close
dialog: embrace.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: It's a lie!
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: These walls do not lie! He will
dialog: betray you.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: He will not!
scene_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST
dialog: Then he will die!
scene_heading: INT. VELLA'S ROOM - INTERCUT
text: Colwyn and Vella in each other's arms.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: You too are lonely.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I ache with it.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: Let me comfort you.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I cannot take comfort when she has
dialog: none.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: Then give me comfort. Sleep with me
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I cannot betray my bride.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: One night is no betrayal. Have pity
dialog: on me.
dialog: (begins to cry)
dialog: Please, I beg you, do not refuse me.
dialog: You do not know the price.
text: Her tears wash the blue dye from her eyes and we see that
text: her eyes are red.
text: Colwyn is in the arms of a Dark One.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I feel your pain, but I cannot
dialog: betray her.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: You will not, then?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I cannot.
text: Vella's left hand turns into a claw. She moves it toward his
text: neck, then stops. She begins to cry; blood-red tears run
text: down her cheeks.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: My master told me: make him betray
dialog: her; if he will not, kill him.
text: Colwyn steps back from her.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: (thrusts out her claw)
dialog: Yes, he is my master.
text: Colwyn plucks his glaive from his belt and poises it to
dialog: throw.
speaker_heading: VELLA
text: These talons were a heartbeat from
dialog: your throat. I could have killed you
text: in an instant.
text: Colwyn lowers the glaive.
speaker_heading: VELLA
dialog: But in the hour I knew you, I loved
dialog: you. That love is life for you and
dialog: death for me. Remember me.
text: In the Vortex, Lyssa stares defiantly at the red-eyed
dialog: Colwyn.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: It is you who are betrayed.
text: The red-eyed Colwyn extends his left hand, which turns into
text: a claw; the talons clutch the empty air - and in her room,
text: Vella gasps as she is strangled.
text: The red-eyed Colwyn snaps his arm sideways - and Vella is
text: flung across her room against the wall. Her body
text: disintegrates, leaving only gray ash and an empty chemise.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Have faith, Lyssa. I will come.
text: In the Vortex, the false Colwyn has vanished. The huge red
text: eyes have reappeared in the Beast's hole.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: He will come for me.
speaker_heading: VOICE OF THE BEAST (OVER)
dialog: He will not come. You will be my
dialog: queen.

scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY OF REEDS - SUNRISE

speaker_heading: TORQUIL

speaker_heading: TORQUIL

speaker_heading: CYCLOPS

dialog: (to Torquil)
dialog: Saddles.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
text: The innkeeper.
text: As Colwyn and Torquil move toward the inn, Ynyr draws the
text: Cyclops aside, glancing at the bands of white linen on his
dialog: wrists.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (low, to Cyclops)
dialog: It is dangerous for you.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: It will only be a few hours. Then I
dialog: will accept my fate.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSH - DAY
text: The band watches from the edge of the marsh as the Cyclops
text: stands knee-deep in water, facing the charge of a dozen
text: fire-mares.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: They'll trample him to death!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: No. He will master the leader.
text: The fire-mares charge past the Cyclops, who disappears in a
text: cloud of smoke and steam and spray. They wheel and charge
text: again, circling him. He fixes his eyes on the lead mare, who
text: pulls out of the circle and comes toward him. The Cyclops
text: places his hand on the mare's muzzle and the horse stands
text: quietly. The others follow suit, forming a circle around
dialog: him.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSH - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: The band is mounted, except for the Cyclops. Titch sits
text: behind Colwyn.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Quell?
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: I cannot go with you, my friend.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: It is today?
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: Yes. It is today.
text: The band files past him, each man reaching down to shake his
text: hand. Ergo is next to last. His mouth works as he tries to
text: speak, but no words come out. The Cyclops embraces him.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: My heart stays here.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: And mine goes with you.
text: Ergo moves off, wiping his nose on his sleeve. Colwyn is
text: last, with Titch sitting behind him.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (to Titch)
dialog: You're too young to come with us,
dialog: lad. Stay with our friend.
text: He swings the boy to the ground, then grips the Cyclops's
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Each to his fate.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: Each to his fate.
text: The Cyclops stands beside Titch, holding the boy's hand,
text: watching the band move off.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (to Colwyn, as they ride)
dialog: He ran a great risk, helping us
dialog: today. If he opposes his fate, his
dialog: death will be terribly painful.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (looking back)
dialog: Let us wish him peace.
text: The Cyclops is sitting cross-legged on the ground, having
text: wound a white linen headband around his forehead. Titch sits
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (pointing up)
dialog: We must cover a hundred leagues
text: before sunrise.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (stand in his stirrups)
dialog: At the gallop!
text: As the mares increase their speed, their sparking hooves
text: begin to flash, until, at full gallop, their feet and
text: fetlocks are enveloped in flame. They thunder down the road
text: on a carpet of fire.
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGE - SUNSET
text: In long shot, we see the fire-mares silhouetted against the
text: darkening sky, galloping along the spine of the ridge on a
text: thin line of flame.
scene_heading: EXT. FORD - NIGHT
text: A GATEKEEPER comes out of his hut as he hears approaching
text: hoof-beats. A wooden gate stretches across the road, barring
dialog: the ford.
speaker_heading: GATEKEEPER
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: If they're nobles, it'll cost 'em
dialog: gold.
text: The Gatekeeper's mouth drops as the fire-mares round the
text: curve and smash through the gate, causing the stream to boil
text: and hiss as they gallop through it. He stares at the clouds
text: of steam that mark their passage.
speaker_heading: GATEKEEPER
dialog: (plaintive whine)
dialog: I would've settled for silver.
scene_heading: EXT. LOG ROAD IN SWAMP - NIGHT
text: With hoofbeats audible in the distance, half a dozen THIEVES
text: huddle on the log road, preparing an ambush.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: To your places. If they resist, show
dialog: no mercy!
text: The thieves kneel at the edge of the log road, weapons at
text: the ready. The Leader stands in the middle of the road,
text: notches an arrow, and draws his bow.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Hold, or you are dead men!
text: His eyes turn to saucers as the fire-mares round the curve
text: and bear down on him. He yelps and dives into the swamp,
text: along with the rest of his band. The fire-mares thunder
text: past, leaving the thieves gulping swamp-water and the log
text: road in flames.
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY OF REEDS - JUST BEFORE DAWN
text: The horizon shows light gray as the fire-mares streak across
text: the valley, leaving a trail of blazing reeds.
text: Two dozen Slayers ride from the Fortress to oppose them.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (shouts to Torquil)
dialog: It's almost dawn! Flank them!
text: Torquil leads half the band to the right, Colwyn leads the
text: other half to the left. They sweep past the Slayers on
text: either side, surrounding them with a ring of fire. The
text: Slayers are enveloped by flames as the band reconverges and
text: heads toward the high wall of the Fortress.
text: But a dismounted Slayer pierces the fiery wall, his clothes
text: flaming, and hurls a spear at Rhun at the tail of the band.
text: Colwyn and Torquil look back and see Rhun skewered by the
text: spear, the point protruding from his chest. Torquil shakes
text: his head and they continue toward the wall.
text: But atop the wall, hidden behind the crenellated parapet,
text: wait another dozen Slayers with cauldrons of boiling pitch
text: at the ready.
text: Colwyn reaches the bottom of the wall and swings off his
dialog: mare.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Up the wall! Quickly!
text: The others dismount and follow him up the wall, which is
text: canted back some twenty degrees from the vertical, allowing
text: them to clamber up the stone courses. But suddenly a stream
text: of boiling pitch pours down the wall toward them.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Look out!
text: They dodge the hissing steam of pitch, but a second stream
text: catches Oswin, who screams as he's enveloped by the boiling
dialog: liquid.
text: Colwyn and Torquil look up to see a cauldron of pitch being
text: moved into position directly above them. But Torquil points
dialog: down the wall where ...
text: ... the Cyclops is galloping along the parapet, the hooves
text: of his fire-mare sparking against the stone. Titch stands on
text: the saddle behind him, with a crossbow laid across his broad
text: shoulder. The boy looses a bolt and hits one of the Slayers
text: at the cauldron, saving Colwyn and Torquil.
text: The Slayers loose a hail of arrows, several of which strike
text: the Cyclops in the chest. But he keeps coming, and Titch
text: keeps firing bolts from behind his shoulder, felling Slayers
dialog: like deer.
text: As the twin suns are about to rise, the Slayers overturn the
text: great cauldron of pitch, which pours down the wall, heading
dialog: straight for Colwyn ...
scene_heading: EXT. ARCTIC LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
text: The Fortress rises out of the ice and Colwyn looks up to see
text: the stream of pitch frozen solid, not three feet above them.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: On them!
text: He leads the band up the wall to the parapet, where the
text: Cyclops has dismounted and is holding off several Slayers,
text: shielding Titch, who is still firing his deadly bolts. A
text: brief but fierce battle disposes of the Slayers.
text: The band gathers around the fallen Cyclops. A dozen broken-
text: off arrow shafts protrude from his body. He holds Ergo's
text: small hand in one of his great paws.
speaker_heading: CYCLOPS
dialog: (dying smile)
dialog: A man can ask nothing more than that
text: his death help his friends.
text: His hand tightens with the pain that he has brought upon
text: himself, then his fingers open slowly. Ergo stifles a sob as
text: the great eye closes in death.
text: Torquil calls Colwyn's attention to yet another group of
text: Slayers in the distance. Colwyn leads the band across an ice
text: bridge to a stone door encased in ice. They hack through the
text: ice and swing open the door, which opens onto a set of stone
text: stairs leading down.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (glance toward Slayers)
dialog: I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: It is not necessary. They will not
dialog: follow.
scene_heading: INT. STONE STAIRWAY - INTERCUT - DAY
text: The band moves down the stairs.
text: Above, the Slayers reach the stone door, but they're clearly
text: reluctant to descend. One steps forward and starts down -
text: but then hears the eerie screams of the Dark Ones below. He
text: scurries back up and, with the others, backs away from the
dialog: door.
text: On the stairs below, the eerie screams are deafening,
text: echoing through the stone corridors. Ynyr leads the band,
text: taking them down the stairs, across a landing, and down
text: another flight of stairs.
text: Torquil notices mortar crumbling between the stones of the
dialog: staircase.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Look.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes, they are weakening. It takes
dialog: great power to maintain the
dialog: Fortress, and they have expended
dialog: much.
scene_heading: INT. STONE CORRIDOR
text: The band hurries down the corridor, pursued by dozens of red
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (looking back)
dialog: They're gaining on us.
dialog: (draws his sword)
dialog: We must slow them up with steel.
text: They are standing beneath a Romanesque arch that supports
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (looks up at the arch)
dialog: Better stone than steel.
text: He draws his sword and inserts it beside the capstone of the
text: arch, working the blade to loosen the mortar. Torquil
text: follows his thought and begins chopping at the mortar on the
text: other side of the capstone.
text: The red eyes are almost on them when they finally succeed in
text: dislodging the capstone. They jump back as the capstone
text: falls and the arch collapses, blocking the corridor with a
text: wall of stone rubble.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: You're resourceful, my lad.
dialog: (grins)
dialog: I tell you, one year under my
dialog: tutelage and I could make you the
dialog: Prince of Thieves.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Subject to the King, no doubt.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (modest bow)
dialog: Naturally.
text: Suddenly, a black claw bursts from the stone rubble and
text: clutches Torquil by the neck. Colwyn quickly draws his sword
text: and hacks off the arm, which disintegrates into gray ash.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (fingering his neck)
dialog: A good thrust, my friend. Another
dialog: second and there'd have been nothing
dialog: between my head and shoulders but
dialog: bad memories.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I intend to keep you alive, your
dialog: majesty. So you can abdicate your
dialog: throne and become my Warlord.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Perhaps. If the pay is good.
text: Colwyn signals Ynyr, who leads the group down the corridor
text: and then down yet another flight of stone stairs. They
dialog: emerge in ...
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN OF AGE
text: A pillared cave, pitch black. We hear the rasping sound of
text: labored breathing, as of old men close to death.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (calls softly)
dialog: Stay together.
text: They move through the cave, weapons at the ready. A feeble
text: voice calls out.
speaker_heading: OLD TORQUIL
dialog: Torquil ...
text: Torquil turns to see a wizened, hollow-eyed old man: himself
text: at the end of his life.
speaker_heading: OLD TORQUIL
dialog: Do not let this happen, Torquil.
text: A PRIESTESS OF YOUTH steps out from behind a pillar: she is
text: eighteen, wearing a transparent garment that shows the
text: stunning beauty of her young body. She holds a golden goblet
text: containing a rainbow-colored liquid.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: It need not happen, Torquil. Drink
dialog: the rainbow. It is youth.
text: She reaches behind the pillar and takes the hand of YOUNG
text: TORQUIL, pulling him into view: it is Torquil as he was at
dialog: eighteen.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: It is your youth, Torquil.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (touches Torquil)
dialog: This is the Cavern of Age. Touch
dialog: nothing, take nothing, or the future
dialog: will be plunged into your heart.
text: Torquil shudders as he looks at the old man he will become,
text: horrified by the gaping face of his own future. Colwyn takes
text: his arm and gently pulls him away. But the Priestess of
text: Youth slips ahead, appearing again with the Young Torquil,
text: this time in passionate embrace. As she caresses the youth,
text: she holds out the goblet to Torquil.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: Drink the rainbow, Torquil. Youth is
dialog: yours. I am yours. Take me, Torquil.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (guiding him past)
dialog: She lies, my friend.
text: Now it is Ergo's turn to confront the future. He sees
text: himself as an old man, bald and shrunken, at the edge of
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: OLD ERGO
dialog: Ergo, save yourself. Save yourself
dialog: from this.
text: >From behind a pillar appears a FAIRY PRIESTESS OF YOUTH,
text: golden-haired, beautiful, holding a gold goblet. She tilts
text: the goblet and pours some of the rainbow liquid into her
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: FAIRY PRIESTESS
dialog: (holds out her cupped hand)
dialog: Drink from my hand, Ergo. I can save
dialog: you.
text: Ergo starts toward her, but Titch grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: (yanking him back)
dialog: Ergo!
text: Ergo allows himself to be pulled along, gazing back
text: wistfully.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was
dialog: so ugly.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: Would you desert your friends?
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: (shaking himself out of it)
dialog: No, no. I'm with you, boy.
text: Bringing up the rear of the group is Kegan. He looks to the
text: side and gasps in horror as he sees himself at age eighty,
text: writhing on the floor, wracked by the pain of a horrible
dialog: last illness.
speaker_heading: OLD KEGAN
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Disease and pain, Kegan. This is
dialog: your future.
text: A PRIESTESS OF YOUTH appears. She is very young, perhaps
text: fifteen, with the kind of beauty that makes a man catch his
text: breath. She holds out the goblet, her face full of
dialog: compassion and concern.
scene_heading: VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS
dialog: (pleading with him)
dialog: Oh please, Kegan, don't let this
dialog: happen. Come to me as you were.
text: A YOUNG KEGAN steps out beside her. He is sixteen, a golden
dialog: youth.
scene_heading: VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS
dialog: Come to me young, Kegan.
text: She steps forward, moving very close to him.
scene_heading: VERY YOUNG PRIESTESS
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Your youth is in the goblet, come to
dialog: me in the rainbow.
text: No mortal man could resist her. She holds the goblet to his
text: lips and he drinks.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
text: (sees him and shouts)
dialog: Kegan!
speaker_heading: YNYR
text: It is too late. He has drunk.
text: The Priestess embraces Kegan. As they kiss, a rainbow arches
text: down and envelopes them in its multi-colored light. But the
text: colors soon fade and the rainbow becomes an arc of white
text: light, growing brighter and more intense. In the blinding
text: light, the Priestess begins to age, turning old before our
text: eyes, as does Kegan himself.
text: The others watch, frozen in horror, as Kegan struggles to
text: escape her embrace. But she clutches him with bony fingers,
text: pressing her wrinkled mouth to his. They topple to the
text: floor, writhing in each other's arms, their skin turning to
text: parchment. The writhing stops. Two skeletons lie on the
text: floor, locked in fatal embrace, the white bones shimmering
text: in the arc of light.
text: As the others continue through the cave, Ergo takes Titch's
text: hand and places it on his arm.
speaker_heading: ERGO
dialog: Keep a tight hold, boy, in case I
dialog: get any more crazy ideas.
scene_heading: INT. OUTER WALL OF VORTEX
text: The band approaches the curving bloodstone wall of the
text: Vortex. Great circular openings in the wall indicate the
dialog: terminal of the Arms.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (to Colwyn)
dialog: They will hold Lyssa in the Center
dialog: of the Vortex, the place of the
dialog: Beast, where its power is greatest.
dialog: No man can match it there. Lyssa
dialog: must try to move toward us. For as
text: we enter the Vortex and move closer
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: (waits, then finishes the
dialog: sentence)
dialog: The Beast will kill her.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes. To keep her from you. But now
dialog: that we are inside the Fortress, you
dialog: will be able to contact her.
text: Colwyn kneels on the floor, elbow on knee, bending his
text: forehead against his hand in concentration.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Lyssa ...
scene_heading: INT. CENTER OF VORTEX - INTERCUT
text: Lyssa is halfway up the spiraled wall of the Vortex, midway
text: between the Beast's hole below and the passage above - all
text: of which are guarded by red eyes.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: Colwyn ...
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: You must move away from the Center.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
text: All the passages are guarded.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (hand on Colwyn's shoulder)
dialog: She must make a glaive.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them
dialog: straight and cross them.
text: Lyssa removes a pair of gold bracelets from her arm, bends
text: them straight, and forms a cross.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Now grip them in your hand.
text: She wraps her fingers around the intersection of the cross,
text: converting the bracelets into a kind of homemade glaive.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Will your power outward.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: I don't know how.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: You have the power. Will it.
text: As Lyssa frowns in concentration, her glaive begins to glow.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: Yes. I can do it.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (to Colwyn)
dialog: West.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Take the western passage.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: All directions are the same here.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (to Colwyn)
text: The spiral begins in the west.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
text: Where the spiral begins.
text: Lyssa looks up to where the spiral begins.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Move quickly. We are coming for you.
dialog: We are in the Fortress.
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: (as she smiles)
dialog: I knew you would come.
text: At the outer wall, the band is midway between two of the
text: Arms. Ynyr looks from one to the other, then chooses the one
text: on the left.
dialog: And in the Center, Lyssa must make a similar choice, for the
text: spiral begins midway between two of the Arms. She also
text: chooses the one on the left. She holds the shining glaive in
text: front of her as she moves into the Arm and we hear the
text: scrape of talons and the gutturals of frustration as the red
text: eyes are forced to retreat before it.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST ARM OF VORTEX
text: The band moves down the curving Arm, toward the Center.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND ARM OF VORTEX
text: Lyssa moves out the adjacent Arm, away from the Center. She
text: holds her glaive in front of her, forcing back the red eyes.
scene_heading: INT. CENTER OF VORTEX
text: The huge red eyes of the Beast rise toward the top of its
text: hole. We hear a hideous scream of rage as the Beast
text: discovers Lyssa gone.
text: We do not actually see it emerge from its hole, but we see
text: the reaction of the lesser Dark Ones guarding the passages:
text: they shrink in fear, fleeing up the passages as the Beast
text: climbs out of its hole and up the side of the spiral funnel.
text: As the Beast moves into the west passage, we catch a glimpse
text: of one taloned foot: it is so large that the mind can't
text: conceive of a living creature this huge. It leaves behind a
text: trail of black mud mixed with fragments of a bizarre
text: seaweed: dark red, with spiral leaves.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND ARM OF VORTEX
text: Lyssa glances back fearfully as she hears the Beast coming
dialog: up the Arm.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: Colwyn. Where are you, Colwyn?
scene_heading: INT. FIRST ARM OF VORTEX
text: Ynyr leads the band down the Arm.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (worried)
dialog: We should have reached her by now.
text: Colwyn stops, furrows his brow in concentration.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Lyssa ...
speaker_heading: LYSSA (OVER)
dialog: (breathing hard)
dialog: Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the
text: eyes of the Beast.
text: Colwyn turns toward the right-hand wall of the passage.
speaker_heading: COLWYN (OVER)
dialog: Lyssa, touch the wall of your
dialog: passage.
text: Lyssa presses her hand against the wall behind her.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (runs to the wall)
dialog: She's on the other side of this
dialog: wall. I can feel it!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (covers his eyes)
dialog: I chose the wrong passage.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: She can see the Beast!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Use your sword.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: What use is my sword? I can't reach
dialog: her!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (points to wall)
dialog: Cut. Cut!
text: Colwyn stares at him for a moment, then unsheathes his
text: sword, grips it with both hands, and swings it at the stone
text: wall. The blade strikes the stone with a spine-shivering
text: clang. He swings again - another clang. But on his third
text: swing, the blade bites into the rock, sinking to a depth of
dialog: several inches.
text: On the next swing, the blade penetrates deep into the rock,
text: and on the next, it slices all the way through, tearing
text: loose chunks of stone. Colwyn swings the sword back and
text: forth like a scythe, cutting his way through the solid rock,
text: spraying fragments behind him.
text: In the other passage, Lyssa presses herself against the
text: wall, watching the Beast's eyes come closer. Suddenly, a
text: chuck of rock bursts out of the wall near her as Colwyn cuts
text: through. He seizes her arm and pulls her through the hole,
text: into the adjacent passage.
text: Ynyr lays a hand on Colwyn's shoulder as he embraces Lyssa.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You must move quickly. The Beast
dialog: will stop at nothing now.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (divines his intention)
dialog: You're coming with us.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (shakes his head no)
dialog: It is my fate to die in the
dialog: Fortress.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: No! You cannot know that!
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: I can. Because I choose it.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (imperious)
dialog: I forbid you!
text: Ynyr smiles indulgently. Colwyn shrugs in embarrassment.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I didn't mean it that way. But you
dialog: cannot stay.
text: Ynyr takes Colwyn and Lyssa by the arm and moves up the
dialog: passage.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You cannot stay. You must both
dialog: escape the Fortress or else this
dialog: world is doomed.
scene_heading: INT. OTHER ARM OF VORTEX
text: The Beast moves toward the hole in the passage wall.
scene_heading: RESUME - COLWYN ET. AL.
text: They hear the Beast tearing at the stone wall, enlarging the
text: hole to allow it to pass through. Ynyr nudges Colwyn and
text: Lyssa up the passage.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Go now.
dialog: (turns to Torquil)
dialog: Quell was wise. He knew that a man
dialog: cannot ask more of his death than it
text: help his friends.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
text: (sadly, grips his hand)
dialog: That is true.
text: The wet-eyed Ergo is too choked with emotion to approach the
text: old man. Ynyr lays a hand on Titch's head.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Take care of Ergo.
speaker_heading: TITCH
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: The five move up the passage.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Quickly, or he will waste his life
dialog: for nothing.
text: They increase their pace. Ynyr watches them until they
text: disappear, then backs slowly up the passage.
text: A section of wall explodes inward as the Beast tears his way
text: through. Ynyr sees the red eyes and places a hand on his
dialog: glaive.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: You and I were destined to meet, my
dialog: friend.
text: He flings his glaive, which flies to a point ten feet in
text: front of him and hangs in midair, glowing.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: And I am not so old that I can be
text: swatted like a fly.
text: He thrusts his hand forward - the glaive leaps toward the
text: Beast, giving off a blinding light. The Beast roars and
dialog: retreats.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: No, not so old as that, my black
dialog: beauty.
text: Now the red eyes narrow as the Beast focuses its power on
text: the glaive. The weapon is pushed backwards, slowly but
dialog: surely.
speaker_heading: YNYR
dialog: Yes, you will have to attack me
dialog: directly to kill me. I will cost you
dialog: power, my dark friend. Much power.
text: He thrusts his hand out and the glaive leaps forward - but
text: only a few feet this time. The Beast's power stops it, then
text: continues to push it back toward the old man. He holds out
text: his clenched fist and stops the glaive about five feet in
text: front of him. The Beast's power is so tremendous, however,
text: that the arms of the weapon begin bending backward.
text: Suddenly, one of the horizontal arms snaps off and flies
text: toward Ynyr, grazing his shoulder. He staggers back, but
text: manages to hold the glaive steady. The other horizontal arm
text: snaps off and buries itself in his chest. He goes down on
text: one knee but continues to hold the glaive steady, though the
text: weapon is now reduced to its vertical axis.
text: Finally, his strength gives out. He drops his arm. The
text: vertical blade spins toward him and pierces his throat. The
text: beast moves past his crumpled body, up the passage.
scene_heading: INT. VERY WIDE STAIRCASE
text: The five make their way up the staircase to a landing. As
text: Torquil starts up the next flight, Colwyn calls him back.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: We must find a smaller passage,
text: where it cannot follow.
text: They move down a corridor to ...
scene_heading: INT. DODECAHEDRON
text: They look around in confusion at the doors in each of the
text: twelve sides of the huge room.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: Where is the Fortress?
speaker_heading: COLWYN
text: In the Arctic ice.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: (points to door)
dialog: That way. I can feel the cold.
text: They move to the door, which opens onto a long stairway
text: leading up. At the top, we can see snow blowing past the
dialog: opening.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (pointing up)
dialog: She's right. Look.
text: They hear the Beast coming closer and start up the long
dialog: stairway.
scene_heading: INT. LONG STAIRWAY - NIGHT
text: As the five make their way upward, a terrible noise from
text: below makes them stop and look back: the Beast is tearing
text: away the rock, enlarging the passage to follow them. They
text: quicken their pace.
text: Along the stairs are small piles of fine powder: the mortar
text: between the stones is crumbling and trickling down the
dialog: walls.
scene_heading: EXT. FORTRESS - NIGHT
text: The five emerge from the staircase and make their way across
text: the Arctic landscape, toward the outer wall. Colwyn looks
text: back and sees the Beast tearing its way out of the Fortress.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't
dialog: do battle with that thing.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: There's no way to outrun it. You
dialog: know that. This is what Ynyr was
dialog: preparing me for. It's what he died
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: You'll be killed.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: Don't worry. I'll tap him on the
dialog: head with my sword hilt if I have
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (quietly, but with iron
dialog: authority)
dialog: You'll lead the others to the wall
dialog: as I tell you. Now.
text: Torquil bows to Colwyn's authority; he leads the others
text: toward the wall. Colwyn pulls off his hauberk, useless in
text: this battle, and faces the Beast in his tunic. The wind
text: whips the thin cloth as he advances across the ice to where
text: the Beast waits, obscured by the thickly falling snow.
text: Suddenly, a gigantic chunk of ice flies straight at him. He
text: raises his hand and the ice shatters, streaking past him
text: harmlessly.
text: Now he begins to concentrate, focusing his power until his
text: body gleams - then shimmers - then bursts into flame with
text: tongues of white fire leaping from his body as if it had
text: been doused in gasoline. The flame is under his power; it
text: doesn't harm him, nor does it melt the snow he walks on. It
text: only harms when he wills it - as when he sees a patch of
text: Dark Ones approaching from the side. He sweeps his arm
text: toward them and an arc of flames rolls across the ice like a
text: wave, washing over them and leaving their charred bodies
text: writhing in the snow.
text: The Beast is moving back and forth in an area of ice ridges
text: and hummocks, dimly visible through the heavy snowfall. Near
text: it is a stone tower, some fifty feet high. The tower is
text: suddenly lifted from the ground and hurled at Colwyn. He
text: makes a downward chop with his hand and the tower splits in
text: the middle, the two pieces flying past on either side of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: I am no feeble old man for you to
text: crush with two blows.
dialog: (moves forward, grim-faced)
dialog: This is for that old man.
text: He sweeps his arm toward the Beast and an arc of flame rolls
text: across the ice. As the Beast sidesteps, the flaming arc
text: slices off the top of an ice hummock, leaving the flat
text: surface boiling and steaming from the heat.
text: Colwyn presses forward, driven by grief and rage. He
text: launches a second arc of flame, one end of which catches the
text: Beast's side. The Beast roars with pain and retreats, driven
text: back by Colwyn's power. He launches a third arc, and this
text: one strikes the Beast's head, staggering it.
text: The Beast is wounded now: one of its huge eyes is swollen
text: half shut, the skin around it badly charred. Enraged, the
text: Beast counterattacks. Huge projectiles streak toward Colwyn:
text: first come blocks of ice, then great fragments of stone.
text: Finally, the stone fragments begin to burn, screaming
text: through the air like meteors.
text: The projectiles shatter against Colwyn's protective shield
text: of flame, but the force of repeated impact drives him
text: backward. Small fragments of ice and stone actually pierce
text: the shield, tearing his tunic, cutting his skin. He is
text: bleeding from several flesh wounds and his forehead is
text: burned by a fragment of flaming rock.
text: But the Beast's power is not infinite. The hail of
text: projectiles slows, then stops. Colwyn resumes his advance.
text: He chops his arm downward: we hear a sharp crack and an ice
text: hummock EXPLODES near the Beast. He chops again and an ice
text: ridge EXPLODES, leaving a deep crack in the ice. The Beast
text: hurls another projectile, but Colwyn brushes it aside as if
text: it were a mosquito and sweeps an arc of flame at the Beast
dialog: to back it off.
text: Then he resumes chopping with his arm: crack followed
text: closely on crack as the ice around the Beast is sliced and
text: shattered by Colwyn's power. The section of ice on which the
text: Beast stands suddenly drops a foot or so. The Beast hurls a
text: final projectile, then Colwyn cracks the ice again. We hear
text: a deep RUMBLE and a huge section of ice collapses, falling
text: into the depths of the Fortress, carrying the Beast with it.
text: Watching from a distance, Torquil sees the exhausted Colwyn
text: staggering on the ice, barely able to stand.
speaker_heading: TORQUIL
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: I'll get him. Make for the wall.
text: Torquil heads for Colwyn. Ergo pushes Lyssa and Titch toward
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: ERGO
text: Quickly, quickly to the wall.
text: But Ergo himself turns around and follows Torquil to where
text: Colwyn is stumbling on the ice. Dark Ones flit between the
text: ice hummocks, converging on them.
text: As Torquil helps Colwyn toward the wall, Ergo forms a rear
text: guard, armed with butcher knives from his voluminous coat.
text: As Dark Ones lunge out of the swirling snow, the little man
text: faces them fearlessly, hurling his knives with deadly aim to
text: protect his friends: one creature falls with a knife between
text: the eyes, another with a knife in the neck, a third pierced
text: through the heart.
text: They reach the parapet, where Torquil and Lyssa help Colwyn
text: over the wall. The five clamber down the face of the wall
text: and Torquil is about to jump off onto the icy ground.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (points to horizon)
dialog: Wait!
text: The two suns are about to come up. They remain on the wall -
text: except for Ergo, who slips on a sheet of ice and slides
text: toward the ground. Titch reaches out and grabs his hand,
text: holding him on the wall, though Ergo's legs are buried in
text: snow up to the knees.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST VALLEY - SUNRISE
text: Clinging to the wall, the five look out on a green valley.
text: Ergo's legs are still buried to the knees, but in the
text: ground. The stones of the wall are shifting. The Fortress is
text: collapsing.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: (jumps to the ground)
dialog: Away from the wall!
text: Torquil and Colwyn haul Ergo out of the ground and move away
text: from the wall.
text: They watch the Fortress crumble.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: It's a fitting monument for Ynyr and
text: Quell and the others.
text: The Fortress sinks from sight, leaving a green valley in its
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: That's a better one.
speaker_heading: COLWYN
dialog: Yes.
text: They make their way across the glen, Colwyn and Lyssa with
text: arms around each other, Titch riding on Torquil's shoulder,
text: and the Ergo-puppy riding on Titch's.
speaker_heading: LYSSA
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Where's Ergo?
text: Titch hands her the Ergo-puppy, who licks her face. She
text: laughs and sets the puppy down. It runs in front of them,
text: frisking.
text: PEASANT FAMILIES come out of the forest and join them.
text: Children chase the puppy through the grass.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
