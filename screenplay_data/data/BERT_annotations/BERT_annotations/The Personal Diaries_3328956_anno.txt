text: CLOSE ON a BBC microphone of the 1920's, A formidable piece
text: of machinery suspended on springs.
text: A BBC NEWS READER, in a tuxedo with carnation boutonniere, is
text: gargling while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a
text: towel at the ready. The man in the tuxedo expectorates
text: discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth fastidiously, and
text: signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an atomizer. The
text: Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb, and sprays
text: his inner throat. Now, he’s ready.
text: The reader speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones. There’s no
text: higher creature in the vocal world.

text: CLOSE ON - BERTIE - the Duke of York, second son of the King;
text: his handsome, sensitive, features look terrified.
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER (V.O.)
dialog: The Opening Ceremony was the first
dialog: occasion his Majesty the King
dialog: addressed his subjects on the
text: wireless. The close of the first

speaker_heading: WOOD
dialog: Let the microphone do the work,
dialog: sir.
text: Wood checks his watch.
speaker_heading: WOOD (CONT’D)
dialog: Thirty seconds, sir.
text: Bertie braces his shoulders manfully, but without an ounce of
text: confidence, closes his eyes, nods, opens them, and
text: reluctantly goes through the tunnel towards the light, like a
text: prize-fighter entering the arena, to be greeted by the roar
dialog: of the crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. ROYAL PODIUM - DAY
text: HAND-HELD CAMERA, BERTIE’S POV: far ahead, at a seemingly

text: only thing between the terrified observer and 100,000 people.
text: Silence falls over the stadium.
text: Overhead, thick roiling clouds.
text: BERTIE approaches...like a death march.
text: Bertie’s eyes widen in terror as he reaches the microphone.
text: The red transmission light blinks four times then glows solid
text: red. Bertie is live.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM, BBC BROADCASTING HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I have received from his Majesty

dialog: [For ease of reading, Bertie’s stammer will not be indicated
dialog: from this point in the script.]

text: the stadium PA system.
text: CU huge metal speakers.
text: CU soldiers at rigid attention.
text: CU Wood, he shuts his eyes.
text: CU Cosmo Lang, expressionless.
text: CU Elizabeth, dying.
text: Bertie gulps for air like a beached fish and attempts to

scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM, 145 PICCADILLY - CONTINUOUS
text: CLOSE ON SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM - an elderly, unctuous,
dialog: studiedly-distinguished physician who simultaneously manages
text: to combine pontificating and obsequiousness.
scene_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM
dialog: Inhale deep into your lungs.
dialog: Relaxes your larynx, does it not?
text: Bertie is seated nervously on the edge of a couch, gripping a
text: cigarette between thumb and forefinger, placed in the middle
text: of his mouth.
text: Elizabeth watches from across the room.
speaker_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT'D)
text: Cigarette smoking calms the nerves
dialog: and gives you confidence.
text: Bertie clearly feels nothing of the sort. Smiling
text: ingratiatingly, the doctor produces a medical cannister from
text: his bag.
speaker_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: If Your Highness will be so kind as
dialog: to open his hand...
text: Bertie unclenches a fist.
speaker_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you so very much.
text: Opening the container, with forceps he removes five marbles
text: from an antiseptic solution and places them onto Bertie’s
dialog: palm.
speaker_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Sterilized. Now...if I may take the
dialog: liberty?...insert them into your
dialog: mouth.
text: Bertie obeys, mortified. The doctor hands Bertie a book from
text: his bag.
speaker_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you be so kind as to read.
text: Bertie blanches, his neck muscles twitch and constrict
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I...
dialog: He can’t even say “can’t”.
scene_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM
dialog: Just take your time. Relax.
text: Bertie is unable to do it. Elizabeth watches with growing
dialog: discomfort.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Excuse me, Doctor. What is the
dialog: purpose of this?
scene_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM
dialog: The classic approach that cured
dialog: Demosthenes.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That was in Ancient Greece. Has it
dialog: worked since?
text: Blandine-Bentham passes Bertie a book.
scene_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM
dialog: Now if you would be so kind as to
text: read. A wealth of words.
text: Bertie tries. It is excruciating.
speaker_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Fight against those marbles Your
dialog: Royal Highness. Enunciate!
text: As Bertie struggles.
speaker_heading: SIR BLANDINE-BENTHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: A little more concentration your
dialog: Royal Higness.
text: Bertie spits the marbles out.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (explodes )
dialog: I nearly swallowed the damned
dialog: things!
text: Bertie storms out as Elizabeth tries to placate the doctor.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Thank you so much, Doctor, it’s

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Insert marbles! He can insert his
dialog: own bloody marbles....!
dialog: [Note: when he speaks with his wife there’s hardly any
dialog: hesitation]
text: Elizabeth smiles as she lights the cigarette for him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You can’t keep doing this, Bertie.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I know. Promise me: no more.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HARLEY STREET - NEW DAY
text: A thick grey wet blanket...
text: Out of which materializes the moisture splattered hood of a
text: large AUSTIN.
text: Elizabeth, inside, determinedly glances out.
text: The vehicle noses thru a pea-soup fog. The York’s HOUSE
text: DETECTIVE is walking a few feet in front of the car, finding
dialog: the way.
text: After a moment, the House Detective signals the driver to
text: stop. Elizabeth peers out the window.
text: POV - in the gloom the least attractive and most ill-
text: maintained of the Georgian terraced houses.
text: Elizabeth looks disappointed and dubious. She gets out of the
text: car. Instructing the House Detective to wait outside, she
text: enters the building.
scene_heading: INT. GROUND FLOOR ENTRANCE, HARLEY STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Elizabeth enters, somewhat dampened, the white silk roses
text: decorating her hat now limp.
text: There is a cramped elevator which is whirring noisily and a
text: winding staircase.
text: Elizabeth is even more dubious.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Elizabeth inside the cramped elevator.
text: She surveys the buttons. The bottom one reads “Basement: L.
dialog: Logue, Speech Defects”.
text: She closes the inner gate of the elevator and presses the
dialog: bottom button.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Confused, she opens the inner gate, closes the outer gate
text: then the inner gate and presses the button again. The
text: elevator jumps downwards.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM, LOGUE’S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS
text: Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that’s all.
text: She looks about. The area is devoid of life. Coughs. No
text: response. Calls imperiously:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Hello. Is anyone there?
text: From behind a door:
speaker_heading: MUFFLED VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m just in the loo.
dialog: Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She’s
text: further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being
text: flushed, and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE - a
text: tall, middle-aged man with strong features. His demeanor is
text: friendly, yet professional.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: “Poor and content is rich and rich
dialog: enough”
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Shakespeare. I’m sorry, there’s no
dialog: receptionist. I like to keep things
dialog: simple. How are you Mrs Johnson?
dialog: I’m afraid you’re late.
text: Offers his hand. She takes it, a little gingerly.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I’m afraid I am.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Where’s Mr Johnson?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He doesn’t know I’m here.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That’s not a promising start.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: My husband has seen everyone to no
text: avail. He’s given up hope.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: He hasn’t seen me.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You're awfully sure of yourself.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I’m sure of anyone who wants to be
dialog: cured.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Naturally he wishes to be cured. My
dialog: husband is required to speak
dialog: publicly.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Perhaps he should change jobs.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He can’t.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Indentured servitude?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Something of that nature.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Well have your hubby pop
dialog: by...Tuesday would be good...to
dialog: give his personal history and I’11
dialog: make a frank appraisal.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I do not have a “hubby”. We don’t
dialog: ‘pop’. We never talk about our
dialog: private lives. You must come to us.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Sorry, Mrs J, my game, my turf, my
dialog: rules.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And what if my husband were the
dialog: Duke of York?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: The Duke of York?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Yes the Duke of York.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I thought the appointment was for
dialog: “Johnson”? Forgive me, your
dialog: Royal...?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Highness.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Your Royal Highness.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Johnson was used during the Great
dialog: War when the Navy didn’t want the
dialog: enemy to know ‘he’ was aboard.

dialog: Pause.

dialog: 10
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: We are operating under the
dialog: strictest of confidences.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Of course. I’m considered the
dialog: enemy?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You will be if you remain un-
dialog: obliging.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: How did you find me?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: The President of the Speech
dialog: Therapists Society.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Eileen McCleod? She’s a sport.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Dr McCleod warned me your
dialog: antipodean methods were “unorthodox
dialog: and controversial”. I warned
dialog: her...they were not my favorite
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I succeed.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So she says.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I can cure your husband. But for my
dialog: method to work there must be trust
dialog: and total equality in the safety of
dialog: my consultation room. No
dialog: exceptions.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Well then, in that case...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: When can you start?
scene_heading: SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A well-used Morris Oxford pulls up, driven by Lionel’s eldest
text: son - LAURIE. Lionel is the passenger. As he gets out:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Still sounds a bit rough.
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: You make me drive too slowly, Dad!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Did you pick mum up from Bridge?
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Yes, I’ve hardly been out of the
dialog: car all day.
text: They enter a modest dwelling.
scene_heading: INT. DINING AREA OF LIVING-ROOM, LOGUE FLAT - EVENING
text: Lionel and MYRTLE are finishing up at the table with their
text: three sons. As well as Laurie and ANTONY, there’s their
text: studious middle son VALENTINE, 17, his nose buried in a stack
dialog: of science books.
text: Lionel is bursting to tell Myrtle something.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I had a special visitor today.
speaker_heading: ANTONY
dialog: May I be excused?
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: (to Lionel)
dialog: Oh yes?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You must stay, bored stupid,
dialog: listening to your parents’ inane
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: ANTONY
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Thanks, dad!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: And mum.
speaker_heading: ANTONY
dialog: And mum!
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: How special is special?
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Me too?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: A girl?
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: What else?
dialog: 12
text: He and Antony start to leave.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Take your plates.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Special to the point of someone I
dialog: can’t really talk about.
text: The boys grabs their plates and exit. Lionel looks at
text: Valentine, nose still buried in his text.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: Doctor? Doctor? You can go as well.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: (still studying)
dialog: I’m fine.
text: Lionel clears Valentine’s plate. Valentine goes back to his
dialog: book and scientific oblivion.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Not too high and mighty I hope?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Aah.
text: Antony burst back in, model airplane in hand, doing barrel
text: rolls with sound effects, bombing Valentine with a tea towel.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Not someone who’d...call attention?
dialog: Why bring it up if you can’t talk
dialog: about it?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: Myrtle, just a woman looking to
text: help her husband.
text: They realize from engine noises that Antony is under the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (trying to make light of
dialog: it, not quite succeeding)
dialog: And I had a ‘call’.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Oh yes.
text: Valentine looks up from his book.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: What’s the Illiotibial Tract, Dad?
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: If you don’t know, look it up.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Right.
text: Starts turning pages.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Could be fun.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: It always is.
speaker_heading: LIONEL

scene_heading: INT. CHILDREN’S NURSERY, YORK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Elizabeth, fashionably attired for an evening-out, is curled
text: on a bearskin rug reading to a little girl - LILIBET, 10 -
text: who claps her hands primly, and her younger sister - MARGARET
speaker_heading: ROSE, 5.
text: As Elizabeth closes the book ("Peter Pan”), Bertie, handsome
dialog: in a tuxedo, comments:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Weren’t they lucky!
text: Within his family Bertie’s stammer is virtually absent.
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: MARGARET ROSE
dialog: Now Papa tell a_ story!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Could I be a penguin instead?
text: He drops to his knees and waddles. In his tux he looks like
text: a penguin. Margaret Rose giggles, but is undeterred.
speaker_heading: MARGARET ROSE
dialog: Tell me a penguin story, please.
text: Called upon to perform, the stammer returns slightly, but the
text: girls listen raptly, ignoring their father’s minor
text: impediment, and it fades.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: There were once two princesses
dialog: whose Papa had been turned into a
dialog: penguin by the local witch. This
dialog: was inconvenient because he loved
text: to hold his princesses in his arms
dialog: and you can’t do that if you’re a
dialog: penguin, you have wings like
dialog: herrings.
speaker_heading: MARGARET ROSE
dialog: Herrings don’t have wings.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: His wings were the shape of
dialog: herrings. To make matters worse she
dialog: sent him to the South Pole which is
dialog: an awfully long walk if you can’t
dialog: fly.
speaker_heading: LILIBET
dialog: You can’t walk from the South Pole!
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Shh!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Exactly. When he reached the water
text: and dived in he found he could fly.
text: Fly through the depths. So fast, in
dialog: fact, that he was in Southampton
text: Waters by lunchtime. From there he
dialog: caught the 2.30 to Weybridge,
dialog: changed at Clapham Junction and
dialog: asked a passing Mallard the way to
text: Buckingham Palace. He swam up the
text: Thames and came out of a plughole,
dialog: giving Mama, the cook and Mrs
dialog: Whittaker quite a shock.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The princesses heard the commotion
text: and hurried to the kitchen where
dialog: they gave the penguin a good scrub,
text: a mackerel and a kiss. And as they
dialog: kissed him guess what he turned
dialog: into?
scene_heading: LILIBET AND MARGARET ROSE
dialog: A handsome prince!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: A short-tailed Albatross. With
text: wings big enough to wrap around
text: both his precious girls together.
text: (He hugs them both
dialog: together )
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: About our coming to dinner?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No. About her!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: A married American? He can’t be.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: She can. By the way I think I found
dialog: someone rather interesting. On
text: Harley Street. A doctor.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Out of the question. I’m not having
dialog: this conversation again. The

speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR

speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: My boys made those. Good, aren’t

speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: I was told not not to sit too

text: Bertie remains silent.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I was also told, speaking with a

dialog: choose the topic.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Waiting for me to commence a
dialog: conversation one can wait a rather
dialog: long wait.
dialog: [Although Bertie’s stammer in the consultation room will

dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Timing isn’t my strong suit.

speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Aren’t you going to start treating

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Only if you’re interested in being
dialog: treated. Please, call me Lionel.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I prefer Doctor.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I prefer Lionel. What’1l I call
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Your Royal Highness, then Sir after
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: A bit formal for here. What about
dialog: your name?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Prince Albert Frederick Arthur
dialog: George?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: How about Bertie?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (flushes )
dialog: Only my family uses that.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Perfect. In here, it’s better if
dialog: we're equals.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If we were equal I wouldn’t be
dialog: here. I’d be at home with my wife
dialog: and no-one would give a damn.
text: Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Don’t do that.
text: Bertie gives him an astonished look.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Sucking smoke into your lungs will

dialog: 21
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: My physicians say it relaxes the

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: They're idiots.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They’ve all been knighted.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Makes it official then. My
dialog: ‘castle’, my rules. What was your
dialog: earliest memory?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What an earth do you mean?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: First recollection.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (stammer growing in
dialog: intensity)
dialog: I’m not here to discuss personal
dialog: matters.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why’re you here then?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (exploding - stammer free)
dialog: Because I bloody well stammer!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Temper.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: One of my many faults.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: When did the defect start?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I’ve always been this way!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I doubt that.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don’t tell me! It’s my defect!
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Four or five.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That's typical.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: So I’ve been told.
dialog: (quickly adds)
dialog: I can’t remember not doing it.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That I believe. Do you hesitate
dialog: when you think?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don’t be ridiculous.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: One of my many faults. How about
dialog: when you talk to yourself?
dialog: silent.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone natters occasionally,
dialog: Bertie.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Stop calling me that!
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Then we shan’t speak!

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: A fortune. So, Bertie...when you
dialog: talk to yourself, do you stammer?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Of course not!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Thus proving your impediment isn’t
dialog: a permanent part of you. What do
dialog: you think was the cause?
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I don’t know! I don’t care! I
text: stammer. And no one can fix it.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bet you, Bertie, you can read
text: flawlessly, right here, right now.
text: Bertie snorts dismissively.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: And if I win, I get to ask
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And if I win?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You don’t have to answer.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: One usually wagers money.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: A bob each to sweeten it? See your

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I don’t carry cash.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I had a funny feeling you mightn’t.

speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: Stake you. Pay me back next time.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If there is a next time.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (nods )
dialog: I haven’t agreed to take you on.
text: Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a recording device
text: with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the turntable and
text: positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open book.
text: Bertie glares at it defiantly.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I can’t possibly read this.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Then you owe me a shilling for not
dialog: trying.
dialog: 24
text: Furious, Bertie opens the book and reads, stammers badly and
dialog: gets worse.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: “To be or not to be, That is the
dialog: question. Whether it is wiser...”
dialog: There!
text: He hands the book back to Lionel.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT’D)
dialog: I can’t read!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I haven't finished yet.
text: Lionel returns the book to Bertie and turns to some recording
text: apparatus on a nearby table.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m going to record your voice and
dialog: then play it back to you on the
dialog: same machine. This is brilliant.
dialog: It’s the latest thing from America:
dialog: a Silvertone.
text: He hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones. Bertie
dialog: doesn’t want to take them.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s a bob in this, mate. You
dialog: can go home rich!
text: Bertie reluctantly puts them on. Logue turns a dial. LOUD
text: MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You're playing music.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: How can I hear what I’m saying?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Surely a Prince’s brain knows what
dialog: its mouth is doing?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You’re not well acquainted with
dialog: Royal Princes, are you?
text: Bertie replaces the earphones. Again, the LOUD MUSIC. His
text: mouth moves as he reads, but all that can be heard is the
dialog: music.
dialog: 25
text: Finished, Bertie takes off the earphones and the music
text: ceases. Bertie reaches for the coins, but Logue snatches
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hopeless. Hopeless!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You were sublime. Would I lie toa
dialog: prince of the realm to win twelve-
dialog: pence?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I’ve no idea what an Australian
dialog: might do for that sort of money.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Shall I play it?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: If you prefer, we’ll just get on to
dialog: the questions.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Thank you Doctor, I don’t feel this
dialog: is for me.
text: He heads for the door. Logue puts the record in a brown paper
text: dust jacket and hands it to Bertie.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Sir? The recording is free. Please
dialog: keep it as a souvenir?

scene_heading: INT. THE KING’S STUDY, SANDRINGHAM ESTATE - CONTINUOUS
text: The King’s study, which resembles an orderly naval captain’s

text: He is giving his Christmas address via the radio.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V (CONT’D)
dialog: .--within our borders, to regain

dialog: to carry with us those whom the

dialog: God bless you.
text: The red light next to him goes out, indicating the broadcast

text: stands by as well as an official photographer.
text: King George V looks at Bertie, who is standing next to him.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V (CONT’D)
dialog: Easy when you know how.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Sir?
text: Bertie moves away and the photographer captures the King,

speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: (to Bertie)
dialog: Have a go yourself.
speaker_heading: WOOD
dialog: Congratulations, Sir.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V

speaker_heading: WOOD
dialog: Sir.

speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: Thank you.

speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V (CONT’D)
text: Sit up, straight back, face boldly
dialog: up to the bloody thing and stare it
dialog: square in the eye, as you would any
dialog: decent Englishman. Show who’s in
dialog: command.
text: Bertie regards the BBC microphone as though it were an alien
dialog: creature.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: D-d-don’t thu-thu-think I c-c-can.
text: In the presence of his father, Bertie’s stammering returns in
text: full form, his breathing short and shallow, the neck muscles
text: in spasms.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: This devilish device will change
dialog: everything if you won’t. In the
dialog: past all a King had to do was look
dialog: respectable in uniform and not fall
dialog: off his horse. Now we must invade
dialog: people’s homes and ingratiate
dialog: ourselves with them. This family is
dialog: reduced to those lowest, basest of
dialog: all creatures...we’ve
dialog: become...actors!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Papa, we’re not a family, we’re a

text: His father shoots Bertie a surprised look: does the lad have
dialog: a brain after all?
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: The most successful institution in
dialog: history. Our cousins wear crowns
dialog: throughout Europe. A dozen of them!
dialog: Sitting on thrones is our business!

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (tries to brighten things)
text: He’s broken off with Lady Furness.

speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: And taken up a Mrs Simpson, a woman
dialog: with two husbands living! Had the
dialog: audacity to present her to me at
dialog: Georgie’s wedding. I told him
dialog: straight no divorced person could
dialog: ever be received at court. He said
dialog: she made him sublimely happy. I
dialog: imagined that was because she was
dialog: sleeping with him. “I give you my
dialog: word we've never had immoral

dialog: and lied.
text: Bertie groans.

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Lying bastard.
text: Bertie gets up and retrieves the recording he made with
text: Lionel. He walks to a Victoria stand, lifts the arm, places
text: the steel needle. It slips and slides across the records
text: surface, as steel needles do. But what he hears is poetic and
dialog: flowing:
scene_heading: BERTIE’S RECORDED VOICE
dialog: “To be, or not to be, - that is the

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Strictly business. No personal

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I thought I’d made that very clear
dialog: in our interview.
text: Logue is silent, then:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Got the shilling you owe me?
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No I don’t!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Didn’t think so.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Besides, you tricked me!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: No, I showed you what you can do.
dialog: (tries to get them to
dialog: understand)
dialog: What you’re asking will only deal
text: with the surface of the problem.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That’s sufficient. My husband has
dialog: difficulties with his speech. Just
dialog: deal with that.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I’m willing to work hard, Doctor
dialog: Logue...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Lionel.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Are you willing to do your part?
text: Logue considers, then tells Bertie:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Alright. You want mechanics? We
dialog: need to relax your throat muscles
dialog: and strengthen your tongue. By
dialog: repeating tongue twisters for
dialog: example. “I am a thistle-sifter. I
text: have a sieve of sifted thistles and
text: a sieve of unsifted thistles.
dialog: Because I am a thistle sifter.”
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You have a flabby tummy, we must
dialog: build up the strength in your
text: diaphragm. Simple mechanics.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That is all we ask.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: And that’s about a shilling’s
dialog: worth.
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Forget about the blessed shilling!
dialog: (calm again)
dialog: Perhaps, upon occasion, I shall
dialog: request some assistance in coping
dialog: with a minor event. Will that be
dialog: agreeable?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That will be the full extent of

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: This is actually quite good fun,

speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: Here’s to the memory of your

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I was informed, after the fact, my

speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Sing it then. Give me the chorus.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No. Certainly not.
dialog: (fascinated by the plane)

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Because you’re peculiar.
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Try “Camptown Races” then.

dialog: (realises)
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Well, as a little reward, you get

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: David and I were very close. Young
dialog: bucks... You know.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Chase the same girls?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: David was always very helpful in
dialog: arranging introductions. We shared
dialog: the expert ministrations of
text: “Paulette” in Paris. Not at the
dialog: same time of course.
text: An uncomfortable silence. Too much has been said.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Did David tease you?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: They all did. “Buh-buh-buh-Bertie”.
dialog: Father encouraged it. “Get it out,
dialog: boy!” Said it would make me stop.
dialog: Said...”I was afraid of my father,
dialog: and my children are damn well going
dialog: to be afraid of me”.
text: Lionel has been watching Bertie work on the model.

dialog: then she wouldn't feed me, far far
dialog: away.”
dialog: (speaks )
dialog: Took three years for my parents to

dialog: still.
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Some of them must be loveable.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (shoots him a look)

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That’s not right. Queen Wallis of

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Unthinkable.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Can he do that?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Absolutely not. But he’s going to
dialog: anyway. All hell’s broken loose.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Can’t they carry on privately?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If only they would.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Where does that leave you?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I know my place! I’1l do anything

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Has it come to that? But the way

text: on the throne.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I am not an alternative to my

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: If you had to you could outshine

text: Lionel reaches out and gives Bertie a pat of comfort on the
text: shoulder. Bertie pulls back in offended shock.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don’t take liberties! That’s
dialog: bordering on treason.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I’m just saying you could be King.
dialog: You could do it!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That is treason!
text: They face each other, as though in combat.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I’m trying to get you to realise

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I’ve had enough of this!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What're you afraid of?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Your poisonous words!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why’d you show up then? To take
dialog: polite elocution lessons so you can
dialog: chit-chat at posh tea parties?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don’t instruct me on my duties! I’m

speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: It’s not just because she’s an
dialog: American. It’s that she is soon to
dialog: be a twice divorced American, and
dialog: the King can not marry a divorced
dialog: woman. I apologize for the nature
dialog: of this, but... according to
dialog: Scotland Yard, the King does not
dialog: possess exclusive rights to Mrs.
dialog: Simpson's favours and affections,
text: sharing them with a married used

scene_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Dear, dear man... I refused your

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You asked for trust and total

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bertie, I heard you at Wembley, I

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What, as a failed actor!?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: It’s true, I’m not a doctor, and
dialog: yes I acted a bit, recited in pubs

text: shell-shocked and unable to speak
dialog: and somebody said, “Lionel, you’re
dialog: very good at all this speech stuff.
dialog: Do you think you could possibly

dialog: muscle therapy, exercise,
dialog: relaxation, but I knew I had to go
dialog: deeper. Those poor young blokes had
text: cried out in fear, and no-one was
dialog: listening to them. My job was to
dialog: give them faith in their voice and

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You give a very noble account of
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Make inquiries. It’s all true.
speaker_heading: BERTIE

dialog: my neck. I vouched for you and you
dialog: have no credentials.
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: But lots of success! I can’t show
dialog: you a certificate - there was no
dialog: training then. All I know I know by
dialog: experience, and that war was some

dialog: (with mock seriousness)
dialog: Lock me in the Tower.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I would if I could!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: On what charge?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Fraud! With war looming, you've

text: It’s held in place by a large rock!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That is the Stone of Scone, you are
dialog: trivialising everything-
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I don’t care. I don’t care how many
dialog: Royal arses have sat in this chair-
dialog: Overlapping-
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Listen to me... !
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Listen to you?! By what right?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Divine right, if you must! I’m your
dialog: King!!!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Noooo you’re not! Told me so
dialog: yourself. Said you didn’t want it.
dialog: So why should I waste my time
dialog: listening to you?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Because I have a right to be heard!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Heard as what?!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: A man! I HAVE A VOICE!!!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yes you do. You have such

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What on earth’s going on, Sir?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It’s all right, Archbishop.
dialog: The Archbishop of Canterbury.
dialog: 74
dialog: 75
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Mr Logue, you should know that I
dialog: have found a replacement English
dialog: specialist with impeccable
dialog: credentials. Hence, your services
dialog: will no longer be required.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Your Majesty’s function is to
dialog: consult and be advised. You didn’t
dialog: consult, but you’ve just been
dialog: advised.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Now I advise you: in this personal
dialog: matter I will make my own decision.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: My concern is for the head upon
dialog: which I must place the crown.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I appreciate that Archbishop, but
dialog: it’s my head!
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Your humble servant.
text: Lang turns on his heel and is gone, leaving Bertie shaken,
text: with both anger, and fear.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Thank you Bertie. Shall we
dialog: rehearse?
text: Bertie sits in the ceremonial chair once more.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT’D)
dialog: As soon as you and Elizabeth enter
dialog: the West door, you’ll be greeted
dialog: with the hymn “I Was Glad When They
dialog: Said Unto Me.” You won’t actually
dialog: be that glad, because they sing it
dialog: for a great long time. Then your
dialog: friend the Archbishop will ponce up
dialog: and say, “Sir, is Your Majesty
dialog: willing to take The Oath?” You
dialog: say..
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: “IT am willing”.
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Course you are! I’1l see what it
dialog: sounds like from the cheap seats so
dialog: even your old nanny can hear.
dialog: “Will you govern your peoples of
dialog: Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,
dialog: Australia and New Zealand according
dialog: to their lands and customs?”
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "I solemnly promise so do so."
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: LOUDER! I can’t hear you up the
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: “I SOLEMNLY PROMISE TO DO SO!”
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Very good! "Will you to your power
dialog: cause Law and Justice, in Mercy, to
dialog: be executed in all your
dialog: judgements?"
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "I will." “I WILL!”
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Then a long bit about upholding the
dialog: faith, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
dialog: To which you finally say...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: “These things which I have
dialog: herebefore promised, I will perform
dialog: and keep. So help me God.”
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That’s all you have to say. Four
dialog: short responses, kiss the book and
dialog: sign the oath. There you are:
dialog: you’re King. Easy.

text: There is a projectionist also.
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: MARGARET ROSE
dialog: You nearly crowned him backwards
dialog: Archbishop!
text: Lang steps in front of the screen, eager to explain
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Someone had removed the thread that
text: was marking the front of the Crown,
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Try not lose the thread,
dialog: Archbishop.
speaker_heading: LILLIBET
dialog: (peering around Lang)
dialog: Archbishop, your missing Papa.
text: We see Bertie giving two of his responses.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Very good, very good. Archbishop.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Well, I hope Your Majesties are
text: thrilled with the result.
text: The Coronation footage finishes. The next segment of the
text: newsreel is entitled “Hitler in Nuremberg!” and shows him
text: viewing troops doing the goose-step amidst immense crowds. We
text: then see Hitler’s mad eloquence, mesmerizing all.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG (CONT’D)
dialog: (to the projectionist)
dialog: You can turn that off now.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: No, wait, keeping going.
speaker_heading: LILLIBET
dialog: Do have a seat, Archbishop.
text: They watch the footage.
speaker_heading: LILIBET
dialog: What’s he saying, Papa?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I don’t know, but he seems to be
dialog: saying it rather well.

dialog: Good Morning Mr Baldwin.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Good Morning your Majesty.
dialog: Congratulations on your Coronation.
dialog: It went splendidly.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Thank you, Prime Minister. Luckily

dialog: oaths. I may not be so fortunate in
dialog: the future.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Sir, I have asked to see you today
dialog: in order to tender my resignation
dialog: as Prime Minister.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I am so sorry to hear that, Mr
dialog: Baldwin.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Neville Chamberlain will take my
dialog: place as Prime Minister. It’s a
dialog: matter of principal. I was
dialog: mistaken. I have found it
dialog: impossible to believe that there is
dialog: any man in the World so lacking in
dialog: moral feeling as Hitler, but the
dialog: world might be hurled for a second
dialog: time into the abyss of destructive
dialog: War. Churchill was right all along.
dialog: This was always Hitler’s intention.
dialog: I am only sorry to leave you in
dialog: this time of crisis. I am afraid

dialog: at once to withdraw their troops

speaker_heading: HARDINGE
dialog: At last. Here it is. You are live

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: LIONEL

scene_heading: INT. BERTIE’S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: “There may be dark days ahead, and
dialog: Wr... ”
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Turn the hesitations into pauses,
dialog: and say to yourself, “God save the
dialog: King”.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I say that continually, but
text: apparently no one’s listening.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Long pauses are good: they add
dialog: solemnity to great occasions.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Then I’m the solemnest king who
dialog: ever lived. Lionel, I can’t do
dialog: this!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bertie, you can do this!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If I am to be King...where is my
dialog: power? May I form a Government,
dialog: levy a tax or declare a war? No!
dialog: Yet I am the seat of all authority.
dialog: Why? Because the Nation believes
dialog: when I speak, I speak for them. Yet
dialog: I cannot speak!
dialog: As though none of this had happened:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Let’s take it from the top. “In
dialog: this grave hour...”
speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (waltzing and singing)
dialog: “For the second time in the lives

text: Bertie jams and comes to a halt.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Pause. “we are...” Take a pause.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I can’t do this.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bertie, you can do it. Have a look
text: at the last paragraph.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Bertie...it’s time.
text: Bertie and Lionel glance at each other.
text: Bertie approaches the door.
text: He pauses.
text: Down a long perspective of rooms we see ahead the waiting

dialog: speech specialist.
scene_heading: INT. STATE ROOMS, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS
text: Bertie, Lionel, and Elizabeth walk towards the microphone.
text: A corgi barks as they approach.

text: Chamberlain and Churchill are in attendance.
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Prime Minister. Nice to see you
dialog: again, so soon. Good of you to be
dialog: here, I’m sure you’ve had rather a

speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Let’s hope we have no more
dialog: interruptions from those damned

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Or the wretched dogs.

dialog: Congratulations. First Lord of the

scene_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL

dialog: The long walk.
text: Churchill detaches himself from Lang and walks with Bertie.
scene_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Good luck, Sir. I too dread

dialog: impediment myself, you know.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I didn’t.
scene_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
text: Family secret. Tongue-tied. An
dialog: operation was considered too
dialog: dangerous. I eventually made an

text: A moment of silent recognition between the two men.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Thank you, Mr Churchill.
text: Churchill nods, then goes to his seat, as Bertie passes into
text: the next room.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT’D)
dialog: How long, Logue?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Just under three minutes, Sir.
text: Ahead is the microphone set up on a grand desk in a
text: beautifully ornate state room.
dialog: 84
text: Next to it is now revealed a stills camera and lights - all
text: set for a photo op.
text: Bertie, Logue and Elizabeth, ignoring it, pass right by, turn
text: a corner and we now see a perspective of much smaller rooms
text: leading to a microphone framed in a doorway, hung at head
text: height. A tumble of cables stretch through the rooms.
text: We pass through two rooms of audio equipment with eight
text: technicians all wearing black tie, all set for the broadcast.
text: Bertie’s tension builds.
text: At the door to the broadcasting booth he is met by the BBC’s
dialog: Wood.
text: Bertie greets him
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Mr Wood.
speaker_heading: WOOD
dialog: Good luck, Your Majesty.
text: Logue, Bertie and Elizabeth enter the booth.
scene_heading: INT. BROADCASTING BOOTH - DAY
text: The dreaded BBC microphone, in a surprisingly small room. It
text: is arranged so Bertie can stand up as he speaks, the way
text: Logue likes it. The ceiling has been lowered and it has been
text: decorated in cheerful colours. As a podium for the speech an
text: old school desk has been propped up on wooden blocks so it’s
dialog: the right height for Bertie.
text: Logue immediately opens the window to get the air
dialog: circulating.
text: Bertie says nothing, but goes up and inspects the looming
dialog: microphone.
text: He spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus
text: with the little finger, thumb to chin.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I am thistle sifter, I have a sieve
text: of sifted thistles and a sieve on
dialog: unsifted thistles..
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Bertie, darling, make sure it’s not
dialog: switched on!
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Remember the red light will blink
dialog: three times and then I’ve asked
dialog: them to turn it off, because we
dialog: don’t want that evil eye staring at
dialog: you all the way through.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I am sure you will be splendid.
speaker_heading: WOOD
dialog: One minute, sir.
text: Elizabeth steps back with a wonderful smile as Wood closes
text: the door, sealing Bertie and Logue in the booth.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No matter how this turns out, I
dialog: don’t know how to thank you for
dialog: what you’ve done.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Knighthood?
text: They smile.
speaker_heading: WOOD (0.S.)
dialog: Twenty seconds.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Forget everything else and just say
dialog: it to me. Say it to me, asa
dialog: friend.
text: The red light in the booth flashes.
text: The red light flashes for the second time.
text: Bertie concentrates.
text: The red light flashes for the third time.
text: The red light now goes steady red.
text: Lionel opens his arms wide and mouths, “Breathe!”.
dialog: On Air.
text: Bertie’s hands begin to shake, the pages of his speech rattle
text: like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the Adam’s
text: apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms
text: reappear.
text: Several seconds have elapsed. It seems an eternity.
dialog: 86
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM, BBC BROADCASTING HOUSE - DAY
text: The technicians in their suits, ties and scientific looking
text: white overcoats, wearing bulky headphones, monitoring
text: daunting banks of valves and dials listen with growing
text: apprehension to the silence broken only by crackling static.
scene_heading: INT. KING’S STUDY/BROADCAST ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
text: The tension is more than palpable.
text: Bertie and Logue stare at each other.
text: Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man
text: he’s worked with. His confidence is contagious.
text: Bertie takes a deep breath, lets it out slowly. His throat
text: muscles relax, his hands steady - all the things he’s
dialog: practiced.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: In this grave hour, perhaps the
dialog: most fateful in our history, I send
dialog: to every household of my peoples,
dialog: both at home and overseas this
dialog: message spoken with the same depth
dialog: of feeling for each one of you as
dialog: if I were able to cross your
dialog: threshold and speak to you myself.
text: His cadence is slow and measured, not flawless, but he does
dialog: not stop.
scene_heading: INT - STATE ROOMS - DAY
text: In the listening room:
text: Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair and then slowly

dialog: Over and over again we have tried
dialog: to find a peaceful way out of the
dialog: differences between ourselves and
dialog: those who are now our enemies. But
dialog: it has been in vain. We have been
dialog: forced into a conflict. For we are
dialog: called, with our allies, to meet
dialog: the challenge of a principle which,
dialog: if it were to prevail, would be
dialog: fatal to any civilized order in the
dialog: world. Such a principle, stripped
dialog: of all disguise, is surely the mere
dialog: primitive doctrine that might is
dialog: right. For the sake of all that we
dialog: ourselves hold dear, and of the
dialog: world’s order and peace, it is
dialog: unthinkable that we should refuse
dialog: to meet the challenge. It is to
dialog: this high purpose that I now call
dialog: my people at home and my peoples
dialog: across the seas, who will make our
dialog: cause their own. I ask them to
text: stand calm and firm, and united in
dialog: this time of trial. The task will
dialog: be hard. There may be dark days
dialog: ahead, and war can no longer be
dialog: confined to the battlefield. But we
dialog: can only do the right as we see the
dialog: right and reverently commit our
dialog: cause to God.
