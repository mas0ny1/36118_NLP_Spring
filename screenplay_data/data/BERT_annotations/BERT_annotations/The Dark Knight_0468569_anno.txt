dialog: Which SHATTERS to reveal-
scene_heading: 1 INT. OFFICE, HIGH RISE -- DAY 1
text: A man in a CLOWN MASK holding a SMOKING SILENCED PISTOL ejects
text: a shell casing. This is DOPEY. He turns to a second man,
text: HAPPY, also in clown mask, who steps forward with a CABLE
text: LAUNCHER, aims at a lower roof across the street and FIRES a
text: cable across. Dopey secures the line to an I-beam line-
text: CLAMP on- sends a KIT BAG out then steps OUT the window...
scene_heading: 2 EXT. HIGH-RISE -- DAY 2
text: ...into space. The men SLIDE across the DIZZYING DROP...
text: landing on the lower roof across the street.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAY 3
text: A MAN on the corner, back to us, holding a CLOWN MASK. An

text: the car- two other men wearing CLOWN MASKS.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: Three of a kind. Let's do this.
text: One of the Clowns looks up from loading his automatic weapon.
speaker_heading: CHUCKLES
dialog: That's it? Three guys?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: There's two on the roof. Every guy
dialog: is an extra share. Five shares is
dialog: plenty.
speaker_heading: CHUCKLES
dialog: Six shares. Don't forget the guy
dialog: who planned the job.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: Yeah? He thinks he can sit it out
dialog: and still take a slice, then I get
dialog: why they call him the Joker.

speaker_heading: HAPPY
dialog: Why do they call him the Joker?

scene_heading: 5 EXT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS 5

speaker_heading: 7 EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY 7
text: Dopey watches the alarm PING his handheld.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: DOPEY
dialog: Here comes the silent alarm.
dialog: (touches a button)
dialog: And there it goes. That's funny.
dialog: It didn't dial out to 911- it was
dialog: trying to reach a private number.
text: Behind him, Happy RAISES his silenced HANDGUN.
speaker_heading: HAPPY
dialog: Is it a problem?
speaker_heading: DOPEY
dialog: No, no. I'm done here.
text: Happy SHOOTS. Dopey SLUMPS. Happy picks up his bag and
dialog: FORCES OPEN the roof access door...
scene_heading: 8 INT. STAIRWELL, BANK -- DAY 8

speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: Obviously, we don't want you doing
dialog: anything with your hands other than
dialog: holding on for dear life.
dialog: BLAM. Chuckles is BLOWN OFF HIS FEET- Grumpy and Bozo DIVE
dialog: for cover- the Bank Manager steps out of his office, SHOTGUN
dialog: in hand. Hostages SCRAMBLE, CLINGING their grenades...
scene_heading: 11 INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY 11
dialog: Happy CLAMPS a DRILL to the vault- the bit SPINS- SLIDES
text: into the metal door- a BOLT of ELECTRICITY RIPS THROUGH THE
speaker_heading: DRILL,
dialog: THROWING HAPPY TO THE FLOOR--
scene_heading: 12 INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY 12
dialog: Grumpy and Bozo cower as the Bank Manager FIRES again.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: He's got three left?
text: Bozo raises TWO fingers. Grumpy squeezes off a SHOT. The
text: Bank Manager FIRES. FIRES again. Grumpy looks at Bozo, who
dialog: nods. Grumpy JUMPS UP.
dialog: The Bank Manager FIRES- Grumpy GRUNTS as buckshot CLIPS his
text: shoulder. FALLS. The Bank Manager moves in for the kill,
text: FUMBLING for new shells. Bozo STANDS- SHOOTS him.
text: Bozo picks up the shotgun. Grumpy checks his wound- it's
text: superficial. He struggles to his feet.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where'd you learn to count?!
text: Bozo's mask stares him down. Grumpy heads for the stairs in
text: the back. Bozo starts loading fresh shells into the shotgun.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: You have any idea who you're stealing
dialog: from? You and your friends are dead.
text: Bozo looks down at him. Says nothing.
scene_heading: 13 INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY 13
text: Happy at the vault door, barefoot, turning the tumblers with
text: hands stuffed into his SNEAKERS. Grumpy walks in.
speaker_heading: HAPPY
dialog: They wired this thing up with 5,000
dialog: volts. What kind of bank does that?
speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: A mob bank. Guess the Joker's as
dialog: crazy as they say.
text: Happy shrugs. Grips the WHEEL BOLT and SPINS it.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's the alarm guy?
speaker_heading: HAPPY
dialog: Boss told me when the guy was done I
dialog: should take him out. One less share.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: Funny, he told me something similar...
text: Happy FREEZES. The wheel SPINS to a STOP- the vault DOOR

speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: C'mon, there's a lot to carry...
scene_heading: 16 INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY 16
text: Bozo walks back into the lobby with two more DUFFELS. Sets
text: them down on an ENORMOUS PILE. Grumpy looks at it.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: If this guy was so smart he would
dialog: have had us bring a bigger car.
text: Grumpy JABS his pistol in Bozo's back. Takes his weapon.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm betting the Joker told you to
dialog: kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
speaker_heading: BOZO
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: No. I kill the bus driver.
speaker_heading: GRUMPY
dialog: Bus driver? What bus-
text: Bozo steps backwards. SMASH. Hostages SCREAM as the TAIL
text: END OF A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS ROCKETS through the front of the
text: bank, SLAMMING Grumpy into the teller's window.
text: Bozo picks up Grumpy's weapon. Another clown OPENS the rear
text: door of the bus. Bozo SHOOTS him. Then loads the bags onto
text: the bus. The wounded Bank Manager watches him. In the
speaker_heading: distance: SIRENS.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Think you're smart, huh? Well, the
dialog: guy who hired you's just do the same
dialog: to you...
text: Bozo slowly shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Sure he will. Criminals in this
dialog: town used to believe in things...
text: Bozo turns back to the Bank Manager. Crouches over him.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Honor. Respect. What do you believe,
dialog: huh? What do you bel-

text: is knotted around the pin.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: I believe that what doesn't kill
dialog: you...
text: Bozo PULLS off his MASK. The Bank Manager GASPS. In the
dialog: reflections of the glass DEBRIS behind the Bank Manager we
text: see GLIMPSES of a SCARRED MOUTH and CLOWN MAKEUP. THE JOKER.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...simply makes you stranger.
text: The Bank Manager's eyes go wide. The Joker rises, strolls
text: towards the bus, the purple thread attached to the grenade
text: pin UNRAVELING FROM THE PURPLE LINING of his jacket as he
text: walks. The Joker climbs into the bus, SHUTS the rear door,
text: TRAPPING THE PURPLE THREAD...
scene_heading: 17 EXT. SCHOOL, GOTHAM -- DAY 17
text: Kids pour out, heading onto a long line of school buses.
scene_heading: 18 INT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS 18
text: As the bus pulls out, the purple thread PULLS THE PIN--
text: hostages scream and scurry away from the Bank Manager, who
text: shakes with fear as, with a FIZZ, the grenade does not
speaker_heading: explode, but SPEWS RED SMOKE.
speaker_heading: 19 EXT. BANK -- DAY 19
text: The School Bus pulls free of the Bank wall and pulls out
text: onto the street, SLIDING INTO THE LINE OF IDENTICAL BUSES
text: HEADING PAST THE BANK. The buses trundle past COP CARS racing
dialog: up the street... and we-

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: No, man. I don't like it tonight.
speaker_heading: BUYER
dialog: What're you, superstitious? You got
dialog: more chance of winning the powerball

scene_heading: 22 INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT 22
dialog: DETECTIVE RAMIREZ, female, rookie detective, 30's, makes

speaker_heading: ENGEL
dialog: Mr Mayor, you were elected on a
dialog: campaign to clean up the city...
dialog: when are you going to start?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Well, Mike-
speaker_heading: ENGEL
dialog: Like this so-called Batman- a lot of
dialog: people say he's doing some good that
dialog: criminals are running scared... but
dialog: I say NO. What kind of hero needs
dialog: to wear a mask? You don't let
dialog: vigilantes run around breaking the
dialog: law... where does it end? Yet, we
dialog: hear rumors that instead of trying
dialog: to arrest him the cops are using him
dialog: to do their dirty work.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: I'm told our men in the Major Crimes
dialog: Unit are close to an arrest.
speaker_heading: RAMIREZ
dialog: Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're
dialog: closing in on the Batman.
text: WUERTZ looks up, listless. Crumples up a paper.
speaker_heading: WUERTZ
dialog: The investigation is ongoing.
text: He throws the paper at the trash. It rebounds off a board
dialog: headed 'BATMAN: SUSPECTS.' Lined with pictures: Abraham
dialog: Lincoln. Elvis. The Abominable Snowman.

scene_heading: 23 EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT -- NIGHT 23

speaker_heading: RAMIREZ
dialog: Ever intending to see your wife again,
dialog: Lieutenant?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I thought you had to go look after
dialog: your mother, detective.
speaker_heading: RAMIREZ
dialog: They checked her back into hospital.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: RAMIREZ
dialog: (making light)
dialog: Least there she's got someone round
dialog: the clock. Unlike your wife.
dialog: (looks at bat-signal)
dialog: He hasn't shown?
text: Gordon gets up. Looks into the sky at the bat-signal.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Often doesn't. But I like reminding
dialog: everybody that he's out there.
speaker_heading: RAMIREZ
dialog: Why wouldn't he come?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Hopefully... Because he's busy.
scene_heading: 24 EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- NIGHT 24
text: Two black SUV's pull onto the top floor. A large man emerges--
text: the CHECHEN. A BODYGUARD points at the sky. The Chechen
text: peers up at the BAT-SIGNAL. Shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: That's why we bring dogs.
text: BODYGUARD 2 opens the back door- three enormous ROTWEILERS
text: emerge, GROWLING. The Chechen crouches, KISSING the dogs.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN (CONT'D)

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to bodyguards)
dialog: The Batman's invisible to you fools...
dialog: but my little princes... they can
dialog: find human meat in complete darkness.
text: The Chechen moves to the second SUV, reaches in and DRAGS
text: out a skinny, wild-eyed JUNKIE by his hair.
speaker_heading: JUNKIE
dialog: (babbling)
dialog: No! No get 'em off me! Off me!
text: The Chechen drags the Junkie towards a battered white van.
text: The van's REAR DOORS OPEN... two armed THUGS emerge, carrying
text: BARRELS... a third hovers in the dark interior.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: Look! Look what your drugs did to
dialog: my customers!
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Buyer beware...
text: The figure emerges: SCARECROW. Wearing his mask.
speaker_heading: SCARECROW
dialog: I told your man my compound would
dialog: take you places. I never said they'd
dialog: be places you wanted to go.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: My business is repeat customers.
speaker_heading: SCARECROW
dialog: If you don't like what I have to
dialog: offer, buy from someone else.
dialog: Assuming Batman left anyone else to
dialog: buy from.
text: The Chechen frowns. THE DOGS START BARKING.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: He's here.
text: A BURLY THUG at the periphery is suddenly SUCKED into the
text: darkness. In his place a shadow straightens, revealing
text: POINTED BAT-EARS against the glittering skyline.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: Come on, sonofbitch- my dogs are
dialog: hungry, pity there's only one of
dialog: you...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 10.
text: A BODYGUARD to the side DISAPPEARS with a scream, and a SECOND
speaker_heading: BAT-SHADOW appears.
text: The Chechen looks taken aback. Three more BAT-SHADOWS
dialog: appear... even the dogs stop growling.
text: BOOM! A hole appears in the SUV next to the Chechen. The
text: first bat-shadow steps into the light carrying a SHOTGUN.
text: CHAOS as men scatter and the rooftop erupts in GUNFIRE. The
text: Chechen TURNS as he hears one of his men SCREAM.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Loose the dogs!
dialog: A Bodyguard releases the DOGS- they RACE, SALIVATING, into
dialog: the darkness...
dialog: The Dogs RACE towards a Bat-Shadow- the first dog LEAPS,
dialog: gets its JAWS around the Bat-Shadow's throat...
text: Scarecrow ducks behind the van- holes PUNCHED in the side by
text: shotgun blasts right behind him. He starts to climb into
dialog: the driver's seat-
text: The muzzle of a shotgun is pressed to the back of his head-
text: a bat-shadow is behind him- he SPRAYS him with FEAR TOXIN-
text: the bat-shadow collapses to the ground, SCREAMING. The
text: Chechen, cowering from gunfire, looks down at him.
speaker_heading: SCARECROW
dialog: Not the real thing.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: How you know?
speaker_heading: SCARECROW
dialog: We're old friends.
text: A HUGE BLACK SHAPE SLAMS down onto a row of parked cars.
speaker_heading: The BATMOBILE.

scene_heading: 26 EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS 26

text: A bat-shadow lines up his shotgun on a running bodyguard-
text: CLUNK- a BLACK GAUNTLET grasps the barrel and BENDS it upwards
dialog: with a HOWL of tortured steel- the bat-shadow looks into the
text: face of the Batman. The REAL BATMAN.
text: The Bat-shadow STUMBLES BACKWARDS in terror, leaving the
text: bent shotgun in Batman's hand. Batman OPENS his hand,
text: revealing a PNEUMATIC MANGLE hidden in his palm-
text: Batman bears down on the dogs mauling another bat-shadow-
text: DRAWS his GRAPPLING GUN and SHOOTS his grapple into the fake
dialog: Batman's leg and RIPS him from the dogs, one dog HANGING ON
text: as Batman pulls the unconscious man away... the Chechen RUNS
dialog: down the ramp towards the exit...
dialog: As Batman KICKS the dog off the fake Batman- the Chechen
text: gets into his SUV- another dog LOCKS ITS JAWS around Batman's
dialog: forearm, RIPPING, TEARING- Batman SWINGS THE DOG OVER HIS
text: HEAD- SMASHES it against the ground- its jaws OPEN...
text: Batman rises, an engine RACES behind him- he can't turn in

scene_heading: 27 INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS 27
text: Scarecrow, driving, NODS at him and hits the gas... Batman
text: raises his hand, revealing his jointed mangle and pistons.
text: The mangle STRAIGHTENS and ROTATES from his palm to the knife
dialog: edge of his opened hand...
text: Batman CHOPS straight through the windshield- pulls his hand
dialog: out and CHOPS again- the mangle gets STUCK- Scarecrow steers
dialog: towards a column...
scene_heading: 28 EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS 28
text: Batman can't free himself- he turns a dial on his forearm
text: piston- EXPLOSIVE BOLTS blow, freeing his gauntlet from the
text: mangle- he ROLLS free of the van as it SCRAPES the column
text: and barrels down the circular exit ramp.
text: Batman rises. A phony batman lying on the ground watches as
text: Batman climbs up to the edge of the ten-story corkscrew ramp
text: and stands there, waiting for something.
dialog: After a moment he JUMPS... and falls... ten stories...
text: He's about to hit the exit ramp- the van appears- his cape

speaker_heading: "BATMAN"
dialog: We're trying to help you!
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: I don't need help.

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Put this out, by morning we can put

text: Batman picks up a BUNDLE. Hands it to Gordon.
speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: Some of the marked bills I gave you.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: My detectives have been making drug

scene_heading: 33 EXT. RAIL YARDS -- MORNING 33
text: Alfred gets out of the Rolls carrying a thermos. He walks

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: A dog.

speaker_heading: ALFRED

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: This wasn't exactly what I had in

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I am. Closely. I need to know if

text: Alfred looks at other images- the D.A. at a meeting.
dialog: Campaigning. Helping someone out of a cab: RACHEL.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Are you interested in his character...

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Who Rachel spends her time with is
dialog: her business.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Well, I trust you're not following

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: If you ever took one, I might.
text: Alfred bites the thread. Examines his stitches. Looks at
text: the SCARS criss-crossing Wayne's shoulders.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Know your limits, Master Wayne.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Batman has no limits.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Well, you do, sir.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I can't afford to know them.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: And what happens the day you find
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: We all know how much you like to say
dialog: 'I told you so'.
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: That day, Master Wayne, even I won't

speaker_heading: DENT

dialog: Dent FLIPS. Shows it to Rachel- heads.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're flipping coins to see who
dialog: leads?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
dialog: it got me my first date with you.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm serious, Harvey, you don't leave
dialog: things like this to chance.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I don't.
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: I make my own luck.
text: Dent looks across at the defendant- SAL MARONI.
speaker_heading: MARONI
dialog: I thought the DA just played golf

speaker_heading: DENT

scene_heading: 37 INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY 37
text: Rossi takes a SIP of water. Dent works the room.
speaker_heading: DENT

dialog: (Rossi nods)
dialog: Is this man in the courtroom today?
dialog: (Rossi nods again)
dialog: Could you identify him for us, please?
text: Dent turns to Maroni, who is poker-faced. Dent smiles.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: ROSSI
dialog: You win, counselor. It was me.
text: Dent's smile disappears. He turns back to Rossi.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I've got a sworn statement from you
dialog: that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is
dialog: the new head of the Falcone crime
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: ROSSI
dialog: Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the
dialog: brains of the organization.
text: LAUGHS from the gallery. Dent turns to the JUDGE.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Permission to treat the witness as
dialog: hostile?
speaker_heading: ROSSI
dialog: Hostile? I'll show you hostile.
text: Rossi JUMPS UP, points a GUN at Dent's face. SCREAMS from
dialog: the gallery. Rossi PULLS the TRIGGER- the gun MISFIRES with
text: a POP. Dent steps forward, grabs the GUN- DECKS Rossi with
text: a RIGHT CROSS- unloads the GUN and sets it down in front of
dialog: Maroni.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Ceramic 28 caliber. Made in China.
dialog: If you want to kill a public servant,

speaker_heading: DENT (CONT'D)
dialog: But, your honor, I'm not done...
scene_heading: 38 INT. LOBBY, DENT'S OFFICE, DA'S -- DAY 38
text: Rachel, excited, leads Dent through the lobby.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We'll never link the gun to Maroni,

dialog: tell you one thing- the fact they

dialog: to them.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm

text: Rachel turns to Dent. Smooths his lapels.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.- if

dialog: not doing your job.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: 'Course if you said you were rattled
dialog: we could take the rest of the day...
speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Well, good thing about the mob is
dialog: they keep giving you second chances.
text: Dent picks up a bundle of bills from the heist.
speaker_heading: DENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Lightly irradiated bills. Fancy

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: We liaise with various agencies-
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Save it, Gordon. I want to meet
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Official policy is to arrest the

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: And that flood light on top of M.C.U.?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: If you have any concerns about...

text: Dent tosses the bills back onto his desk. Annoyed.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I've put every known money launderer

dialog: is still getting its money out. I
dialog: think you and your "friend" have
dialog: found the last game in town and you're
dialog: trying to hit 'em where it hurts:
dialog: their wallets. Bold. You gonna
dialog: count me in?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: In this town, the fewer people know
dialog: something, the safer the operation.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Gordon, I don't like that you've got
dialog: your own special unit, and I don't
dialog: like that it's full of cops I
dialog: investigated at internal affairs.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: If I didn't work with cops you'd
dialog: investigated while you were making
dialog: your name at I.A.- I'd be working
dialog: alone. I don't get political points
dialog: for being an idealist- I have to do
dialog: the best I can with what I have.
text: Dent looks at Gordon. Considering how to proceed.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: You want me to back warrants for

dialog: without telling me who we're after?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I can give you the names of the banks.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Well, that's a start. I'll get you

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: FOX

text: The elevator doors close. Reese frowns.
speaker_heading: REESE

text: Fox heads for his office, Reese in tow.
speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: It's done- the numbers are solid.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scene_heading: 42 INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- CONTINUOUS 42
text: Wayne is standing by the window.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Another long night?
dialog: (Wayne smiles)
dialog: This joint venture was your idea,
dialog: and the consultants love it, but I'm
dialog: not convinced. L.S.I.'s grown 8
dialog: percent annually, like clockwork.
dialog: They must have a revenue stream that's
dialog: off the books. Maybe even illegal.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: OK. Cancel the deal.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (looks at Wayne)
dialog: You already knew.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I needed a closer look at their books.
text: Fox looks at Wayne. Wry.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Anything else you can trouble me
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I need a new suit.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: (looks him over)
dialog: Three buttons is a little nineties.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I'm not talking about fashion, Mr.Fox,
dialog: so much as function.
text: Wayne pulls some diagrams. Fox looks them over.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You want to be able to turn your

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sure make backing out of the driveway

scene_heading: 43 INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT 43
text: Rachel and Dent at a table. Dent looks a little intimidated

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: It took three weeks to get a

dialog: worked for the government.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: This city health inspector's not
dialog: afraid to pull strings.
text: Rachel smiles. Then, over Dent's shoulder, she sees Wayne

speaker_heading: DENT (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Rachel! Fancy that.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes, Bruce. Fancy that.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: (Russian accent)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's
dialog: told me everything about you.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I certainly hope not.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Let's put a couple tables together.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: I don't know if they'll let us-
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: They should! I own the place.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: For how long? About three weeks?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: How'd you know?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Natascha, aren't you...?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Harvey's taking me next week.
speaker_heading: WAYNE

speaker_heading: 44 INT. SAME -- LATER 44
dialog: They finish up dinner.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: No, come on- how could you want to
dialog: raise children in a city like this?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I was raised here. I turned out OK.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
text: Rachel gives Dent a withering look.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: The Palisades? Sure. You know, as
dialog: our new D.A. you might want to figure
dialog: out where your jurisdiction ends.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: I'm talking about the kind of city
dialog: that idolizes a masked vigilante...
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Gotham's proud of an ordinary man
dialog: standing up for what's right.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: Gotham needs heroes like you- elected
dialog: officials, not a man who thinks he's
dialog: above the law.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: We did. All of us who stood by and
dialog: let scum take control of our city.
text: Wayne watches Dent. Sees his passion.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: But this is a democracy, Harvey.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: When their enemies were at the gate,
dialog: the Romans would suspend democracy
dialog: and appoint one man to protect the
dialog: city. It wasn't considered an honor.
dialog: It was considered public service.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And the last man they asked to protect
dialog: the republic was named Caesar. He
dialog: never gave up that power.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Well, I guess you either die a hero
dialog: or you live long enough to see
dialog: yourself become the villain. Look,
dialog: whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
dialog: want to spend the rest of his life
dialog: doing this. How could he? Batman's
dialog: looking for someone to take up his
dialog: mantle.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: Someone like you, Mr. Dent?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Maybe. If I'm up to it.
text: Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dent's face.
speaker_heading: NATASCHA
dialog: But what if Harvey Dent is the caped
dialog: crusader?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: If I were sneaking out every night
dialog: someone would've noticed by now.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 26.
text: Dent takes Rachel's hand. Rachel glances at Wayne. Awkward.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Well, you've sold me, Dent. I'm
dialog: gonna throw you a fundraiser.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm
dialog: not up for reelection for three years.
dialog: That stuff won't start for-
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I don't think you understand. One
dialog: fundraiser with my pals, you'll never
dialog: need another cent.

scene_heading: 47 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS 47

text: The screen flickers to life: Lau. The room ERUPTS.
speaker_heading: LAU (ON T.V.)
dialog: Gentlemen, please. As you're all

dialog: A relatively small amount: 68 million.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: Who's stupid enough steal from us?
speaker_heading: LAU
dialog: I'm told the man who arranged the

speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: Who the hell is that?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: MARONI
dialog: Two-bit whack-job wears a cheap purple
dialog: suit and make-up. He's not the
dialog: problem- he's a nobody.
dialog: (looks at Lau)
dialog: The problem is our money being tracked
dialog: by the cops.
dialog: Murmurs of surprise.
speaker_heading: LAU
dialog: Thanks to Mr. Maroni's well-placed
dialog: sources we know that police have
dialog: indeed identified our banks using
dialog: marked bills and are planning to
dialog: seize your funds today-

scene_heading: 48 EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN BANKS -- CONTINUOUS 48

scene_heading: 49 INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS 49

speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: You promised safe, clean money launder-
speaker_heading: LAU
dialog: With the investigation ongoing, none
dialog: of you can risk hanging on to your
dialog: own proceeds. And since the
dialog: enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my
dialog: competitors out of business, I'm
dialog: your only option.
speaker_heading: MARONI
dialog: So what are you proposing?
speaker_heading: LAU
dialog: Moving all deposits to one secure
dialog: location. Not a bank.
speaker_heading: GAMBOL
dialog: Where, then?
speaker_heading: LAU
dialog: Obviously, no one can know but me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: LAU (CONT'D)
dialog: If the police were to gain leverage
dialog: over one of you everyone's money
dialog: would be at stake.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: What stops them getting to you?
speaker_heading: LAU
dialog: As the money is moved I go to Hong
dialog: Kong. Far from Dent's jurisdiction.
dialog: And the Chinese will not extradite
dialog: one of their own.
text: From the back of the room comes LAUGHTER. It grows and grows,
dialog: until it fills the room. All eyes turn:
text: The Joker. Sweaty clown makeup obscuring the AWFUL SCARS
text: which widen his mouth into a PERMANENT, GHOULISH SMILE.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: I thought I told bad jokes.
speaker_heading: GAMBOL
dialog: Give me one reason I shouldn't have
dialog: my boy here pull your head off.
text: The Joker pulls out a freshly sharpened pencil.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: How about a magic trick?
text: The Joker SLAMS the pencil into the table, leaving it UPRIGHT.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll make this pencil disappear.
text: Gambol nods. His BODYGUARD MOVES at the Joker- who SIDESTEPS-
text: GRIPS his head- SLAMS it, FACE DOWN, onto the table...
text: The Bodyguard goes LIMP and slides off of the table. The
text: PENCIL is gone. MAGIC. The Joker BOWS. Grins at Gambol.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: And by the way, the suit wasn't cheap.
dialog: You should know. You bought it.
text: Gambol STANDS, furious. The Chechen stops him.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: Sit. I wanna hear proposition.
text: The Joker nods his thanks. Rises.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: A year ago these cops and lawyers
dialog: wouldn't dare cross any of you.
dialog: What happened? Did your balls drop
dialog: off? See, a guy like me-
speaker_heading: GAMBOL
dialog: A freak.
dialog: Laughs. Which the Joker tries to ignore.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: A guy like me... I know why you're
dialog: holding your little group therapy
dialog: session in broad daylight. I know
dialog: why you're afraid to go out at night.
dialog: Batman. He's shown Gotham your true
dialog: colors. And Dent's just the
dialog: beginning.
dialog: (indicates Lau)
dialog: And as for his so-called plan- Batman
dialog: has no jurisdiction. He'll find him
dialog: and make him squeal.
dialog: (smiles at Lau)
dialog: I can tell the squealers every time.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: What you propose?
speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: It's simple. Kill the Batman.
dialog: Jeers. Laughter.
speaker_heading: MARONI
dialog: If it's so easy why haven't you done
dialog: it already?
speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: Like my mother used to tell me- if
dialog: you're good at something, never do
dialog: it for free.
speaker_heading: CHECHEN
dialog: How much you want?
speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: Half.
text: Laughter. The Joker shrugs. Rises.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't deal with this now, soon

dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: GAMBOL
dialog: Enough from the clown.
text: Gambol gets up, MOVING at the Joker, who casually opens his

speaker_heading: THE JOKER
dialog: Let's not blow this out of all
dialog: proportion.
text: Gambol stares at the Joker. Hard.
speaker_heading: GAMBOL
dialog: You think you can steal from us and
dialog: just walk away? I'm putting the
dialog: word out- 5 hundred grand for this

dialog: get to teach him some manners, first.
text: The Joker shrugs. Turns to the assembled.
speaker_heading: THE JOKER

speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: DENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd
dialog: asked, I could have taken his passport-
dialog: I told you to keep me in the loop.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yeah? All that was left in the vaults
dialog: were the marked bills- they knew we
dialog: were coming! As soon as your office
dialog: got involved, there's a leak-
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: My office?! You're sitting down
dialog: here with scum like Wuertz and
dialog: Ramirez...
dialog: (off look)
dialog: Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Don't try to cloud the fact that

dialog: Dent turns to Batman.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: We need Lau back, but the Chinese

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: If I get him to you, can you get him

speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Sorry.
text: Fox picks up the chest, demonstrating its flexibility.
speaker_heading: FOX

speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Well, I do love Chinese food. And
dialog: Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
dialog: we'd been deliberately wasting your

speaker_heading: LAU
dialog: Just accidentally wasting it.
speaker_heading: FOX

dialog: It won't matter. The head guys make

dialog: commercials?
text: Laughter. Dent shifts, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: WAYNE (CONT'D)
dialog: II Believe in Harvey Dent.' Nice
dialog: slogan, Harvey. Certainly caught
dialog: Rachel's attention. But then I
dialog: started paying attention to Harvey,
dialog: and all he's been doing as our new
dialog: D.A., and you know what? I believe
dialog: in Harvey Dent. On his watch, Gotham
dialog: can feel a little safer. A little
dialog: more optimistic. So get out your
dialog: checkbooks and let's make sure that
dialog: he stays right where all of Gotham
dialog: wants him...
dialog: (raises his glass)

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You can't ask me to wait for that.
text: Wayne takes Rachel's arms, looking at her, excited.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: It's happening now- Harvey is that

speaker_heading: STEPHENS
dialog: Just the normal number of bad guys
dialog: in the building- and they're all

speaker_heading: LOEB
dialog: How'd they get my D.N.A.?
dialog: Gordon looks at Stephens's list.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Somebody with access to your house

speaker_heading: DENT

dialog: them gunning for you makes you see
dialog: things clearly.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: Yeah. It makes you think about what

text: Rachel looks at Dent. Smiles.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The rest of your life, huh? That's

speaker_heading: ALFRED

dialog: The bandit had been throwing the
dialog: stones away.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: So why was he stealing them?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Because he thought it was good sport.
dialog: Because some men aren't looking for

speaker_heading: REESE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: The Joker killed Gordon- and, and

speaker_heading: BATMAN
dialog: You're the symbol of hope that I
dialog: could never be. Your stand against
dialog: organized crime is the first
dialog: legitimate ray of light in Gotham
dialog: for decades. If anyone saw this,
dialog: everything would be undone- all the
dialog: criminals you got off the streets
dialog: would be released. And Jim Gordon

speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.
dialog: They'll hate you for it, but that's

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 75.
dialog: Wayne shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Today I've found out what Batman

dialog: conference for two reasons. Firstly,
dialog: to assure the citizens of Gotham
dialog: that everything that can be done
dialog: over the Joker killing is being done.
dialog: Secondly, because the Batman has
dialog: offered to turn himself in-
speaker_heading: The crowd REACTS
speaker_heading: HECKLER
dialog: So where is he?!
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: But first. Let's consider the
dialog: situation: should we give in to this
dialog: terrorist's demands? Do we really
dialog: think that-
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: You'd rather protect an outlaw

dialog: The Batman is an outlaw...
scene_heading: 153 INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 153
text: Rachel is watching the press conference on TV.
speaker_heading: DENT (O.S.)
dialog: But that's not why we're demanding
dialog: he turn himself in. We're doing it

dialog: happy to let Batman clean up our
dialog: Streets for us until now-
scene_heading: 154 INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- CONTINUOUS 154
speaker_heading: HECKLER
dialog: Things are worse than ever!

speaker_heading: COP HECKLER
dialog: NO MORE DEAD COPS!!

text: Rachel comes up to Alfred. Upset.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why is he letting Harvey do this,
dialog: Alfred?
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: I don't know. He went down to the
dialog: press conference-
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And just stood by?!
speaker_heading: ALFRED
dialog: Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent
dialog: believe that Batman stands for
dialog: something more important than a
dialog: terrorist's whims, Miss Dawes, even
dialog: if everyone hates him for it.
speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: That's the sacrifice he's making- to
dialog: not be a hero. To be something more.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, you're right about one thing-
dialog: letting Harvey take the fall is not
dialog: heroic.
text: Rachel holds out an ENVELOPE.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DENT

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: DENT
dialog: You wouldn't dare try to justify

dialog: You thought we could be decent men
dialog: in an indecent world. You thought
dialog: we could lead by example. You thought
dialog: the rules could be bent but not

speaker_heading: BATMAN

speaker_heading: BATMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You either die a hero or live long
