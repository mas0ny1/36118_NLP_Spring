dialog: 
dialog: I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened

dialog: 
dialog:

text: Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK.
text: A warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH (O.S.)
dialog: 
text: And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
dialog: searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the

text: CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine envelope
dialog: filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face of
text: the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon imp with

dialog: 
text: A MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder.
text: The man discards the glassine envelope...

dialog: 
text: as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" up. Let the

dialog: 
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
dialog: 
text: Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part of
dialog: a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these

dialog: 
dialog: A FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON
dialog: 
text: are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their
text: arms linked together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CURVE
dialog: 
text: leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly,
text: shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom

dialog:

dialog: us, womblike, peaceful...
dialog: 
text: ...AND OUT OF THE DARKNESS,
dialog: 
text: something takes shape - a CROW. Winging its way from Ashe's dream-like

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CITY OF ANGELS - NIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Crow flies over a bridge with spans the Styx - the city's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CROW
dialog: 
text: rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods,
text: and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present
text: ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass
text: welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO BACK".
dialog: Nevertheless, we continue on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH (V.O.)
dialog: 
dialog: They say that time cancels pain. I don't know about that. Eight

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CROW
dialog: 
text: sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and
text: grimy glass. Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent

dialog: 
scene_heading: WE PASS OVER SARAH'S ROOFTOP
dialog: 
text: The Crow circles downward...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH (V.O.)

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As Sarah rises the Crow flits away like yesterday's memory. Sarah's

text: Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of
dialog: the bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
dialog: Hey, Gabriel...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sarah gives the cat an obligatory behind-the-ear scratch, then
text: climbs from bed, making her way across the loft.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH'S ARTIST LOFT
dialog: 
text: is furnished in thrift-store treasures. The loft has an earthy
text: warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside -
text: an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle
text: window through which Sarah can view the local wildlife on the
text: streets below.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON SARAH'S CANVASSES
dialog: 
text: Turbulent oils reminiscent of history's brooding symbolist painters.
dialog: Give Sarah's childhood inspiration, the subject matter is no
dialog: real surprise.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA ISOLATES a work-in-progress. The painting depicts a woman
text: resembling Sarah being cradled in the arms of her pale-faced
text: lover, surrounded by a sea of watchful dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
text: reaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper
text: arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black
text: angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She's got a ring
text: in her navel, another in a nipple...
dialog: 
dialog: In short, the skate-waif we knew back in Detroit has matured
dialog: quite a bit since that fateful Devil's Night. Sarah shuts here
text: eyes, turns her face up into the spray. For a brief second we
dialog: see a flash of...

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sarah's eyes snap open. She holds a hand out to the shower wall,
text: takes a moment to collect herself.
dialog: 
text: Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes.
text: Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh,
dialog: the symbol of eternity.
dialog: 
text: As Sarah sites in front of her vanity we catch sight of the irony
text: mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the mask is
dialog: a...
dialog: 
text: TARNISHED WEDDING RING
dialog: 
text: Once Shelly's. There's an inscription inside - "FOREVER".
dialog: 
text: Sarah fingers the ring a moment, glancing at the irony mask.
dialog: Lots of memories. Lots of ghosts.

speaker_heading: (WISTFULLY)
dialog: 
dialog: Me too.
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. SARAH'S LOFT, STREET - DUSK
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: An ill-wind kicks up trash and grit. Sarah glances down. Dozens
text: of the glassine imp envelopes swirl around Sarah's feet like
text: confetti. One of the envelopes has stuck to her heel. As she
text: peels it off, she catches sight of...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A PALE FACE
dialog: 
text: in a shadowed entryway. It's a TEENAGED GIRL (16), strung out
text: on drugs. The girl cowers in a narrow stairway, hugging herself,
text: shivering from withdrawal.
dialog: 
text: Sarah draws closer, notices some of the grinning imp drug sachets
text: at the girl's feet. The girl shies away, frightened, suspicious.

dialog: 
text: Behind Sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop - walls covered

text: Judah reaches for metal rod, lashing out at Ashe's bare, bloodied
dialog: back...
dialog: 
text: WHACK! Ashe SCREAMS. Judah is hell-bent on beating Ashe into
text: oblivion. With every stroke of the switch the crowd CHEERS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON ASHE
dialog: 
text: His eyes are rolling to whites as consciousness begins to recede...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASHE'S POV
dialog: 
text: The swirling faces of the masked celebrants, with Judah front
text: and center. Mob mentality, everyone drunk and LAUGHING, jeering
text: at Ashe, the dangling fool. It's a scene out of Hell...
dialog: 
text: .. and behind Judah, a familiar figure pushing her way to the
text: front of the crowd...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
text: lunges forward, clutching the misericord, shoving a reveller
dialog: aside...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
dialog: Get away from him!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Judah turns. Sarah drives the misericord into Judah's eye. Judah,
text: momentarily blinded, falls back...
dialog: 
text: Sarah unlashes the end of the chain from the hydrant...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASHE
dialog: 
text: falls to the street as the chain CLATTERS over the street lamp.
text: He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back
dialog: up...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASHE
dialog: 
dialog: Sarah, get back!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Too late. Judah has torn the misericord from his eye. He rushes
dialog: up to Sarah and...
dialog: 
text: ...THUNK! Drives it deep into her chest.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASHE
dialog: 
dialog: SARAH!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle.
text: She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the
text: wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then
text: falls back.
dialog: 
text: Silence now as the crowd begins to back away. The mood has shifted.
dialog: 
text: Ashe drops by Sarah's side. She stares up at the sky, eyes wide
dialog: with wonder...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
dialog: The crows...I can see them coming...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH'S POV
dialog: 
text: Once again, the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the
dialog: sky.
dialog: 
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 
text: Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been
text: burning since the moment of his resurrection. He rises. All reason
text: is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled
dialog: animal fury.
dialog: 
text: Ashe launches himself at Judah, sending the villain tumbling
text: back into a nest of scaffolding. One of the pipes punches clear
text: through Judah's chest, impaling him!
dialog: 
text: Judah hangs there, transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck
text: through it. He struggles to pull himself from the piping, but
text: even so, he's laughing hysterically...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDAH
dialog: 
dialog: You can't stop me anymore, Ashe. You don't have the power.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ashe's eyes boil with hatred.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASHE
dialog: 
dialog: If it were just me, you'd be right, Judah. But I have an eternity
dialog: of pain to call upon...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ashe lifts his hands up, exposing his bleeding palms.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASHE
dialog: 
dialog: And the pain gives me strength.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASHE'S PALMS
dialog: 
text: As we watch the stigmata close themselves up, blood drawing itself
text: back into the wounds.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - NIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black tidal
text: wave. They descend on Judah as one entity, SCREAMING down from
text: the heavens like a storm of razor blades.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDAH
dialog: 
dialog: NO!!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We get one final glimpse of horrified Judah's face, eyes wide
text: with terror, before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDAH
dialog: 
text: lets loose a DEATH-SHRIEK that all but splits the sky as the
text: myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: There's a balance that needs to be kept...someone had to cross

text: over her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
dialog: I didn't want it to be you...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sarah looks up at Ashe, tries her level best to smile. She's
text: at death's door now - one foot already over the threshold. Her
text: face is pale, having lost so much blood. Tears spill down Ashe's
text: cheeks, causing the war-paint makeup to run in rivulets.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASHE
dialog: 
dialog: (in anguish)
dialog: 
dialog: I can't go with you, Sarah. I have to stay here now.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
dialog: Do you love me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ashe nods.
dialog: 
text: Sarah reaches down to the wedding ring which hangs from her neck
text: on the chain. She tugs at the chain, snapping it apart. She holds
text: the ring out to Ashe.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
dialog: Take...this...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ashe takes the ring from Sarah. She closes Ashe's hand around
text: the ring, gripping his fist tightly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
dialog: I'll wait for you. Forever, if I have to.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: 
dialog: ...nothing can keep them apart.
dialog: 
dialog: (her voice fading)
dialog: 
dialog: ...nothing.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Ashe nods, trying to let this thought reassure him. It's the
text: only thing he has left to cling to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARAH'S POV
dialog: 
text: Ashe's face, surrounded by a nimbus of light. We're falling away
text: from him. Down, down, down. And as we fall, we hear a FLUTTERING
speaker_heading: OF WINGS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SARAH'S FACE
dialog: 
text: Her eyes lose focus. Her head goes slack in Ashe's arms. She's
dialog: gone.
dialog: 
text: Ashe lowers his lips to her, kissing her one final time.
dialog: 
text: Ashe cradles Sarah's lifeless body in his arms, gently rocking
text: back and forth, tears streaming down his cheeks.
dialog: 
text: And as we pull back from them, we realize that the scene mirrors
text: the prophetic image from Sarah's own painting - the woman dying
text: in the arms of her lover, surrounded by a gallery of skull-masked
dialog: celebrants.
dialog: 
text: Ashe stands, lifting Sarah in his arms. He turns to leave...
dialog: 
text: THE DAY OF THE DEAD CROWD
dialog: 
text: slowly part for him, revealing a path of marigold petals leading
text: away down the street. It's almost as if, by silent consensus,

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The same church we visited the night before. Ashe, still carrying
text: Sarah in his arms, enters the sanctuary.
dialog: 
text: The church is aglow with candles. Ashe lays Sarah's body down
text: in front of the offrenda, folding her arms across her chest,
text: leaving her in a state of repose. He stands, taking in one last
dialog: look.
dialog: 
text: As Ashe moves to leave, he sees the elderly priest he had spoken

dialog: 
text: Ashe moves out from the shadows into the steadily growing light,
text: watching them. We see just a hint of hope in his eyes - hope
