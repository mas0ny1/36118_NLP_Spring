dialog: 1 EXT. SWEDEN - DAY 1
dialog: A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of
dialog: railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a
dialog: scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings -
dialog: 2 EXT. CABIN - ESTABLISHING A2
scene_heading: 2 INT. CABIN - LAKE SILJAN - DAY 2
dialog: An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin -
dialog: a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting
dialog: and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: What kind is it?
dialog: VANGER O/S
dialog: I don't know. White.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: And the frame?
dialog: VANGER O/S
dialog: Dark.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: Postmark?
dialog: VANGER O/S
dialog: Same as last time.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: No note.
dialog: VANGER O/S
dialog: No.
dialog: 3 INT. VANGER'S STUDY - SAME TIME 3
dialog: Henrik Vanger - at 82, even older than Morell - listens
dialog: to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled
dialog: room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: I can't take it anymore.
speaker_heading: MORELL O/S
dialog: I know. I'm sorry, Henrik.
dialog: There's nothing more to say. Vanger sets the receiver
dialog: down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame
dialog: resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in.
dialog: It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now
dialog: burst outside -

scene_heading: 4 INT. COURTHOUSE - STOCKHOLM - DAY 4
dialog: Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of
dialog: reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building.
dialog: As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing
dialog: in his direction. Without stopping -
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: What is this, the media event of the
dialog: year?
speaker_heading: REPORTER 1
dialog: Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it
dialog: won't work.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Don't try to play it up, that won't
dialog: either.
scene_heading: 4A EXT. COURTHOUSE - STOCKHOLM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 4A
dialog: Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime,
dialog: which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his
dialog: umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him -
dialog: REPORTER 2
dialog: Will you appeal?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'll appeal to you, Viggo: Find a
dialog: real story to cover.
dialog: He hurries off in the rain.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER V/O
dialog: Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist
dialog: was found guilty today on 16 counts
dialog: of aggravated libel against financier
dialog: Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
scene_heading: 5 INT. CAFE - STOCKHOLM - DAY 5
dialog: At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee,
dialog: and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself
dialog: fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV. He's the only
dialog: one there who watches it - no one else is interested -
dialog: which only makes it worse.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: TV NEWSCASTER
dialog: In an article published earlier
dialog: this year, Blomkvist claimed
dialog: Wennerstrom - founder and president
dialog: of The Wennerstrom Group - used State
dialog: funds intended for industrial
dialog: development in Poland for an arms
dialog: deal with the right-wing Ustashe in
dialog: Croatia.
dialog: The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the
dialog: courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal
dialog: team, confidently addressing the reporters -
dialog: WENNERSTROM ON TV
dialog: I have nothing against Mr.
dialog: Blomkvist. He's a good journalist
dialog: who I don't believe is guided by
dialog: malice. But what he wrote was
dialog: inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go
dialog: unanswered. He - all journalists -
dialog: have to accept like the rest of us,
dialog: actions have consequences.
dialog: Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Marlboro Red ... and a lighter.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. CAFE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 6
dialog: He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette.
dialog: Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the
dialog: lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
dialog: Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.
dialog: TV NEWSCASTER V/O
dialog: Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600
dialog: thousand SKE in damages and all court
dialog: costs, which could be significantly
dialog: more.
dialog: He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful
dialog: feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it,
dialog: finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.
scene_heading: 7 EXT. MILLENNIUM OFFICES, STOCKHOLM - DAY - ESTABLISHING 7
dialog: 8 INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY 8
dialog: He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly-
dialog: young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man-
dialog: walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the
dialog: editor's office.
dialog: 4.

dialog: 
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Where you been?
dialog: Erika Berger is about Blomkvist's age, and - like the
dialog: IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a
dialog: mini-skirt.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Walking. Thinking.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Smoking?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Just one.
dialog: He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: TV4 called. I told them no
dialog: statement until we've read the
dialog: judgment in its entirety.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I have. Who else?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Everyone who's ever wanted to see
dialog: you humiliated.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: You've been on the phone all day
dialog: then.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: I'm as much to blame for this as you.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: You are? You wrote it?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: I read it. I ran it.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Not the same.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Mine is.
dialog: They regard each other in another silence. Then -
dialog: 5.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm tired. I feel like climbing
dialog: under a duvet and sleeping for a
dialog: week.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Alone?
dialog: He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: I already called Greger and told him
dialog: I wouldn't be home tonight.

dialog: A motorcycle dives down a driveway that burrows under a
dialog: three-story building.
scene_heading: 10 INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - MILTON SECURITY - DAY 10
dialog: Dragan Armansky, 40's, who looks more like a boss of a
dialog: New Jersey crime family than CEO of a high-tech security
dialog: firm, sits behind his desk, waiting with an older client.
dialog: ARMANSKY
dialog: It's possible we could wait forever.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: You called her, I thought. You spoke
dialog: to her.
dialog: ARMANSKY
dialog: I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: I don't understand.
dialog: ARMANSKY
dialog: No one here likes her. So it's
dialog: better if she works at home.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: But you told her I wanted to meet
dialog: her.
dialog: ARMANSKY
dialog: But I've told her many more times I
dialog: prefer her not to meet clients.
scene_heading: 11 INT. MILTON SECURITY - SAME TIME - DAY 11
dialog: The figure from the motorcycle crosses the lobby. From
dialog: behind we can't see him/her well, but can see wary looks
dialog: from others emerging from and getting into the elevator.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: FRODE V/O
dialog: But you like her.
speaker_heading: ARMANSKY V/O
dialog: Very much. She's one of the best
dialog: investigators I have. As you saw
dialog: from her report -
scene_heading: 12 INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - CONTINUED 12
dialog: The report on Armansky's desk is 200 pages long.
dialog: INSERT: Printed on its cover: Mikael Blomkvist, a case
dialog: number and, smaller, its author, Lisbeth Salander.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: But.
dialog: ARMANSKY
dialog: I'm concerned you won't like her.
dialog: She's different.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: In what way.
dialog: ARMANSKY
dialog: In every way.
scene_heading: 13 INT. MILTON SECURITY - STOCKHOLM - SAME TIME - DAY 13
dialog: The black-clad figure - from behind again - strides past
dialog: coworkers who look away.
scene_heading: 14 INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - CONTINUED 14
speaker_heading: SECRETARY/INTERCOM
dialog: Ms. Salander's here.
dialog: Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom
dialog: button twice to say `okay, let her in.'
dialog: Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic-
dialog: looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair -
dialog: pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably
dialog: several more under her black leather jacket - black t-
dialog: shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots.
dialog: Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his
dialog: initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This
dialog: is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me.
dialog: ARMANSKY
dialog: Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: How do you do?
dialog: 7.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him:
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Something wrong with the report?
dialog: FRODE
dialog: No. It seems quite thorough.
dialog: There's a wealth of data here. But
dialog: I'm also interested to know what's
dialog: not in it.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: There's nothing not in it.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: Your opinion of him isn't.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I'm not paid to give my opinion.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: So you don't have one?
dialog: Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back
dialog: begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually -
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: He's clean. In my opinion.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: He's - excuse me?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: He's honest. He's who he presents
dialog: himself to be. In his business,
dialog: that's an asset.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: There's less in his asset column
dialog: after his conviction today.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: That's true. He made a fool of
dialog: himself with that. If it happened
dialog: that way.
dialog: Frode looks at Armansky. What's that supposed to mean?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: If he made up the story, that's
dialog: out of character. So is giving up
dialog: without a fight. People don't do
dialog: things that are out of character.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: Are you saying he was set up?
dialog: 8.
dialog: 8.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: That wasn't part of my assignment.
dialog: And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: You're quite right he made a fool of
dialog: himself professionally. How big of a
dialog: fool did he make of himself
dialog: financially?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: The judgement will just about empty
dialog: his savings.
dialog: This seems to please Frode more than anything else that
dialog: has been said, and Salander sees it.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: May I go?
dialog: FRODE
dialog: Your report is light in another
dialog: area. His personal life. Anything
dialog: you chose not to include?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Nothing that warranted inclusion.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: I'm not sure if that means yes or no.
dialog: ARMANSKY
dialog: I think what Ms. Salander means, and
dialog: I agree, is that everyone has a right
dialog: to a certain amount of privacy, even
dialog: when they're being investigated.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: Not in this case. I have to know
dialog: if there's anything about him I might
dialog: find unsavory - even if she doesn't.
dialog: Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and
dialog: encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no
dialog: more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: He's had a long sexual relationship
dialog: with his co-editor. It wrecked his
dialog: marriage, but not hers. Her husband
dialog: accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at
dialog: Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.
dialog: Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much
dialog: simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: FRODE
dialog: You were right not to include that.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I know.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: Anything else?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: No.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: Please think before you say no.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I did.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: I don't want to be surprised by
dialog: something later.
dialog: Salander offers nothing more.
dialog: FRODE
dialog: So. Nothing else. In the personal
dialog: department. You're sure.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He likes sandwiches.

scene_heading: 15 INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 15
dialog: Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed
dialog: snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika -
dialog: in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather
dialog: jacket.
dialog: She wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened
dialog: living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half-
dialog: eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Usually when I wake up in a cold
dialog: bed, it's at home.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: What are you doing?

dialog: You're taking over as publisher.
dialog: You're sorry for any nuisance
dialog: Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be
dialog: reached for comment.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: You're giving up.

dialog: For you.

dialog: Salander sits alone at a table waiting for someone with
dialog: a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a Christmas
dialog: bow, the price tag still on it, a paperback book - My 60
dialog: Memorable Games, by Bobby Fischer. She notices the price
dialog: tag is still on it. Peels it off. Dials a call on her
dialog: cell. Hangs up when it goes to voice mail.
scene_heading: A18 EXT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING A18
scene_heading: 18 INT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY 18
dialog: She knocks on a door. Hears classical music playing
dialog: softly inside, but no one answers. She tries the door.
dialog: It's unlocked. The gift in hand, she pushes it open.
dialog: She comes into an apartment which looks like it could
dialog: belong to a professor. Sees a chess piece on the floor.
dialog: Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess
dialog: table and, next to it, a body.
dialog: The gash on the old man's head could have been caused
dialog: by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to
dialog: it. She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing.
dialog: Calls for an ambulance.
scene_heading: 19 INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - EVENING 19
dialog: It's doubtful there's a stranger Christmas gathering
dialog: going on anywhere in the world. Standing around with

dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: Blomkvist; his teenage daughter Pernilla; his sister
dialog: Annika and her Italian husband; Erika and her weirdly
dialog: understanding artist husband Greger, whose arm is around
dialog: her waist; a few other friends (and perhaps lovers).
dialog: GREGER
dialog: You needed a better attorney. You
dialog: needed your sister.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: She offered.
dialog: ANNIKA
dialog: He declined.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: As she hoped.
dialog: ANNIKA
dialog: Never a good idea mixing family and
dialog: business.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: And I still would have lost.
dialog: GREGOR
dialog: Did you have ... anything on him.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I had a lot. It just wasn't any
dialog: good.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: It wasn't even about Mikael. It
dialog: was Wennerstrom sending a message to
dialog: the press as a whole - and the FSA:
dialog: Don't ask questions.
dialog: Blomkvist's daughter seems concerned for him.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to
dialog: worry about me.
dialog: PERNILLA
dialog: Mom's worried.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: About me?

dialog: About all that money.

scene_heading: 20 INT. SODER HOSPITAL - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 20
dialog: Outside the ICU, Salander sits on the floor like a dog
dialog: who won't leave the spot its master told it to wait. For
dialog: the first time since we've met her, she looks vulnerable.
dialog: The doors swing open. A doctor steps out. Salander gets
dialog: up to hear his report -
dialog: DOCTOR
dialog: You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: His ward. He doesn't have a
dialog: daughter.
dialog: The doctor isn't sure then if he should talk to her.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Please.
scene_heading: 21 INT. ICU - SODER HOSPITAL - LATER - NIGHT 21
dialog: Not allowed to go inside, she peers through glass at
dialog: Palmgren, who is unaware of her, or the nurse attending
dialog: him, or even himself. A spiderweb of tubes emerge from
dialog: his neck and wrists; oxygen tubes from his nostrils.
dialog: DOCTOR V/O
dialog: He's had severe cerebral
dialog: hemorrhaging. Either from the
dialog: fall itself, or a stroke that led to
dialog: the fall. His blood pressure is
dialog: still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain
dialog: consciousness, but that's not
dialog: assured. And it's possible, if he

dialog: What is that?
dialog: PERNILLA
dialog: You think it's all senseless but it
dialog: isn't. It's more natural to believe
dialog: in something than not to.
dialog: She begins eating. Blomkvist stares at her, feeling a
dialog: little sick. A cell phone rings. No one can tell - as
dialog: you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out.
dialog: It's Blomkvist's.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: Looking back at his daughter with some concern, he steps

dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Yes.
dialog: FRODE O/S
dialog: Forgive me for intruding on your

dialog: I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik

dialog: You know, you're calling at an

dialog: FRODE O/S
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down to
dialog: Christmas dinner myself.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: That's not what I mean.
dialog: FRODE O/S
dialog: You're referring to your recent
dialog: legal trouble. That has provided Mr.
dialog: Vanger with some entertainment.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: FRODE O/S
dialog: He doesn't care for Wennerstrom
dialog: either.
dialog: Frode, in his polite, deliberate way, is reeling
dialog: Blomkvist in like a perch.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Have him call me.
dialog: FRODE O/S
dialog: He'd like to meet in person if that's
dialog: okay. Up north. Hedestad.

dialog: Thank you for coming way out here.
dialog: Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's
dialog: insufficient coat. Would you like to
dialog: freshen up? We'll be having dinner

dialog: Unless you'd like a drink instead.
dialog: What would you like?

dialog: VANGER
dialog: What?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I can't stay for dinner.
dialog: Vanger looks thoroughly disappointed. Or hurt.

dialog: That you used to run one of the

dialog: My grandfather forged the tracks

dialog: I'm not obsessed with the declining

dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Doing.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Officially, assisting me with my

dialog: you'd do that by doing what you do so

dialog: She takes a Coke can from an anemically-stocked fridge
dialog: to a desk in her so-called living room, a clutter of full
dialog: ashtrays, fast food wrappers, empty soda cans, paperwork,
dialog: unwashed laundry.
dialog: The only things of any value here are her MacBook and
dialog: several external hard drives.

dialog: She types Dirch Frode in the search window. Clicks on
dialog: the top result which takes her to Frode's bio on Vanger
dialog: Industries' site with its distinctive V.I. logo.
dialog: His official company photo accompanies his profile:
dialog: Uppsala University Law School ... Assistant Counsel,
dialog: Vanger Industries, 1965-1972 ... Head Counsel, 1972-
dialog: present.
dialog: She types in another search - Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
dialog: Clicks on his Wikipedia page, which shows a photo of him
dialog: alongside his bio. She skims it -
dialog: President of the investment firm, Wennerstrom-gruppen ...
dialog: personal wealth of 12 billion dollars (80 billion kronor)
dialog: ... 82-foot yacht, villa on the island of Varmdo ...
dialog: She does a third search, types:
dialog: Wennerstrom+Vanger Industries - and hits the `cached'
dialog: option -
dialog: There are only a couple of results that include both
dialog: terms. She goes to one of them, a body of text of some
dialog: old page with the cached terms highlighted in yellow and
dialog: blue, and reads -
dialog: ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, CPA, Vanger Industries
dialog: Accounting Dept., 1971-1972 ...

dialog: 31 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1960 31
dialog: The children of the "thieves, misers, bullies and
dialog: incompetents" play on a beach. A shutter blinks freezing
dialog: a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white -
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: This is Harriet. The granddaughter
dialog: of my brother Richard.
dialog: 32 INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY 32
dialog: The same photograph of Harriet in a photo album Vanger
dialog: shows Blomkvist.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Richard, who I may as well start
dialog: with to get it out of the way, was a
dialog: Nazi of the first order - joining the
dialog: Nationalist Socialist Freedom League
dialog: when he was 17.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: A page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young
dialog: man in a uniform with a Nazi pin.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Isn't it interesting how fascists
dialog: always steal the word freedom.
dialog: (Blomkvist checks his watch)
dialog: The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway,
dialog: Richard died a martyr to the Nazi
dialog: cause in 1940 - missed all the real
dialog: excitement - but not the opportunity
dialog: to regularly beat his wife Margareta
dialog: and their son, Gottfried.
dialog: We see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father -
dialog: was what people used to call a Good-
dialog: Time-Charlie.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: They're still called that.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Are they? Okay.
dialog: INSERT: Close on a photo of Gottfried.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: He was a charmer, a ladies man, a
dialog: drunk. In other words, a born
dialog: salesman - which is what he did for
dialog: the company - traveling around,
dialog: taking clients out to dinner and so
dialog: on.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Someone has to do it.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: That's right. Anyway, he died in
dialog: 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the
dialog: island.
dialog: A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: His wife Isabella - who was pretty
dialog: much useless before as a parent -
dialog: became even more so after his death -
dialog: which is when I began looking after
dialog: their children - Martin - who runs
dialog: Vanger Industries now that I'm
dialog: retired - and Harriet.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: A photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: She was bright and curious, a
dialog: winning combination in any person.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: And beautiful.
dialog: Vanger nods as he regards the photo ...
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Something happened to her?
dialog: Vanger nods again; is silent for several moments ...
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Someone in the family murdered
dialog: Harriet and for the last forty years
dialog: has been trying to drive me insane.

dialog: Anna gathers the cups and leaves with the tea tray.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: It was September 21st, 1966. A
dialog: Saturday. Harriet was 16.
dialog: 36 EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY - 1966 36
dialog: Three generations of Vangers dot the grounds.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: My brothers - along with their
dialog: wives, children and grandchildren -
dialog: had gathered here for our loathsome
dialog: annual board meeting and dinner. It
dialog: was also the day the Yacht Club held
dialog: its Autumn parade.
dialog: 37 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY - 1966 37
dialog: And we see the parade, and, among the spectators lining
dialog: the town's main street, Harriet with other teenage girls.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: Harriet and a couple of school
dialog: friends had gone into town to watch
dialog: it. She returned a little after two
dialog: o'clock.
dialog: 38 INT. VANGER'S PARLOR - DAY - 1966 38
dialog: A clock in the room reads, 2:10. Vanger and a few family
dialog: members sip afternoon cocktails. Harriet appears.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: She came to the parlor. She asked
dialog: if she could talk to me. I honestly
dialog: don't remember what I was doing that
dialog: I thought was more important, but I
dialog: told her to give me a few minutes.
dialog: She leaves. He returns to the others in the room.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: But in a few minutes, before I could
dialog: go upstairs to talk to her, something
dialog: else occurred.
dialog: 39 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1966 39
dialog: A car and a fuel truck, both going too fast, collide on
dialog: the bridge. The truck rolls onto its side crushing the
dialog: car and spewing gasoline.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: The accident had nothing to do with
dialog: Harriet - and everything.
scene_heading: 40 INT. VANGER'S FAMILY ROOM - DAY - 1966 40
dialog: Vanger and the others react to the noise of the crash.
dialog: Out the large window they can see the bridge and many of
dialog: those on the grounds trotting down to get a closer look.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: It was chaos as everyone dropped what
dialog: they were doing.
dialog: 41 EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY - 1966 41
dialog: People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: Police, an ambulance, fire brigade,
dialog: reporter, photographer and onlookers
dialog: quickly arrived from town, as those
dialog: of us on the island - the family -
dialog: hurried to the bridge from our side.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: The truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but
dialog: the other motorist is trapped.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: The driver of the car - a Mr.
dialog: Aronsson - was pinned and severely
dialog: injured. All we could do was try to
dialog: pry him out with our hands - since
dialog: metal tools could spark.
dialog: A local newspaper photographer and another man, snap
dialog: pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry
dialog: the injured driver from his car. As the chaos ensues -
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: About twenty minutes after the crash,
dialog: Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna
dialog: herself saw her.
scene_heading: 42 INT. KITCHEN - VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966 42
dialog: Anna glances to Harriet as she comes in, then back out
dialog: the window to the bridge. Harriet passes a clock that
dialog: reads 2:35, steps outside, walks toward the woods ...
dialog: 43 EXT. THE BRIDGE - DUSK - 1966 43
dialog: As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make
dialog: progress extracting the driver from the car. A young man
dialog: coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: We finally got poor Aronsson out of
dialog: his car and off to the hospital, and
dialog: those of us on our side drifted back
dialog: to the house.
dialog: 44 INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966 44
dialog: The family has assembled at a long dining table.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: The sun was down, the excitement
dialog: over, we sat down to dinner. That's
dialog: when I noticed Harriet wasn't there.
dialog: Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else,
dialog: including the young man from the bridge, his jacket
dialog: draped on his chair, passes platters of food around.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: And she wasn't there the next
dialog: morning. Or the next. Or the next
dialog: forty years.

scene_heading: 45 INT. VANGER'S MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY 45
dialog: Vanger has the same look of concern on his face now as he
dialog: leads Blomkvist up some stairs.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: What was she going to tell me? Why
dialog: didn't I make time for her? Why
dialog: didn't I listen?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: She couldn't have run away?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Not without being seen.
dialog: 45A EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT - 1966 45A
dialog: The crews continue their work under lights.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Firemen stayed on the bridge all
dialog: night pumping out the gasoline. And
dialog: no one swam across, or took a row
dialog: boat. All of them were still tied up
dialog: on this side Sunday. Believe me, we
dialog: checked.
scene_heading: 45B INT. VANGER MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY 45B
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: She couldn't have fallen and drowned?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: The currents aren't strong here.
dialog: Anything that falls into the water
dialog: turns up nearby. Like her father.
dialog: His body didn't drift more than ten
dialog: meters when he drowned the year
dialog: before.
dialog: Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his
dialog: labored breathing.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: No. Someone killed her, Mr.
dialog: Blomkvist. Someone on the island
dialog: that day. Someone close enough to
dialog: know what she used to give me each
dialog: year on my birthday.
dialog: He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to
dialog: reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a
dialog: wall.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: VANGER
dialog: These were from her.
dialog: And, on another wall, forty similarly-framed flowers -
dialog: VANGER
dialog: These, from her killer.
dialog: Blomkvist regards the forty ...
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Who knows about these?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Me, the police, the murderer ...
dialog: and now you.
dialog: 46 EXT. STOCKHOLM - DUSK 46
dialog: It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before
dialog: a luxurious apartment building. Salander approaches from
dialog: the other direction. Passing, she notes the four number
dialog: tones the woman keys in the code lock.
dialog: The door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside.
dialog: Salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones
dialog: in the Milton Security lock.
scene_heading: 47 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STOCKHOLM - CONTINUOUS 47
dialog: Opulent foyer. Security camera. Antique elevator cage
dialog: whose cables pull the woman upstairs. Salander comes to
dialog: an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement
dialog: machine room. Examines tangles of phone lines, meters,
dialog: Wi-Fi routers. Photographs them with a digital camera.
dialog: She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer. The front
dialog: door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes
dialog: it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass.
dialog: The man is a driver/bodyguard. He continues to hold the
dialog: door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an
dialog: idling car and crosses to it in the rain ... Wennerstrom.
dialog: 48 EXT. VANGER'S MANOR - NIGHT 48
dialog: The rain here is icier and more punishing.
dialog: VANGER V/O
dialog: When the police investigation petered
dialog: out, I kept at it -
dialog: 25.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 49 INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT 49
dialog: They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: - studying their reports and
dialog: interviews, all the information there
dialog: was, and it's a lot. I've spent half
dialog: my life examining the events of a
dialog: single day.
dialog: And for all that, he's no closer to the truth.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I understand your frustration.
dialog: But what you're asking me to do is
dialog: a waste of money.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: We haven't discussed your fee.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: We don't need to. I can't find
dialog: something you haven't been able to
dialog: in forty years.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: You don't know that. You have a
dialog: very keen investigative mind.
dialog: Blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as
dialog: Vanger refills his wine glass.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Here's what I propose: You come
dialog: stay on the island. I have a nice
dialog: little cottage by the water you can
dialog: use. You study the material I give
dialog: you. You find something I've missed
dialog: - or you don't.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: You want me to set aside my life
dialog: and career for something that's a
dialog: complete waste of time.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Think of it as a well deserved
dialog: vacation. A way of avoiding all the
dialog: people you want to avoid right now.
dialog: (nothing from Blomkvist)
dialog: As for compensation, I'll pay you
dialog: twice your salary for as many months
dialog: as it takes. I'll quadruple it if
dialog: you solve the mystery.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Mr. (Vanger) -
dialog: VANGER
dialog: I'm not done. I'll throw in one
dialog: more thing - even though you're a
dialog: terrible negotiator. It's what you
dialog: want more than anything else and it
dialog: can't be bought at any price. I'll
dialog: give it to you ... Hans-Erik
dialog: Wennerstrom.
dialog: He pushes toward Blomkvist a plate: the carcass of the
dialog: fresh-killed and cooked duck they've been eating. It and
dialog: the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a
dialog: moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: He began his career working for me.
dialog: And I've followed it with interest,
dialog: shall we say, ever since. You were
dialog: right about him. You just couldn't
dialog: prove it.
scene_heading: A50 EXT. PLAGUE'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING A50
scene_heading: 50 INT. PLAGUE'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 50
dialog: Salander climbs a flight of stairs in a building that
dialog: couldn't be more different than Wennerstrom's. Knocks
dialog: on a door, waits, listens to some dead-bolts unlocking.
dialog: It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing
dialog: over 300 pounds. He offers her no greeting. Fades back
dialog: into the shadows of his dark apartment.
dialog: PLAGUE
dialog: Would you like to sit? I could
dialog: possibly clear a place if necessary.
dialog: It's hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish
dialog: that. The place is like a junkyard. Even the unmade bed
dialog: is covered with stuff.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Did you make it?
dialog: PLAGUE
dialog: Have you something for me?
dialog: She takes some cash from a pocket, hands it to him. He
dialog: counts it and is unimpressed with its total.
dialog: PLAGUE
dialog: I'm on welfare; I don't administer
dialog: it. This isn't enough.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I had to pay three months back rent
dialog: and eat a little bit. It's all I
dialog: have right now.
dialog: PLAGUE
dialog: I find that so poignant.
dialog: So much so that he does nothing more than look at her.
dialog: She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and
dialog: moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end
dialog: computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives
dialog: her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over
dialog: in her hands.
dialog: While it's clear both these people are deficient in
dialog: behavior that governs polite society, it's hard to tell
dialog: which lacks it more.
dialog: PLAGUE
dialog: No `thank you?'
scene_heading: 51 INT. MILLENNIUM OFFICE - EARLY MORNING 51
dialog: Erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks,
dialog: comes through the empty offices with a Wayne's Coffee to-
dialog: go cup - but Blomkvist is already there, packing supplies
dialog: from his desk, books from his shelf. A second suitcase,
dialog: presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor.
dialog: ERIKA V/O
dialog: You can't be serious -
scene_heading: 51A INT/EXT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - EARLY MORNING - LATER 51A
dialog: He zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and
dialog: gathers the rest.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: We're in our worst crisis ever and
dialog: you're writing a memoir?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: You fired me; I need something to do.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: You fired you; I need you here, not
dialog: the North Pole. You know what this
dialog: is going to look like.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Like I've been gutted. Like I'm
dialog: running away. I am.
dialog: They cross through the building, he with his cases, she
dialog: with her coffee cup.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Wennerstrom wants to see me waving
dialog: a white flag, not a red one. And the
dialog: more it looks like there's a problem
dialog: between you and me, the more it'll
dialog: satisfy him.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: There is a problem between us. He
dialog: won't be satisfied until he shuts us
dialog: down, and you're leaving me to fight
dialog: him alone.
dialog: He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a
dialog: statue - and steps outside.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: It's four hours by train. It's not
dialog: the North Pole.
scene_heading: 52 EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY 52
dialog: The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with
dialog: two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him.
dialog: He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi
dialog: stand.
speaker_heading: 53 INT. TAXI - MOVING - DAY 53
dialog: As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist
dialog: regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him
dialog: in the rear view mirror.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Think this snow's going to let up
dialog: anytime soon?
dialog: HUSSEIN
dialog: This is the North Pole.
scene_heading: 54 EXT. COTTAGE - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY 54
dialog: The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here
dialog: he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The
dialog: taxi drives off and disappears into the snow.
dialog: 55 INT. COTTAGE - DAY 55
dialog: Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would
dialog: call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold.
dialog: Blomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out
dialog: books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and
dialog: a small printer.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no
dialog: reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces
dialog: it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands
text: a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads
dialog: straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: What. Milk?
dialog: He opens the old fridge. No milk. Nothing.
dialog: 56 EXT. COTTAGE - DAY 56
dialog: He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone
dialog: out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water.
dialog: Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't.
scene_heading: 57 INT. MARKET - HEDESTAD - DUSK 57
dialog: He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some
dialog: packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food.
dialog: 58 EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK 58
dialog: He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow,
dialog: cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again.
dialog: Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever
dialog: - there are no cell towers anywhere around here.
dialog: 59 EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK 59
dialog: Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he
dialog: can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the
dialog: end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: It's me. I'm here. It's fucking
dialog: cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you
dialog: tried to call, the reception sucks,
dialog: and if you tried to email, there's
dialog: none of that either, so - so - I'm
dialog: here - and - I can't even speak it's
dialog: so fucking cold.
dialog: He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from
dialog: before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in
dialog: the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge.
dialog: 60 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 60
dialog: As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to
dialog: get a fire going using pages ripped from a book. It's a

dialog: In the machine room again, she pulls one cable away from
dialog: the others and wires to it to Plague's electronic box.
speaker_heading: 63 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN 63
dialog: The bell in the church tower clangs -
speaker_heading: 64 INT. COTTAGE - DAWN 64
dialog: But it's a knock that draws Blomkvist awake. Having
dialog: forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with
text: him, then the room, and groans. He pads to the door in
dialog: the freezing cold. Opens it to find a rugged older man
dialog: on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.
dialog: NILSSON
dialog: I'm Gunner. The caretaker.
speaker_heading: 65 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAWN 65
dialog: As Gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for
dialog: him, Blomkvist works at unpacking the boxes - documents,
dialog: fat police reports, notebooks, folders, photo albums.
dialog: NILSSON
dialog: You're an author.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm writing a biography of Mr.
dialog: Vanger, yes.
dialog: Nilsson nods, but isn't sure he believes it. Maybe he
dialog: took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down.
dialog: NILSSON
dialog: I saw you on television.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: That's unfortunate.
dialog: NILSSON
dialog: Bit of trouble, I guess.
dialog: Blomkvist nods and hopes that's enough to put an end to
dialog: the subject. It isn't.
dialog: NILSSON
dialog: No jail time, though. That's good.
dialog: Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?
dialog: 31.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: Blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat. Nilsson
dialog: dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made.
dialog: NILSSON
dialog: There.
dialog: 66 EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY 66
dialog: Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around
dialog: the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold
dialog: grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old
dialog: man, is inadequately dressed.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: The island is owned by my family.
dialog: Your closest neighbor is my brother
dialog: Harald, another Nazi if you can
dialog: believe. Two in the family. He's
dialog: detestable to put it nicely, but
dialog: you'll probably never see him. He's
dialog: a recluse.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: He was there that day?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Indeed he was.
dialog: Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a
dialog: suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -
dialog: VANGER
dialog: That's his daughter Cecilia's house.
dialog: They don't speak.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Does anyone speak to anyone on this
dialog: island?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother
dialog: - who lives there -
dialog: (points)
dialog: - she speaks to Harald - which is one
dialog: of reasons I don't speak to her.
dialog: (points)
dialog: Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Who doesn't he speak to?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: You, probably. Not that you'd want
dialog: him to. He can be as unpleasant as
dialog: Harald.
dialog: 32.
dialog: 32.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm quickly losing track who's who.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Oh, how you'll wish were it always
dialog: so. Soon you'll know us all only too
dialog: well - with my apologies.
dialog: (points)
dialog: Out there is my nephew Martin's
dialog: house; Harriet's brother.
dialog: It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Who speaks to him?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: I speak to him. He runs the company
dialog: now, as I think I told you.
dialog: They hear a distant rifle crack and echo. It startles
dialog: Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Someone shooting their dinner.
dialog: Gunner probably. The caretaker.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I just met him.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.
dialog: Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a
dialog: suspect. Vanger points off -
dialog: VANGER
dialog: He lives over there.
dialog: Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: And you live here.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Sorry?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Your house.
dialog: For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means.
dialog: Then he is, and is pleased by it.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 33.
dialog:

dialog: A nurse takes a tray away, leaving Salander alone with
dialog: Palmgren, separated by the chess table they won't playing
dialog: a game on. She wipes his mouth with her sleeve.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I got a call from social welfare.
dialog: I've been assigned a new guardian.
dialog: It's unlikely he understands what she has said. It's
dialog: unlikely he even knows she's there.
dialog: 68 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 68
dialog: Tacked to a wall, a map of the island on which Blomkvist
dialog: has written the names of the living Vanger family members
dialog: and staff in the approximate locations of their houses.
dialog: Next to it - 3x5 cards and photos - a Vanger family tree -
dialog: which doubles as a suspects list. On some of the cards
dialog: is the word, `deceased.'
dialog: He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins
dialog: reading the police reports. The first is a photocopy
dialog: of a note when the call from Vanger came in: "Officer
dialog: Morell informed by telephone of situation, 10:19 p.m."
dialog: 69 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT - 1966 69
dialog: Gustaf Morell stands at the bow of a patrol boat slowly
dialog: motoring past the bridge where the fire brigade works to

dialog: 70 INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966 70
dialog: Morell, feeling like he's entered an Agatha Christie
dialog: locked room mystery, regards the extended Vanger clan
dialog: sitting in the living room looking suitably worried.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: I'd like to see the girl's room.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: It's down the hall.

dialog: 
dialog: MORELL
dialog: I thought this was your house.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: It is. She lives with me.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: Are her parents alive?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Her mother is.
dialog: Vanger points Isabella out. Slender, overdressed and
dialog: smoking a Sobranie, she immediately strikes Morell as a
dialog: woman as venomous as she is beautiful.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: This way.
dialog: Morell follows Vanger down a hall -
dialog: INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Approx. 12:05, inspected
dialog: missing girl's bedroom. Found - "
scene_heading: 71 INT. HARRIET'S ROOM - VANGER MANOR - DAWN - 1966 71
dialog: A purse on the desk in Harriet's room. Morell carefully
dialog: removes the contents: Comb, pocket mirror, handkerchief,
dialog: wallet containing a few kronor, her ID, and her address
dialog: book. He leafs through this.
dialog: DET. MORELL
dialog: I want to speak to everyone here.
dialog: That'll take all night so you might
dialog: want someone to put some coffee on.
dialog: YOUNGER VANGER
dialog: What about the search?
dialog: MORELL
dialog: First thing in the morning.
dialog: YOUNGER VANGER
dialog: No. We should do it now. She could
dialog: be hurt out there.
dialog: Vanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Please. I beg you.

dialog: with Blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of his pipe.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: MORELL
dialog: But I also couldn't find a motive.
dialog: Was it spontaneous? Was it planned?
dialog: Did she know something someone wished
dialog: she didn't? Was it about business?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Business? She was sixteen.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: And very bright. Henrik told me he
dialog: could easily imagine her running the
dialog: business someday, which would mean
dialog: someone else wouldn't.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: She was with some friends that day.
dialog: At a parade. You must have talked to
dialog: them.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: She told them she wasn't feeling
dialog: well. She left early. But they also
dialog: said she kept secrets from them, too.
dialog: The main thing I learned talking to
dialog: them for hours is that teenage girls
dialog: are complicated.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I have one.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: So you know.
dialog: (Blomkvist does indeed)
dialog: Did you bring the last gift Henrik
dialog: received?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: It's at the National Forensic Lab.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: I can tell you what their report
dialog: will say now: It's a flower common
dialog: to Europe. All of them are. No
dialog: prints. No DNA.
dialog: He lights the pipe. Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I wanted to ask you about this.
dialog: He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket.
dialog: Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it
dialog: delicately. The decades have dried out its pages.
dialog: 37.
dialog: 37.
dialog: Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
dialog: MORELL
dialog: She received this from Henrik the
dialog: Christmas before. I studied it more
dialog: times than I can say. I know every
dialog: page of it.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: It's the last page I'm curious about.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: As was I.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: The only names not alphabetized.
dialog: Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns
dialog: to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting:
dialog: Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018
dialog: MORELL
dialog: They're local Hedestad phone numbers.
dialog: The first belonged to a woman named
dialog: Margot, whose mother was Magda, who
dialog: claimed she didn't know Harriet. The
dialog: fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie
dialog: Larsson, an elderly woman who died a
dialog: few years before. The other three
dialog: were unconnected in any way that I
dialog: could find.
dialog: He hands the address book back. It, and everything else
dialog: about the case, clearly trouble him still.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I've reminded you of things you'd
dialog: rather forget. I'm sorry.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka
dialog: Case.
dialog: Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.
dialog: MORELL
dialog: Every policeman has at least one
dialog: unsolved case. Back then it was old
dialog: Torstensson. Year after year he kept
dialog: returning to one - taking out the
dialog: files - uselessly studying them. As
dialog: young men, we had to laugh.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Was this also a missing girl case?
dialog: 38.
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: MORELL
dialog: No, that's not why I mention it.
dialog: The Rebecka Case is something that
dialog: happened before Harriet was born.
dialog: I'm talking about the soul of a
dialog: policeman. Poor Torstensson could
dialog: never solve it, and could never let
dialog: it go.
dialog: And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case.

dialog: 79 INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - DAY 79
dialog: As a man behind a desk reviews a thick file, Salander
dialog: reviews him: About 50; spends money on suits, thinking
dialog: that might disguise his public servant status; no wedding
dialog: ring; typical creep, as far as she's concerned.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was
dialog: told he had a stroke of some kind.
dialog: (nothing from Salander)
dialog: Terrible.
dialog: It is, but she can tell he couldn't care less. He leafs
dialog: through her file -
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: What exactly do you do at this
dialog: security company?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Make coffee and sort mail.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: But not full-time. Not even part-
dialog: time consistently. They somehow got
dialog: along without coffee or mail in July
dialog: and August?
dialog: Nothing from her.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: How much do you earn there?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Enough.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: How much is your rent?
dialog: 39.
dialog: 39.
dialog: Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I pay my rent.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: When's the last time you were late?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Never.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Do you think that ring in your eyelid
dialog: makes you attractive?
dialog: Salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all
dialog: her life, doesn't dignify the question with an answer.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Here's the problem. There a
dialog: discrepancy between the obligation of
dialog: Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the
dialog: management of your finances.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: It isn't a discrepancy or a problem.
dialog: It was clear to him I could manage my
dialog: own finances.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: But that's not clear to me.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I'm not a child.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: No. You're not.
dialog: (looks at her too long)
dialog: But you were. And between then and
dialog: now -
dialog: (indicating the files)
dialog: - two years in the locked ward at
dialog: St. Stephens, for violent aggression -
dialog: failure to adapt to four foster homes
dialog: and seven schools - arrested twice
dialog: for intoxication, twice for narcotics
dialog: use, and most recently for assault:
dialog: a bottle smashed into a man's face.
dialog: You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into
dialog: thinking you've improved, but looking
dialog: at this -
dialog: (the file)
dialog: - not to mention how you're looking
dialog: at me now - I can see you haven't.
dialog: So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are
dialog: over. Starting now, you'll be given
dialog: a monthly allowance. You'll provide
dialog: me with receipts for your expenses.

dialog: I've been on my own since I was
dialog: twelve.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: No. You've been a persistent burden
dialog: to the State since you were twelve.
dialog: She won't look at him any more - not that there's
dialog: anything even remotely interesting to see if she did.
speaker_heading: BJURMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ms. Salander? Please look at me.
dialog: Because this is important.
dialog: She does ... in a way that says, I'd like to kill you.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: This behavior you're displaying
dialog: right now is elaborately documented
dialog: here -
dialog: (in the file)
dialog: - so it would come as a shock to no
dialog: one if I chose an alternative to the
dialog: lenient arrangement I just outlined.
dialog: Is that what you're saying with your

dialog: 80 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - EVENING 80
dialog: Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road
dialog: Blomkvist has to climb to reach it, and the fact he, like
dialog: all writers, is out of shape, taxes him. A car driven by
dialog: an attractive woman in her 30's pulls alongside him.

dialog: LIV
dialog: I found him at death's door halfway
dialog: up the hill.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: No, it's a climb for anyone. I
dialog: should've warned you. Come on in.
dialog: Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand.
dialog: 82 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 82
dialog: The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern.
dialog: Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has
dialog: prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere.
dialog: LIV
dialog: I used to work in the company's
dialog: petrochemical division in Goteborg.
dialog: When it was sold, I went with it.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: A dark day.
dialog: LIV
dialog: I live in Hong Kong now, but come
dialog: back to Stockholm for family events,
dialog: and when I do, I drive up to spend a
dialog: couple days with Martin.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: She comes for the moose steak.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Is that what this is?
dialog: They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange,
dialog: wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine
dialog: in Blomkvist's glass and gets up.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: Something's open. You like this one,
dialog: or would you like to try something
dialog: else?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: That one's good.
dialog: Martin heads off to the kitchen. Blomkvist and Liv,
dialog: left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about.
dialog: LIV
dialog: I saw you on Sky News a while ago.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: That was a dark day.
dialog: LIV
dialog: Sorry to remind you of it.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: It's okay. There are worse things
dialog: than libel - though I can't
dialog: immediately think of one in my
dialog: business.
dialog: LIV
dialog: You're writing a book now, Martin
dialog: said.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Henrik's biography.
dialog: LIV
dialog: I love Henrik. He's fascinating.
dialog: Martin, too. Together they're the
dialog: Old Sweden and the New.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: They are.
dialog: LIV
dialog: You know about Harriet, right?
dialog: Blomkvist doesn't say. The sound of the wind stops.
dialog: LIV
dialog: You don't?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I do.
dialog: Martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in
dialog: hand and returns with it to the dining room.
dialog: LIV O/S
dialog: The family doesn't like to talk about
dialog: it, but it can't just be swept under
dialog: the rug.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: What can't.
dialog: LIV
dialog: Harriet.
dialog: Martin doesn't comment. Just nods. Silence. Then -

dialog: Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Maybe we could talk about that
dialog: later.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: We can talk about it now.
dialog: (Blomkvist glances to Liv)
dialog: Liv knows everything about my crazy
dialog: family. Which is why she'll never
dialog: marry me.
dialog: LIV
dialog: That's one reason.
text: She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it.
dialog: The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not
dialog: unlike Blomkvist and Erika.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: Don't put that in your book.
dialog: Anything else is fine. Harriet
dialog: certainly. Everything changed after
dialog: that. Not just the family, but the
dialog: company.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: How so.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but
dialog: we're still the largest family-owned
dialog: company in the country. At the
dialog: height, we had 40,000 employees. We
dialog: have about half that now, and that
dialog: downward slide - anyone can tell you -
dialog: began after my sister's death. It
dialog: broke Henrik's entrepreneurial
dialog: spirit, and his heart.
dialog: And Martin's, too, clearly. Blomkvist dares to ask, as
dialog: innocently as possible -
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: You were here that day?
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: Everyone was here, though I didn't
dialog: get in until after the accident on
dialog: the bridge. The 4:30 train.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I know it well.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: It was a terrible day. And the days
dialog: after - searching and not finding her
dialog: - were even worse.
dialog: Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: This event, Mikael, has to be a
dialog: big part of your book.
dialog: Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will.
dialog: 83 INT. STOCKHOLM METRO - DAY 83
dialog: As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a
dialog: subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of
dialog: her messenger bag from her shoulder -
dialog: She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the
dialog: junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down,
dialog: but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the
dialog: escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto
dialog: the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now.
dialog: She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the
dialog: junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He
dialog: wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator
dialog: and disappears into the underground station.
dialog: 84 INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY 84
dialog: Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of
dialog: Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks,
dialog: a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ...
text: A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top
dialog: of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find
dialog: a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: Hi. I thought I'd come over and say
dialog: hello. I'm Cecilia.
dialog: 85 INT. COTTAGE - DAY 85
dialog: Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the
dialog: wall. Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post-
dialog: It next to it that reads: Recent Photo?
dialog: INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager,
dialog: and a Post-It with her name on it.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: We're all uncomfortable with the
dialog: idea of a chronicle of our family.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: It's not about the family. It's
dialog: about Henrik and the company.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: Like I said.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: It's not my intention to present a
dialog: malicious portrait of anyone.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: Unlike the one that landed you in
dialog: court.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Unlike that one. Correct.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: So, what you're saying is, you're
dialog: not really here to look into what
dialog: happened to Harriet.
dialog: Silence. Then -
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
dialog: but no, that's not by any means my
dialog: focus.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: So all those boxes Gunner carted
dialog: down here - which are where? - in the
dialog: closet now? - weren't Henrik's
dialog: private investigation.
dialog: (Blomkvist can't think fast
dialog: enough to respond)
dialog: I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my
dialog: Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.
dialog: INSERT of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform
dialog: on the wall.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Since we're talking about it, since
dialog: you brought it up, what was Harriet
dialog: like?
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: I'm sure Henrik has told you.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: He was my age then, and so couldn't
dialog: know what was really going on with a
dialog: teenager any more than I can with my
dialog: own daughter. You were her age.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: Actually, my sister Anita was closer
dialog: to her in age.
dialog: INSERT of the photo on the wall of Anita, taken when she
dialog: was about 17 years old.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: She knew Harriet better than anyone -
dialog: certainly better than I did. You
dialog: should talk to her.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'd love to, where is she.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: If I had to guess - London.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: You don't know where your own sister
dialog: lives?
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: I haven't seen her in years. We
dialog: never really got along.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm getting used to that comment.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: That's the way it is when you're
dialog: always after the same boys.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: People generally get over that sort
dialog: of thing at a certain point.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: Oh, I'm long over it, and won't
dialog: ever have to worry about it again.
dialog: She hates this place even more than
dialog: I do. She left, moved to London and
dialog: that was it. You couldn't pay her to
dialog: send a Christmas card, much less
dialog: visit.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'll try to track her down for you.
dialog: CECILIA
dialog: Don't bother.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: For myself then.
dialog: He smiles. She studies him. Maybe he's not so bad.

dialog: trousers.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: You feel that? That's gaberdine.
dialog: Unzip them.
dialog: (she does)
dialog: And ...
dialog: (she tugs at his underwear)
dialog: And ...
dialog: (she doesn't move; he smiles)
dialog: I like the reticence. I prefer a
dialog: whore who pretends she isn't. It's
dialog: almost convincing.
dialog: He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him.
scene_heading: 90 INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT 90
dialog: Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private
dialog: bathroom. When she returns to the office, she finds him
dialog: calmly writing a check.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Here you go. As promised.
dialog: He holds it out to her, but when she reaches for it,
dialog: pulls it back a little.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: I know you're not thinking about
dialog: telling anyone about our date. Enjoy
dialog: your computer games.
dialog: She takes the check and leaves.
scene_heading: 91 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT 91
dialog: She sits cross-legged in the dark. Thinking. Or
dialog: plotting. The dragon tattoo visible on her bare back.
dialog: 92 INT. AIRLINE - IN FLIGHT - DAY 92
dialog: Blomkvist, who doesn't care for flying, pours two mini-
dialog: bottles of vodka into a plastic cup.
dialog: 93 EXT. LONDON - DAY 93
dialog: He sprays Binaca in his mouth. Then, careful to look
dialog: both ways, crosses the street to an investment bank.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 94 INT. OFFICE - INVESTMENT BANK - DAY 94
dialog: Blomkvist approaches a desk. The brass name plate on it
dialog: reads, Anita Vanger.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Excuse me. I'm sure I should have
dialog: made an appointment.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: It's fine. Please. Have a seat.
dialog: The accent is all British. She's been here much longer
dialog: than her home country. No trace of Swedish anymore. He
dialog: offers his hand -
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm Mikael.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: Mikael. How do you do.
dialog: As he sits, she regards him a little more carefully ...
dialog: ANITA
dialog: You're looking for investment
dialog: counseling, Mikael?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I would if had any money to invest.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm writing a biography of your
dialog: uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.
dialog: She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia
dialog: predicted, but it doesn't come.
speaker_heading: 95 EXT. CAFE - LONDON - DAY 95
dialog: They sit together at a little table on the sidewalk.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: How is Henrik?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Good. Engaging. I like him.
dialog: She does, too.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 51.
dialog: Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
dialog: ANITA
dialog: I haven't seen him in over 30 years.
dialog: Or my sister. Or anyone else in my
dialog: family.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Most of what I'm writing about
dialog: predates that, so your recollections
dialog: are valid.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: I wouldn't know where to start, if
dialog: that was a question.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I can narrow it. I've gotten up to
dialog: the 1960s. To the event that altered
dialog: everything in Henrik's life.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: Harriet.
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: Everything I knew about that I told
dialog: to - whatever his name was - that
dialog: policeman - when it happened.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Morell.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: My recollections then were a lot
dialog: better than they are now.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm not speaking of the crime itself.
dialog: I'm trying to get a clearer sense of
dialog: what Harriet was like. Particularly,
dialog: toward the end.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: She was messed up. Like all us
dialog: Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken
dialog: father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi
dialog: like mine.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Was he abusive?
dialog: ANITA
dialog: Mine?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Hers.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: ANITA
dialog: I never saw it myself, but you could
dialog: tell something was going on. One day
dialog: she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd
dialog: be putting on makeup and wearing the
dialog: tightest sweater she had to school.
dialog: The next she'd be studying a Bible
dialog: like a nun - no Vanger was ever
dialog: religious - can you imagine?
dialog: Obviously, she was very unhappy.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: She never confided in you what about,
dialog: specifically?
dialog: ANITA
dialog: There was no specifically. It was
dialog: everything. It was being part of
dialog: that family. Henrik's the only
dialog: decent person in it.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: What do you think happened to her?
dialog: ANITA
dialog: Everyone knows what.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: But you have no ... thoughts about
dialog: why, or who.
dialog: ANITA
dialog: All I know is I always felt sorry
dialog: for her. Even more than for myself.
dialog: I got out of there when I was 18 and
dialog: never went back. She would have done
dialog: the same but didn't make it to 18.
dialog: 96 EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY 96
dialog: Salander, on a park bench, debates with herself if she
dialog: wants to make the call on the cell in her hand. She
dialog: scrolls to "NB" and hits send. It connects.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth
dialog: Salander.
dialog: (the call is put through)
dialog: ... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed
dialog: our appointment. I had a lot of work
dialog: ... no, nothing to be concerned about
dialog: ... I need another advance on my
dialog: allowance. Can I come to your office
dialog: tonight? ... I don't need a pen,
dialog: what's the address?
dialog: 53.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 97 EXT/INT. HEDEBY ISLAND - TAXI - MOVING - DUSK 97
dialog: The taxi that first brought him here to the island,
dialog: crosses the bridge. Again, Blomkvist regards the Middle
dialog: Eastern driver, who regards him in the rearview mirror.
scene_heading: 98 EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 98
dialog: Outside the building's entrance with a backpack slung
dialog: over her shoulder, Salander presses an apartment button.
dialog: As she waits, she notes there's no security camera.
speaker_heading: BJURMAN O/S
dialog: Yes?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: It's me.
dialog: The door buzzes. She pushes it open.
scene_heading: 99 INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 99
dialog: She moves along a hallway with both purpose and dread.
text: Knocks on his door ... It opens, revealing him in a robe.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Come on in.
scene_heading: 100 INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 100
dialog: She takes in the layout quickly: living room, dining
dialog: area, kitchen, short hallway to a closed door.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Like it?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: It's nice.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: It's home.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: So, what do you need money for this
dialog: time? Grand Theft Auto 5?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Food.
text: He smiles. Steps toward her. Lifts her chin.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: How are you? Been thinking about
dialog: last time? Decided you wanted to see
dialog: me again?
dialog: 54.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I just want my money.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Well, let's see if I can help you out
dialog: with that.
dialog: He walks to the hallway. She doesn't. He holds out
dialog: his hand. She finally joins him. As they step into the
dialog: bedroom, he roughly pushes her toward the bed.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Wait.
dialog: She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair.
text: Sits on the edge of the bed. He stands over her. She
dialog: knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Is there a problem?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I just want to know, am I going to
dialog: have to do this every time I need
dialog: money to eat?
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: It's so cute when you do that surly
dialog: thing. Take my hand
dialog: She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's
dialog: a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other
dialog: to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out.
dialog: He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into
dialog: unconsciousness.
scene_heading: 100A INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT 100A
dialog: She comes to, on her stomach, sees her wrists cuffed to
dialog: the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts
dialog: with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off. She
dialog: starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her
dialog: underwear.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Please. I have neighbors.
dialog: He lights a couple candles. Switches on some New Age
dialog: music.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: What we're going to do now is teach
dialog: you the value of money.
dialog: He watches her struggle. But she's not going anywhere.
dialog: He tears open a condom package with his teeth.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: I forget - did I ask you before if
dialog: you liked anal sex?
dialog: He crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top
dialog: of her. She keeps fighting but there's not much she can
dialog: do handcuffed. Eventually, she retreats to another place
dialog: inside herself. She's had to go here before in her life;
dialog: it's the only place to go in such situations.
dialog: 101 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 101
dialog: The cat turns its head to a sound Blomkvist can't hear.
dialog: He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at
dialog: photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks
dialog: up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet
dialog: Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews:
speaker_heading: HARRIET V/O
dialog: Faith is the assurance of things
dialog: hoped for, the evidence of things not
dialog: seen. Through faith we understand
dialog: that the world was created by the
dialog: word of God - and that what is seen
dialog: was not made of things that are
dialog: visible ...
dialog: He sets it down. Rubs his eyes. Everything - his
dialog: daughter, his life, this cabin, the word of God - is
dialog: depressing.
scene_heading: 101A INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN 101A
dialog: Dawn light outside the living room window.
dialog: Bjurman, at his dining table with a glass of orange
dialog: juice, writing out a check.
dialog: In the bedroom, Salander slips on her leather jacket,
dialog: shoulders her backpack, hobbles out to the living room.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: I'll drive you home.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: I can get home on my own.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: It's bizarre: his manner seems to be one of genuine
dialog: concern. She nods. He hands her the check. Then opens
dialog: the door for her like a perfect gentleman.
dialog: BJURMAN
dialog: So, next Saturday, here?
dialog: 56.
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: She nods. Leaves. The door closes.
dialog: 102 EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAWN 102
dialog: A lone figure hobbles through the empty streets.
scene_heading: 103 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAWN 103
dialog: She sets a check down. On the memo line he's neatly
dialog: written, "for food." She takes a bottle of water from
dialog: the fridge and drinks.
scene_heading: 104 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAWN 104
dialog: Shower water hits the dragon tattoo on her shoulder
dialog: blade and runs down past several others. By the time the
dialog: water reaches the drain it has turned red.
dialog: 105 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY 105
dialog: Coming through trees with a bag of groceries, Blomkvist
dialog: sees a BMW parked outside his cottage.
scene_heading: 106 EXT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 106
dialog: Blomkvist taps on the car's fogged-up driver's window.
dialog: A hand inside wipes at it, revealing Erika. She lowers
dialog: it a crack.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Is it any warmer inside?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: No.
dialog: 107 INT. COTTAGE - DAY 107
dialog: As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going,
dialog: using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps
dialog: herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with
dialog: the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: What have I missed besides you?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: The steady exodus of two-thirds of
dialog: our advertisers.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Seriously?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Is that hard to believe? Sitting up
dialog: here in Lappland with your cat?
dialog: 57.
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm not. I'm working.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: I can see.
dialog: What she can see is the Vanger research covering the
dialog: walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the
dialog: family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Would you like to meet him?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Maybe in about an hour. If you're
dialog: interested.
dialog: He is.
dialog: 108 INT. VANGER MANOR - EVENING 108
dialog: Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat
dialog: with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: I apologize if you're having
dialog: financial problems at the magazine
dialog: in Mikael's absence.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: We'll work through them.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them
dialog: about this.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: How long do you think you can hang
dialog: on? Six months or so?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: That sounds about right.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: (cheerfully)
dialog: You know, I used to be in the
dialog: newspaper business. We owned six
dialog: dailies back in the 50's.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: We still own one. The Courier, here
dialog: in town.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: VANGER
dialog: I let my nephew Birger run it since
dialog: he can't run anything else.
dialog: Erika nods politely.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: So what do you say to taking on a
dialog: partner?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: We've never considered it before.
dialog: We value our independence.
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: Your independence is dependant on
dialog: advertisers - if we're being honest.
dialog: However much you think that is, you'd
dialog: retain. We don't care about content.
dialog: Blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a
dialog: party.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Excuse me. Did I miss something?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: We're talking about an investment in
dialog: the magazine.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I gather. Why would you want to do
dialog: that?
dialog: MARTIN
dialog: Not for the return, that's for sure.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: (to Erika)
dialog: I feel bad that I've take Mikael
dialog: away from you at the worst possible
dialog: time. This is the right thing to do.
dialog: The moral thing. That's one reason.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: And.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: The enemies of my friends are my
dialog: enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much
dialog: as you hate what he's done to you.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: So what do you say?
dialog: 59.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
dialog: Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Is that a maybe?
dialog: She nods.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Wonderful! More wine, Anna.
dialog: Blomkvist looks at Erika, but she glances away to Vanger.
dialog: VANGER
dialog: I think Mikael is adapting well to
dialog: rustic life, by the way.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Have you seen him try to make a fire?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: Put the logs on end, like this.
dialog: He makes a teepee shape with his hands, like praying.
dialog: 109 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT 109
dialog: Erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: How long have you been discussing
dialog: this with them?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: I haven't been. They asked me to
dialog: come up yesterday.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: Why would I. You live in the woods.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: So I deserve to be treated like an
dialog: idiot?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: I wanted to hear what they had to
dialog: say. You would've said no before
dialog: they could.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: I'm saying it now. It's not a good
dialog: idea.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: You heard me tell them we could
dialog: hang on for six months. I was lying.
dialog: Without their money we'll be out of
dialog: business in three.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: You don't know this family. They're
dialog: crazy.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: We're not marrying into it.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: We are if we do this. It's exactly
dialog: what we're doing.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: You want to say no? Let's say no.
dialog: Instead of 50 percent of something,
dialog: let's own 100 percent of nothing.
dialog: The logs crackle as flames climb them. She gets up,
text: comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears
dialog: into the bedroom. He stares at the fire.
dialog: ERIKA O/S
dialog: Mikael?
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: What.
dialog: ERIKA O/S
dialog: I'm leaving this God-forsaken island
dialog: in the morning.
dialog: BLOMKVIST
dialog: So?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: So are you coming to bed or not.
dialog: 110 INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY 110
dialog: Salander regards a selection of forearm tattoos: barbed
dialog: wire, Celtic bands, strings of leaves and flowers.
dialog: TATTOO ARTIST
dialog: You thinking one arm or both?
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: Wrists and ankles. But none of
dialog: these. Just a plain band, like
dialog: handcuffs.
dialog: 61.
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: TATTOO ARTIST
dialog: It's sensitive there. Particularly
dialog: the ankles. It's gonna hurt.
dialog: That doesn't bother her in the least. She rolls up her
dialog: sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun.
dialog: SALANDER
dialog: How much do one of those cost?
speaker_heading: TELEVISION IMAGE:
dialog: A bland financial announcer reading the news. The

dialog: 111 INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY 111
dialog: A news crew has crammed itself inside Erika's office,
dialog: where a reporter interviews her -
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: We made a serious mistake last year,
dialog: and we regret it. But we're moving
dialog: forward, and this is the first step.
dialog: REPORTER 2
dialog: You wouldn't say the first step was
dialog: your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist?
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: That's inaccurate. Read the original
dialog: press release, Viggo. I didn't fire
dialog: him. He's on sabbatical.
dialog: REPORTER 2
dialog: Where.
dialog: ERIKA
dialog: I'm not sure, to be honest with you.

dialog: He's at his desk, the cat in his lap, reviewing the
dialog: album of photos taken on the day Harriet disappeared.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: They're arranged chronologically, and Vanger has noted
dialog: the approximate time of day of each.
dialog: The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by
dialog: family members of each other. The next couple taken in
dialog: town of the parade. Then dozens taken on and around the
dialog: bridge of the dramatic accident. He hears the sound and
dialog: glances out to see a television news van driving toward
dialog: Vanger's manor -
dialog: 113 EXT. VANGER MANOR - DAY 113
dialog: A crew is set up in the yard by the water, interviewing
dialog: Henrik and Martin. Under his suit jacket Henrik wears a

dialog: MARTIN
dialog: Millennium is an excellent magazine.
dialog: We also think it's undervalued right
dialog: now, which is good business for us.
speaker_heading: REPORTER 3
dialog: Is any magazine really undervalued
dialog: today. How many will be around
dialog: tomorrow?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: There's another reason. I don't like
dialog: bullies.
speaker_heading: REPORTER 3
dialog: Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
dialog: VANGER
dialog: I'm referring to anyone who tries
dialog: to sue their enemies into submission.
dialog: If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try
dialog: it again, he'll find himself fighting
dialog: a company that can afford to fight
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: REPORTER 3
