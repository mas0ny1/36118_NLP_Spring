scene_heading: EXT ASBURY PARK BOARDWALK - DAY
text: Jersey spring day. Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier,
text: the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline.
text: An OLD MAN stares at the empty beach. Sun-worshipers hours away from
text: besmirching the dunes. His features are simple. He wears an old overcoat.
text: His face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more sunrises
text: than one would suspect. He inhales the crisp, salty air and lets a small,
text: satisfied smile cross his face.
text: Behind him. a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the
text: boardwalk. Three young boys skate around by on roller blades, passing a
text: street hockey ball between them proficiently. The Old Man views them
text: briefly. checks his watch, and looks back toward the ocean.
text: The skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt. We pan up to
text: their faces - now cold and dispassionate. They look at one another and nod.
text: Their skates glide out of frame.
text: P.O.V. SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach.
text: We get closer and closer to him until...
text: One of the skaters checks him hard into the railing. The Old Man exhales
text: violently and falls to his knees. The two other skaters begin savagely
text: beating on him with their hockey sticks, as he crumbles beneath them.
text: Repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head.
speaker_heading: OC VOICE
dialog: I don't understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on the
dialog: writings Lewis Caroll?
text: The three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Man's pulse.
text: Satisfied, they skate away, leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk.
scene_heading: INT AIRPORT - DAY
text: LOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal. They pass through the
text: metal detectors. The Nun carries a donation can.
speaker_heading: LOKI
text: Leaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely at 'Through the Looking
dialog: Glass' - particularly 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's the
dialog: metaphorical meaning?
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: I wasn't aware there was one.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Oh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organized
text: religion. The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously refers to
text: either the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant god,
dialog: Lord Ganesha. This takes care of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an
text: obvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of a
dialog: carpenter. He represents the Western religions. And in the poem. what do
dialog: they do? They dupe all the oysters into followmg them. Then. when the
text: oysters collective guard is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck and
text: devour the helpless creatures, en masse. I don't know what that says to
dialog: you, but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythological
text: figures insures the destruction of one's inner-being.
text: BARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eats
text: popcorn and stares at...
text: A steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting lovedones, family.
speaker_heading: OC LOKI
dialog: Organized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our
text: actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes
text: a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says "No, no!"
text: Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him,
text: kneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: 'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale? I think not.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: (really dazed)
dialog: I've... I've never really thought about it like that...

dialog: What have I been doing with my life...?'.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Don't look back. Just get out there and taste life.
dialog: (off donation can)
dialog: Leave this for the unenlightened. Poverty is for the gullible - it's
dialog: another way the church is trying to control you. You take that money you've
dialog: been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nice
dialog: piece of ass. You deserve it.
text: The Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something.
text: A passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Loki
text: faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the
text: still-transfixed Bartleby.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (looking OC)
dialog: Here's what I don't get about you: you know for a fact that there is a God.
dialog: You've been in his presence, he's talked to you personally. And yet I just
dialog: heard you claim to be an atheist.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: C'mon man - you know I don't believe any of that shit I was telling her. I
dialog: just like to fuck with the clergy; keep 'em on their toes. When her head
dialog: stops spinning, she'll be facing the way of the Just again. But oh. will
dialog: she have a bunch to confess.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Now here's what I don't get about you: why do you feel the need to come
dialog: here all the time?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (off travelers)
dialog: I like to watch. This is humanity at it's best. Look at them.

dialog: know that the girl cheated on him while he was away.
speaker_heading: OC LOKI
dialog: She did?
text: Bartleby and Loki continue to watch the arrivals.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
text: Uh-huh. Twice. But it doesn't matter at this moment because they're both so
dialog: relieved to be with one another. I like that. I just wish they could all
dialog: feel that way more offen.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Maybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would. Now
dialog: what was so friggin' important that I had to miss cartoons this morning? If
dialog: it was to share in your half-assed obsessions with Hallmark moments, I'm
dialog: going to slug you.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (still looking OC)
dialog: You're never going to believe this: we're going home.

dialog: (off Bartleby's popcorn)
dialog: Let me have some?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (pulls out envelope)
dialog: Look what somebody sent us in the mail.
dialog: (hands him a newspaper article and corn)
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Did you say we're going home?
dialog: (reads)
dialog: "Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon on 'Catholicism - Wow!"

dialog: (reads)
dialog: "Updating the church... television spots... Papal consent...
dialog: rededication...
dialog: (to Bartleby)
dialog: Again - and?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (snatches article) Give me this
dialog: (getting up; reading)
dialog: "The Re-dedication of Saint Michael's Church on it's hundredth anniversary
text: is the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic Church
text: back into the mainstream. With a papal sanction, the archway entrance to
text: the centuryold, Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway of
dialog: pleanry indulgence, which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all who
dialog: pass through it's arches a morally clean slate."
dialog: (looks at Loki)
dialog: You still don't get it, do you?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: No, I don't get it. Are we leaving now?
text: They start walking.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: If you walk through the church's front door on the day of the Re-dedication
dialog: ceremony, your soul is wiped clean of any and all existing sin, moreso than
dialog: the sacrament of penance could ever offer. It's a plenary indulgence, man!
dialog: I don't know why I never thought of this before.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (spits out chewed popcorn into trash can)
dialog: Sounds thin. Sounds like someone made it up.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: It's rarely employed, but it's legitimate. It has a papal sanction for
dialog: God's sake.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: So you're saying you and I can walk through this doorway and go back home?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: No - by passing through the doors, our sins are
dialog: forgiven. Then all we have to do is die...
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Wait. wait, wait - Die? I don't want to die.
dialog: (chews popcorn)
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (steps on conveyor belt)
dialog: You'd rather stay down here for a few more eons?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: No, but we don't even know if we can die. And what if we can, but this
dialog: archway thing doesn't pan out? What then? Hell? Fuck that.
dialog: (spits out chewed popcorn into napkin)
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Impossible. If we cut off our wings and transubstantiate to complete human
dialog: form then we become mortal. And if we die with clean souls, there's no way
dialog: to keep us out. They have to let us in.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Who sent this thing?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I don't know. Somebody who's looking out for us,
dialog: I guess. Does it matter? All that matters is that
dialog: after all these years, we've found a loophole. He
dialog: can't keep us out anymore. And once we're back
dialog: in, I'm sure He'll just forgive and forget.
text: They pass the Nun. who leans against a wall, still dazed.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Yeah, but this plenary' indulgence thing is a church law, not Divine
dialog: Mandate. Church laws are fallible because they're created by man.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: One of the last sacred promises imparted to Peter the first Pope by the Son
dialog: of God before He left was "Whatever you hold true on earth..."
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: " ...I'll hold true in Heaven."
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: So if the Pope says it's so, God must adhere. It's dogmatic law.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (beat; extends hand)
dialog: Let it never be said that your anal retentive attention to detail never
dialog: yielded positive results.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (accepts hand)
dialog: You can't be anal retentive if you don't have an anus.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: There's just one thing I think I should do before we leave - something
dialog: that'Il get us back on His good side.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: What's that?
text: Loki smiles and starts rifling through his pockets. He extracts a magazine
dialog: article.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: This is something I've been dreaming about for five years now. Read.
text: The crumpled article displays a Barney-like gold-hued cow, alongside
dialog: various profit charts and text.

text: "Mooby the Golden Calf- Creating an Empire Out of Simplicity."

speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Are you nuts?!
dialog: (crumples article)
dialog: We're mere days away from getting back, and you want to jeopardize it
dialog: because you have a soft spot for the good ol' days?!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What better way to show I've repented than by resuming the position I
dialog: denied... thanks to you.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: A killing spree is not going to make things better for us.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: We're not talking about killing here. We're talking about Divine Justice.
text: We're talking about punishing the wicked, raining down fire and brimstone.
dialog: He's all about that. I just know he'd want this done.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: There hasn't been an Angel of Death since you quit. Doesn't that mean
dialog: anything to you? Besides, what if you're wrong?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: If I'm wrong, it won't matter. Like you said - we pass through the arch and
dialog: we're forgiven anyway
text: They step up to an elevator and press the button.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (considering it)

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You know, I've done this three times now; and each time the counselor tells
dialog: me I should be more careful in the future, I should show' some
dialog: responsibility. Gotta tell you, though - this is the first time the
dialog: counselor wasn't some ugly as hell old bitch. It's kind of hard to take
dialog: abortion advice from a woman who's too gross to get laid in the first
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I'm not here to lecture you - I'm here to make sure you really want to go
dialog: through with this.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I'd rather go back to that night when my idiot bovfriend swore up and down

dialog: there?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Ever think about having it?

speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I never did.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You had an abortion?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (lights a smoke)
dialog: My first year in college. All through high school, I'd dated the same guy -
dialog: Walter Flanagan. We were really in love, right? So much so. that we decided
dialog: to go Carnegie Mellon together... that's this college in Pittsburgh. So
dialog: there we are -away at school, and there's suddenly no parents to worry
dialog: about anymore, so we're screwing like rabbits - just constanly doing it.
dialog: And I wound up getting pregnant. So he begs me to have it. He says we
dialog: should quit school and get married, and I'm telling him that that'lI screw
dialog: up our educations. We fought about it for a week - my arguement being there
dialog: was no rush to have kids, you know? We could always have a baby in a couple
dialog: of years - after school. So I got the abortion against his wishes... I
dialog: mean, what the hell - it was my body, right? After graduation, we got
dialog: married and immediately set about trying to have kids. We tried like hell
dialog: for the first six months, and... nothing. So I went to a gynocologist to
dialog: see if everything was okay on my end.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It wasn't.
dialog: (takes a drink)
dialog: My uteran wall had this fissure. It seems that the doctor who performed the
dialog: procedure on me years before had somehow botched it. I'd never be able to
dialog: have a child.
text: The Girl's face says it all. Bethany takes a drag and continues.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So there I am - devastated. And now I have to go home to break the news to
dialog: my husband who years before had begged me to have the baby - his baby. And
text: after I explain it to him through my tears, he sits on the couch and rubs
dialog: his eyes. And in the calmest, most rational voice I've ever heard anybody
dialog: use in my life, he asks me for a divorce. And I fought him, you know? I
dialog: tried to talk him out of it; told him there were alternatives - like we
dialog: could adopt. And all he said was he wanted a wife who could have his
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: He remarried. He had two kids in two years with his new wife. We never
dialog: spoke again. And now I do this.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: That's like... such a sad story.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I dated this guy a year or two ago - he was really into comic books. He
dialog: told me I had the stock superhero story -I wanted to prevent a wrong that
dialog: had happened to me from ever happening to anyone else. Kind of like Batman,
dialog: he said. The only difference is I don't put on tights to do it... unless
dialog: all my other clothes are in the wash.

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I don't think they'd accept that one - we already used it as our excuse for
dialog: killing Christ. So where were you yesterday morning - a bunch of us went
dialog: out for brunch?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I went to church.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: That kills me. You and church. We work in a field that specializes in

speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I sit there every Sunday and I feel nothing. I can remember sitting in

dialog: like I was important. And the stories of all these holy people were so
dialog: inspiring. Now I sit there and think about my checking, and what I'm going

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: So then why do you still go?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: That's just it - I don't. I don't think I have any faith left.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (making coffee)
dialog: I had a girl in here once - 'bout fifteen. She told me that faith is like a
dialog: glass of water. When you're young, the glass is full, and it's easy to fill
dialog: up. But the older you get, the bigger the glass gets, and the same amount
text: of water doesn't fill the glass anymore. Periodically, the glass has to be
text: refilled.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: A fifteen year old who came in here said that?
speaker_heading: LIZ
text: She had gotten knocked up by her pastor.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Jesus! See? A minister knocks up a teenager -isn't anyone afraid of the
dialog: Lord's wrath anymore?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: That would require faith, and that commodity lately seems reserved only for
text: the psychotic zealots that hang around outside.

dialog: So what are you doing tonight?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Watching T.V.
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Uh-oh - that sounds militant. You thinking of joining the other side?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Couldn't do it. Women are insane.

dialog: Wh..what are you?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: I'm pissed is what I am. You go around drenching everyone that comes into
dialog: your room with flameretardent chemicals? No wonder you don't get laid.
dialog: (pulls pants back on)
dialog: Go get me a towel, will you?
text: Bethany blinks. She exits the room and comes back with a towel. She holds
text: it out to Metatron who grabs it and starts toweling off.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: (taking off jacket)
dialog: Stand back.
text: Bethany steps back. Metatron flexes and huge fucking wings extend from it's
text: back, dripping water. Bethany goes wide-eyed and cowers against the wall.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: (tosses towel away)
dialog: Like I was saying - I am the Metatron.
text: Bethany stares, saying nothing, pinned against the wall. Metatron looks
dialog: insulted.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Metatron. Don't tell me the name doesn't ring a bell?
text: Bethany remains silent and wideyed. Metatron gets testy.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: You people. If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing, right?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I am a seraphim.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The highest choir of angels?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You do know what an angel is, don't you?
text: Bethany slowly nods.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Metatron acts as the voice of God. Any documented occasion when some yahoo
dialog: claims to have spoken with God, they're speaking to me. Or they're speaking
dialog: to themselves.
speaker_heading: BET HANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why doesn't God speak for himself?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Ah. So glad you decided to join the conversation. To answer that - human
dialog: beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand
dialog: the awesome
dialog: power of God's true voice. Were you to hear it, you're mind would cave in
dialog: and your heart would explode within your chest. We went through five Adam's
dialog: before we figured that out.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Are you going to kill me?
speaker_heading: Ni ETATRON
dialog: I could for what you did to this suit. Unfortunately I can't. You're
dialog: called.
speaker_heading: BETH ANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Called how? How called?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: All that from two words. Color this angel impressed.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How do I know you're an angel?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Oh, you mean besides the fiery entrance and the expansive wingspan? You
dialog: people kill me. Fine. You want more proof? How about a tequila?
dialog: (snaps fingers)
scene_heading: INT MEXICAN BAR - NIGHT
text: Bethany and Metatron sit at a table. Bethany immediately clutches at her
text: pajamas. Metatron waves a WAITER over.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Where the hell are we?!
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: The only place one can go for good tequila.
dialog: (to Waiter)
dialog: Dos tequilas, por favor. And an empty glass.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Si.
text: The Waiter turns to leave. Metatron yanks a smoke from his pocket as he
dialog: goes.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Gracias, senor.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: We're in Mexico?!
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Actually, we're in the Chilli's down the street from your house, but it was
dialog: still an impressive trick
dialog: (lights smoke)
dialog: You don't mind that I lost the wings, do you? I'm trying to keep our
dialog: profile low.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I suppose it would be too cliche to observe aloud that this is the weirdest
dialog: dream I've ever had.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Can you imagine how insulting it is to converse with a person and have them
dialog: insist you're a dream? If I had an ego, it'd be bruised.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What do you want with me?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: I'm to charge you with a holy crusade.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You do know what a crusade is, don't you?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Uh, yeah.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Don't give me that. Last time I charged someone with a crusade they had to
dialog: look the word up.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Why am I supposed to go on a crusade?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Your's is a heritage divine. Also, you didn't seem to be doing much lately.
text: The Waiter arrives with their drinks.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Oh - Gracias!
dialog: (he leaves; off the tequila)
dialog: One of the only things your people have mastered since you crawled from the
text: primordial ooze.
dialog: (sips)
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I work in an abortion clinic.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: (spits tequila into empty glass)
dialog: Moses was a drunk. Look what he accomplished. And no one's even asking you
dialog: to part an ocean. All you have to do is go to New Jersey.
speaker_heading: BETH ANY
dialog: New ]ersey.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Sure. Go to New Jersey and visit and small church on a very important day.
dialog: Agreed?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: That doesn't sound like a crusade.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Aside from the fine print, that's it.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What's the fine print?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: (mumbles into glass)
dialog: stopacoupleofangelsfromenteringandthusnegatingallexistence.
dialog: Damn, this is good tequila.
dialog: (sips)
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Wait, wait, wait. Repeat that.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Damn, this is good tequila?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: The first part.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: (spits into empty glass)
text: Details. Stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all
dialog: existence. God, I hate when people need it spelled out for them.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Clarify that.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: That's the problem with you people - you need every-thing clarified. No
dialog: leaps of faith whatsoever. Alright -vou want the whole secret origin? Here
dialog: goes: Back in the old days, God was vengeful and hot-tempered, and his
text: wrath was bore by the Angel of Death - name of Loki. When Sodom and
dialog: Gommorah were destroyed? That was Loki. When the waters wiped out
dialog: everything with the exception of Noah and his menagerie? That was Loki. And
dialog: he was good at what he did. But one day, he refused to bear God's wrath any
dialog: longer.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: METATRON
text: Because he listened to his friend - a Grigori by the name of Bartleby.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Grigori?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: One of the choirs of angels. They're called Watchers. Guess what they do?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So they're like Guardian angels?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Exactly like that, but different. So one day, Loki's wiping out all the
dialog: first born of Egypt...
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: The Tenth Plague.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: See? Tell a person you're the Metatron and they stare at you blankiy;
text: mention something out of a Charlton Heston movie and they're suddenly
dialog: theology scholars. May I continue uninterrupted?
dialog: (Bethany nods)
text: So once he's done with the first born, Loki takes his friend Bartleby out
dialog: for a post-slaughter drink. And over many rounds, they get into this
dialog: discussion about whether or not murder in the name of God is okay. Now,
dialog: Bartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually, not to mention the
text: fact that Loki's more than half in the bag, and in the end, Bartleby
text: convinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser one - one that
text: doesn't involve slaughter. So - very inebriated - Loki tells God he quits:
text: throws down his fiery sword, gives him the finger - which ruins it for the
dialog: rest of us. because from that day forward, God decreed that angels could no
dialog: longer imbibe alcohol. Hence all the spitting.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Sounds reasonable.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Maybe to you, but I'm a lush by nature.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I mean about the angel of Death's resignation.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: For a liberal, yes, but this is the Angel of Death we're talking about. The
dialog: Angel of Death can't be a conscientious objector. The Angel of Death is
dialog: charged with meting out whatever justice God demands. So for their
dialog: insolence, God decreed that neither Loki nor Bartleby would ever be allowed
text: back into Paradise.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Were they sent to Hell?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Worse. Wisconsin. For the entire span of human history. And when the world
text: ends, they'll sit outside the gates for eternity.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: And what's this have to do with me?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Somebody's clued them in to a loophole in Catholic dogma that would allow
dialog: them to reenter Heaven.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So what? They beat the system. Good for them.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: It's not that simple. If they get in, they will have reversed God's decree.
dialog: Now listen up because this part is very important: existence in all it's
dialog: form and splendor functions solely on one principle: God is infallible. To
dialog: prove God wrong would undo reality and everything that is. Up would become
dialog: down, black would become white, existence would become nothingness. In
dialog: essence - if they are allowed to enter that church, they'll unmake the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Are these guys that bitter?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: No, that's the stupid part: they have no idea what their actions will
dialog: result in. As far as they know, they're just going home. Isn't that sweet?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: If this is so major, why are you talking to me? Why doesn't God do
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: He could. He could blink them out of existence, destroy that church, turn
dialog: them into plants. But He'd rather see you take care of this one personally.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Because of who you are.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: And who am I?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: The girl in the p.j.'s. Don't ask so many questions just serve your
dialog: purpose.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I'll pass.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: When some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus -where was God? When
dialog: my
dialog: husband decided he couldn't be with a wife that couldn't bear his children
dialog: - where was
dialog: God? Now all the sudden, after all these years of quiet noninvolvement in
dialog: my life, He
dialog: sends one of His lackey's my way who tells me I should save the world, and
dialog: as what -
dialog: some sort of test? To Hell with Him.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Do yourself a favor Bethany - do the world a favor: let go of your petty
dialog: crap. It's served you precious little in the past, and it serves you even
dialog: less now when the fate of existence
dialog: hangs in the balance. Don't allow eons of history and life to get blinked
dialog: out of being just because you have a grudge against your creator.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: A grudge? Do you know why I work in that clinic? It's my own private way of
dialog: saying
dialog: "fuck you" to God.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: And any other day I'd say that's your business and your life, and enjoy
dialog: yourself and goodnight. But this isn't about you - this is about eve~body.
dialog: So you lost the abiliry to make life. You're being offered the chance to
dialog: play mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it - saving it.
text: (swigs her drink and spits it out)
dialog: But I can't make you. You'll do what you will. However, if you should
dialog: decide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility, you won't be
dialog: alone. You'll have support.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What, more angels?
speaker_heading: NIETATRON
dialog: Prophets - although they don't quite get it yet. You'll know them right
text: away - one speaks, the other listens. The one who speaks - and he will at
dialog: great lengths, whether you want him to or not - will make mention of
dialog: himself as a prophet. The other one won't say anything, but he'll be
dialog: helpful
dialog: just the same.
dialog: (looks at watch)
dialog: I have to go. You'll do what you will, but try to remember that we're
dialog: working in a time frame here.
text: Metatron moves to exit.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey.
dialog: (Metatron turns)
dialog: You work for God.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: They tell me it's God. If it's not, I'm going to be severely pissed - what
dialog: with all these years of bossing people around on his behalf and
text: expectorating perfectly good tequila.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What's he like? God?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Lonely. But funny. He's got a great sense of humor.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I'll bet.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Look at sex. Sex is funny. One time I asked him why you people had to look
dialog: so stupid while procreating. He said if you didn't, you'd do it all the
dialog: time, just for fun.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: But we do.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: I know. And you all look so damn stupid doing it. It kills us upstairs.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Sex is a joke in Heaven?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: The way I understand it, it's mostly a joke down here too.
text: And with that, Nietatron is gone. Bethany looks at her drink. A three-man
text: mariachi band surround her and begin playing Prince's 'Little Red
dialog: Corvette'.
scene_heading: INT BETHANY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Bethany startles awake. The radio on her night-table plays 'Little Red
text: Corvette'. She lays back down.
scene_heading: INT BETHANY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Bethany sits at her desk, staring into space. A twenty-something girl
text: speaks, butBethany's not really listening. She's extremely preoccupied.
scene_heading: INT CLINIC - NIGHT
text: Bethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms. She packs up her bag and
text: turns on the alarm.
scene_heading: EXT CLINIC - NIGHT
text: Bethany exits and locks the door behind her. She starts walking.
text: As her feet tread lightly toward her car, three small shadows move toward
dialog: her.
text: Bethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse for
text: her keys. She hears something and stops. Roller blades can be heard moving
text: slowly across the asphalt of the parking lot. Bethany turns quickly.
text: Nobody's there. She looks around, a bit peturbed.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (calling into the darkness)
dialog: God, what time do you people quit and go home?! Let's just save it for
dialog: tomorrow, alright?
text: There's no response. Then there's the noise of wood being tapped against
text: the ground. Bethany peers into the darkness, looking for the source.
text: Suddenly, a skater whips past her, slamming his stick into the back of her
text: knee. Bethany goes down. Another skater whips in and slashes at her, but
text: she ducks. The stick hits the car door above her. She rifles through her
text: purse madly until another skater whips by, dragging her purse away with his
text: stick. Bethany looks up.
text: The Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly, a few feet from her. They tap
text: their hockey sticks in unison on the ground. Bethany jumps up and faces
text: them defensively. The Triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at her.
text: And from out of nowhere, a large figure swoops down from above, landing on
text: the ground between Bethany and her menacers. The Triplets stop short and
text: regard the figure curiously. The large figure whips into a defensive
dialog: stance, Batman-style.
text: The Stygian Triplets look to one another. They shrug and charge anew.
text: From behind the rock-still large figure, a smaller figure leaps into the
text: streetlight, shrieking, flying through the air, busting into a flying kick.
text: He lands before the middle Triplet and open-palm punches him twice in the
text: face, grabbing his stick from the falling child's hand and tossing it into
text: the air behind him.
text: The stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of the
text: large figure, who twirls it under his arm, and then back Out like a sai. He
text: swings it out before him, knocking the other two Triplets off balance. The
text: smaller figure back flips into the larger figure's arms and kicks his feet
text: into the faces of the two wobbling Triplets. They go down, and the smaller
text: figure leaps forward with a shriek, landing between the fallen pair, elbows
dialog: into their backs.
text: The flrst struck Triplet leaps out of the darkness at the large figure,
text: screaming something unholy. The large figure catches the kid by the throat
dialog: and quickly
text: head butts him, tossing him to the side. The large figure sways for a beat
text: and then shakes it off.
text: The small figure collects the hockey sticks and throws them into the
text: distance. He kicks at the falien Triplets as they scurry away.
speaker_heading: SMALL FIGURE
dialog: (calling after them)
dialog: GO BACK TO YOUR PAPER ROUTES, YOU PUNK FUCKS!
dialog: (more to himself)
dialog: Snoogans.
text: The large figure saddles up beside the small figure. They look at one
text: another and shake hands.
speaker_heading: SMALL FIGURE
dialog: Dude, I know they were just kids, but we kicked their fucking asses!
text: Bethany stares, mystified. She grabs her purse from the ground.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Where... where did you learn to do... that stuff?!
speaker_heading: SMALL FIGURE
dialog: From this comic book some guys made about us. Long story.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't know what to say... or think.
text: The figures turn into the light, revealing the faces of the heroes for the
text: first time - two very familiar faces.
speaker_heading: SMALL FIGURE
dialog: Say you'll offer us sex as a reward.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Who are you?
text: The large figure lights up a smoke. The small one extends his hand.
speaker_heading: SMALL FIGURE
dialog: Jay. And this is my business associate, Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: BIETHANY
dialog: Well thank you for being out here so late... Come to think of it, what are
dialog: you doing out here so late?
dialog: (freezes)
dialog: Wait a second are you protestors?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What's a protestor?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You're not with the Fight-to-Lifer's?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You mean those fucks with the signs and pictures of dead babies? Shit no.
dialog: Me and Silent Bob are pro-choice:a woman 5 body is her own fucking

speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Then - I don't mean to sound ungrateful - but what are you doing hanging
dialog: around?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: We're here to pick up chicks.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (a bit stunned)
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: We figure an abortion clinic is a good place to meet loose women. Why else
dialog: would they be there unless they like to fuck.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Oh. Right. Well, I should be going. Thanks for the rescue... I think.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Wait, wait, wait - we just saved your ass, and you're just going to take
dialog: off? What the shit is that?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I had a weird night last night, and now tonight's not shaping up to be any
dialog: better. I think I should go home, take some percosets, and lay down.
dialog: (opens her car door)
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: How about that shit? Fuck this town, man - I'm going back to Jersey and
dialog: selling weed~
dialog: (they start walking)
dialog: At least there I can get turned down while trying to make myself a profit.
text: Bethany freezes. Metatron's words echo in her ear. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: You've gotta be kidding me.
dialog: (thinks for a beat; then) Hey! Wait!
text: She runs up to them. They whip around and raise their fists defensively.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Would you... I can't believe I'm doing this...
dialog: (inhales deeply)
dialog: Would you... like to have a drink with me?

dialog: It's a lot more compact than the flaming sword, I'll say that much.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: It's the weapon of choice these days.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It seems unimpressive. At least the sword looked intimidating. How can I
dialog: strike fear into the hearts of the wicked with this?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Oh, I get it. You want to become a vigilante, right? Like Batman or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Batman never uses guns.
dialog: (off gun)
dialog: I don't know. It feels impersonal.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Then don't use a gun. Just lay the place to waste like Sodom and Gommorah.
dialog: Now that was something.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Oh yeah, for you maybe. You got to stand there and read. I had to do all
dialog: the work.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: What work? You lit a few fires.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I rained down sulfur, man. There's a subtle difference.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Are you kidding me? Any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire.
dialog: Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance. Mass genocide is the

dialog: (to Salesman)
dialog: I'll take this one.

speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You're a man of principle. Where do you come from?

dialog: We used to live in a small town in Jersey. Real small town. We practically
dialog: knew everybody.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What brought you to McHenry?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Hollywood.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hollywood?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Oh yeah. See, we used to sell smoke in front of this video store. And one
dialog: day this fuck wants to rent a video. So we did, only we didn't have
dialog: anyplace to watch it. So we went to the mall and popped it into a VCR at
text: Macy's and sat on the floor and watched it. It was called 'Sixteen
dialog: Candles'. Did you ever see it?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: So the next day we rented 'The Breakfast Club', and then 'Weird Science'
dialog: where these two fucks have a chick that'll do anything for them and they
dialog: don't do nothing because it's a PG movie. But then we got thrown out of
dialog: Macy's when we watched 'Pretty in Pink', because of this bitch.
dialog: (points to Silent Bob)
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: What'd you do?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You know how at the end the red-headed bitch gets together with her dream
dialog: guy at the prom?
dialog: (Bethany nods)
dialog: Well pussy here starts fuckin' sobbing all sorts of loud and shit. And the
dialog: manager's like "Get the hell out of here!" And I'm like "Fuck you, you bald
dialog: cocksucker! I'll kick your lard..
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (speeding him along)
dialog: So what exactly brought you to Illinois?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Oh yeah. See, all these movies take place in a town called Shermer, in
dialog: Illinois. And there's all this fine bush running around, and we could kick
dialog: all the dude's asses because they're all whiney pussies. Except Judd Nelson
dialog: - he was harsh. But best of all, there was no one selling weed. So I says
dialog: to Silent Bob "Man, we could live phat if we were the blunt-connection in
dialog: Shermer, Illinois!" So we collected some cash we were owed, and caught a
dialog: bus. But when we got here,
dialog: you know what we found Out? There is no Shermer in Illinois. What kind of
dialog: shit is that?! Fucking movies are bullshit!
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: And now you live here?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Fuck that. This berg sucks. Everyone talks with a stupid accent so you
dialog: don't know what they're saying, and it's too fuckin' cold. We were talking
dialog: about taking off. Until we met you, that is.
dialog: (kisses her hand)
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (retracts her hand)
dialog: Right. So how much longer are you staying here?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Until you're ready to skip out and make with the sex.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: No. How long are you staying in McHenry?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: We're leaving tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Where are you going next?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Jesus - this broad asks alot of questions.

dialog: No, I want to go with you to New Jersey.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Really? You're the only chick I ever met that wanted to go to Jersey. Most
text: chicks try to get out.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: When can we leave?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Wait a second! What is this shit? Are we going fuck or not?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You're going to lead me somewhere.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Me lead you? Lady, I don't even know where I am half the time. If we're not
dialog: going to fuck then what the hell did you ask me out for?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Someone told me I'd meet you, and you'd take me somewhere I was supposed to
dialog: go. I didn't believe it until you said that thing in the parking lot.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What the hell are you babbling about? All I know is we saved your ass from
dialog: some angry fucking dwarfs and you promised us se~..
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Didn't this crazy bitch promise us sex?
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: ...and now you're telling me that I'm supposed to take you somewhere, and
dialog: you don't even know where it is?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you believe in God?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Holy shit - you're a Jehovah's Witness! All the fine chicks that come out
dialog: of that place, and we gotta get the one Jesus freak!
dialog: (to Silent Bob, getting up)
dialog: Let's go...
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (grabbing his sleeve)
dialog: No. wait...
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (pulling back)
dialog: I'll scream rape.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I can pay you.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (quickly sitting back down)
dialog: Pay?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: For being my guide. You were going to leave anyway; all I'm asking is to
dialog: tag along and see where it leads. I'll pay a hundred bucks and all
dialog: expenses.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (thinks; to Silent Bob)
dialog: I feel like I'm Han Solo, and you're Chewie, and she's Ben Kenobi, and
dialog: we're in that fucked up bar.
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: What about sex?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: No sex.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Alright, but let's say we're caught in a situation where we've got like
dialog: five minutes to live, like a bomb or something is gonna go off - would you
dialog: fuck us then?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: In that highly unlikely situation?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Yeah? You slut. Noonch.
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: What do you think?
text: Silent Bob shrugs. Jay stands up.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Alright. But I'll drive.
scene_heading: EXT MAIN HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Bethany's car roars overhead, speeding down the road, reving awfully
dialog: loudly.
scene_heading: INT BETHANY'S CAR - NIGHT
text: The speedometer reads ninety five.
text: Jay drives, eyes glued to the road. happy as hell. Silent Bob smokes to his
text: right. Bethany sits pinned against the back seat, wearing an uncomfortable
text: and dubious look. She struggles to lean forward. The engine still races.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (yelling over engine noise)
dialog: What gear are you in?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (not looking back)
dialog: Gear?
scene_heading: EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Jay, Silent Bob, and Bethany sit on and against the car. The hood is open
text: and smoke billows out.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Well what do I know from shifting?! Like I ever drove before!
text: Silent Bob shrugs and smokes. Bethany walks away, shaking her head.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Chicks.
text: Silent Bob nods and extracts a tool from his jacket. He begins working on
text: the engine as a cross~ountry bus races by.
scene_heading: INT BUS - NIGHT
text: Bartleby and Loki sit in the back. Bartleby reads a map and Loki stares at
text: the gun in his lap. A COUPLE makes out in the seat in front of them.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: We have to pass through three more states to get to New Jersey: Indianna,
dialog: Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: With a very important stop in Cleveland.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Oh right. The Angel of Death Returns. Sounds like a bad movie.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Movies are bullshit. And don't start with me, airight. The last time you
dialog: bugged me about my job, you got us sentenced to life in Wisconsin.
dialog: (looks out window)
dialog: All this time we've been down here, why didn't we ever leave the Cheese?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: He said to stay where he put us. We feared worse punishment if we disobeyed
dialog: Him again.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Where were we afraid He'd send us?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: New Jersey.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Now that, my friend. is irony.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, maybe you're wrong about this slaughter. How can you even be sure
dialog: of what incurs the Lord's wrath these days? Times change. Remember when
dialog: eating meat on Friday was supposed to be a Hellworthy tresspass? Or when
dialog: people weren't even supposed to shop on Sundays?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: That stuff was small potatoes. The major sins never change. And believe me
dialog: - I can spot a commandment breaker a mile away.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You don't believe me?
text: (looks around; eyes fall on kissing couple)
dialog: There. There's one.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (off couple)
dialog: So what? They're kissing.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Adultery.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: That's a stretch. How do you know they're not dating?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You'd know better than me - let's hear it.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Oh, I know the truth. But let's see how boned up on the job you really are.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: A test?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Of sorts. So what's your proof?
speaker_heading: LOKI
text: He's wearing a wedding band.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: So? Maybe that's his wife.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: No married man kisses his wife like that. You get married and the passion
dialog: dies, man. Don't you ever watch talk shows?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: LOKI
text: A guy makes his best plays when wooing. When the object of his desire is
text: won, there's no need to expend the effort anymore. He relaxes, satisfied
text: with the spoils of victory, which he then decides isn't so victorious
text: because he's saddled with a life-mate.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Very romantic sentiment.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: That's the problem - romance. You think about it :back in the old days,
dialog: nobody got married out of quote, unquote, love. People married for
dialog: property', dowries, or to procreate - to immortalize oneself through
dialog: offspring. When did all this love stuff start? What the hell happened to
dialog: the status quo?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: The Troubadors.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Lionel Richie's old group?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: No, that's the Commodores. The Troubadors were wandering minstrels and
text: dramatists that sang melodramatic and sappy songs of undying love.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Sounds like the Commodores.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: The Troubadors made 'love' fashionable. And their influence altered the
dialog: balance in a significant fashion. Until them, people got married because
dialog: they had to. After them, people started 'falling in love'. Romantic
dialog: courtships became the norm. What started out as simple entertainment made
dialog: such a dramatic impact as to forever alter the way society operates.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: That's human beings for you - easily misled. From the Garden of Eden to the
dialog: 'Thigh Master' - thev believe what they're told. I'm telling you - one day
dialog: they're all going to watch one too many John Hughes flicks and start
dialog: looking for Shermer, Illinois.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Be fair. Humans are dumb, but not that dumb.
dialog: (off couple)
dialog: So is it adultery or not?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (thinks; to couple)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: The Couple stops kissing. The MAN looks at Loki.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Are you married?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Just curious.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (holds up ring finger)
dialog: What do you think?
text: The Man shakes his head and goes back to kissing. Bartleby offers Loki a
text: "Satisfled?' expression. Loki taps the Man on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (breaks kiss; pissed)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: To her?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Are you married to her?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Not that it's any of your fucking business, but no! Why?!
text: Loki looks at Bartleby. Bartleby rolls his eyes. Loki calmly shoots the man
text: in the head. Screaming ensues.
scene_heading: EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: The bus skids to a halt. People flock off in a panic. scattering. After a
text: beat, Bartleby and Loki deboard and stand there alone.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY

speaker_heading: JAY

dialog: maybe you, but definitely not me.

dialog: Let me know how she is.
speaker_heading: BETHANY

dialog: Nobody is fucking me! You got that?!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: At least not in this car.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I'm sorry I dragged you to that diner. I don't know what I was thinking.
dialog: But being that I've decided to go home and not to New Jersey, this is where
dialog: you two get off.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You're breaking up with us?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Good luck with finding Molly Ringwald, or whoever it is vou're looking for.
dialog: Sorry for the inconvenience. Good bye.
text: Bethany starts walking away. Jay stares at her, shocked.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: Who the hell do you think you are, lady? You can't go around breaking
dialog: people's hearts like that! We fell in love with you! Guys like us don't
dialog: just fall out of the sky, you know!
text: On cue, a naked black MAN falls from the sky. landing between the two
text: parties. Bethany and Jay stare at him. The Man is face down, sooty, and
text: ashen - as if he's just been in a fire. Bethany drops to her knees and
text: rolls him over, feeling for a pulse. Jay looks down, then looks skyward as
text: Silent Bob joins him.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (yelling up)
dialog: A beautiful, naked woman doesn't just fall from the sky, you know?!
dialog: (beat; to Silent Bob)
dialog: Was worth a try.
text: Silent Bob nods. Bethany presses her ear to the man's chest.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: No heartbeat.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Do you think he fell from a plane? Like 'Alive'? Did you ever see that
dialog: flick?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (starts CPR'ing him)
dialog: I think there would have been more of a mess if he fell from that high.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Not necessarily.
text: Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob leap back. The man sits up and rubs his face.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: KILL IT!! KILL IT!!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: That sounds familiar.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Jesus, are you okay?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Rufus. And yes, I'm fine.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: He's the fuckin' undead!! Cut his head off!!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (getting up with Bethany's help)
dialog: What happened to your car? You clock ninety in first gear or something?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Mind your own fucking business!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (to Jay)
dialog: Listen, goldie-locks, what I just did was not easy and it ga\e me a fucking
dialog: migraine. Now if you don't pipe down, I'm going to rip your balls off.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (hiding behind Silent Bob)
dialog: I knew it! Mother fucker wants to eat my brain!
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I think he was aiming a bit further south.
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: Speaking of which, you're awfully nude - Rufus, is it?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Rufus it is, Miss.
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Hey, tubby... how's about lending a brother your coat 'till I can find my
dialog: own threads?
text: Jay looks at Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Dude, he fell out of thin air!
text: Silent Bob shrugs and passes his coat to Rufus. Jay bugs.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Dude, his dick is gonna be rubbing all over the inside of your armor!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: I'll do my best to tuck it back, brother.
text: Silent Bob nods. Something OC catches his eye. He stares OC and exits.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Where exactly did you fall from?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Some might say grace.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Dude, he's talking about your mom.
text: Jay turns to see that Silent Bob isn't there.
text: Silent Bob peers at a large bush at the road side. The bush rustles
dialog: slightly.
speaker_heading: OC BETHANY
dialog: You know, normally I'd have a hard time with this, but somehow you falling
dialog: out of the sky seems to go hand in glove with some of the other stuff I've
dialog: been deaiing with.
speaker_heading: OC RUFUS
dialog: Believe me - you ain't seen nothing yet.
text: Silent Bob peers closer at the bush. Suddenly - a Stygian Triplet leaps out
text: at him, pinning him to the ground with his hockey stick.
text: The other two Triplets leap on top of Jay and BETHANY
text: Rufus grabs the one off Bethany and hurls him to the side.
text: Jay manages to reach into his jacket and pull out a copy of Penthouse. He
text: rolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it.
text: Silent Bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it up
text: hard, into the Triplet's forhead, knocking him off. He rushes to Jay's side
text: and plies the other Triplet from his throat, hurling him OC.
text: The Triplet Silent Bob fought 'punctures' the air with his stick and rips
text: downward, creating a 'hole'. He grabs his friend and leaps into it,
dialog: disappearing.
text: Jay and Silent Bob look at eachother, blink, and embrace passionately.
text: The Triplet that Rufus threw rushes Rufus from behind - hockey stick in
text: lancing position. Without looking back, Rufus reaches behind himself,
text: grabbing the stick and swinging it (and the Triplet) over his head in an
text: arch, letting go. The last Triplet goes sailing through the 'hole', and it
text: seals shut.
text: Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob are in various wide-eyed states of shock.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Alright - what's with you, lady?! That's the second time you got attacked
dialog: by the fucking Mighty Ducks!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (wiping off hands)
dialog: Man, they're onto you bad, already. I got here just in time.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: How can you be so composed? We were almost killed.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
text: Death is a worry of the living. The dead only worry about decay and
dialog: necrophiliacs.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: See! I told you he was the undead!
speaker_heading: RU FUS
dialog: Not the undead, the dead. I died. Christ told me the secret to resurrection
dialog: once when we were at a wedding in Canna, but I got drunk and forgot it.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Wait. wait, wait - Christ? You knew Christ?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Knew him? I saw him naked.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Let me guess - you're another angel?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: No, I'm a man - just like you and him.
dialog: (looks at Jay)
dialog: Well, maybe not like him. At least I was a man. Been dead for nearly two
dialog: thousand years. Here.
text: (pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear)
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: No wonder he saw Jesus - homey's rockin' the ganj.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (unrollingit)
dialog: It's not a joint.
dialog: (looks at it)
dialog: I can't read this.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: It's Sanskiit. It says "Rufus - see you in two years. Jesus." Freaked me
dialog: out because he basically told me when my number was up. Took the flavor out
dialog: of the remaining years. Look, we gotta keep moving. If we stay in one place
dialog: long enough, those things are liable to come back. What say we continue
dialog: this discussion over something to eat?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: WAIT A SECOND!
dialog: (inhales deeply)
dialog: I'm a rational woman, okay. All I want to know is where you, and those...
dialog: kids came from?!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: They came from Hell. I came from Heaven.
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: Let's start walking.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Walk? Do you know how far we are from anywhere?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Back in the old days with J.C., we walked everywhere. Did you ever hear of
dialog: a fat apostle?
dialog: (exits)
text: Bethany looks to Jay and Silent Bob for some guidance or stability.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What's an apostle?
text: Bethany shakes her head and exits. Jay and Silent Bob shrug at each other.
scene_heading: EXT MOOBY CORP. BUILDING - DAWN
text: A large office building in downtown Cleveland. The city. hasn't started up
text: yet. A pickup truck pulls curbside in front of the structure. Bartleby and
text: Loki jump out of the back and pat the side of the truck. offering waved
text: thank-you's to the driver. As the truck pulls away, Loki pulls out the
text: article and looks at it. He looks up at the building and nods to Bartleby,
text: smiling. They head toward the front doors.
scene_heading: INT QUAlNT SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAWN
text: A ringing phone is answered by the unseen figure in the chair. We move from
text: the seated Figure, passing by the dead bodies of the home's original
text: owners, and come to a stop on the bruised and worn Stygian Triplets seated
text: on a couch. They look scared.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Hello?... No, they're not in right now... I'm the phone guy... I'll leave
dialog: them a message... Bye.
text: The Figure hangs up the phone and rises.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: You say the girl has already met the prophets?
text: The Stygian Triplets nod.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
text: She grows closer to learning her true identity. If that happens, our plan
dialog: is jeopardized. I can't afford to go into the field - that might compromise
dialog: us further. The best course of action is to insure that our parcel is not
dialog: found. And being that I can't even trust you enough to kill a girl, I'm
dialog: left with no choice but to seek outside assistance in guarding our package.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I'm going to have to summon the Golgothan.
text: The Figure exits. The Stygian Triplets register shock.
scene_heading: EXT FAST FOOD JOINT - DAWN
text: Rufus - now wearing some funky new clothes - carries a tray of fast food to
text: an outdoor table. Sitting already are Bethany, Jay, and Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (off new clothes)
dialog: It's amazing the shit people throw out. Didn't I tell you I'd find some
dialog: threads?
text: A car full of teens whip past them.
speaker_heading: TEEN
dialog: (yelling from passing car)
speaker_heading: GARBAGE PICKER!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (waves to them)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (to group)
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: It means they saw you pull that shit out of that dumpster.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: So it's a good thing, then.
dialog: (handing coat back to Silent Bob)
dialog: I appreciate the loan, brother. You can have this back.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Lucky you.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (off food)
dialog: Damn, I remember when all we used to have for breakfast was fish and goat's
dialog: milk. What do you call this shit?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: Egg McMuffin. Now how about you start explaining some things to me.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Like - for starters - who the hell are those kids that keep attacking me?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Nasty little bastards called the Stygian Triplets. They're not really
text: related. When they were alive they were a trio of kids that snatched a
dialog: neighbor's toddler and smashed it's skull in - "just to see what it looked
dialog: like" I believe was their defense. They were killed in a car wreck on the
text: way to a detention center.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So they're dead too?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You'd be surprised how many dead people are just walking around - we're
dialog: stubborn bastards. Thing is, those kids are supposed to be in Hell. Which
dialog: means that someone wants you out of the picture so badly they're willing to
dialog: summon demons.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Is it those two angels I'm supposed to stop?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Couldn't be. They're not evil - they're just stupid.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: Wait a minute - are you going to listen to this shit? We don't even know
dialog: who this guy is. For all you know, he's in with those fucks. They both
dialog: showed up at the same time.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I hate to say it - but he does have a point. How did you know where to find
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You know what the dead do with most of their time? They watch the living.
text: Especially in the shower.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: I can't wait to die.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: And why are you watching me?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Because you're the one who's going to help me get some changes made in that
dialog: book you all hold so much stock in.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Hustler?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: The Bible.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What's your beef with the Bible?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I'm not in it.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Neither are any of us, but you don't hear us bitching.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: But I'm supposed to be in it. I was the Thirteenth Apostle.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I've been going to church my entire life and I've never heard of a
dialog: thirteenth apostle named Rufus.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: See? You know all about the other twelve Apostles -white boys, I might add.
dialog: But no mention of Rufus. And why? Cause I'm a black man. But that's just my
dialog: pet peeve. I mainly want to correct a major error that you people are
dialog: basing a faith on.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Jesus wasn't white; He was black.
text: Rufus bites into his sandwhich. Bethany, Jay and Silent Bob look at him and
dialog: then each other.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Bullshit. I've seen pictures of Jesus, and He has blonde hair and blue
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (wiping hands)
dialog: That's what's particularly insulting. Between the time when He established
dialog: the faith and the church started to officially organize, the powers-that-be
dialog: decided that while the message of Christ was integral, the fact that He was
dialog: black was a detriment. So all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric,
dialog: even though the brother was blacker than Jesse.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: If that's true, then why'd He get written about while you were left out?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Well He is the Son of God, right? It's kind of hard to have the New
dialog: Testament without him. So you fudge a few facts and put a spin on His
dialog: ethnicity. Leaving me out's okay because there's still Twelve apostles to
dialog: choose from.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I don't buy it.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: That's what the good people of Antioch were saying when they stoned my ass.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You were martyred?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: That's one way of putting it. Another way is to say I was bludgeoned to
dialog: shit by big rocks. See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the world
text: and spread His word. Antioch was already garnering a big Christian
dialog: following, so I got sent there. And was a big hit. They loved hearing about
dialog: Jesus' message, and how He was the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He was
dialog: black, the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit. I pressed
dialog: the point, and before I know it, I'm wearing stones - although not to
dialog: accessonze.
speaker_heading: BETH ANY
dialog: Why didn't you just let the point go when you saw how they were reacting?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Because it's part of the facts. White folks only want to hear the good
dialog: shit: life eternal, a place in God's kingdom. As soon as they hear they're
dialog: getting all this from a black Jesus, they freak. And that - my friends - is
dialog: called Hypocrisy. Folks just can't accept a black Savior.
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: You going to eat that hash brown?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So you went to Heaven?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Shit yeah; it was the least the brother could do. I gave up my sheep and
dialog: followed His ass around Jerusalem for three years. And in all that time,
dialog: did I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn't bitch, because I was into His
dialog: message. And while the message is what counts, folks should know that He
dialog: was black. That's why I'm going to help you find stop those angels from
dialog: getting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my campaign.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: How do you know about that?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Heaven's a pretty boring place, and anything that breaks the tedium is
dialog: news. The unmaking of existence is what you might consider a great
dialog: tediumbreaker. Besides, there isn't much I don't know about you.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I find that hard to believe.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: When you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: You did that?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Yeah... but I never told anyone about it.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Neither did he. He died of Leukemia two years later. His name was...
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: ...BryanJohnson.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Your exploits - no matter how inane - are well-known in Heaven. Probably in
dialog: Hell, too.
text: Bethany rubs her temples and exits OC. Rufus watches her go.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Tell me something about me.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (preoccupied with the OC Bethany)
dialog: You masturbate more than anybody else on the planet.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Shit, everyone knows that. Tell me something nobody knows.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You think about guys when you do it.
text: Rufus gets up and exits. Silent Bob looks at Jay, shocked.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Not all the time!
text: Bethany sits on a swing in the kiddie-jungle gym, shaking her head. Rufus
text: joins her.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I'm sorty if I spooked you.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I just feel... violated. Like my life isn't mine exclusively.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: That's the way it goes with celebrities.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What are you talking about? I'm a nobody. I'm just a quiet girl from the
text: suburbs who counsels pregnant teens.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You sound like Christ. He had the same reaction when He found out who He
dialog: was, minus the quiet girl from the 'burbs angle. And like Him, I'm sure
dialog: you'll come to terms and do what you're supposed to.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Why not get the pope or someone holy like that?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Just because a guy wears a funny hat, doesn't make him the right man for
dialog: the job. Only certain hands can deliver the world from the brink of
dialog: destruction. last time it was Jesus - this time it's you.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Can't say yet. But the question is - are your hands capable enough to carry
dialog: the burden. It all rides on you.
speaker_heading: BFTRANY
dialog: (rubbing her temples)
dialog: Two thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home. You know,
dialog: yesterday I wasn't sure God even existed. And now I'm upto my ass in
dialog: Christian Mythology.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: God hates it when it's referred to as Mythology.
speaker_heading: BFTHANY
dialog: Well then let's ask the quote, unquote 'prophets' what we should call it
dialog: instead.
dialog: (looking OC; concerned)
dialog: Now where did those two assholes go?
scene_heading: INT STRIP JOINT
text: It's your typical strip club. One woman on a stage and a crowd of men
text: paying way-too-much attention. The place is dimly lit with red lights and
text: chock full of smoke. Off to one side, a dee-jay spins records, blasting the
text: music. The crowd is rather thin.
text: Jay and Silent Bob sit at the stage. their eyes glued on...
text: The DANCER - a gorgeous, shapely vixen with very little clothing on, and
text: growing littler by the second.
text: Jay pokes Silent Bob, who produces a wad of bills. They skim off a nice
text: pile and stow the rest. They spread their piles neatly on the bar. The
text: Dancer smiles and starts dancing toward them. Jay holds up a five-spot and
text: performs his own little seductive dance ~th it. He stands at the edge of
text: the stage, ~'rating. The Dancer slinks over and Jay stuffs the five in her
text: G-string. She rubs his head and slinks away. Jay humps Silent Bob's chair,
text: excitedly. Bethany and Rufus come up from behind them. Bethany hits Jay.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (shouting above the music)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Proving to this bastard that I ain't gay.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Long story - forget it. But we should get moving. How can we get to New
dialog: Jersey?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I had a car.
text: She slaps Jay upside the head, but - riveted by the Dancer - he doesn't
dialog: feel it.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: We could go by train.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (looking OC)
dialog: Sounds cool.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: There's a phone out there. I'll call for reservations.
text: Rufus is now also riveted by a table dancer off to the side.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: No, it's okay. I can handle it.
text: Rufus half-nods. Bethany shakes her head and exits.
text: The Dancer gyrates on the stage, revealing more and more of herself.
text: Jay pounds on the stage, hoots, and dances, flashing more bills.
text: ACROSS THE STAGE a small GANG of bandanna-wearing, angry-looking blacks
text: watch the OC Jay with little amusement. The Dancer dances toward them.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (banging on stage)
dialog: Sweet thing!
dialog: (Hashes another five)
dialog: Look what I found! Snoog!
text: The Dancer smiles as she approaches Jay, but is interrupted by more
dialog: banging.
text: The GANG LEADER has his foot on the stage. He produces a ten dollar bill
text: from his jacket and casually holds it up. The other three members of his
text: posse smile and slap hands.
text: The Dancer shrugs at the shocked Jay and changes direction, heading toward
text: the Gang. Jay casts a horrified look at Silent Bob.
text: The Gang Leader leans forward, preparing to tip when we hear an obnoxiously
text: loud throat~learing.
text: Jay holds aloft a twenty, smiling and nodding.
text: The Dancer shrugs at the Gang Leader and again switches direction. The Gang
text: Leader looks at his posse, who shake their heads at him, disappointedly.
text: The Stage becomes a bidding table, as - on one side - the Gang Leader
text: produces two twenties. On the other side, jay - staring at the Gang Leader
text: - produces three twenties. The Gang Leader hits his posse up for more cash.
text: Jay hits Silent Bob up for more cash. The Dancer stays in the middle,
text: gyrating and sizing up the best offer.
text: Jay then produces the creme'de Ia creme': three hundred dollar bills. He
text: sneers at the OC Gang Leader. The Dancer heads over to jay and wraps her
text: legs around him from the stage, gyrating against his groin. Jay stares at
text: the Gang Leader, a victorious smirk on his face.
text: The Gang Leader shakes his head angrily and jumps out of his seat,
text: producing a gun from his jacket. He fires into the ceiling. The music
text: scratches to a halt and the other viewers scatter toward the door. The Gang
text: Leader points his piece at Jay, his posse backing him up.
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: You a smart ass, ain'tcha, white boy? Come in here and ruin my good time.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: It's a free country. The bitch just came to the man with the most.
speaker_heading: DANCER
dialog: Bitch?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: No offense, baby.
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: The bitch is gonna be leaving with the man with the most - the man with the
dialog: most led in his piece. While you and tubby are leaving with the most led in
dialog: your dead fucking carcasses, know what I'm sayin?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Dancer)
dialog: Step to the side, baby. I've gotta slap this pussyass, Nino Brown wanna-be
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: DANCER
dialog: (to Gang Leader)
dialog: Come on, Kane. This isn't necessary.
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: Shut the fuck up and back away from the midget!
text: The Dancer moves to the side.
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: (to Jay)
dialog: Now I believe you were about to apologize. I believe you were about to
dialog: intone some pleas for mercy. You were about to say "Please, Mister Kane, I
dialog: didn't mean to disrespect you in your club. Please accept my most humble
dialog: apology.
text: Bethany comes back and sees the mess. She moves to rush to Jay's side, but
text: Rufus holds her back An OC Jay laughs.
text: Jay leans on Silent Bob, laughing. The Gang stares back, angrily.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You want an apology?
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: (cocks gun)
dialog: Give me at least one "I'm sorry," and ltll put a kill shot through that
dialog: thick fucking skull of your's. Otherwise we go slow and long in the pain
dialog: dispensation.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (beat; zips jacket closed)
dialog: Know what I'm doing?
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: No. What you doing?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I'm closing my jacket, so that when we start this up, I don't get your
dialog: filthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt. You know why?
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Because you can't get shit stains out of flannel. What I'm saying is that
dialog: you got shit for brains.
text: The Gang Leader and his posse stare silently for a moment.
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: Well I appreciate you breaking that down for me, but I got it without the
dialog: explanation.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: No. No, I don't think you did get it. See, there's gonna he some nine's
dialog: firing in here, and when the bullets stop flyin', your cunt-lip ass is
dialog: gonna be all holes and smoke. You think you can draw on me and walk away?
dialog: Fuck that. And fuck you - you punk-ass monkey bitch! Yeah, I called you a
dialog: monkey! Maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before I cap you, I'll bring a
dialog: coconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave; stick a straw through it
dialog: and stick the other end in the ground. Your lips'll reach.
text: The Gang stares, mystified. Rufus and Bethany can't move they're so
dialog: frightened.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You think every white boy cowers at your ass? Shit, if I don't fucking
dialog: plant you - watermelon - my muscle here will.
dialog: (thumbs at Silent Bob)
dialog: What do you think he is? My boy friend? I love chicks. So he's gotta be
dialog: with me for one reason: to watch my back. Silent Bob doesn't talk in words
text: - he speaks in bullets. Re's all quiet cause he's thinking about how he's
dialog: gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the bullets in
dialog: your bodies before they cool down. You know why? Because he likes to see
text: the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down. Come to think of
dialog: it, I~m tired of talking to your dumb ass; you probably don't even
dialog: understand big words like 'piss'. Tell you what - I'll let him explain it
dialog: to you.
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Silent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches.
text: Silent Bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion. Jay looks at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What are you waiting for?!
text: Silent Bob shrugs.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (flabbergasted)
dialog: YOU DON'T RAVE A GUN?!?
dialog: Silent Bob kind of nods
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (shocked)
text: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN? ALL THIS TIME WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, AND YOU DON'T
dialog: HAVE A GUN?!?
text: Silent Bob indicates the negative, sheepishly.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: THAT'S JUST FUCKING GREAT! DO YOU THINK I
dialog: WOULD'VE SAID ALL THAT IF I'D KNOWN YOU
dialog: DIDN'T HAVE A GUN?!?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: HUNHH?!?
text: Silent Bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully. The Gang snickers and smiles.
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: What was that about a coconut?
text: Jay shakes his head and glowers at Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: No gun! What the fuck kind of muscle are you?! All this time and you got no
dialog: gun!
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: Oh boys! We have some unfinished business here.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Can we talk this over?
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: Tell you what - you got thirty seconds. Then I cap you. Talk all you like.
text: Bethany goes to make a move, but Rufus holds her back, shaking his head. He
text: puts a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the action,
text: smiling.
text: Jay fumes.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: I can't believe you.
dialog: (to Gang Leader)
dialog: Do me a favor.
dialog: (points to Silent Bob)
dialog: Shoot this piece of shit first.
dialog: (to Silent Bob; disgusted)
dialog: No gun!
text: Suddenly, they both snap into a momentary trance. Zombie-like, Jay and
text: Silent Bob step to the turntables behind them. Jay puts on headphones and
text: begins scratching a record. A familiar tune begins.
text: The Gang watches, perplexed.
text: Silent Bob whips around, microphone in his hand, and begins to sing.
speaker_heading: SILENT BOB
text: HEY, HEY, HEY!!! IT'S FAT ALBERT!
dialog: AND I'M GONNA SING A SONG FOR YOU!!
text: AND BILL'S GONNA TELL YOU A THING OR TWO!!
dialog: WE'LL HAVE SOME FUN, NOW!
dialog: WITH BILL AND ALL THE GANG!
scene_heading: LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER -
dialog: WHILE WE DO OUR THANG!
text: The Gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment. The Gang Leader softens
text: and smiles, adding a slight nod of approval. Jay provides back-up.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: NA , NA, NA! GON NA HAVE A GOOD TIME!
speaker_heading: SILENT BOB
dialog: (as Fat Albert)
dialog: HEY! HEY! HEY!
speaker_heading: JAY
text: NA. NA. NA! GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME!
text: Bethany and Rufus look on. amazed.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I thought she looked familiar.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
text: (he nods toward the stage)
dialog: Serendipity.
text: Bethany looks to the stage.
text: The Dancer is the SERENDIPITY in question. She wipes sweat from her brow.
scene_heading: INT. MOOBY CORP. BOARDROOM - DAY
dialog: Oh, this isn't your standard boardroom; this is Mooby Corp., home of Mooby,
text: the Golden Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation on
text: Barney: sickeningly simple and very non-threatening. A large table sits in
text: the middle, a media center behind the huge chair at the head. The walls are
text: adorned with framed posters of Mooby, playing with kids, mouth agape in a
text: stupid smile. At the center of the table is a large, gold plated statue of
dialog: the insipid creature.
text: Doors open and the boardroom fills with suits - six men, one woman. They
text: chatter and take their seats. After a beat, WHITLAND, the CEO, enters,
text: taking his place at the head of the conference table.
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
text: Good morning, shoppers.
dialog: (slaps a file on table)
dialog: Has anyone seen the over-night's?
text: An anticipatory hush fills the room.
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
dialog: We creamed 'em.
text: A cheer and applause goes up from the group. Whitland smiles.
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
dialog: (reading from file)
dialog: And last night was a rerun, which says to me that with the six months we
dialog: have to ready and promote the 'Very Nlooby Christmas' pay-per-view special,
dialog: we can produce history-making numbers. The record is held by that
dialog: shock-jock's New Year's thing, but I see no reason why our little cash cow
dialog: can't supercede those numbers and...
dialog: (stops and sniffs the air)
dialog: Do I smell onions?
text: Bartleby and Loki sit behind the thrall on a black leather couch. Loki is
text: carving something out of an onion, while Bartleby looks on.
text: Whitland and the rest of the board stare at them.
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
dialog: I didn't realize we had guests. Who are these gentlemen with?
text: The other suits shrug and look to one another for an answer nobody has.
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
dialog: (to Bartleby and Loki)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Loki continues carving. Bartleby looks at his friend and shakes his head.
text: Loki lifts his head without looking up.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (very distracted)
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
dialog: May I ask what you're doing in my boardroom?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (still preoccupied)
dialog: My friend just has a few words for you, and then we'll be on our way.
dialog: Heading to Jersey, you see. Now -by the decor, I assume I'm guessing
dialog: correctly that this is the corporate headquarters for Mooby Productions
dialog: International?
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
dialog: You guess correctly. Now, may I ask who the fuck you are and - again - what
dialog: the fuck you're doing in our conference room?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (to Bartleby, still not looking up)
dialog: You may proceed, mon ami'.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I can't believe you.
dialog: (to Whitland)
dialog: I just want to start off by apologizing. My friend here has a penchant
dialog: toward the dramatic, so he's making me do this. Usually, I don't even
dialog: involve myself in his affairs, but he hasn't done this in awhile, so he
dialog: wants...
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Just read 'em their rights already.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (sighs; circling the table)
text: Mooby, the Golden Calf. Created by Nancy Goidruff -a former kindergarten
dialog: teacher - in nineteen eighty nine to fill a gap in the Saturday morning
text: schedule on local network K-REL Bought by the Complex Corporation in
dialog: nineteen ninety one and broadcast nationally as the 'The Mooby Fun-Time
dialog: Hour', it picked up a large following of children, ages three to eight, and
dialog: spawns sixteen records, two theatrical films, eight prime-time specials, a
text: library of priced-to-own video cassettes, and bicoastal theme parks dubbed
dialog: 'MoobyWorld'.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did I miss anything?
text: Whitland and company stare for a beat.
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
dialog: You forgot 'Mooby Magazine'. Is there a point to this?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: You and your board are idolators.
text: Whitland and company stare dumbfounded. Loki finishes carving and stands
text: beside Bartleby.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (to Bartleby)
dialog: How could your forget the magazine?
text: Bartleby rolls his eyes. Loki turns to the Whitland and holds up the
dialog: sculpture.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It's you.
dialog: (sets sculpture on table)
dialog: Do you know much about voo-doo? Fascinating practice, very close to
dialog: Satanism, but not really much of a religion - no doctrine of faith. Just an
text: arrangements of superstitions, the most well- known of which is the voo-doo
dialog: doll.
dialog: (sneezes; waits; continues)
text: A mock-up of an individual is subjected to various pokes and prods, and the
dialog: desired result is that the individual will feel the effects.
speaker_heading: WHITLAND
dialog: (to nearest board member)
dialog: Call security - now.
text: Loki throws the knife at the table, severing the phone cord.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: All lines are currently down.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (to Whitland)
dialog: Again -. I apologize for my friend's...
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Would you just get on with it?!
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (miffed; to Whitland)
dialog: You are responsible for raising an icon that draws worship from the Lord.
dialog: You've broken the first commandment, but more than that, I'm afraid none of
dialog: you passes for a decent human being. Your continued existence is a mockery
dialog: of morality.
dialog: (looks to Loki; Loki nods)
dialog: Like you - Mister Bernard.
dialog: (stands behind board member)
dialog: Last year you cheated on your wife of seventeen years, eight times - twice
dialog: with prostitutes. You even had sex with her best friend while she was at
dialog: her garden club meeting and you were supposed to be watching your kids.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: In the bed you and your wife share, no less.
text: The board member stares in disbelief. Loki nods to Bartleby and he moves
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: BARTLBY
dialog: And you, Mister Newman.
text: Loki sifts through compact discs. He pulls out one entitled 'Mooby Mania'
text: and pops it into a player. A simple children's song echoes through the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: You got your girlfriend drunk at last year's Christmas party, and then paid
text: a kid from the mailroom to have sex with her while she was passed out, just
dialog: so you could break up with her - guilt free - when she sobbingly confessed
dialog: the next morning that she cheated on you. She killed herself three months
dialog: later. You sent flowers to her wake.
text: The board member's face is frozen. Bartleby shakes his head and moves
text: quickly around the table.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (not liking his job)
dialog: Mister Pereira disowned his gay son; Mister Turran put his mother in a
dialog: third-rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her house to
text: purchase an oriental rug for himself; Mister Barker flew to the Phillipines
text: on the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy; Mister
dialog: Bloom okayed the production of Mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafe
dialog: and toxic materials because it was less costly.
text: Bartleby stops at the female Board member and looks at her, relieved.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: You, on the other hand, are an innocent. You lead a good life and have
dialog: never misused your power here.
text: She stares at Bartleby. Loki pats her on the back and urges Bartleby on.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: But you, Mister Whitland. You have more skeletons in your closet than this
dialog: assembled party. I can't even mention them aloud.
text: Bartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into Whitland's ear.
text: Whitland goes green. Bartleby steps back. Loki stands beside Whitland.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You're her father, you sick fuck.
text: Whitland begins sobbing.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (to Loki)
dialog: Can I go now?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (cheerily rubbing his head)
dialog: Go on, you crazy kid.
text: Bartlebv exits. Loki turns menacingly on the others.
speaker_heading: LOKI
text: With the exception of Miss Pryce, there is not a decent human being amongst
dialog: you. Do you know what makes a human being decent?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Fear. And therein lies the problem. None of you has anything to fear
text: anymore. You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power, hiding behind
dialog: your false idol, far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy even from
dialog: one another. But not from God.
text: Loki goes to exit but pauses. He turns around.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I forgot my little voo-doo doll.
dialog: (looks at Whitland)
dialog: Wow. It really does look just like you. Maybe, if I believed enough...
text: Loki begins moaning menacingly, slowly waving an open palm over the figure.
text: Whitland looks at it horrified, then at Loki, then back at the figure. He
text: sweats and shifts in his seat - eyes pinned on the figure. Loki lets out a
text: shriek and smashes the figure with his fist. Whitland freezes, eyes closed.
text: Slowly, he opens his eyes - unharmed.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I don't believe in voo-doo.
text: Loki swiftly exits. The Board Members sit in awed silence. Then the doors
text: burst open and Loki storms back in.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: But I do believe in this.
text: Gun blazing, he takes out the male board members, including Whitland, in a
text: flurry of bullets. The remaining female Board Member covers her head with
text: her arms. Loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: It's okay. You've done nothing wrong. They were bad men. You are a pure
dialog: soul.
text: She looks at him, terrified. He smiles back. Then his expression hardens.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: But you didn't say 'God Bless You' when I sneezed.
text: He quickly puts the gun to her head. She slams her eyes shut.
speaker_heading: OC BARTLEBY
dialog: (cautionary)
dialog: Loki!
text: Loki freezes and looks OC. He grimaces and holsters his piece.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (to woman)
dialog: Sorry. Force of habit.
text: He surveys his handiwork and exits. The female Board Member slowly opens
text: her eyes and looks around.
scene_heading: INT STRIP JOINT - LATER
text: Jay and the Gang Leader sit together at a table, surrounded by the other
text: gangsters and Silent Bob. They laugh and chug their '40's.
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: (to Gang)
dialog: Watch this shit.
dialog: (to Jay)
dialog: Do it again, G. Do the Mush-mouth.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (swigs his beer; as 'Mush-mouth')
dialog: Hey-buh, Fat-buh, Al-buh-bert.
text: The Gang laughs hysterically.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER 1
dialog: Fat Albert like a mother fucker and shit!
text: Bethany, Rufus, and Serendipity huddle around a table further away.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (elated)
dialog: I forgot you were down here! How long now?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Three years this August. What about you - is this another temporary
dialog: expulsion? You and your 'Christ was down' campaign?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What does that mean - another expulsion? I thought you came down here
dialog: specifically to help me?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Is that what he told you? Rufus gets thrown out constantly; at least once a
text: month, ethereal time. They always bring him back, but only after a few days
dialog: of peace and quiet - free from that black nationalist rhetoric.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (joking)
dialog: Artsy-fartsy bitch.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Who you calling artsy-fartsy?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: Serendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in Jerusalem.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Let me guess - the fourteenth apostle; left out of the bible because she's
text: a woman.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: The girl's not a woman.
dialog: (to Serendipity)
dialog: No offense.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Oh, those weren't tits I saw Jay cozying up to?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (tugs on boobs)
dialog: What, these? You should know better than anyone at this table that tits
dialog: don't make a woman.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Hell, the tubby, coat-wearing mother fucker's got tits - don't make him a
dialog: woman.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Aside from an intuitive knack for accessorizing, what traditionally defines
text: a woman falls between two things : her legs. But as you can see...
text: Serendipity stands and unbuttons her jeans, dropping them slightly,
text: revealing yet another smooth, sexless crotch, quite like Metatron's.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I lack definition.
speaker_heading: OC JAY
dialog: Hey! They're getting a free show!
text: Serendipity pulls her pants back up and sits down, smiling at the OC party.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (weary)
text: Oh God. Another angel. Like Metatron.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: How do you know Metatron?
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: How does she know Metatron?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: This is the last Scion.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Don't you see the resemblance?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (stares at Bethany)
dialog: A bit.
dialog: (suddenly nervous)
dialog: Oh shit. If she's been tapped, then something's up.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I'm confused.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Bethany, Serendipity here isn't technically an angel, nor is she by any
dialog: means a human being like I was and you are.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Amen to that.
text: (swigs her beer and spits it out)
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Then who is she?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Not who - what. I haven't always been part of the anthropomorphic club. I
dialog: used to be an abstract.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Now I'm really lost.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Serendipity's an idea.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Try all ideas.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I'm a muse, stupid.
text: Bethany stares at her for a beat, then at Rufus. Rufus nods affirmatively.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I can't take much more of this.
dialog: (downs her beer)
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (to Serendipity)
text: She's now met a seraphim, a dead man, and a muse.
dialog: You can appreciate her frame of mind.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (to Serendipity)
dialog: So you - what - inspire people?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: What just went down with your friends over there-you don't think they
dialog: thought of that themselves? I knew Kane's weak spot for Fat Albert and
dialog: passed it along to the boys.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
text: If she hadn't interceded, they'd be chalk lines right now.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You made them sing that song?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I offered them a solution out of the hole they dug for themselves.
dialog: Thankfully, they took it.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Are you kidding? Those two are so dense, they wouldn't get a good idea if
text: it was given to them in a specially marked box.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Dense people are the most open to suggestion - it's vou so-called
dialog: intelligent folks that have a hard time accepting a good idea.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Ain't that the truth.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Prove it. Give me a good idea.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: If I do, and you accept it, then you'll have confirmation that you are - as
dialog: you say - dense.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Alright. So you're a muse. So what kind of people do you inspire - besides
dialog: stupid ones?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I used to specialize in entertainment - literature, theatre, so forth.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Movies?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: In some cases, I'd do everything but bang starlets on the casting couch.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What have I seen that you've been involved with?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Off the top of my head - everything. Well almost everything. For example:
dialog: I'm responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Nine?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
text: The one about the kid, by himself in his house; burglars trying to get in
dialog: and he fights them off?
dialog: (Bethany nods)
dialog: I had nothing to do with that one. Somebody sold their soul to Satan to get
dialog: the grosses up on that piece of shit.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Which brings us to the next logical question - what are you doing
dialog: stripping?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Well you remember why I left, right?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit for
dialog: your ideas.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: And sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and turn
dialog: out real trash.
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: So I opted to quit being a muse and write for myself. I gave my two weeks
dialog: notice. got a body, fifty bucks, and got sent out into the world to make my
dialog: fortune.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So what happened?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Writer's block.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Writer's block?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Can you believe it? Me - a muse, for God's sake! I sit down in front of the
dialog: typewriter, and what do I get? Nothing. Blank page. 1 can't even write a
dialog: grocery list.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob? You inspired them.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: That's the cosmic joke. I can give out a zillion and nine ideas a second,
dialog: but I can't keep any for myself. Her quirky sense of humor.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: God's.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You're saying God's a woman.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Was there ever a doubt in your mind?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: The possibility never presented itself. He's always referred to as a Him.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I didn't write it that way My job stops at the idea stage. The person that
text: holds the pen adds their own perspective, and all the pen-holders were men.
dialog: One of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in the
dialog: editorial process.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Another one's that you can't jerk off.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: See. these being male-dominated times, the Pharisees and High Priests felt
text: threatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling their
dialog: fates. so they made sure that She became a He Doesn't stop with God - the
dialog: whole book is slanted and gender-biased: a woman's responsible for the
text: first sin, the fall of man, and the expulsion from Eden. a woman cuts
text: Sampson's coif of power, a woman asks for the head of John the Baptist.
dialog: Read that book again some time - women are painted as bigger antagonists
dialog: than the fucking Egyptians and Romans combined.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: God is a woman...
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I don't know what the big surprise is - women are the only gender that can
dialog: create life, just like God created the universe. Who else but a mother
dialog: could have the infinite patience with impudent children that God has with
dialog: humanity. A woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes, so
dialog: psychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can feel
text: completely comfortable with; and the faithful - both male and female - feel
dialog: at ease with God. In time of trial, our first instinct is to implore the
dialog: aid of the Almighty, just as when you're a child, the only person who can
dialog: make it all better is...
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: ...mom. God, it makes sense.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (to Serendipity)
dialog: Shit, you still have a knack for words.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Not really useful in my new line of work.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: What about that? Why'd you choose stripping?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: In an effort to create something artistic that I could claim as my own.
dialog: See, I've been able to fool myself into thinking this isn't stripping, it's
dialog: dancing; and at least dancing is artistic. But She won't even give me that
dialog: much - the way God designed dance, it's the only creative act which results
text: in no tangible product. Unlike paintings, poems, movies or most other arts
text: forms. when the dance is over, there's nothing to show for it - nothing to
dialog: save and enjoy... or sell.
dialog: (takes a drink)
dialog: Believe me, the irony wasn't lost on this muse.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: How long are you going to keep this up?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Believe me, I think about eating crow and going back to the grind from time
dialog: to time. But I'd hate to give Her the satisfaction of my playing the
dialog: prodigal. And it sucks because I can't stand being flesh anymore -
dialog: especially this halfway crap. Not only do I have to take care of the
dialog: aesthetic - the showers, the haircutting, the pit-shaving - but I can't
dialog: take advantage of the benefits - like getting laid or using my period as an
dialog: excuse not to get laid...
dialog: (conspiratorily to Bethany)
dialog: ...the only true boon to having a period, from what I understand.
speaker_heading: RLFLS
dialog: Well we could sure use your help. We need someone with good ideas. You
dialog: remember a couple of angels named Loki and Bartleby?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
text: Sure - the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: They found a way back.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: God no. Not the plenary indulgence loop hole?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You know about that?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I always knew that thing was a bad idea. Leave it to the Catholics to
dialog: destroy existence.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Bethany's Catholic.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: My condolences.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What do you have against Catholics?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Ever been to a Catholic mass?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Once or twice.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: It's like bad sex - up, down, up, down, kneel, leave.
dialog: And the whole time you'd rather be watching t.v.
dialog: You people don't celebrate your faith - you mourn it.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So if we're so wrong, then what's the right religion?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: When are you people going to learn? It's not about right or wrong - it's a
dialog: question of faith. It doesn't matter what you believe in - just that you
dialog: believe.
text: Jay and Silent Bob join them, wearing bandannas.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Look! They made me and Silent Bob part of the gang!
text: Suddenly, the doors behind them blast open, pouring light into the onc~im
text: room. A huge figure stands in the doorway, backlit and acting as a sepia
text: filter - the light and vapors surrounding him are brown.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: (deep, gutteral hiss)
dialog: Not born... shit into existence.
text: Our group stares at the OC brute. Jay sniffs the air.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Who farted?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Sweet Christ, someone wants you bad.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What do you mean? What's that smell?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Don't tell me that's who I think it is.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITh
dialog: The stench should say it all.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Who the hell is it?!
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: An excremental - the Golgothan.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: A shit-demon.
text: The Golgothan moves slowly from the door, toward the group.
speaker_heading: NO-MAN
dialog: No... man. ..of...woman.. born...
text: The Gang join the others. They hold and cover their noses.
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: (to Jay; loading his piece)
dialog: Friend of your's?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to group)
dialog: Is this smelly fuck with us?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: He's coming for Bethany.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Gang Leader)
dialog: Smoke that mother fucker like it ain't no thang!
speaker_heading: GANG LEADER
dialog: I knew I'd get to wax someone today. Represent!
text: The Gang charges OC, guns blazing, while we hold on the group. Suddenly,
text: the room is filled with screams and wet, slurpy noises. The group goes from
text: staring wide-eyed, to shielding themselves. The noise stops and Jay and
text: Silent Bob look up.
text: The Gang lay about NoMan in trashed, dead positions. They are covered in
text: murky, creamy crap - their wide, white eyes frozen in horror. NoMan scoops
text: a finger-full of muck off the leader and eats it, smiling.
text: Our heroes start backing up slowly, as to not be noticed.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: I guess we're in charge of the gang now.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What the fuck happened?!?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Go for the bar. We might have a few seconds - his short-term memory's for
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: So's the rest of him.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: No chance of taking him down?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Gee. I don't know. Let's ask the gangstas.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You're right; let's book.
text: They dash. NoMan snaps to attention and throws it's arm at them, launching
text: a huge glob of shit through the air.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (running; seeing it coming)
dialog: SHIT!!!
text: Everyone leaps behind the bar. The shit flies over them and slams against
text: the mirror above. Immediately, it stretches - Blob-like - over the entire
text: frame, and burns in an acidic fashion.
text: Jay stares, horrified.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Now that... is some powerful shit.
text: Serendipity pulls at the floor, yanking open a door.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Quick! Get in!
text: Bethany, Rufus, jay and Silent Bob leap into the darkness. Serendipity
text: follows, pulling the door shut on top of them.
scene_heading: INT BASEMENT
text: Our heroes cower beneath the floor door.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What is that thing?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: You ever hear of Golgotha?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
text: Skull place. The hill where Christ was crucified.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (peering above)
dialog: Yeah, well it wasn't just Christ up there - the Romans crucified everybody
dialog: on that hill. Ahd Christ excluded, they were all criminals - killers,
dialog: brigands, thieves, rapists. And whenever the crucified expired, their
text: bodies would naturally lose muscle control, spilling bowel and bladder in
text: the process. And the result is that walking pile of crap up there: the
dialog: Golgothan Shit-Demon - Hell's chief assassin. And he's here for you,
dialog: girlie.
text: Silent Bob stares at a crack in the doors. A milky drop of shit drips
dialog: through it.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What are we doing down here, then?. Any second now he'll be blasting
dialog: through that door!
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Shit's brainless. If we can sit tight for a couple of minutes, he'll forget
dialog: what he came for.
text: Suddenly another drop falls. Then another. Then a steady stream. Silent Bob
text: taps Rufus and points. Rufus reacts.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (indicating trickling shit)
dialog: Looks like it's been taking memory training courses...
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (off trickle)
dialog: JUMP!!!
text: The five leap from their perch on the steps, just as the doors explode,
text: dumping a torrent of crap on the steps. The body of muck morphs into NoMan
text: anew. NoMan lumbers toward them. The group, attempting to gain their
text: bearings on the floor, crawls backwards. NoMan pulls a piece of himself
text: off, rolling it around in It's hands.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: If anybody still remembers any prayers, I suggest you start whipping them
dialog: out.
text: Silent Bob stares wide-eyed up at the approaching demon. And then,
text: something occurs to him. He stops backing up and stands. The others
dialog: continue moving back.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Bob, get down! Jay!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: You tubby retard! Get your ass back on the floor!
text: Silent Bob stands like a statue in the Golgothan's path. The demon snarls a
text: smile, moving ever closer. Silent Bob reaches into his coat and pulls a
text: small canister out. He points it at the beast. A mist shoots out into the
text: face of the Golgothan. It pauses, looking confused. The shitball in It's
text: hand drops to the floor, and then so does It.
text: Bethany, Rufus, Serendipity, and Jay climb to their feet and crowd around
text: Silent Bob. They look to the fallen, unconscious behemoeth, then to Silent
dialog: Bob.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (off Bob's canister)
dialog: What was that?
text: Silent Bob holds the can out to them: it's a small, trial size can of Glade
text: Air Freshener. Jay looks at it, then at Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (reading can)
dialog: 'Knocks strong odors out.'
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Way to go. tubby.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Why would you ever carrs this?
text: Jay farts. Silent Bob sprays the freshener at his ass. The others look at
dialog: jay.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (to Serendipity)
dialog: Who has dominion over this thing?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Only Lucifer can order a killing. But something doesn't make sense: this
dialog: thing never travels alone - with it's intelligence level, Lucifer'd never
dialog: allow it. It usually has some kind of backup.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Can you get some answers?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I can give it a shot.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Serendipity's going to talk to that demon.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Cool! Can we watch?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Not a good idea. Demon's can wreak havoc on the weak-minded.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Fuck you - weak-minded! Me and Silent Bob can talk to him in his own
dialog: language! See...?
dialog: (makes the universal metal sign)
dialog: he'd understand this.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (shakes her head; to Rufus)
dialog: Whoever sent this might send mor~. I suggest you take the princess and get
text: as far away as possible.
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: I'll do what I can to extract some info from shit-boy here. If there's
dialog: anything helpful. I'll get it to you somehow.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (hugs her)
dialog: Thank you. And... you're a great dancer.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I'm a better juggler.
dialog: (to jay and Silent Bob)
dialog: You know you're supposed to be prophets. right? Start acting like prophets.
dialog: You should have seen that thing coming.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: Why the hell are we getting yelled at?!
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Just watch out for Bethany. Go.
text: Bethany leads Jay and Silent Bob up the stairs.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Man, bitch thinks just 'cause she's good-looking, she can tell us what to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: She told me that if you behave, she'll give you head.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Yeah?.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Oh, a demon'd have a field day with you.
text: Serendipity and Rufus watch them disappear up the steps.
speaker_heading: OC JAY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: OC BETHANY
dialog: You shut up.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: Nice girl.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Comes from good stock.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: You haven't told her yet?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Not the right time.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: How uncanny is the resemblance? Those eves, the lips...
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: The nails.
text: Serendipity looks at Rufus. He smiles. She hits him, laughing. He cracks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Blasphemer.
text: Then, the OC Golgothan makes a groggy, grumbling noise.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Shit. You'd better go. I'll take care of the trash.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (hugs her)
dialog: Good luck.
text: Rufus runs up the steps. Serendipity tunrs on the Golgothan.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Alright, Stinky - let's see what you know.
scene_heading: EXT CHURCH -DAY
text: A suited MAN stands at a podium, addressing a small thrall of reporters.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: And now, to speak on behalf of his Holiness' 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign,
dialog: ladies and gentlemen of the press, I give you the driving force behind the
dialog: movement - Cardinal Glick.
text: The reporters clap as CARDINAL GLICK takes to the podium. He strikes one as
text: more of an agent than a man of the cloth as he removes his Wayfarers.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: Thank you, Mister Flanagan - one of this parish's chief patrons, who
text: donated the stained-glass likeness of Our Lady of Gleeful Misery that
dialog: welcomes you as you enter the church every Sunday.
dialog: (off index cards)
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - few would deny that the Catholic Church
dialog: has fallen behind somewhat in the times. Catholicism usually strikes the
dialog: average person as an old-fashioned remedy for the ills - both moral and
dialog: psychological - of a society that has since left it's stringent rules and
text: ornate rituals on the heap with 45's and eight track cassettes. And in an
dialog: effort to disprove that, the Church has appointed this year as a time of
dialog: renewal, both of faith and of style. So, it is with great pleasure, that I
dialog: present you and your parish - mere days away from it's centennial
dialog: celebration - and the continental United States, via Satellite with the
dialog: first of man revamps that the 'Catholicism -Wow!' campaign will unveil over
dialog: the next year.
dialog: (applause)
dialog: Now, what does this mean for the average church-goer? Are we going to throw
dialog: out the rule book and adopt a hippie mentality in regards to our faith? No.
dialog: We're simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the aesthetic
dialog: and theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the highest
dialog: membership numbers on the planet.
text: A few applause ring out. Glick smiles.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: Thank you, thank you. So what are we talking about here. Well, for
dialog: example...
dialog: (pulls out crucifix)
dialog: while it has been a time-honored and traditional symboL of our faith, we
dialog: have decided to retire the highly recognizable, yet wholely depressing
dialog: symbol of our Lord, Jesus Christ, crucified. Why? Well, look at it. Would
dialog: you relish being a member of a group that uses a man nailed to two pieces
dialog: of wood as it's masthead? Of course not - who would? I've got enough
dialog: downers in my daily routine without having to deal with this visual
dialog: everytime I go to worship. lnstead, the church is going to adopt this new,
dialog: more soothing and inspiring sigil, which we feel is in-line with our new
dialog: outlook.
text: Glick pulls a cover off an object to his right - a two foot figure of
text: Christ smiling and giving the 'thumbs up'. The crowd buzzes.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: See? Isn't this better? How could you not feel just great walking into a
text: church and seeing this behind the priest - a positive reinforcement that
dialog: whatever we do, God thinks is 'a~kay'. I love this thing, it's so...
speaker_heading: REPORTER I
dialog: (interupting)
dialog: Cardinal Glick - has the church given any thought to it's position on john
dialog: Doe Jersey? Will he be given the right to die with dignity?
text: Another buzz rises from the crowd. Glick rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: C'mon people. We're not here to talk about that. It's an issue we stand
dialog: firm on - euthanasia is a big no-no, just like abortion. Murder's murder.
dialog: Why won't you people accept that? Besides, we're here to talk about this
dialog: little guy - your friend and mine... the happy Jesus. Can't you just see it
text: on chains around people's necks, and as the new background in avant garde,
dialog: MTV videos?
scene_heading: INT BUS TERNIINAL - DAY
text: The image of the 'Happy jesus' - thumbs up and all - is captured on a t.v.
scene_heading: monitor, a label reading U\'E VIA SATELLITE - RED BANK. NEW JERSEY' at the

speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: And you say Siskel and Ebert have no influence over this culture.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: We're getting out of here at just the right time. These people are nuts.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (off t.v.)
dialog: And that's the church we're heading to?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (steps to ticket window)
dialog: If you want to go home...

dialog: Two tickets to New Jersey, please.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Jersey's sold out, sir.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: The computer says.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Come on - how many people can possibly be going to New Jersey?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Enough to fill a bus.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (to Loki)
dialog: You had to drag that judgement out. You couldn't just hit and run.
dialog: (to Woman)
dialog: When's the next one?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Same time tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: What?! Doesn't this place warrant at least two buses a day?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I take it you've never been to the Garden State. Next.
text: Bartleby and Loki look around.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: There's no one else here.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Then I guess it's lunch time.
dialog: (she shuts her window)
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: We should have learned to drive a long time ago. Infinite celestial power
dialog: and we can't catch a bus.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Just shut up, this is your fault.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You can either lament over our mass transit folly, or you can listen to my
dialog: suggestion.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: It's your suggestions that prevent us from negotiating what should be a
dialog: simple matter of catching or staying on a bus!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Why fall victim to gravity when we can just as easily rise above?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (stares at him)
dialog: Fly?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: We got wings, right? Let's use them.
speaker_heading: OC VOICE
dialog: I wouldn't suggest that.
text: The pair spin and gawk.

text: NoMan is tied to a chair in the middle of the floor. Serendipity draws a

text: and throws it into No Man's face. It roars to life. The Golgothan shakes of
text: his daze, turning his attention on Serendipity.
speaker_heading: NoMAN
dialog: The Muse. They told us you were up here.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Matter of perspective. NoMan. I like to think of it as 'down here'. I have
dialog: a few questions for you, sir.
speaker_heading: NoMan
dialog: Free us from these binds, that you may have answers.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (heads toward it)

dialog: (stops; sarcastic)
dialog: Oh wait. I'm smarter than that.
text: NoMan lets out a bellow.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Face it, big guy - I'm not releasing you until I get answers. This can go
dialog: hard or easy. The sooner I get what I want, the sooner you'll be free. Now,
dialog: you can start by telling me why you're on this plane?
speaker_heading: NoMAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Liquidate the Last Scion.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: See? That wasn't so hard. Now - who sent you? Was it Lucifer?
text: NoMan laughs in a sinister fashion.
speaker_heading: NoMAN
dialog: Our master is no one and all. For a time, he will be prince of this world -
dialog: and the fate of those who dwell in it will be at the mercy of his whimsy.
text: And then he will sever reality and crush existence, like a thumb punctures
dialog: a fontanell, giving peace to those who've been without for so long.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Did Bartleby and Loki send you?
speaker_heading: NoMAN

dialog: world may die screaming. No power - divine or inherited - threatens the
dialog: crusade. You cannot win. Soon will rise of the cry of the abandonned,
dialog: begging your God to put an end to the madness. And only as being becomes
dialog: not, will they know that the God of Abraham lay dormant while the dream
dialog: perished in a blink. Your God is not dead - He's brain dead.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: She, you chauvinist bastard - She's brain dead. And no She's not. Stop
dialog: trying to be so spooky. Tell me who sent vou, or I'll use whatever
dialog: influence I have below' to make Hell even worse for you.
speaker_heading: NoMAN
dialog: You speak of Azrael.
dialog: (he laughs)
dialog: We pity you. Muse. You're still playing the old game. The one that could

speaker_heading: NoMAN
text: No soul escapes Hell, but one.
dialog: (beat - as if It's heard something)
dialog: Would that I could cross the threshold of your confining circle, I would
dialog: crush your half-life throat. But my Master does not abandon me to this
dialog: mockery of a prison. We will come back for the girl. And when we do, it

speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Jesus Christ, Azrael - how'd you get out of Hell?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: I told them I was coming up on a routine possession. I don't have much
dialog: time. If they figure out my ruse, they'll come looking for me.
speaker_heading: BARTLEIBY
dialog: You lied?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Go figure. Him. A demon.
dialog: (to Azrael)
dialog: Why'd you bring us in here?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Because you two fucks are inches away from getting yourselves caught. Going
dialog: around killing people, about to uncase your wings... don't you have any
dialog: idea what's going on?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: We're going back home.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Are you so clueless as to think you can just waltz back into Heaven?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Why not? We're going back clean.
speaker_heading: AZ RAEL
dialog: Let me let you in on a little secret, okay: everyone is looking for you.
dialog: Both sides - above and below. The orders are to terminate you on sight.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: You're pissing people off, that's why! Word on the grapevine is that God's
dialog: pissed off at your presumption, and I know Lucifer's pissed because you
dialog: assholes might just succeed where he's failed so many times, making him
dialog: look bad.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: So they're going to kill us?!?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: They're going to try'. That's why you have to travel incognito - tone down
dialog: your behavior, stay off their respective radars. Go about this thing more
dialog: subtly. Quit killing people - that's high profile. And for God's sake,
dialog: don't uncase your wings until you have to transubstantiate. Because the
dialog: minute you let them flap, legions of thrones and hordes of demons will
dialog: fight each other over who gets to kill you first.
dialog: (looksOC)
dialog: Shhhh!
text: A WOMAN and her small DAUGHTER walk past. While the Woman looks at the

text: further down the aisle, oblivious to the trio.
speaker_heading: DAUGHTER
dialog: Mommy, that man had horns.
text: Azrael grabs his hat and puts it back on.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: That's the kind of shit I'm talking about!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Oh, lighten up.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (still reeling)
dialog: I can't believe they want to kill us.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Believe it, boys. They've even got the Last Scion looking for you.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You're kidding!
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: This is big. I'm telling you. Your re-entry is a thorn in a lot of sides,
dialog: and they'll stop at nothing to prevent it.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: If that's the case, then why aren't you hunting for us too?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Because I want to see you go back. You were both given a raw deal; almost
dialog: as raw as mine. If you make it back, then I figure there's hope for me.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: In the meantime, I suggest you find an alternate mode of transportation. If
dialog: anything else comes up, I'll contact you.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Thank you, Azrael. You're a true friend.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Would you expect anything less from a demon. I have to get back to the Pit,
dialog: before they get suspicious.
dialog: (turns to leave)
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Hey Az - what's it like down there. Is it as bad as they say?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL

text: Bethany and Rufus sit across from one another. They stare out the window.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: How you coping, kid?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: It's weird. just when I think I've got a handle on things. something
dialog: wholely unbelievable presents itself. Sometimes I wish I had just stayed
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You sound like the Man.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What was He like?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Jesus? Black.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Besides that.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: The brother was centered. I mean, He was God, right? But I think He felt
dialog: left out because He was more than human, you know? We used to sit around
dialog: the fire - me and the other guys - and we'd be talking about what ass-holes
dialog: the Romans were or getting laid...
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Some things never change.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: ...and He'd just sit there listening and smiling. We'd ask Him why He never
dialog: joined in the convo, but He said He just liked to hear us talk; about
dialog: anything. Said it was like music. I think He just wished He had unimportant
dialog: shit to talk about himself.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: How does He feel now?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: He still digs humanity, but it bothers Him to see the shit that gets
dialog: carried out in His name - wars, bigotry, but especially the factioning of
dialog: all the religions. He said humanity took a good idea and, like always,
dialog: built a belief structure on it.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Having beliefs isn't good?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I think it's better to have ideas. You can change an idea. Changing a
dialog: belief is trickier. Life should malleable and progressive; working from
dialog: idea to idea permits that. Beliefs anchor you to certain points and limit
dialog: growth; new ideas can't generate. Life becomes stagnant. That was one thing
dialog: the Man hated - still life. He wanted everyone to be as enthralled with
dialog: living as He was. Maybe it had
dialog: something to do with knowing when He was going to die. but Christ had this
dialog: vitality that I've never encountered in another person since. You know what
dialog: I'm saving?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: He was big on life?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: It was more than that. He was the only person I ever knew who never engaged
dialog: in that most ancient of life-affirming activities.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Sex.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Debate. That's the only way people know how to reaffirm that they're alive
dialog: - by debating. In all it's forms. People spend their whole lives debating:
dialog: we fight about who's right and who's wrong, we fight ourselves, we fight
dialog: each other, we fight death, we fight over beliefs, we fight over fights. We
dialog: believe that to stop debating - in any fashion -is to stop living and give
dialog: up. People say that life's a struggle, but it's not. Life is living. I'm
dialog: even guilty of it myself, the way I go on about Christ's ethnicity,
text: fighting for the truth to come out. And I'm dead. Even in death, the only
dialog: way I know how to live is through debate. That's sad, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BETIIANY
dialog: Not if you believe it's important for people to know.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: A belief's a dangerous thing, Bethany. People die for it. People kill for
text: it. The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the Catholic
dialog: Belief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit. And whether
text: they know it or not, Bartleby and Loki are exploiting that belief, and if
dialog: they're successful, you, me. all of this... ends in a heartbeat.
dialog: (beat)
text: All over a belief.
text: Bethany nods. Rufus looks around.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I haven't seen the moron twins in awhile.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
text: They went to the lounge car to smoke.
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: I'll go find them; make sure they're not getting into any trouble.

speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: And who are your new friends?
speaker_heading: JAY
text: They just got in at the last stop.

speaker_heading: JAY

text: Bartleby and Bethany lay on either side of the table in their booth.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You can smoke up with them if you want. You don't have to keep me company.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: It's a long trip. There'll be plenty of time later.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So why are you heading to Jersey?
speaker_heading: BETRANY
dialog: There's just this thing there I'm supposed to do. How about you?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: We're going home.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Do you two live together?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Unfortunately. Do you live with those guys?
speaker_heading: B ETHANY
dialog: God, no. Not they just sort of adopted me.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: They're funny as hell. The big one never says a word.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I wish the little one would take a cue from him. But they're okay, as far
dialog: as stoner's go.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Lo... Larry's taken an immediate shine to them, and he usually hates
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: BETIIANY
dialog: How long've you two been together?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Awhile. He's great company. He can be a little flaky sometimes, but we've
dialog: got a lot in common.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: How'd you meet?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: We were stationed together.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: See? That's beautiful. And everyone's always up-in-arms about this
dialog: 'out-in-the-military' issue.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Well there's all that macho bullshit about it being 'This Man's Army'. And
dialog: you two meet and hook up while in the service, which is so special -
dialog: because it's so hard to meet anyone you can seriously relate to...
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (catches on)
dialog: You think we're lovers?! Oh no. No, we're not gay.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Oh God, I'm sorry'. I just assumed...
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
text: No. We live together and all, but at the end of the night, I go to my room.
text: and he goes to his.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why? Do I come off as gay?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No, not at all. I'm sorry. My ex-husband kind of fouled up my relationship
dialog: awareness barometer.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: You're divorced?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: That's the nice way of putting it. I consider it being dumped.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I was dumped once. More or less.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: It's terrible, isn't it? Don't you constantly question your value - like
dialog: why was I so easy to cast aside? Didn't I have merit?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: And you wonder if the other party's going to come to their senses and call
dialog: you back.
speaker_heading: BETIIANY
dialog: The worst is that I still think like a couple. After all these years, I
dialog: still have the 'we' mentality.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Mine grew out of what was really a stupid misunderstanding. A
text: misunderstanding that grew into a total withdrawl of communication.
dialog: Abandonment. And even though it was years ago, there's not a day that goes
dialog: by that I don't wonder what went wrong. And then it hits me - I was
text: replaced by someone. A lot of someones.
speaker_heading: BET HANY
dialog: And they always tell you it'll hurt less with time...
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: ...when actually, it hurts more.
speaker_heading: BETHANY

speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
text: Whole-heartedly.
scene_heading: INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT
text: Jay is asleep on Silent Bob's shoulder, drooling slightly. Loki talks with
dialog: Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I'm telling you, man - it's all about organized religion and society's
dialog: battle against it. The Rebels are fighting the Empire, right? Now the
dialog: Empire is led by whom? Darth Vader? No. It's led by the Emperor. And the
text: Emperor is a practitioner of the Force, albeit the Dark Side of the Force.
dialog: And the Force is basically a religion.
dialog: (Silent Bob nods)
text: So the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule, and the Imperial government is
dialog: run by this old religion. What you have, then, is a theocratic government -
text: a government run by the church. So Luke, Han, and Leia are fighting that
dialog: government to liberate the galaxy from the pious grip of what is, in
dialog: essence, holy mother church.
text: Silent Bob nods in understanding.
text: Bethany and Bartleby slump in their booth, the table loaded with empty
text: glasses. Bethany is quite tipsy. Bartleby sips his drinks, and
text: surreptitiously spits it out.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: You're saying you still go to church?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Every Sunday.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Does it do anything for you?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Gives me time to balance my check book every week.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: See? That's what I'm talking about. People don't go to church and feel
text: spiritual. They go to church and feel bored. But they keep going. Every
dialog: week. Out of habit.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Or in habit, if you're a nun.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Oh... that wasn't very funny at all.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: A friend of mine told me that church is like bad sex:it's messy and there's
dialog: no foreplay...
dialog: (starts laughing)
dialog: No. that's not it. I am so buzzed.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: When do you think you lost your faith?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I remember the exact moment. I was on the phone with my mother, and she was
dialog: trying to counsel me through what was happening to me and my marriage. And
dialog: she said something like "There's always a plan." And I... just got so
dialog: angry. I mean, I know she was talking about God, right - God had a plan.
dialog: But I was like "What about my plans?" You know? Like, don't they count for
dialog: anything? I had planned to grow old with my husband and have a family -
dialog: wasn't that plan good enough for God?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Apparently not.
dialog: (swigs her drink)
dialog: How about you? When did you lose your faith?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Me? Years ago. One day, God just stopped listening. I kept talking, but I
text: got the distinct impression that He wasn't listening anymore.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: She. And how do you know She was listening in the first place?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: I guess I don't.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I hate thoughts like that. But they occur to you with age. When you're a
dialog: kid, you never question the whole faith thing - God's in Heaven, and
dialog: He's... She's always got her eye on you. I'd give anything to feel that way
dialog: again. Which is why I guess I let myself get talked into this pilgrimage. I
dialog: needed proof. And the opportunity presented itself to find out if it is
dialog: like they told us in Catholic school. And I gotta tell you - the last few
dialog: days, I've come across some interesting people that lend toward convincing
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Where's this pilgrimage to?
scene_heading: INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
text: Rufus stirs. He looks around and stretches.
scene_heading: INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT
text: Bethany and Bartleby continue their discussion.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You'd never believe me if I told you.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Alright. But I warned you. Okay - I'm going to this church in New Jersey.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Really...
scene_heading: INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
text: Rufus heads toward the back of the car. He opens the door between the cars
text: and exits.
scene_heading: INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT
text: Bethany and Bartleby talk further. Bartleby's intrigued.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I was told that I'm supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering the
dialog: church. They're trying...
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: This sounds so stupid... They're trying to get back into Heaven.
scene_heading: INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
text: Rufus passes through another car and opens the door at the end.
scene_heading: INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT
text: Bartleby grows very tense. Bethany rattles on, half-toasted.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: See, they got tossed out of Heaven years ago, right? And if they get back
dialog: in, it proves God wrong. And since God is infallible, to prove Her wrong
dialog: would...
dialog: (laughing hard)
dialog: ..would unmake existence! I feel so stupid just saying it.
text: Bartleby's eyes are wide. He looks scared. Then, a calm falls over him.
speaker_heading: BETRANY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: But the thing I don't get... is how do I stop an angel? Two, even! I guess
dialog: I'm supposed to talk them out of it or something.
text: Bartleby surreptitiously slides a knife off the table.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Maybe you're supposed to kill them?
text: Bethany breaks into hysterics.
scene_heading: INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
text: Rufus pulls open another door and exits.
scene_heading: INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT
text: Bethany's still cracking up, oblivious to the on-the-defensive Bartleby.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Oh yeah! Kill them! Even if that was the case... I mean. how do you kill an
dialog: angel?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I don't imagine it's much different...
dialog: (slowly lifts the knife)
dialog: ...from killing a human...
text: The door behind them slides open. Rufus steps in.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Where the hell is everybody? I wake up, and...
text: He sees Bartleby. They both freeze.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: The Apostle!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Holy shit!
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (stumbling to her feet)
dialog: Rufus, I want you to meet my friend, Barry...
text: Bartleby leaps out of the booth and grabs Bethany, holding the knife to her
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (chuckiing)
dialog: Barry! Don't be such a show off!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Take it easy, Bartleby. Just let her go and let's talk about this.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: After all this time, this is what it comes down to -slaughtered by this
dialog: meat puppet?!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: There doesn't have to be a slaughter. We can work this out...
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Is that a knife?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Oh. we can work it out, alright. I'm going to work the blade in and out of
dialog: her thorax!
dialog: (calling over shoulder)
dialog: Loki!
text: Loki catches the action and reacts.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Holy shit - the Apostle!
text: He leaps from the table. Jay stirs and wakes up.
speaker_heading: jAY
dialog: (half asleep)
dialog: I didn't come in you, I swear...
dialog: (looks around)
text: Bartleby, with Bethany in hand, faces off against Rufus. Loki joins them.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: They're here to thwart our journey home, my friend. This one just told me
text: that she's supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering a church.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You think she was talking about us?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I'd say there was a pretty good chance. What do you say, Rufus - we're to
dialog: be liquidated?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: It doesn't have to go down like that! You haven't thought about the
dialog: consequences of re-entry!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Consequences, schmonsequences.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I have to agree with him. No one - not you, and especially not this
dialog: finite-lifer - no one is going to impede us. We're going home, regardless
dialog: of whose pride it may hurt!
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: It's not a question of pride, it's...
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Loki - kill the girl
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you, high?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Do it!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I can't kill her if she hasn't done anything, you know that. And it looks
dialog: like she's 'on the job', so to speak...
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Fine! I'll kill her myself...
text: A hand lands on Bartleby's shoulder.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (oblivious to the situation)
dialog: Hey man - now it's your turn. We got enough for a fatty boom-batty, biggety
dialog: blunt!
text: Bartleby turns the knife on him.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (not quite getting it yet)
dialog: We having cake or something?
text: Loki backhands Jay, stunning him.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (dazed)
text: In grates...
text: Jay drops to the floor, out cold. Silent Bob grabs Loki and hurls him down
text: the aisle. Rufus grabs Bartleby's knife hand. They struggle. Bethany
text: collapses.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: TUBBY! THE DOOR!
text: Silent Bob jumps over Loki and opens the back door of the car. He grabs
dialog: Loki by the collar.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Wait, man! Can't we talk about this?!
text: He throws Loki out the door, off the train.
text: Rufus squeezes Bartleby's hand. Bartleby drops the knife and punches Rufus
text: in the face. Bethany jumps on Bartleby's back, covering his eyes. They
text: careen down the aisle, toward Silent Bob. He pulls Bethany off Bartleby's
text: back and kicks him out the back door, off the train. He quickly slams the
text: door closed and leans against it.
text: The Bartender stares at him.
text: Silent Bob brushes off his coat and thumbs toward the door.
speaker_heading: SILENT BOB
dialog: No ticket.
text: Rufus rubs his jaw. Bethany crawls up beside him, breathing heavily.
speaker_heading: BETH ANY
dialog: I should have known something was wrong when he paid for all the drinks.
scene_heading: INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
text: A door is kicked open. Loki enters, brushing himself off. Bartleby follows.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: The Apostle is here!
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I noticed.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: If that's the case, then chick with him must be...
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: The Scion, I'd imagine.
dialog: (leans against the wall; slides down)
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (in a panic)
dialog: Well, shit man! Maybe we should rethink this whole thing! I mean, you heard
dialog: the guy - he said there were consequences. Azrael tells us we're marked.
dialog: Maybe there's more to this than we thought about.
text: Bartleby leans against the wall, sitting on the ground. His demeanor has
text: changed. He stares into space.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: There sure is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's them.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Them.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: The movie about the giant ants?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Them - the humans. It's what it all comes down to. you know? Us against
dialog: humanity... kind of like that giant ant movie.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I'm better than alright. I've had an epiphany, my friend.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: An... epiphany. Yes, well... that'll happen.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: When that sweet, innocent girl let her mission slip, I suddenly understood
dialog: it all - everything. For the first time in all these eons, I get it.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Get what?
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: In the beginning, it was just us and Him. Angels and God. And then He
dialog: created the humans. And He gave them more than He ever gave us. Our's was
dialog: designed to be a life of servitude and worship - adoration. But He gave the
dialog: humans more - He gave them a choice. They can choose to ignore God, choose
dialog: to acknowledge Him. All this time we've been down here, everyday I felt the
dialog: absence of the Divine presence. And it pained me... as I'm sure it must
dialog: have pained you sometimes, even though you'd gloss over it with jokes. But
dialog: we feel his absence, and why? Because of the way He made us -as servants.
dialog: Had we been given free will, we could ignore the pain... like them.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You know - maybe you should take a nap or something.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Loki, don't you get it? It's the humans - it's always the humans. They were
dialog: given paradise; they threw it away. They were given this planet; they
dialog: destroyed it. They were favored best among all His endeavors; and some of
dialog: them don't even believe He exists. Their ego-mania corroded Hell and made
text: it dark and crimson.
dialog: (looks at Loki)
dialog: I asked you to lay down your sword years ago - why?
dialog: Because I felt sorry for them. And where did it get us?
dialog: Thrown out.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: We've paid our debt. Don't you think it's time we went home? And to do
dialog: that, I think we have to dispatch our would-be dispatchers.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Wait, wait, wait - kill them?! You're talking about the Last Scion, for
dialog: Christ's sake! And what about Jay and Bob - I mean, those guys were
dialog: alright.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Don't, my friend. Don't let your sympathies get the best of you, as they
dialog: did me way back when. Scion or not, she's just a human. And regardless, our
dialog: sins are forgiven by passing through that arch. No harm, no foul.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: That sounds thin.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Fine. We'll cover ourselves. We'll take out a slew of people. Maybe amidst
dialog: the body count, He won't notice.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Oh, that's being realistic.
text: Bartleby reaches out and grabs Loki, slamming him against the wall.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I'm going home, Loki. And nobody - not even the Almighty Himself - is going
dialog: to make that otherwise.
text: Bartleby releases Loki and smiles. He exits. Loki watches him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Shit.
text: He follows.
scene_heading: EXT CAMP FIRE - NIGHT
text: Another Newspaper headline regarding 'John Doe Jersey' fills the frame. It
text: is lowered to reveal Jay, Bethany, and Rufus sitting around a makeshift
text: fire in the middle of nowhere. Jay rolls a joint. Silent Bob reads the
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I don't understand why we couldn't stay on the train. You threw those guys
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: A very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are, then don't be
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: And what's with that? Why are we enemies? The guy almost gutted me, for
dialog: God's sake!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: He had the knife at your throat. To gut you, he'd have to have the knife at
dialog: your stomach.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Semantics! Semantics that don't even answer mv question.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Well, I know I'd perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What do you mean, kill? I wasn't asked to kill them -just stop them from
dialog: going into that church.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: And how were you going to do that? Preoccupy them with a game of Bingo?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I've never killed anything before in my life!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Shut the fuck up, little man - you couldn't kill a pint of ice cream, let
dialog: alone an angel.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Fuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Oh yeah? How' would you do it?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I'd give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in 'Hard Target'. D'jou see that
dialog: flick?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (ignoring jay; to Bethany)
dialog: Killing an angel's a two-step process - first you have to cut off their
text: wings. which then makes them human. From that point on, it's the same as
dialog: killing anything else - head or heart, take your pick.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You say it as if it's easy.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (oblivious to Jay)
dialog: Problem is, I don't think we could pull it off even if we wanted to. All
dialog: this time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two weaker -
dialog: and those guys felt far from weak. Either that or someone's protecting them
dialog: - someone with juice.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So then we're screwed?
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Shit, that's the best news l've heard in days.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: This doesn't excuse you from tryng to stop them.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Count me out. You're telling me they're unstopable, I'm exhausted - both
dialog: psychologically and physically, the odds are against us. I say we kick back
dialog: and wait for the end -a little non~xistence might be just what the doctor
dialog: ordered.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I'm with her. I don't care about dying, so long as we're all going to die.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: What are you babbling about now?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: If I was the only one, that'd bother me because every-one else would go on
dialog: living, having a good time without me. But if we all go at once, that'd be
dialog: okay, because I know I'm not missing anything.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: See? You know it's right when even he's making sense.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Besides, she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die in
dialog: like five minutes, she'd have sex with me and Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: So you're suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and
dialog: history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: No. Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Now that we're all but in total agreement on this, I'd just like to finally
dialog: know - why me?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Because you've got nice tits.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I wasn't talking to you!
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: Why me? Why do I have to do this? Nobody's come
dialog: clean on that. Out of everyone on the whole god-damned planet. How come I
dialog: got tapped?
text: Rufus looks at her. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Family ties.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: That show's funny as hell.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: Do you know what the Apocryphal books are?
text: Bethany shakes her head no.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Most of that information in the Bible came from the Dead Sea Scrolls -
dialog: ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago. And when the Sanskrit was
dialog: translated, they discovered data that conflicted with the lore church
dialog: officials had already established as the basis of their religion. They
dialog: couldn't refute centuries of dogma, so they thought it best to leave
dialog: certain passages out - sometimes whole books. Those books make up the
dialog: Apocrypha.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What's this have to do with me?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: You've never gotten the complete picture. If they had compiled the material
dialog: together like they were supposed to, you'd get the whole story. But by
dialog: leaving text out, the church has presented you people with an extremely
text: sterile and unmoving account of religious history. The Creation. the entire
dialog: Old Testament, the history of Christ...
dialog: (let's her take it in)
dialog: Forget about my whole black angle for a minute...
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: We might if you'd quit bringing it up.
text: Rufus backhands Jay. Silent Bob holds jay back. Rufus continues, oblivous
dialog: to Jay.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
text: He goes from twelve years old to thirty. Whole volumes of text about the
dialog: eighteen year struggle with His Divine nature prior to His acceptance of it
text: were thown out, forever lost to the faithful.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I don't buy it. Integral material like that would give people a better
dialog: understanding of the nature of God. Why leave it out?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Because it was all closely tied in with His family.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: His mother and father?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: His brothers and sisters.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wait, wait, wait - Jesus didn't have any brothers or sisters. Mary was a
dialog: virgin - that's why it's called the Immaculate Conception.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Mary gave birth to Christ without having known a man's touch - that's true.
dialog: But she did have a husband. And do you really think he'd have stayed
dialog: married to her all those years if he wasn't getting laid? The nature of God
dialog: and the Virgin Birth - those are leaps of faith. But believing a wife never
dialog: humped her husband - that's just gullibility.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (sudden realization)
dialog: MARY AND JOSEPH HAD SEX?!?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: All the time, from what I understand. Jesus used to tell me stories about
dialog: hearing them through the walls when He was a kid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So you ask why you got tapped. I'll tell you why: a Christ was the
dialog: salvation of this world once before. And you're the closest thing to a
dialog: Christ that still walks.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: The blood that flows in your veins shares a chromosome or two at the
dialog: genetic level with the man you call Jesus.
dialog: (hand on her shoulder)
dialog: You're His great-grand-niece.
text: Bethany's jaw drops. A high-pitched squeak of a word escapes her lips.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (takes a hit from his joint)
dialog: So... that would make Bethany part black.
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Man, this is just like when Vader told Luke he was his father.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I just wish I knew what the hell we're supposed to do now?
speaker_heading: OC VOICE
dialog: You must go to the Dagobah system and find Yoda - the Jedi Master who
dialog: instructed me.
text: Everyone turns around. Metatron leans against a tree.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: God. l've always wanted to say that.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: The voice.
speaker_heading: NIETATRON
dialog: (mimicking his shock)
dialog: The Apostle!
dialog: (sits down with them)
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Now you show up! Where were you when that psychotic bastard had a knife to
dialog: my throat?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: I told you you'd be in capable hands - you're not dead are you?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: What are you doing here anyw'ay?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: I felt left out. Everyone's sitting around coming clean, I thought I'd join
dialog: in with a confession of mine own.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Now who's this mother fucker?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: This is the Voice of God - show some respect.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: The Voice of God? Where's the rest of Him?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Funny you should mention that - we're not sure.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Didn't it ever occur to you that this Bartleby/Loki situation was well
dialog: within the realm of His control?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: If that's the case, then why was Bethany tapped?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: You know those constitutionals He likes to take?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Constitutionals?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I think we're beyond euphemisms at this point.
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: God's a skee-ball fanatic.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Let's not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him, alright?
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game; been playing it for years -
text: He assumes a human form once a month and indulges. Doesn't tell anyone
dialog: where He's playing; just goes away for a couple of hours. It's quite
dialog: understandable - a small exercise in hand/eye coordination has been proven
dialog: as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation. And from what I
dialog: understand, He always gives his free points away to neighborhood children.
dialog: Isn't that sweet?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: But She hasn't come back from one of those day-trips, is what you're
dialog: getting at?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: 'She'? I take it she's met the Muse.
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: No, 'She' hasn't. And we've been unable to locate Her.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Maybe He was killed? Human form has that drawback.
speaker_heading: M ETAT RON
dialog: No - there's a different sort of foul-play afoot, children. Whomever has
text: set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite
dialog: well-hidden. is also responsible for the Lord's whereabouts. Were He to be
dialog: killed in human form, He'd have immediately returned to Paradise. Somebody
dialog: knew enough to keep the body alive, but incapacitate Him in another fashion
text: - He's trapped in a body.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: So God's not dead...
speaker_heading: JAY
text: He's brain dead.
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: So it would seem. And as omnipotent as we are above, I have to admit that
dialog: we're more or less lost without His presence. We've had our people looking
dialog: everywhere for Him. And I tapped her, because I thought we might be able to
dialog: smoke out whoever's behind this. But whoever it is has been clever enough
dialog: to send some lackeys after you, as opposed to showing up themselves.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Can it be Lucifer?
speaker_heading: METATRON
text: Thankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions. I
dialog: know they're not responsible - at least not Lucifer. If he was, he'd have
dialog: made his move by now to conquer Heaven. And I know he's not responsible for
dialog: Bartleby and Loki because he'd have just as much to lose by their return as
dialog: everyone else.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Then what about the Golgothan and the Triplets?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Don't be stupid - demons aren't exclusive to Hell. Anybody can summon one.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Yeah?
text: Silent Bob hands Jay his newspaper and points. Jay reads.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Don't encourage them. And why did you lie to me? You said I was tapped as a
dialog: test?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: No, you said that - I just didn't correct you. You were shocked enough -
dialog: how do you think you would've taken it if I told you the face of God
dialog: belonged on the back of a milk carton?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: So what do we do now?
speaker_heading: M ETAT RON
dialog: I say we get drunk, kids - because I'm all out of ideas.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (off paper)
dialog: Why don't we just ask this guy to close the church?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Here.
dialog: (hands group the paper)
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: 'Glick Takes Heat for Campaign'?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: It's the guy in charge of the church thing.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: 'Cardinal Glick has come under fire for the blatant pandering and
dialog: questionable direction of his church-sanctioned 'Catholicism - Wow!'
dialog: campaign. When asked about his motivations for decommisioning the
dialog: traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed Olympic sized
dialog: lap-pools beneath parish floors, Click responded "Come on - who doesn't
dialog: like a pool party?"
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Maybe you could tell him to shut down the church. If it's closed on that
dialog: day, those guys can't get blessed or whatever - right?
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: Good Lord - he's got a point.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I think Silent Bob had a point. But sure - we can go to him and explain the
dialog: situation somehow.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: 'We'? You're back in?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Well, mine is a heritage Divine... and I wouldn't want to let down the
dialog: family.
dialog: (smiles)
speaker_heading: METATRON
dialog: (off Silent Bob)
dialog: Well, well, well - the prophets finally live up to their titles.

speaker_heading: ALTAR I &amp; 2
speaker_heading: IT'S JESUS!
text: Jesus pulls a box of HOSTIES cereal from his sash.

speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (After a long beat)
dialog: Does it come in chocolate flavor?
text: The Cardinal picks up a golf putter and begins putting into an overturned
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: You see? Now this one's got vision!
dialog: (to Jay)
dialog: We're rolling out the flavors in September. Big cereal month with the kids,
dialog: back to school and all.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: It's a bit... startling.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: Exactly! And that's what we're looking to do - shake these people up a bit,
dialog: get them motivated. That's the whole point of the campaign. Mass attendance
dialog: is at an all-time low in this country. And it's not like we're losing them
dialog: to the Protestants or Baptists - people aren't practicing at any
dialog: denomination these days. If we can sell them some show - let 'em know the
dialog: Catholic church has some panache, we can win them back -even get some new
dialog: ones. Fill them pews, people - that's the key. And cross-promoting - like
text: with the cereal tie-in grabs the little ones as well. Hook 'em while
dialog: they're young.
text: (sits at his desk, lights smoke)
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Kind of like the tobacco industry?
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: Oh - if only we had their numbers. But we are aiming for the same
dialog: demographic, even though mine is the soulsaving biz. And if I have to play
dialog: a bit of the devil to bring them closer to the Lord, then I'll wear the
text: cloven hooves and carry the pitch fork.
text: Jay and Silent Bob adjourn themselves from the group and approach a hat
text: rack, where the Cardinal's CASSOCK and MITER hang. Jay nudges Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: OC BFTHANY
dialog: We really appreciate you seeing us this late in the day, your Emminence. My
dialog: friends and I have been traveling all night in hopes of getting a chance to

text: The Cardinal blows smoke rings.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: You'd like to help out in some way?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: We'd like you to cancel the ceremony and the re
dialog: dedication.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: (pauses mid-ash-tap)
dialog: I beg your pardon?
text: Silent Bob stands alone by the coat rack. Jay leaps into the frame, cassock
text: tied around his shoulder like a cape. He strikes a Superman pose.
speaker_heading: OC BETHANY
dialog: There's going to be a world of trouble if tomorrow's ceremony goes forward
dialog: as planned.
text: The Cardinal leans back in his chair.
speaker_heading: CLICK
dialog: What is this - a threat? Are you planning some sort of demonstation?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Are you pro-choicers?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: No, the trouble's not from us. It's from these renegade angels who've been
dialog: stuck on earth since the plagues...
text: Rufus side-kicks Bethany, nonchalantly.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Uh... these guys who think they're renegade angels.
speaker_heading: RUFL'S
dialog: See padre, it goes down like this - the boys believe that by passing
text: through the archway they can get to Heaven. Granted, it's far-fetched, but
text: the brothers are convinced it's the truth.
text: Silent Bob watches as the Miter appears slowly from behind the partition,
text: resembling a shark fin. It 'swims' to and fro, menacingly. Silent Bob
text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: OC GLICK
dialog: And you want me to call off the ceremony... for that?
text: Bethany leans forward in her seat.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Well. they're very passionate about it. Dangerously so. They could turn
text: violent if they walk through that arch and nothing happens.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: These guys could blow, and if they do, they're going to take some people
dialog: with them. Call this thing off.
speaker_heading: CLICK
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Who sent you? Someone from the Council of Churches, right? Somebody's upset
dialog: that we're getting so much publicity- is that it? Who was it? Rabbi Sloss?
speaker_heading: RLFLS
dialog: We were sent by Him who is called I Am.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: Cute.

dialog: Time to go. kids. Play time with the Cardinal is over.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: Worked for Moses.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Stay out of this.

dialog: Your Emminence, it's not a joke. These guys are an accident waiting to
dialog: happen. And if the re-edication ceremony goes on as planned...
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: ...then these loonies will show up and go nuts, thus endangering the lives
dialog: of all assembled, including the Governor, the press, me, the leaders of the
dialog: Council of Churches. Heck, let's not stop there, maybe even God Himself.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You can't say Himself; it could be a woman.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: (rubs temples)
dialog: Your passion for all topics insignificant, including the gender of our
dialog: almighty lord, tests my patience, people. Now I'm a very important man with
dialog: very important matters that demand my attention, so if you'll please...
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I'm telling you man. this ceremony is a mistake.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: The Catholic Church does not make mistakes.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: What about the church's silent consent to the slave trade?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: And it's platform of non-involvement during the Holocaust?
speaker_heading: CLICK
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Alright, those were mistakes. But one can hardly hold the current
dialog: incarnation of Holy Mother Church responsible for oversights of old. Now
dialog: I've indulged you for more time than I should have. Please go.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: But tomorrow...
speaker_heading: CLICK
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: Tomorrow goes off without a hitch! Do I make myself clear?! I did not labor
dialog: two years and exhaust eve~ ounce of my being to insure that this ceremony
dialog: be a cornerstone in the most important liturgical event since Vatican Two
dialog: just to cancel it at the zero hour at the insistence of a wandering band of
dialog: pranksters who've targeted me as the focus of their evening's merriment!
dialog: This occasion is important for the congregation of this parish, for the
dialog: massive crowds coming for the plenary indulgence, for me, for his Holiness
dialog: the Pope, and - most importantly - for the 'Catholicism - Wow!' campaign!
dialog: And neither you, nor any other influence short of the hand of God...
dialog: (glares at Bethany)
dialog: ... HIM -self will prevent it from occurring successfully!

dialog: ...onehour.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Alright Plato - sounds like you've had enough drinks already. Let's go.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Come on Barkeep - just one drink for the road. Then I'm gone.
text: Serendipity joins Bethany and Rufus. She whispers.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I was trying to find you - to tell you I'd figured out who was behind all
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Is that who I think it is?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: None other than.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: That's my worst suspicions confirmed.
text: The Bartender relents.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Alright - one drink. Then you're gone.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Gimme a Holy Bartender.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Never heard of it.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: He doesn't know how to make a Holy Bartender.
dialog: You know - don't you, Muse?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Azrael... don't.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: Anybody? Well - I know how to make a Holy Bartender.
text: Azrael pulls an Uzi from his coat and blows a dozen holes in the Bartender.
text: The Stygian Triplets burst through the doors and everyone jumps to their
text: feet, with the exception of the Bartender, who dies.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Get it?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Sweet Jesus, Azrael - why?!?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: (rushing him)
dialog: C'mon, demon - let's see you try that shit on a brother whose already dead!
text: The Stygian Triplets cross their sticks in front of Rufus to block him as
text: Azrael trains his Uzi on Bethany.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: (joining them)
dialog: You maintain that kind of an attitude and you and the barkeep won't be the
dialog: only corpses in the room -the Christ-Bitch will join you.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: I can't believe you're behind this. Are you really that stupid?! Do you
dialog: know what's going to happen if those two jerks enter that church?!
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: I'm actually counting on it. And if my calculations are correct, the pawns
dialog: are moving in to check-mate as we speak.
text: Everyone stares at Azrael, with the exception of Jay. He suddenly laughs.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I get it! Holy Bartender! That's a good one!
scene_heading: EXT SAINT MICHAEL'S CHURCH - MORNING
text: A formidable crowd of parishoners surrounds a small stage, ten yards from
text: the front of the church. Banners hang every~ere, heralding 'Catholicism -
text: Wow!' as well as the Centennial of Saint Michael's. The media eats it up.
text: Cardinal Glick stands at the podium, all smiles. He's in mid-speech.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: I'd also like to acknowledge this great state's Governor, Elizabeth Dalton,
dialog: for coming out an helping us ring in the first hundred years of this little
dialog: parish True. she's a Protestant - but we won't hold that against her.
dialog: (crowd laughs)
dialog: Now, let me just give you a bit of history on this particular little
dialog: hundred years young House of God...
speaker_heading: OC BARTLEBY
dialog: This is no longer God's House. God doesn't live here anymore.
text: The crowd turns, aghast. Bartleby pushes his way through them, sheepishly
dialog: followed by Loki.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: He's grown weary of your superficial faith and has turned a deaf ear to
dialog: your lip-service prayers. He is no longer amused, and has abandonned you -
text: His favorites - to the whim of judgement. Hypocrites and charlatans -
dialog: prepare to taste God's wrath!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Maybe we should just go.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: You wanted your body count, you got it. This lot is rife with sin. We'll
dialog: judge them all!
text: Glick grabs a COP from the crowd and pushes him toward the pair.
speaker_heading: CLICK
dialog: These are the two I was warned about, Officer McChee. Please assist them
text: off the church grounds.
text: The Cop grabs Bartleby's arm.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Alright mouthpiece, let's leave the nice Cardinal alone and go for a
dialog: ride...
text: Bartleby grabs the cops hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Mister McGhee, don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Is that so? Well, let's just...
text: Bartleby throws his other hand forward and twists the Cop's head around in
text: one brisk motion. Loki's eyes bug out. The crowd takes flight.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (releasing dead Cop)
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen - you have been judged as guilty of violations against
dialog: our Almighty Lord. And this very day - I assure you - you will all pay for
dialog: your tresspasses... in blood.
dialog: (to Loki)
dialog: Wings. Now.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I'm not so sure...
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
speaker_heading: DO IT!
speaker_heading: INT BAR - LATER
text: Azrael still hosts his captive audience, uzi trained on the mortals. The
text: Stygian Triplets surround them, brandishing their sticks.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You're a muse too?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
text: Former muse. He was kicked out.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Tell them, Serendipity. Tell them how I was slighted by the Almighty.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: You got what you deserved, you yellow shithead.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Ever the apple polisher. I'd hoped that when you left Paradise, you did it
dialog: finally because you couldn't tolerate the injustice that was visited upon
dialog: your own brother.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: He's your brother?!
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Not technically. We were created at the same time.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
text: To compliment one another. Two spirits of pure inspiration.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: So what happened?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Yes. What. Lucifer got restless and started his little war for the throne.
text: Heaven became divided into two factions - the faithful and the renegades.
text: The ethereal planes were chaotic with battle, angel against angel. And when
text: it was all over, Cod cast the rebels into perdition.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: But Azrael refused to fight. He wouldn't ally himself to God or Lucifer. He
text: remained in the middle, waiting to see who came out victorious.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What are you - some kind of fucking chicken?!
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: I was an artist! I was inspiration! A muse has no place in battle! Our job
dialog: is to create - not destroy!
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: So after the fallen were banished to Hell, God turned on those that
dialog: wouldn't fight, and my brother here was sent down with the demons.
dialog: Something he considers a grave injustice.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Don't tell me that you never questioned the judgement, Serendipity; that
dialog: you don't think the Almighty acted too rashly?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: You've been waiting for millions of years to ask me that, haven't you? It's
dialog: been on your mind since the moment you fell. It's been gnawing at you this
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: No, Azrael. It never bothered me, and I'll tell you why:
dialog: you stood behind your office, you prick. So you were an artist - big deal.
dialog: Elvis was an artist, but that didn't stop him from joining the service in
dialog: time of war. That's why he's the King... and you're a schmuck.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: So all this is about revenge?! You're going to unmake existence because you
dialog: have a grudge against God?!
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: After the first million years, revenge was the farthest thing from my mind.
dialog: Self-preservation became the only necessity.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Escape. Escape from Hell became my all-consuming reason. So I studied the
dialog: religions and waited for my opportunity to present itself; which flnallv
dialog: did. in the form of the plenary indulgence And while I couldn't exercise it
dialog: myself. I knew the perfect vessels through which I could free myself from
dialog: torment.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Bartleby and Loki.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: After that, it was a simple matter or waiting for a church to celebrate
dialog: their Centennial, and when that finally happened, applying some of the old
text: inspiration tactics - bv sending the pair an article laced with ideas. An
dialog: incantation I picked up in the Pit kept them cloaked and off Heaven's
text: radars, and aside from the Triplets and the Gologothan, no soul in Hell had
dialog: a clue as to what was going on.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Won't proud Lucifer weep when he realizes I triumphed over the Power in a
dialog: way he never dared or dreamed.
dialog: (shakes it off)
dialog: But no plan, no matter how intricate, could succeed if the Almighty was in
dialog: the realm of the quick. So I dispatched Him in a fairly ingenious fashion.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Oh no. I've seen way to many Bond movies to know that you never reveal all
dialog: the details of your plan - no matter how close you may think you are to
dialog: success. Suffice it to say, the Catholics have been even more helpful in
dialog: insuring my success than by just supplying the clean-slate archwav.
dialog: (gets up)
dialog: The only X-Factor was the involvement of the Last Scion. I'm amazed that
dialog: someone up there would have the balls to make a move without the Lord's
dialog: say-so. Believe me - I sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that
dialog: train. But alas, here you are - powerless to stop the inevitable.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Look, asshole - I don't know if anyone explained the rules to you, but if
dialog: you succeed, everything gets blinked out of existence - even you.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Human, have you ever been to Hell? I think not. Do you know that once Hell
dialog: was nothing more than the absence of Cod? And if you'd ever been in His
dialog: presence. then you'd realize that's punishment enough. But then your kind
dialog: came along - and made it so much worse.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Humans aren't capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon like
dialog: yourself is.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Evil is an abstract; it's a human construct. But true to his irresponsible
dialog: nature. man won t own up to being the engineer of evil, so he blames his
dialog: dark deeds on my ilk. But his selfishness is limitless, and it's not enough
dialog: for him to shadow his own existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt -
dialog: fire, wailing, darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to get
dialog: out of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is
dialog: beyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you
dialog: commit. No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a
dialog: foundless belief that God could never forgive your 'grievous offenses'. So
dialog: you bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horrid
text: imaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the sickness
dialog: that has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there,
text: begging to be 'punished'. And in doing so, they've transformed the cold and
dialog: solitude to pain and misery. I've spent eons privy to the flames, inhaling
dialog: the decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I know what effect such horrors
text: have on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Would you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look...
text: Azrael places his hand over Bethany's eyes. For about ten seconds, we see
text: some of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed into
text: 240 frames of film.
text: Azrael pulls his hand away. Bethany is fried, convulsing uncontrolably.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: I'd rather not exist than go back to that. And if everyone has to go down
dialog: with me, so be it.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (holding up Bethany)
dialog: You're still thinking only about yourself, you fuckmg child.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Now, now, now. Things are getting too tense in here. What say we watch a
dialog: little t.v.
dialog: (grabs remote control)
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Put on channel nine - 'Davey and Goliath'!
text: A Stygian Triplet smacks him with it's hockey stick.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: I was thinking more along the lines of current events.
text: On the T.V. - a sweaty and panicked REPORTER barks into the camera,
text: obscuring the chaos behind him. Screams are heard.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: ...I repeat - men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to St.
text: Michael's... Bullets don't seem to affect them... police who were on the
text: scene are dead... The remaining crowd has dropped to their knees,
dialog: identifying this as the fabled Apocalypse.. I'm not a man of faith, but I'm
dialog: inclined to agree with them..
dialog: (looking OC)
dialog: NO! DON'T COME ANY CLOSER!!
dialog: (pulls gun)
dialog: PLEASE!! Please...
text: He puts the gun in his mouth and fires. The screen goes blank.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: (snapping off tv.)
dialog: You see that? And I told them to keep a low profile. I'd be pissed, but in
dialog: a couple of minutes, it won't matter anymore.
text: While he speaks, Serendipity looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob snaps to
text: attention, and locks eyes with Serendipity. He looks to the golf club, then
text: back at her. He nods.
text: Azrael suddenly catches the exchange between the two.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Now what was that all about?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Hunhh? Oh. nothing. I had something in my eye.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Bullshit. What are you trying to do, Serendipity -get the guy killed? Now
dialog: who's the fucking child? What did you tell him - to hit me with the golf
dialog: club? Are you serious?
dialog: (picks up golf club)
dialog: I'm a fucking demon, and you'd have him assault me with athletic equipment?
dialog: (hands club to Silent Bob)
dialog: Well, here then - take it. Call it a gift.
text: (stands back and hits his own chest)
dialog: Take a shot - take your best shot. C'mon - c'mon, bright boy.
text: The Stygian Triplets snicker. Silent Bob stares at Azrael, perplexed.
speaker_heading: AZRAEL
dialog: Don't you know anything?
text: Silent Bob looks to Serendipity. She nods. He shrugs and swings the club
text: with all his might into Azrael's chest - which caves in, blowing muck and
dialog: shit everywhere.
text: Rufus, Jay, and Serendipity turn on their captors, grabbing the Stygian
text: Triplets by the throats.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: BETHANY! BLESS THE SINK!
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: WHAT?!?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
speaker_heading: DO IT!
text: Bethany leaps over the bar, pushing over the dead bartender, and blesses
text: the melting-ice filled sink. Serendipity urges Rufus and Jay to follow her,
text: with the Triplets in hand. They submerge them - head first - in the sink.
text: Cruddy steam and muck blows out of the water. The Triplets convulse and
dialog: fall still.
text: Azrael clutches at his sucking chest wound, dropping to his knees. He grabs
text: Silent Bob's leg. Silent Bob kicks him onto his back and out cold.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (joining Silent Bob)
dialog: What the fuck have you been eating?
text: Silent Bob shrugs.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What just happened?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: (collecting hockey sticks)
dialog: He said it himself - he's a demon. You hit a demon with an instrument of
dialog: God - the pure side's always going to do the most damage.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Silent Bob's an instrument of God?!
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: No - but the driver is.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: And Glick's the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a better
dialog: game. And the sink...?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: You've got that Divine heritage going for you - sanctifing is just one of
dialog: the fringe benefits.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing at my next party.
dialog: (to Jay)
dialog: How far away is this church?
speaker_heading: JAY
text: Three towns over - about five miles.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: We've gotta make tracks, people - there isn't much time left. Rufus, grab
dialog: his gun.
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Ten steps ahead of you.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (going through dead bartender's pockets)
dialog: We can take the bartender's car - I don't think he'll be needing it
dialog: anymore.
text: Bethany and Serendipity rush out.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: We gonna make it?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: Was Jesus down?
text: Rufus and Jay exit. Silent Bob stares down at Azrael's body. Jay comes back
text: and yanks him out the door.
scene_heading: EXT STREET - DAY
text: Cardinal Click runs to a pay phone. Sweating and bloody, he looks a mess.
text: He presses '0' and looks around wildly - particularly skyward.
speaker_heading: GLICK
dialog: (to God)
dialog: Look, if you didn't like the cereal thing, we could've gone in a different
dialog: direction!
dialog: (to phone)
scene_heading: OPERATOR! SEND MORE POLICE TO SAINT MICHAEL'S PARISH - NOW!! PEOPLE ARE
dialog: GETTING KILLED BY...!
text: As he speaks, a large shadow falls over him from above. It grows larger,
text: enveloping Click. He drops the receiver, drops to his knees, and screams.
scene_heading: EXT SAINT MICHAEL'S - DAY
text: Bethany, Jay, Serendipity, Silent Bob, and Rufus stare OC, horrified.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Holy shit.
text: Bodies, bodies everywhere - partial, whole, bloody - hanging, burning,
text: upended. No one is left standing. It's a scene straight out of Hell.
text: Bethany buries her face in Rufus' chest.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: See? And people wonder why I don't go to church.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Are we too late?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: To save these poor schmucks, yes. But we still exist.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
text: They could already be in the church.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Which means that if they come out, nobody touches them.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Are you shitting me? The brother here is going to shred them with his
dialog: Schwarzenneger special - ain't you, homey?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: If they've passed through that arch, they come out clean. And if they die,
dialog: they go straight up - and we know what happens then.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What if they just kill themselves?
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: They can't - it's a mortal sin. You die with a mortal sin on your soul and
dialog: you burn. They'd go to hell, and that's not what they're after.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: So then what the fuck are we supposed to do?! Just wait for a solution to
dialog: fall out of the sky?!
text: On cue, a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before the
dialog: group, quite like Rufus had, way back at the start. This body, however,
text: bursts apart like a body would if dropped from a large height. Jay looks at
dialog: Rufus.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Friend of your's?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: 'fraid not.
speaker_heading: OC VOICE
dialog: It was a Cardinal.
text: They all turn to see Loki, leaning against a body or two, drinking from a
text: bottle of champagne. His wings lie beside him, filthy - blood spattered and
text: ashen. He looks exhausted. Rufus trains the gun on him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Kind of hard to tell with his face like that, but the Rosaries are a dead
dialog: giveaway.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (goes for the Uzi)
dialog: IT'S ONE OF THEM!! KILL IT!!!
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (struggling to stop him)
dialog: NO...!
text: She slaps the Uzi out of Jay's grip. It clatters to the side.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (to Jay)
dialog: Don't you listen?! We can't touch them!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I wasn't gonna touch him, I was gonna shoot him!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (looking skyward)
dialog: He's been at it for awhile now.
text: In the distance above - a mere shadow against the sky - something winged
text: soars and stops, releasing what looks like a very panicky human being.
speaker_heading: OC LOKI
dialog: We ran out of parishoners, so he just started picking up anyone off the
dialog: street. You're looking at eons of repression getting purged. If only we'd
dialog: been able to jerk off.
text: Loki drags himself a few feet backwards.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I'd step back if I were you.
text: They jump back just as the body hits the ground and explodes. Bethany
text: charges at Loki, grabs his lapels, and shakes him furiously.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
text: WHY?!? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU HOPE TO PROVE?!? ALL THESE PEOPLE - WHY?!?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Rufus)
dialog: I thought we weren't supposed to touch them?
speaker_heading: RUFUS
dialog: I think our Bethan's about hit her ceiling.
text: Loki slaps Bethany away, non-chalantly.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: This wasn't my idea. alright? I just wanted to go home.
dialog: (takes a big champagne swig)
dialog: We both wanted to go home. But he snapped. When he realized who you were
dialog: and what you'd have to do, he just lost it.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You know what's funny about it? He never could stand to see me work. He
dialog: said he always felt son~' for you people - that you didn't know any better.
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Now look at him.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: This guy's drunker than hell.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
text: Which means he's human now - his wings have been cut off.
dialog: (slapping Loki to sober him up)
dialog: Loki! Loki!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (recognizing her)
dialog: The Muse. Haven't seen you in a long time. What's with the tits?
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Loki - have you walked through the arch yet? C'mon. tell me! Have you gone
dialog: in and come out through the archway yet?!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: No.
text: Bartleby lands beside them, draping his wings at his sides, brushing
dialog: himself off.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: We were awaiting your arrival.
speaker_heading: SERENDIPITY
dialog: Bartleby - listen to me! You can't go through with this! Azrael was just
dialog: using you! If you go back this way...
text: Bartleby slaps her down.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: I've become aware of the reprocussions, Muse. I know what I'm doing.
text: Bethany leaps at him, all fists and fury.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
text: YOU FUCK! YOU SICK, TWISTED FUCK!! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!! LOOK AT All
dialog: you've
dialog: done...!
text: Bartleby subdues her. He strokes her hair.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: Bethany - you of all people should understand what I'm t~'ing to accomplish
dialog: here. You too have been abandonned. You know what it's like to be cast
dialog: aside. But while you've only felt the devastating effects for a few years,
dialog: I've dealt with it for millenia. And while you never see your ex-husband or
dialog: how blissful he is with his new wife...
text: (picks up her face and smiles at her)
dialog: And he is...
dialog: (drops her head)
dialog: ..seeing you people everywhere. everyday, trapped on this perfect little
dialog: world He created for you... it's a constant reminder that though my kind
dialog: came first, your kind was most revered. And your kind knows forgiveness,
dialog: while my kind knows regret. A lesson must be taught. All are accountable...
dialog: even God.
dialog: (steps back)
text: Soon a cadre of police will arrive, just in time to kill us as we exit the
dialog: church. And then this failed experiment called existence will cease to be.
text: Loki stumbles to his feet.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I can't... let you do this, Bartleby...
dialog: (he sways as if drunk)
dialog: I didn't know we... would end existence...
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: (to Bethany)
dialog: My compatriot. Genocide takes a lot out of him. He's weakened. And more
text: importantly. he's now a human being. A condition that carries two
dialog: liabilities: a conscience...
text: Bartleby pulls a knife and guts Loki. He stares at Bartleby as he dies,
text: confused and betrayed. Serendipity nods to Rufus and Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: BARTLEBY
dialog: ..and a short life span.
dialog: (in a whisper; to Loki)
dialog: Sorry, old friend - but you lost the faith.
text: Rufus and Serendipity and Silent Bob jump Bartleby and start throwing
text: punches. Silent Bob bites his wing. Jay grabs Bethany and pulls her behind
text: a bush.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (peering out from behind)
dialog: He's lost it! We're fucked! We're absolutely fucked!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (pulling off clothes)
dialog: I hear you.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: I can't believe this shit! We're on the brink of nonexistence and God's
dialog: still nowhere to be found! What the fuck kind of deity gets kidnapped?!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (pulling open pants)
dialog: Amen to that.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (suddenly notices him)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I'd say we've got about five minutes left to live; the whole world's going
dialog: to end. You said you'd fuck me.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: Are you a complete lunatic?! Everyone's out there battling that thing and
dialog: you want to cower back here and jump my bones?! We have to go down
dialog: fighting!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: No - no time for that foreplay stuff, just sex.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You pig...!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What?! It's all over; nobody's gonna beat that thing! Now we can either lay
dialog: here all comatose like that
dialog: John Doe Jersey bastard behind us, or we can make with the love.
text: Bethany freezes.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (finally!)
dialog: What did you say?!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: 'Make with the love'? I just said that to be sensitive. Usually I call it
dialog: boning.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: No - about John Doe Jersey?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: That guy - the one that they won't take off life support - John Doe Jersey.
dialog: This is where he's at.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: What? Where?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Saint Michael's hospital - over there.
dialog: (points behind them)
text: There, across the street, sits a HOSPITAL.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Where's the nearest boardwalk?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Look, I ain't got time to win you a prize or something, we gotta get to it
dialog: before...
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: WHERE IS IT?!?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (scared)
text: Asbury Park. About five miles away.
speaker_heading: BETHANY
dialog: You ever been there?!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (really scared)
dialog: Once. I was banging this girl who worked at the carousel. She wanted to do
dialog: it on the ride, but I got sick and started puking...
