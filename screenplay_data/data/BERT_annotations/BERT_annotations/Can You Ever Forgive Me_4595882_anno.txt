scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK CITY PRE-WAR APARTMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: 1
text: Mostly darkness in the small apartment, a few table lamps
text: illuminating a comfortable, crowded well worn space. On one
text: shelf, souvenirs from a past life: a framed NY Times Best
dialog: Seller list from 1980 with Kilgallen by Lee Israel
text: highlighted in the number 15 spot. Five or six copies of this
dialog: book, and a similar number of Miss Tallulah Bankhead (also by
dialog: Lee) and many more of Estee Lauder by Lee Israel line a
text: shelf. It’s a bit of a trophy case.
text: Across the room, a well worn cat tree sits in the corner,
text: piles of New Yorkers, and LEE ISREAL, around 50 and not
text: trying very hard, is asleep in her clothes on the couch. A
text: Blossom Dearie record spins on the record player, a cat
text: snoozes in her lap. Both snore. An alarm beeps on Lee’s casio
text: digital watch. Finally, she rouses. She looks down at her
text: watch which reads 10pm, and stops the alarm.
text: She moves to the kitchen, responding slightly to the music.
text: We imagine she may be getting ready for bed. She puts her a
text: plate in the sink, and returns. She downs her water from the
text: table and puts the glass into her purse. She takes a bottle
text: of scotch and also puts it into her purse. She turns off the
text: light, but then the front door opens, hall-light pouring in,
text: and we see Lee exit. The door slams shut.

scene_heading: INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
text: Nondescript cubicles and the nondescript people who are
dialog: working in them. It is the graveyard shift and the YOUNG
text: EMPLOYEES are proofreading and black-lining law documents.
text: The large room is eerily silent save for the scratching of
text: pencils on paper and the sound of ICE CLINKING in a glass.
text: Lee is working as well, drinking a scotch on the rocks. She
text: swirls it around absentmindedly as she works without
dialog: enthusiasm.
text: TWO YOUNG WOMEN pass by her cubicle.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Fucking kill me if I’m doing this at her

speaker_heading: ANOTHER CUBICLE WORKER

scene_heading: INT. CORNER MARKET - VERY EARLY MORNING

text: years of stacked up New Yorker magazines. The small one
dialog: bedroom apartment hasn’t been updated in at least 20 years:
text: paint is chipping, furniture is worn and scratched by
dialog: multiple cats, even the light bulbs need dusting. But you can

speaker_heading: A154
text: Lee lies in bed, staring up at the fan. She isn’t filled with
text: anxiety anymore. She is numb. She is lifeless, replaying
text: Elaine’s words in her head. She pulls out Anna’s short story
text: and begins to read.
dialog: 154
scene_heading: EXT. TWELVETREES BOOK SHOP - DAY
dialog: 154
text: Lee walks past Anna’s bookshop. She sees Anna inside, talking
text: to a customer. She knows she can’t go in. She stops and
text: watches though. Suddenly Anna looks up and the two women make
dialog: eye contact.
text: Anna breaks it and when she looks back up, Lee is gone.
text: Sadly, Lee walks away.

scene_heading: INT. JULIUS’ BAR - AFTERNOON - SOME MONTHS LATER
dialog: 157
text: Lee sits at a table - she doesn’t look good but she doesn’t
text: look bad either. Craig brings her a scotch.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Haven’t seen your face in here in a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yeah well, I’m only allowed to leave the
dialog: house for my AA meetings.
text: Craig walks away shaking his head. Suddenly the door opens
text: and Jack comes in. He sees Lee, approaches her table. Is this
text: a coincidence? Jack looks a little thin, and walks with a
text: crutch, babying one foot.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT’D)
dialog: Thanks for coming.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: It was quite inconvenient. I had to move
dialog: around some meetings, but I had my
dialog: assistant cancel my afternoon.
text: Lee smirks. It’s kind of Jack to make this easier.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Can I get you a drink? I’m buying. I’ve
dialog: started counterfeiting money now.
text: She smirks, this tickles Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not today.
dialog: (off Lee’s surprise)
dialog: It’s my new meds. Throwing my whole
text: system off. Gin tastes like mouthwash.
dialog: Takes the fun out of it.
text: Lee is concerned, but doesn’t press.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I guess you were able to cut a deal?
dialog: Ratting on me worked out?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Three years probation.
speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No, I’m at an AA meeting on 10th street.
text: Jack laughs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Criminals at large!
dialog: (then)
dialog: I couldn’t imagine what was so important
dialog: that Lee Israel swallowed her pride and
dialog: asked me to meet her. So spit it out.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I’m reconsidering.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh just tell me.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Well... I’ve been thinking about writing
dialog: a new book. About what happened. About
dialog: what I did. And about you, if you’ll let
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Like hell I will! What would my boyfriend
dialog: think if he knew about my shadier
dialog: dealings?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Do our crimes even count in your top ten
dialog: of shady dealings? I doubt it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fair enough. But I don’t want a book out
dialog: there about me. I’m a very private
dialog: person.
text: Lee is quiet.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I have to do something. I have to write
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Brice? No. I think for once I would like
dialog: to write about one Lee Isreal. As
dialog: terrifying as that sounds.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I’m still mad at you, you know. You
dialog: treated me like shit. I don’t think
dialog: you’re a very nice person.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I would agree with you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But I suppose you may be mad at me as
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: If you didn’t look quite so decrepit, I
dialog: would be.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yes, well. I guess it’s not some huge
dialog: plot twist. It was going to catch up to
dialog: me eventually.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You have fucked your way through
dialog: Manhattan.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I would like that on my tombstone.
text: They share a morbid laugh.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT’D)
dialog: With the addition of: but he steered
dialog: clear of the boroughs.
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: After a beat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Will you make me 29? And with perfect
dialog: skin? And don’t make me sound stupid?

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I’ve already written five chapters.
text: Jack laughs.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT’D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Lee reaches out and touches Jack’s hand. This lingers for
text: just a moment and then Jack stands, breaking it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I’m late for a board meeting. My driver
text: is waiting. The life of a millionaire.
text: They both smile, going with the bit. Jack starts toward the
text: door. Crossing in front of Lee. Lee stifles a little laugh.
text: Jack looks back...
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT’D)
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No... I was so tempted to trip you, just
dialog: now.
text: Jack laughs, against his better judgement.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wow, you’re ... a horrid cunt, Lee.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: So are you, Jack.
dialog: Good luck.
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: LEE

scene_heading: EXT. STREET/LAST BOOKSTORE - DAY
dialog: 160
text: Lee walks down the street and backtracks, having seen
text: something in a bookstore window that has caught her eye. It’s
text: a mounted letter from Dorothy Parker. One that Lee has
dialog: written.
dialog: 161
scene_heading: INT. RENWICK & CO. RARE BOOKS - DAY
dialog: 161
text: Lee addresses the bookseller.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: My friend’s birthday is coming up and
dialog: he’d love to own that Dorothy Parker in
dialog: the window.
speaker_heading: BOOKSELLER
dialog: She’s a beauty, isn’t she?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Can I ask how much a letter like that
dialog: runs?
speaker_heading: BOOKSELLER
dialog: We’re asking nineteen hundred, framed and
text: matted, and she comes complete with a
dialog: letter of authenticity.
text: Lee’s eyes widen.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Does the letter of authenticity come with
dialog: a letter of authenticity?
speaker_heading: BOOKSELLER
dialog: Oh, I can assure you. It’s the real
dialog: thing. No one can write like Ms. Parker
dialog: could. Not before and not since.

scene_heading: INT. LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 162
text: Lee sits at her old typewriter (the one she already owned),
dialog: and writes.
speaker_heading: LEE’S VOICE
dialog: My dear sir, I offer my droopy
dialog: salutations from the Great Beyond. I
dialog: understand that you’re selling my
dialog: personal letters to the tune of nearly
dialog: two grand. To think poor Lee Israel
dialog: received a tiny fraction of that sum when
dialog: she sold them to someone, who then sold
dialog: them to you.
dialog: 163
scene_heading: EXT. RENWICK & CO. RARE BOOKS - DAY
dialog: 163
text: We see the man through the front window, reading this letter.
text: He looks into the distance, considering. Disturbed, he moves
text: to the shop window.
speaker_heading: LEE’S VOICE
dialog: I dearly hope this letter will not affect
dialog: the selling price of your valuable
dialog: artifact. As I most famously muttered
dialog: mere moments after my cremation:
dialog: “Darling, excuse my dust.”
dialog: Yours,
dialog: Dorothy Parker.
text: The bookseller removes the letter from the window display.
text: And then decides to put it back.
