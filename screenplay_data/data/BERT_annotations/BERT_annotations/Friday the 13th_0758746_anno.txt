scene_heading: 4 EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY

dialog: 
text: BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
text: behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
text: and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
text: cow eyes. In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
dialog: an Everly Brothers hit.
dialog: 
text: BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get. He is not

speaker_heading: CLAUDETTE
dialog: We've got to talk.
dialog:

scene_heading: 7 EXT. FOREST - DAY
dialog: 
text: The TRACK goes SILENT.
dialog:

text: walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go. He leaves
text: the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
text: CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I care very much.
dialog: 
text: He puts an arm around her and draws her close. They kiss.
text: They separate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAUDETTE
dialog: Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
dialog: 
text: BARRY decides to be politic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I wouldn't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAUDETTE
dialog: Oh, you...
dialog: 
text: She kisses him and they are locked.
dialog: 
text: A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
dialog: 
text: The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE: Just beyond the thicket of
text: lacy vines. It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
text: impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
text: another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
text: Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
dialog: 
text: This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
dialog: 
text: BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
text: breast. She reaches up to take his hand away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Claudette...
speaker_heading: CLAUDETTE
dialog: Somebody'll see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: No, they won't...
dialog: 
text: He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
text: that part of her bra is exposed. He seals her protesting lips
text: by kissing her.
dialog: 
text: From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
text: A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
text: the field of vision. A branch pops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAUDETTE
dialog: (in a thick whisper)
dialog: Somebody's there, Barry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of
dialog: stone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLAUDETTE
dialog: Let's go back, Barry...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I need you so much, Claudette.
dialog: 
text: BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra. They kiss again,
text: passionately.
dialog: 
text: The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
text: foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
text: the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
dialog: 
text: Closer. The THEME has snuck in. It becomes discordant. It
text: swells. Closer.
dialog: 
text: QUICK CUT to BARRY &amp; CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
text: perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
dialog: 
text: A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
dialog: blow.
dialog: 
text: The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY. The PROWLER's powerful hand has him
text: by the throat. He backpeddles, trying to get away.
dialog: 
text: ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
dialog: 
text: A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.
text: BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist. The knife falls to
text: the mossy floor of the clearing.
dialog: 
text: Two hands go for the free blade. BARRY's hand has it.
dialog: 
text: There is a confused jumble of struggle.
dialog: 
text: Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
dialog: 
text: REACTION SHOT: BARRY, horrified by the sight.
dialog: 
text: The PROWLER's hand has the knife. It moves quickly forward.
text: We can hear the blade strike.
dialog: 
text: BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
dialog: 
text: MCU the moss where the finger fell. The PROWLER reaches into
text: FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
dialog: 
text: QUICK CUT TO: CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors.
text: She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her
text: temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror. The MUSIC
text: has stopped abruptly.
dialog: 
text: THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE.
dialog: 
text: It is completely SILENT.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 8 TITLE SEQUENCE
dialog: 
text: The screen is completely black. A small white shape starts to
text: ZOOMS towards the FG. The shape becomes a three-dimensional
text: rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH. Just as it gets to its final
text: position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane
text: of glass. There is a loud crash. The logo shifts to the upper
text: left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
dialog: 
text: The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Hiya! I'm headed for Camp Crystal Lake.

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I can't remember being this excited

dialog: than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.
dialog: 
text: BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter
text: and heads for a tripod in the middle distance. There are

text: The targets are heavy. This isn't an easy one-person job.
dialog: 
text: The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets
text: closer to setting up the target.
dialog: 
text: In MCU, she lifts a target up. Her head is very close to the
text: face of the target. She gets it up, lets the tripod take the
text: weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow
text: streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by
dialog: eighteen inches.
dialog: 
text: BRENDA whips around.
dialog: 
text: WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES: a very cocky NED, standing by the lean-

dialog: 
text: In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet. The snake
text: is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
dialog: 
text: ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
dialog: been since we met her.
dialog: 
text: The room is small. There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
text: dresser with a cloudy mirror on top. The walls are a light
text: blue, freshly painted. The wall on the inside does not go all
text: the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
text: in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
dialog: 
text: ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
text: she sees. She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
text: sexier. She smiles at herself.
dialog: 
text: She reaches out in CU. Open a drawer. Takes out a towel.
dialog: 
text: ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker. Bends down and opens
text: it up. Takes out a terrycloth robe.
dialog:

text: hair fall down.
dialog: 
text: She hums. Opens her top drawer. Nothing there.
dialog: 
text: Opens the next drawer. Nothing there.
dialog: 
text: Opens the next drawer. Nothing there.
dialog: 
text: ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes! It flails
dialog: at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
text: as having a Navajo bracelet on it. The snake strikes the
text: bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free. The snake
text: falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
dialog: 
text: There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.

speaker_heading: at ALICE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (a tight whisper)
dialog: There's a fucking snake in here.
text: BILL sees it. He freezes, then takes a step forward.
text: Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the
text: machete, cutting the snake into two pieces. Blood spurts onto
dialog: the floor.
dialog: 
text: MARCIE and JACK enter. JACK carries a shovel as a weapon.
text: MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further
text: to see the blood and guts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCIE
dialog: Steve never mentioned serpents. Jack,
dialog: would you get some paper towels?
dialog: 
text: JACK nods and exits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: How the... did he get in there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
text: Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of

speaker_heading: MARCIE
dialog: Thanks.

speaker_heading: BILL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCIE
dialog: Go ahead. I walk on 'em all the time.

dialog: Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?

dialog: 
text: The CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to look over her shoulder.
dialog: 
text: The window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but

dialog: 
text: CUT AWAY to see ALICE using her dishcloth to clear the glass.

dialog: Now ya' close the switch.
dialog: 
text: CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal

text: perfect connection running through his body. There is a
text: sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
text: screams, the generator chugs roughly. Hundreds of volts are
text: streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
dialog: shoes.
dialog: 
text: BILL reacts quickly: knowing better than to touch him and
text: continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
text: at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks.

speaker_heading: BILL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Is it stuck?
dialog:

dialog: 
text: The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have

dialog: 
text: As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see

dialog: 
text: ANOTHER ANGLE: JACK and MARCIE lie completely still beneath

speaker_heading: MARCIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sucker's locked. Who's got the key?
dialog: 
text: ALICE ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and

text: through one of the window panes. She puts her arm through the
text: broken glass, unlocks the door and enters. BILL follows.
dialog: 
text: The CAMERA continues to watch them from outside the cabin.
text: They turn on a light and cross to a phone on Steve Christy's

dialog: It's dead. Try the pay phone.

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Do you have a dime? A quarter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No. There must be some in the desk
dialog: somewhere.
dialog: 
text: They fumble through the desk to find some change. BILL finds
text: some in the postage drawer. He then crosses over to a pay
text: phone mounted on the wall. The CAMERA moves to the cornice of
text: the building where the phone line exits. It follows the link
text: up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Bill?

text: thing she can. She takes the weapon by the barrel and,
text: swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the
text: arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.
dialog: 
text: MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and
text: drops to the floor.
text: ALICE runs out the door.

dialog: 
text: ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the

scene_heading: 134 INT. LARDER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices.
text: ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type
text: which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
dialog: 
text: ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
dialog: 
text: As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam.
text: Then we hear some shuffling around outside. The lights are
dialog: turned on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON (V.O.)
dialog: Please kill her, mommy... Help me,
dialog: please. Kill her, mommy.
dialog: 
text: There is the sound of pots being rustled through. Then the
text: sound of another door being slammed.
dialog: 
text: ALICE relaxes again.
dialog: 
text: Then there is a silence. ALICE thinks about unlocking the door
text: now. She reaches out for the lock. Then thinks better of the
dialog: idea.
dialog: 
text: She cases down the door frame to the floor. On all sides are
text: the cans of food and cooking implements. There is a large
dialog: skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
dialog: 
text: ALICE covers her head with her arms.
text: The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
text: slowly. We see it, but she does not. MRS. VOORHEES' hand
text: finishes turning and now starts to push gently. There is
text: almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
dialog: 
text: The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON (O.S.)
dialog: Come out, come out, wherever you are...
dialog: 
text: ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
dialog: room.
dialog: 
text: Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Please...
dialog: 
text: ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
dialog: 
text: The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
dialog: 
text: The silence is interrupted by a new sound: MRS. VOORHEES has
text: begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
text: door to the larder.
dialog: 
text: REACTION SHOT: ALICE... oh, my God...
dialog: 
text: At first we see nothing on our side. Then, gradually, we see
text: little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops. ALICE's
text: eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
dialog: anything...
dialog: 
text: Larger holes are now made. MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
text: to take a peck inside. We can see her eye at the largest hole.
text: She goes back to whacking away at the door. The hole is near
text: the lock. It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
text: inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
dialog: 
text: ALICE realizes she must defend herself. She reaches down and
text: picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
text: her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
text: come through the entrance.
dialog: 
text: MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete. ALICE fends off the
text: blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
text: head. As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
text: able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
text: a solid blow on top of her head. MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
text: sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
dialog: floor.
text: ALICE raises the skillet again to strike. She crosses
text: carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
text: the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
dialog: 
text: ANOTHER ANGLE: MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert. There is a
text: small puddle of blood under her head.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON ALICE: She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
text: slowly out of the room.

text: up, foraging for food.
dialog: 
text: As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky

scene_heading: 138 EXT. LAKE - DAWN
dialog: 
text: ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping. She has not
text: changed her position since collapsing a few hours before. The
text: water laps gently against the side of the canoe. Very slowly,
text: she wakes. She opens her eyes.
dialog: 
text: The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
text: boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.
text: They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun. The canoe
text: rocks gently. ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
text: lapping water.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
text: and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
text: VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
text: barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
dialog: 
text: The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
text: try to find their footing in the shallow water. MRS. VOORHEES
text: is covered in mud and blood. She sees ALICE struggling to get
text: up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
text: ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming. ALICE grabs a paddle
text: floating near her.
dialog: 
text: MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
text: waist-high water as fast as she can. She screams with rage.
text: Her face goes through a horrifying transformation. From her
text: mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON (Lipsync)
dialog: Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
dialog: 
text: ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
text: who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
text: ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
text: to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
text: using it like a staff to ward off the blow. The machete cuts
text: the paddle nearly in half. MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
text: another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
text: throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water. The machete flies out
text: of her hand and lands in the water. The two women roll in the
text: water. MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
text: stretching to reach around her throat. They roll over and
text: under the water. We cannot see who is winning.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
text: for ALICE. She is screeching madly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON (Lipsync)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Kill her, mommy! Kill her, mommy!
dialog: 
text: ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
text: one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
text: off into the water.
dialog: 
text: The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
dialog: 
text: ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
dialog: shore.

dialog: that says "State Department of Health and Safety". There are
