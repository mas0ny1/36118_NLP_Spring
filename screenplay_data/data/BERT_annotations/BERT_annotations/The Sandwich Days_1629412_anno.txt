scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM - FLASHBACK - MORNING
text: Several fifth graders talk among each other before the beginning
text: of class. The sound is muffled. YOUNG BILLIAM (11) does not talk
text: and looks lonely at his desk. He draws on some paper being quite
text: pleased with his work. Some children accidently push a desk
text: against his causing his pencil to move upwards. His picture is
text: ruined with a long straight line in the middle. His little,
text: personal world is disrupted with the bang causing the muffled
text: talking around him turn instantly clear.
text: MRS. ZIMMERMAN stands at the front of the class taking
dialog: attendance.
scene_heading: MRS. ZIMMERMAN
dialog: Okay, everybody settle down now.
dialog: It may be the first day in class, and
dialog: I know we’re all excited here. Let’s see
dialog: if I can learn your names as I take role.
text: The fifth graders quiet down while the standing children sit

dialog: Billiam Williams?
text: No one knows who YOUNG BILLIAM is but do notice someone sinking

text: it amusing while lightly jokes to his peers. MRS. ZIMMERMAN
text: looks around.
speaker_heading: MRS. ZIMMERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Billiam Williams?
text: YOUNG BILLIAM continues to sink.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. REP’S OFFICE - PRESENT - AFTERNOON
text: BILLIAM (18) sits across from a well dressed, middle aged
text: admissions representative. The rep has a note pad in his lap and
text: a pen in his hand, looking attentively at BILLIAM.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP
dialog: So your parents named you Billiam?
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP
dialog: Could be worse. I once knew a kid
dialog: who’s parents named him Bobert.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP
dialog: Yeah. (laughs) We mocked the hell
dialog: outta that kid! (continues to laugh)
text: BILLIAM is unamused, and the admissions rep notices this.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP (CONT'D)
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: Sorry. Please, continue.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Why do you want to know so much
dialog: about my childhood?
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP
dialog: Well, when we ask most people to
dialog: talk about their childhood on this
dialog: form they at least give us something.
dialog: You just wrote “Not Applicable”.
text: BILLIAM nods slightly.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: (Agreeing) Mmmhmm.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP
dialog: Would you really describe your
dialog: childhood as “Not applicable”?
text: BILLIAM opens his mouth as if he’s about to say something,
dialog: thinking very hard.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LUNCH ROOM - FLASHBACK
dialog: Subtitle: “2000”
text: YOUNG BILLIAM sits at a lunchroom table, all alone.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.0O)
dialog: Back then, kids were (pause) —-
dialog: less than civil towards me.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM suddenly gets hits directly in the face with a
text: large, sloppy sandwich. Shocked, he wipes the contents of the
text: sandwich from his face as loud laughter erupts from off screen.
text: Seated across the lunchroom is YOUNG TERRENCE, the source of the
text: laughter. YOUNG TERRENCE sits amongst his lackeys.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.O) (CONT'D)
dialog: Terrence was my constant tormentor.
text: YOUNG TERRENCE retrieves another sandwich from his paper lunch-
dialog: sack.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.O) (CONT'D)
dialog: And over the years it became quite
dialog: apparent to me that Terrence’s
text: mother stocked him with a steady
dialog: supply of sandwiches.
text: YOUNG TERRENCE begins to happily eat his next sandwich.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. GYM - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS
text: YOUNG BILLIAM prepares to catch a kicked ball in the back of the
text: gym and gets hit with a ball from behind by the laughing unseen
scene_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.0O)
dialog: Well, c'mon, he couldn't always
dialog: throw sandwiches. That's just
dialog: ridiculous.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: But my mother was always there for
dialog: me when I got home. And she always
dialog: tried to make me feel better about
dialog: the situation.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Oh, Billiam.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM’S mother picks a piece of tomato out of his hair.
speaker_heading: MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know why the kids do this to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: (sniffling) Because my name's Billiam?
speaker_heading: MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, heavens no. It's because they're
dialog: jealous of you.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM lifts his head, displaying a look of hope.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Really?
text: His mother nods, smiling. YOUNG BILLIAM smiles back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. REP’S OFFICE - PRESENT
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: What were they jealous of? The
dialog: friends I didn’t have? The social
dialog: skills I was unable to acquire?
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP
dialog: Well, your mom sounds like a pretty
dialog: smart person. I mean, my mom told
dialog: me the same thing, and lI...
dialog: (look of realization) Oh..
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: The worst part was that I actually
dialog: listened to her. (thinks) Wait a minute,
dialog: no. That’s not the worst part. The worst
dialog: part was...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - FLASHBACK
text: YOUNG BILLIAM walks to his seat, and YOUNG TERRENCE sticks his
text: foot out to trip him. YOUNG BILLIAM falls with a thud.
text: YOUNG TIM, who sits all alone in the corner, watches this.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM comes back to his feet and turns to YOUNG
scene_heading: TERRENCE.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: You know what, Terrence? I know
dialog: why you pick on me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: You’re just jealous of me, and you
dialog: pick on me because you’re really insecure
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM (CONT’D)
dialog: about yourself, and need to make me
dialog: feel bad to make yourself feel better.
text: YOUNG TIM, hearing this, shuts his eyes wincing. YOUNG TERRENCE
text: pauses as he takes this all in.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: (sarcastic) You know what? You're
dialog: right. I am jealous of you. All I
dialog: really want to be is your friend.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Really?
text: YOUNG TERRENCE reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sandwich,
text: throwing it in YOUNG BILLIAM’S face. He walks away, and YOUNG
text: BILLIAM stands there, shocked.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.0O)
dialog: My first run-in with sarcasm.
text: YOUNG TIM shakes his head, getting up from his seat and walking
text: over to YOUNG BILLIAM. He pulls out some tissues from his pocket
text: and hands them to YOUNG BILLIAM.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.O) (CONT'D)
dialog: And that’s when I first met my best
dialog: friend, Tim.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: He’s not really jealous of you, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: But my mom said he was.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Well, there’s your first problem.
dialog: When it comes to bullies, never
dialog: listen to your mother.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM thinks about this.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.0O)
dialog: He was right. And the more I
dialog: thought about it, the more I
dialog: remembered all the horrible advice
dialog: my mother had given me.
scene_heading: INT. BILLIAM’S LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK
text: YOUNG BILLIAM is looking up to his mother. She is cutting onions
text: in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Just ignore them, and they'll stop
dialog: picking on you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: YOUNG BILLIAM is counseled by his mother at the dining room
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: The next time they pick on you, you
dialog: just tell your teacher. She'll make
dialog: everything better.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: YOUNG BILLIAM is leaning against the wall in his bathrobe as his
text: mother talks in the background.
speaker_heading: MOTHER (0O.S.)
dialog: I think it's time I gave their
text: parents a call. Once they get a
dialog: good talking to, they'll stop
dialog: picking on you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MOM is tucking in YOUNG BILLIAM in his bed. It is night.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: He won’t bother you anymore, much
dialog: like that boogeyman you mentioned
dialog: before hiding under your bed.
dialog: Goodnight dear.
text: MOM gets up and walks towards the door. As she does, YOUNG
text: BILLIAM’s eyes are wide open with a sense of realization of an
text: old fear. While finding enough courage, he grabs his flashlight,
text: turns it on, and slowly looks under the bed.
text: The flashlight shines towards a body under the bed appearing to
text: be YOUNG TERRENCE. He holds a sandwich in his right hand and
text: moves it towards him.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM wakes up in a sweat screaming.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Mom! The boogeyman is Terrence!
scene_heading: INT. REP’S OFFICE - PRESENT
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Her heart was in the right place,
dialog: but she just didn't understand what
dialog: it was really like. Sure bullies
dialog: were probably insecure with
dialog: themselves which caused them to
dialog: pick on those lesser than them, but
dialog: knowing that didn't help as a
text: little kid. In the end, there are
dialog: just no good ways to deal with a bully.
text: BILLIAM smiles deviously.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (CONT'D)
dialog: But there are some bad ones.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - FLASHBACK
text: YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM sit at a lunchroom table, eating.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM (V.O.)
dialog: Tim and I basically became
dialog: inseparable for the next several
dialog: months. I’d like to say by that time
dialog: I’d taken care of my Terrence situation,
dialog: but I can say that things were at least
text: starting to change.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM gets hit with a sandwich, which smears across
text: his face and falls on the table. He remains unfazed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
text: Hmm. Terrence’s mother switched to
dialog: Miracle Whip.
text: He wipes off his face with a nearby napkin, and continues
dialog: eating.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: At least she stopped using toothpicks.
dialog: (pause) You ever going to stand up to
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Well, my mom says I should try not to
text: give him a big reaction.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Your mom?! You’re still listening to
dialog: your mom?! Are you kidding? Nothing
dialog: she’s said has worked, Bill! Seriously,
dialog: you need to do something. If you don't,
dialog: he’1l never stop. EVER!
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: I know.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM sits there and thinks to himself.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Someone needs to hit him with a
dialog: sandwich.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM suddenly gets a look of realization across his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: I’ve got it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: We're going to settle this on the
dialog: playground.
text: YOUNG TIM looks confused.
scene_heading: EXT. BILLIAM’S HOUSE - FLASHBACK - AFTERNOON
text: YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM walk out from the back door in a
text: hurry wearing backpacks filled with sandwiches. Attached to
text: their pants are walky-talkies. They begin to head towards the
text: garage until a car door shuts.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM moves his arm to stop YOUNG TIM from proceeding
text: further. They hide around the corner from being seen. BILLIAM
text: peeks and sees his mother walking towards the front door with
text: bag of groceries.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
text: Civilian hostile spotted.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Should we initiate plan B?
text: YOUNG BILLIAM turns towards YOUNG TIM.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Affirmative. Get ready.
text: The boys detach their walky-talkies from their pants and turn
text: them on.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Tim, your objective is to watch
dialog: her every move. You can reach me
dialog: on here.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Will do.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Okay. Go!
text: The boys set ways.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM’S mother walks into the house. YOUNG BILLIAM makes
text: his way towards the garage while YOUNG TIM starts sneaking by
text: the house windows. YOUNG BILLIAM brings the walky-talkie towards
text: his mouth. His head peeks around the corner for a clear visual.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Tango Lee Seven this is Bravo Whiskey
dialog: Six. Radio check, over!
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Bravo Whiskey Six, this is Tango
dialog: Lima Seven. I read you loud and clear,
dialog: over!
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Roger, Tango Lee Seven. Give me a
dialog: sitrep, over!
text: YOUNG TIM looks into the window: she is dancing with a cat.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
text: Target is in sight.
text: YOUNG TIM rolls his eyes and gets back into a hiding position.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Be advised, crazy mom close, over.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM makes it to the garage and quietly sneaks towards
text: the garage door. He speaks into the walky-talkie again.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Tango Lima Seven, I’m in position, over.
text: YOUNG TIM peeks through the window again but does not see her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
text: All clear, Bravo Whiskey Six. Mission
dialog: is a go. I repeat, mission is a go!
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Roger, Wilco! Go mission! Over and out!
text: YOUNG BILLIAM grabs the garage door handle and opens it. He runs
text: in as YOUNG TIM follows him from behind. They run out with a
text: ladder, tape, and a long rope.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM’s mother barely recognizes them just in time as
text: they slowly run off with a large ladder.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - AFTERNOON
text: YOUNG BILLIAM is on a ladder as TIM hands him the next backpack
text: of sandwiches. A rope is attached to a closed net attached to
text: the hoop. Duck tape is below the hoop in a formation of an ‘xX’.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: You sure this is a good idea?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: No, I think it’s a bad one! You
dialog: want out?
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: No. I was just thinking of one sandwich.
dialog: I think we made a hundred sandwiches!
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Revenge is messy. You said it
dialog: yourself, Tim. I have to stand up to
dialog: Terrence. If I don’t, he’1ll never stop.
dialog: I tried telling the teacher. I tried
dialog: ignoring him. I tried to look brave. I
dialog: tried to pretend I don’t care. But I do
dialog: care. It’s time for Terrence to get a
dialog: taste of his own medicine.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: What if it doesn’t work?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: It will work.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - AFTERNOON
text: YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM stand at the playground to their old
text: school, waiting. YOUNG TIM glances at his watch.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Maybe he won’t show.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: He’1l show.
text: Suddenly in the distance, YOUNG TERRENCE shows up on his bike.
text: The scene plays in slow motion. He ride up to the playground and
text: tosses his bike to the ground, his long coat tails flutter in
text: the wind (in slow motion a la John Woo). YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG
dialog: TIM watch this.
text: YOUNG TERRENCE approaches the duo.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: Well, well, well.. if it isn’t
dialog: Billiam Williams.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM exchange glances.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: And you brought your friend Dim Tim.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Hi Terry.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: I got your note. What do you want?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: I just want to teach you a lesson.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: Oh yeah? And what’s that?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: That when someone you’ve tortured
dialog: for his entire life asks you to
text: meet him out in a secluded area-
dialog: (pause) you should always watch
dialog: where you stand.
text: YOUNG TERRENCE looks down to find that he is standing on a giant
text: X. YOUNG BILLIAM pulls a string. YOUNG TERRENCE sees YOUNG
text: BILLIAM pull the string and looks up as a giant bucket of
text: sandwiches is released above his head.
text: A hundred sandwiches fall out of the bucket and fall all over
text: YOUNG TERRENCE. YOUNG TERRENCE slowly looks up from his feet at
text: YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: You're dead.
text: As they move forward, YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM start backing
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Uh, Bill? What was your plan for
dialog: after we hit him with the sandwiches?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: That’s about as far as I got.
text: YOUNG TERRENCE backs them both into a tree, grabbing YOUNG
text: BILLIAM and raising his fist.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: (smiling) I’m really going to
dialog: enjoy this.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM winces, waiting for impact when in the distance a
text: car engine is heard revving. YOUNG TERRRENCE slowly turns his
text: head around.
text: Far in the distance, a silver station wagon sits at the end of
text: the parking lot. The engine revs again.
text: YOUNG TERRENCE lets go of his grip and walks towards the car.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, what’s this?
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Bill? Is that your mother?
text: YOUNG BILLIAM simply stares ahead, nodding in shock.
text: YOUNG TERRENCE squints towards the car to get a better
text: look. He laughs to himself.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TERRENCE
dialog: Aww, isn't that cute? Billy called
text: his mommy to come and save him.
text: The car engine revs again.
scene_heading: INT. BILLIAM'S MOM'S CAR - DAY
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Nobody hurts my boy and gets away
dialog: with it.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY
text: The car suddenly peels forward, towards YOUNG TERRENCE. YOUNG
text: TERRENCE’s face drops in horror, as he begins to run in the
text: opposite direction. He runs towards his bike and hops on,
text: pedaling away.
text: YOUNG TERRENCE cowardly screams as he drives his bike fast away,
text: YOUNG BILLIAM’s mother on his tail. They drive off into the
text: distance and disappear, leaving YOUNG BILLIAM and YOUNG TIM
dialog: alone.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY
speaker_heading: YOUNG TIM
dialog: Wow. (pause) Your mom is insane.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM smiles, as he stares off to where they drove
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BILLIAM
dialog: Naw, she just loves me.
text: YOUNG BILLIAM pats YOUNG TIM on the back. They walk off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. REP’S OFFICE - PRESENT
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: And, so that’s how it ended.
dialog: Terrence ended up transferring to a
dialog: new school, and I really haven’t
dialog: seen him since.
text: The ADMISSION REP places his folder on the table.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP
dialog: Well, I must say, that’s one heck
dialog: of a story. And I can see why you
dialog: didn’t try and fit that into a
dialog: single essay.
text: The ADMISSION REP sticks out his hand.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS REP (CONT'D)
dialog: We’1l let you know.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - PRESENT -CONTINUOUS
text: BILLIAM walks out into the lobby and looks around to see several
text: students sitting in a line of chairs. At the front of them is
text: TERRENCE. He looks up and notices BILLIAM, surprised.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Terrence?
speaker_heading: TERRENCE
dialog: Oh hey, Bill.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: You’re going to this school?
speaker_heading: TERRENCE
dialog: If they let me.
text: Awkward pause as the two think of what to say.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Well, good luck Terrence.
speaker_heading: TERRENCE
dialog: Hey, you too.
text: BILLIAM begins to walk away.
speaker_heading: TERRENCE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Billiam!
text: BILLIAM shields his face in terror, wincing. He looks back to
text: see TERRENCE is sticking out his hand, smiling.
speaker_heading: TERRENCE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good to see you.
text: BILLIAM shakes TERRENCE’s hand.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: TERRENCE
dialog: Hey, maybe we can get together and
dialog: get a bite to eat sometime. No
dialog: sandwiches of course. (laughs)
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Yeah, I’d like that.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RESTRAUNT - DAY
text: BILLIAM and TERRENCE are talking to each other as they eat by a

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
text: BILLIAM walks with TERENCE down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: TERRENCE
dialog: It was great seeing you again. My
dialog: car is right up there. Where is yours?
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Oh, it’s at the shop. There were some
dialog: problems with the engine and had to get
dialog: it fixed.
speaker_heading: TERRENCE
dialog: That sucks, man. Need a ride?
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: Uh, my mom is picking me up.
text: TERRENCE is in shock.
speaker_heading: TERRENCE
dialog: She's... what?
text: BILLIAM looks at him questionably.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: She’s picking me up. I told her to
dialog: arrive about this time.
text: BILLIAM glances around.
speaker_heading: BILLIAM
dialog: She should be here... oh, there
dialog: she is.
text: TERRENCE looks where BILLIAM is looking at. He spots his mother
text: standing outside the car. Her eyes lock on TERRENCE with an evil
dialog: grin.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You!
text: TERRENCE panics and begins running the opposite direction and
text: around the corner. BILLIAM is confused and watches him run off.
text: BILLIAM’S MOTHER gets in the car quickly and turns it on,
text: storming after TERRENCE.
