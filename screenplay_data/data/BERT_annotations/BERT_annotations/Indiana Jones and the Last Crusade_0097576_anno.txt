scene_heading: EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY
text: A mountain peak dominates the landscape.
scene_heading: TITLES BEGIN.
text: Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a
text: company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.
text: CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS
text: reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted
text: against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.
text: The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Dis-mount!
text: RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that
text: this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The
text: "Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.
text: One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,
text: bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.
speaker_heading: FIRST SCOUT
dialog: Herman's horsesick!
text: A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored
text: hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite
dialog: for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his
text: uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.
speaker_heading: SCOUTMASTER
dialog: Chaps, don't anybody wander off.
dialog: Some of the passageways in here
dialog: can run for miles.
text: Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.
scene_heading: INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY
text: The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops
text: several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.
text: HERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's
text: drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HERMAN
dialog: I don't think this is such a good
dialog: idea.
text: LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.
text: The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light
text: of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach
text: cautiously, careful to stay hidden.
speaker_heading: HERMAN
dialog: What is it?
dialog: This is what they see:
text: FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the
dialog: pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."
text: The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery
text: Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his
dialog: shoulders).
text: And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT
text: FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet
dialog: anything that this is INDLANA JONES.
text: However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,
text: we are shocked to discover that it is someone else.
dialog: We'll call him FEDORA.
scene_heading: TITLES END.
text: The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.
text: Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: Alfred, did you get anything yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Nothing. Dig in.
text: Two of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: ROSCOE
dialog: Hey, I've got something!
text: Whoops from the other men.
speaker_heading: ROSCOE
dialog: I got something, Garth!
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: ROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a
text: lantern resting on a rock.
speaker_heading: ROSCOE
dialog: I got something... I got something
dialog: right here.
text: More whoops from the other men.
text: FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes
text: ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the
text: box as Fedora opens it.
speaker_heading: ROSCOE
dialog: (more whoops; then)
dialog: Oh, look at thatl
dialog: (more whoops)
dialog: We're richl We're rich!
speaker_heading: HALFBREED
dialog: Shut up. Shut up.
text: FEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's
text: comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.
speaker_heading: ROSCOE (O.S.)
dialog: Well, we're rich, ain't we?l
text: INDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.
speaker_heading: HERMAN
dialog: Indy? Indy? What are they doing?
dialog: Indiana? Indiana?
speaker_heading: INDY
speaker_heading: Shhhl
text: FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its
text: beauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: HALFBREED
dialog: Hey, we got to find more stuff
dialog: to bring back.
text: INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (hushed; urgent)
dialog: It's the Cross of Coronadol
dialog: Cortes gave it to him in 15201
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: FEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box
dialog: and the lantern.
text: INDY turns back to observe the men.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: That Cross is an important artifact.
text: It belongs in a museum.
text: A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward
speaker_heading: HERMAN.
speaker_heading: INDY
text: Run back and find the others.
dialog: Tell Mister Havelock that there
text: are men looting in the caves.
text: HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror
text: as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Have him bring the sheriff.
text: INDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: It's only a snake.
text: INDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Did you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: HERMAN
dialog: Right. Run back. Mister Havelock.
dialog: The Sheriff. What, what are you
dialog: gonna do?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I don't know... I'll think of
dialog: something.
text: INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees
text: the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for
text: additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of
dialog: the Cross...
text: FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: Dig with your hands.
text: INDY picks up the Cross.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: FEDORA (O . S . )
dialog: Not with your mouth.
text: As FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his
text: pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's
text: feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.
speaker_heading: ROSCOE
dialog: He's got our thing!
speaker_heading: HALFBREED
dialog: Get 'im!
dialog: 
text: The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock
text: each other over in the attempt.
text: Only FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in
text: the direction of his fleeing companionsthen sets off
text: after INDY.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE CLIFFS - DAY
text: INDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.
text: He pausessquintsshields his eyeslooks in all directions.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Mister Havelock! Anybody
dialog: Everybody's lost but me!
text: He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER,
text: HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: There he isl
speaker_heading: MEN
speaker_heading: (AD-LIBS)
dialog: Let's go! Let's get him! Let's
dialog: go!
text: Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy
text: puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy
text: puts the Cross in his belt.
text: INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But
text: the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a
text: standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his
text: back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.
text: FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into
text: the saddle and gallop off.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Hyahl Hyah!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSCOE
dialog: Hey! Come back here!
text: FEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK
text: AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two
dialog: more gang members). Now we glimpse...
scene_heading: THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT
text: The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm
text: is out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from
text: the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in
dialog: the truck.
speaker_heading: PANAMA HAT
dialog: Come on. Get him!
text: INDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace
text: with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.
text: Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched
text: low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin
dialog: pumping.
text: INDY VEERS OFF in a new directiontoward a RAILROAD TRACK.
scene_heading: EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY
text: The train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over
text: his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he
text: LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.
text: He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from
text: the truck onto the train.
text: HALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed
text: runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked
text: on a flatcar.
text: INDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still
text: running after him, Indy enters the trap door of...
scene_heading: INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY
text: and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling.
text: Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles:
text: Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Then, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap doorfollowed by ROUGH RIDER.
text: Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.
text: INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at
text: Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.
text: The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended
text: for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.
text: Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL
text: BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's
text: end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.
text: He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-
dialog: to-eye with an
speaker_heading: ENORMOUS ANACONDA
text: The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Oh...
text: INDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Oh... Oh...
text: Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him.
text: Engulf him. Almost smother him.
text: INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.
text: INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.
text: HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.
text: ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.
speaker_heading: ROUGH RIDER
dialog: Here, let me.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TRAIN- DAY
text: INDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks
text: worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and
text: tosses it away.
text: ROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at
text: him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...
scene_heading: EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY
text: INDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a
text: long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto
text: the roof of the rhino boxcar.
scene_heading: INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
text: as a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE
scene_heading: BLACK RHINOCEROS.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
text: ROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle,
text: rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.
text: Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.
text: IN THE BOXCAR BELOW
text: ... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the
text: commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS
text: HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.
text: BACK TO THE ROOFTOP
text: as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and
text: Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.
text: SMASH! The horn comes up againRIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Holy smokes!
dialog: 
text: INDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from
text: falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.
scene_heading: EXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY
text: The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The
text: door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
text: INDY gets to his feetlooks aheadsees a WATER TANK alongside the track
text: directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...
text: In an instant, he calculates his approachtimes the distanceand LEAPS for
text: the tank's WATER SPOUT.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A
text: FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout
text: deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks
text: up to see FEDORA walking toward him.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: Come on, kid. There's no way
dialog: out of this.
text: As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF
text: COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.
scene_heading: INT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY
text: INDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Ohhh!
text: INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in
text: through the cracks between the boards.
text: Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an
text: AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust
text: swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.
text: And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged
dialog: from his belt during the fall...
text: INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He
text: carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.
text: INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP
text: flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.
text: The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and
text: tries again. This timesuccess! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion
text: BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.
text: INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs
text: away even more. Indy inches forwardbends down (never taking his eyes off
text: the Lion)picks up the Crossand steps back again, sweat pouring down his
dialog: face.
dialog: But now... how to get out?
text: He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING
text: DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
text: Toss up the whip.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR
text: FEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, "reels" INDY out of the
text: Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.
text: The men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to
text: face them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: You've got heart, kid.
dialog: (indicates Cross)
dialog: But that belongs to me.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (takes Cross from his belt)
dialog: It belongs to Coronado.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Coronado is dead. And so are all
dialog: his grandchildren.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: This should be in a museum.
speaker_heading: ROSCOE
dialog: Now give me thatl
text: ROSCOE makes a grab for the Crossbut INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war
text: ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS
text: AROUND Roscoe's hand.
text: ROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDERreleases his grip on the Cross and tries
text: to shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO
text: THE NEXT CAR.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: Don't let him get awayl
text: INDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading
scene_heading: "DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Magic?
text: He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping
dialog: inside.
text: FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: Hold it. Make sure he doesn't
dialog: double back.
scene_heading: INT. THE CABOOSE - DAY
text: which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of
text: the caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC
dialog: BOX.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: Okay, kid. out of the box.
dialog: Now.
text: FEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly
text: collapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely
dialog: vanished.
text: FEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back.
text: He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the
dialog: balcony and sees:
text: INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: Damn.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY
text: as INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name
text: "JONES" painted on the mailbox.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSE - DAY
text: INDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky
text: BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
scene_heading: INT. THE STUDY - DAY
text: INDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps
text: clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.
text: PROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very
text: ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a
text: beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The
text: sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just
text: studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: We never get to see the PROFESSOR's face in this scene.
text: So INDY CHARGES IN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Out!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: It's important!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Then waitcount to twenty.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: No, Dad. You listen to me
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (now he shouts)
dialog: Junior!
text: No question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says "What am I going to
dialog: do with this guy?" And obeys
text: starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: One, two, three, four...
text: Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand
text: sketching; then, he holds up one finger.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: In Greek.
dialog: INDY's reaction:
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (louder, in Greek)
dialog: One... two... three... four...
text: An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the
text: window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat.
text: HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET.
dialog: INDY's reaction: Trouble!
text: HENRY is just finishing the sketch.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: May he who illuminated this...
dialog: illuminate me...
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY
text: The study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN
text: comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet.
text: INDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman
text: continues to spitright into Indy's face. Indy flinches.
speaker_heading: HERMAN
dialog: I brought the Sheriff.
text: HERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Just the man I want to see! Now,
dialog: there were five or six of them.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: All right, son.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ... they came after... me...
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You still got it?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Well, yes, sir. It's right here!
text: INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his
text: point. The Sheriff takes it casually.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I'm glad to see that... because
dialog: the rightful owner of this Cross
dialog: won't press charges, if you give
dialog: it back.
text: FEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED.
text: He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a
dialog: friendly manner.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: He's got witnesses, five or six
dialog: of them.
text: The SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots
text: The SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from
text: Fedora, then runs out the door.
speaker_heading: ROSCOE
dialog: Yahoo!
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: As ROSCOE runs outside INDY seesthrough the screen doorthe MAN IN
text: THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front.
text: Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Crossthe Man hands Roscoe some
dialog: money in exchange.
text: The SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Good day.
text: FEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic
dialog: man-to-man way.
speaker_heading: FEDORA
dialog: You lost today, kid, but that
dialog: doesn't mean you have to like it.
text: Then, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat
text: by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for
text: the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face.
text: CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT
text: The hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE the face of FULL
scene_heading: GROWN INDIANA JONES.
text: And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his
dialog: back.
scene_heading: FADE IN TITLE: "PORTUGUESE COAST1938"

dialog: Small world, Doctor Jones.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Too small for two of us.
text: THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS OF
text: CORONADO from Indy's belt.
speaker_heading: PANAMA HAT
dialog: This is the second time I've had
dialog: to reclaim my property from you
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: That belongs in a museum
speaker_heading: PANAMA HAT
dialog: So do you.
dialog: (he moves his eyeline)
text: Throw him over the side.
text: THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP
text: It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA.
text: Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.
text: The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back)
text: propel INDY across the deck toward the rail.
text: As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage
text: to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold
text: the drums together.
text: INDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward
text: the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.
text: PANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to
text: the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes
text: his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder
text: from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from
dialog: Panama Hat.
text: A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of
text: his grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two
text: sailors who attack him from the sides.
text: INDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.
text: He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.
text: He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the
text: deck around him.
text: SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all.
speaker_heading: PANAMA HAT
dialog: Grab him, he's getting away!
dialog: Grab him!
text: Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large
text: Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a
text: hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly
text: avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still
text: holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly
text: onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending
text: an enormous orange fireball into the sky.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER
text: as bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.
speaker_heading: INDY BOBS UP
text: in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for
text: something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE
text: PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver revealing the

speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Next week: "Egyptology." Starting

speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Marcus!

dialog: I did it!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: You've got itl
text: INDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk
text: and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: You know how long I've been
dialog: looking for that?!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: All your life.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: All my life!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Well done, Indy. Very well done,
dialog: indeed This will find a place
dialog: of honor in our Spanish collection.
text: INDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: We can discuss my honorarium over

speaker_heading: INDY

scene_heading: INT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Shush! Shush! Shushl
text: INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching

speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're

dialog: Here are your phone messages.
speaker_heading: MALE STUDENT
dialog: Doctor Jones, you promised...

speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: This is your appointment schedule.

dialog: "My grade!" "Sign my registration card!"
text: INDY silences the mob with a raised hand.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (very efficiently)
dialog: Okay. Irene, put everyone's name
dialog: on a list, in the order they
dialog: arrived, and I'll see each and

speaker_heading: PRIVATE OFFICE

speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (softly; reading)
dialog: "Venice, Italy."

scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY
text: INDY escapes through the garden.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY
text: INDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous
text: museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this
dialog: opportunity to examine them.
text: After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the
text: brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the
text: next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC.
text: DONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties,
text: Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man.
text: Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: I trust your trip down was
dialog: comfortable, Doctor Jones. My
dialog: men didn't alarm you, I hope.
text: He shakes hands with INDY.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I know who you are Mr. Donovan.
dialog: Your contributions to the museum
dialog: over the years have been extremely
dialog: generous. Some of the pieces in
dialog: your collection here are very
dialog: impressive.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones,
dialog: I have a passion for antiquities.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have a look over here. This might
dialog: interest you.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: DONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back
text: the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLETabout two feet square, inscribed with
text: letters and symbols.
text: INDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Well, it's sandstone. Christian
dialog: symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-
dialog: Twelfth Century, I should think.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: That was our assessment as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Where did this come from?
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: My engineers unearthed it in the
dialog: mountain region north of Ankara
text: while excavating for copper.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can you translate the inscription?
dialog: Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd
dialog: like to wake up to!
speaker_heading: INDY
text: An old man's dream.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Every man's dream.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Including your father's, I believe.
text: INDY stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Grail lore is his hobby.
dialog: He's a teacher of Medieval
dialog: Literature. The one the students
dialog: hope they don't get.
text: The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a matronly
text: woman in an expensive evening gown.
speaker_heading: MRS. DONOVAN
dialog: Walter, you're neglecting our
dialog: guests.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Be along in a moment, dear.
text: He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns
text: to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet,
text: obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with
text: champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Hard to resist, isn't it? The
dialog: Holy Grail's final resting place
dialog: described in detail!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What good is it? This Grail
dialog: Tablet speaks of deserts and
text: mountains and canyons. Pretty
dialog: vague. Where do you start
dialog: looking? Maybe if the Tablet were
dialog: intact, you'd have something to
dialog: go on. But the entire top
text: portion is missing.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
text: Just the same, an attempt to
dialog: recover the Grail is currently
dialog: underway.
text: INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Let me tell you another "bedtime
dialog: story, " Doctor Jones.
dialog: After the Grail was entrusted
dialog: to Joseph of Arimathaea, it
dialog: disappeared and was lost for a
dialog: thousand years before it was found
dialog: again by three Knights of the
dialog: First Crusade. Three brothers,
dialog: to be exact.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I've heard this one as well.
dialog: Two of these brothers walked out
dialog: of the desert one hundred and
dialog: fifty years after having found
dialog: the Grail and began the long
dialog: journey back to France. But
dialog: only one of them made it. And
dialog: before dying of extreme old
dialog: age, he supposedly imparted
dialog: his tale to ato a Franciscan
dialog: friar, I think.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.
text: DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle
text: pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: This is the manuscript in which
dialog: the friar chronicled the Knight's
dialog: story... it doesn't reveal on
dialog: location of the Grail, I'm afraid...
dialog: but the Knight promised that two
dialog: "markers" that had been left
dialog: behind would.
dialog: (indicates the Tablet)
dialog: This Tablet is one of those
dialog: "markers." It proves the Knight's
dialog: story is true. But as you pointed
dialog: outit's incomplete.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, the second "marker" is
text: entombed with the Knight's dead
dialog: brother. Our project leader
dialog: believes that tomb to be located
dialog: within the city of Venice, Italy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As you can now see, Doctor Jones,
dialog: we're about to complete a great
dialog: quest that began almost two
dialog: thousand years ago. We're only
text: one step away.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: That's usually when the ground
dialog: falls out from underneath your
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: You could be more right than you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: We've hit a snag. our project
text: leader has vanished. Along with
dialog: all his research. Uh, we received
text: a cable from his colleague, Doctor
dialog: Schneider, who has no idea of his
dialog: whereabouts or what's become of
dialog: him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want you to pick up the trail
dialog: where he left off. Find the man
dialog: and you will find the Grail.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: You've got the wrong Jones, Mister
dialog: Donovan. Why don't you try my
dialog: father?
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: We already have. Your father is
text: the man who's disappeared.
scene_heading: EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
text: A FORD COUPE speeds down the tree-lined street.
scene_heading: EXT. PROFESSOR HENRY JONES' HOUSE - DAY
text: The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. INDY climbs from the car and
text: hurries up the walkway. BRODY is a step behind.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Your father and I have been
dialog: friends since time began. I've
dialog: watched you grow up, Indy. And
dialog: I've watched the two of you grow
dialog: apart.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've never seen you this concerned
dialog: about him before.
text: They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. They exchange a
text: quick look of concern as they enter.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: INDY approaches the half-open front door.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: (to BRODY)
dialog: He's an academic A bookworm.
dialog: He's not a field mans
text: He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad? Dad?
dialog: 
text: INDY opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room.
text: We see the place has been ransacked.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: BRODY sees INDY's face and opens the other half.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Dear God.

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What has the old fool got
dialog: himself into now?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I don't know. But whatever it
dialog: is, he's in over his head!
text: BRODY picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: It's today's mail. And it's been
dialog: opened.
text: INDY turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. Then something hits
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Mail! That's it, Marcus!
text: He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from
text: his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (as he tears it open)
dialog: Venice, Italy!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What is it?
text: INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or
text: DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of
text: handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with
dialog: great curiosity.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every
dialog: clue he ever followed. Every
dialog: discovery he made. A complete
dialog: record of his search for the Holy
dialog: Grail. This is his whole life.
dialog: Why would he have sent this to me?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I don't know. But someone must
dialog: want it pretty badly.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Do you believe, Marcus?
text: As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of
text: Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.
text: A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting
text: to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair
text: because he holds the Grail in his hands.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Do you believe the Grail actually
dialog: exists?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: The search for the Cup of Christ
dialog: is the search for the divine in all
dialog: of us.
text: BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: But if you want facts, Indy, I
dialog: have none to give you. At my age,
dialog: I'm prepared to take a few things
dialog: on faith.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him
dialog: I'll take that ticket to Venice
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I'll tell him we'll take two.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
text: A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN
text: CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Tell me, what's going to happen
dialog: when we get to Venice?
speaker_heading: DONOVAN

speaker_heading: BRODY

speaker_heading: DONOVAN

dialog: I maintain an apartment in Venice,

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Oh, well. That's good. Thank
dialog: you.
text: BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo.

speaker_heading: BRODY

speaker_heading: INDY

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes
dialog: that are bright and intelligent.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Doctor Jones?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: I knew it was you
text: She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: you have your father's eyes.
text: INDY is instantly attracted to her.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: And my mother's ears. But the
dialog: rest belongs to you.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Looks like the best parts have
dialog: already been spoken for.
text: INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Marcus Brody?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: That's right.
text: The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: (introducing herself)
dialog: Doctor Elsa Schneider.
text: INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Uh... how do you do?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY
text: INDY, BRODY and ELSA walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on
dialog: either side.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: The last time I saw your father
dialog: we were in the library. He was
dialog: very close to tracking down the
dialog: Knight's Tomb. I've never seen
text: him so excited. He was as giddy
dialog: as a schoolboy.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Who? Attila the Professor? He
dialog: was never giddy, even when he was
dialog: a schoolboy!
text: INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy
text: himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal,
text: Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Frauleinwill you permit me?
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: I usually don't.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I usually don't either.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: In that case, I permit you.
text: INDY gives her the flower.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: It would make me very happy.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: But I'm already sadby tomorrow
dialog: it will have faded.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: I hate to interrupt youbut the
dialog: reason we're here
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Yes. I have something to show
dialog: you.
text: She hands a slip of paper to INDY.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: I left your father working in
dialog: the library. He sent me to the
dialog: map section to fetch an ancient
dialog: plan of the city. When I got back
dialog: to his tablehe'd gonewith
dialog: all his papersexcept for that
dialog: scrap which I found near his chair.
text: INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Roman numerals.
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - DAY
text: ELSA leads INDY and BRODY into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at
text: tables in front of a large building.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Here is the library.
text: They have arrived at the front steps of the library.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: That doesn't look much like a
dialog: library.
speaker_heading: BRODY
text: It looks like a converted church.
text: ELSA leads the way inside.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY
text: INDY, BRODY and ELSA enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor.
text: We notice, along with INDY and BRODY, that the library contains many stained-
dialog: glass windows.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: In this case it's the literal
dialog: truth. We're on holy ground.
dialog: These columns over here...
text: She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: ... were brought back as spoils
dialog: of war after the sacking of
dialog: Byzantium during the Crusades.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: INDY glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a
text: Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Now please excuse me. The library's
dialog: closing in a few moments. I'll
dialog: arrange for us to stay a little
dialog: longer.
text: The minute ELSA is out of earshot.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: MarcusI've seen this window
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Where?
text: INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the
dialog: airplane.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Right here. In Dad's Diary.
dialog: You see?
text: BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman
text: numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad was onto something here!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Well, now we know the source of
dialog: the numbers, but we still don't
dialog: know what they mean.
text: INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back
text: into his pocket.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (explaining to Brody)
dialog: My dad sent me this Diary for a
dialog: reason. Until we find out why,
dialog: I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Find something?
text: INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving
text: across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BRODY
speaker_heading: (to ELSA)
dialog: Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent
dialog: That window seems to be the source
dialog: of the Roman numerals.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: My God, I must be blind
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad wasn't looking for a book
dialog: about the Knight's Tomb... he was
dialog: looking for the Tomb itself
text: ELSA wears a blank expression.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Don't you get it? The Tomb is
dialog: somewhere in the library! You
dialog: said yourself it used to be a
dialog: church! Look.
text: INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Three.
text: INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Three!
text: INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy
text: hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep
text: up with him.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Seven.
text: He points again to the stained-glass window.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Seven... Ten.
text: He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: And ten. Now where's the ten?
dialog: Look around for the ten.
text: INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Three, seven and ten.
dialog: 
text: He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and
text: ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge
text: "X"visible only from this higher angle.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Ten.
dialog: (wryly; to himself)
text: "X" marks the spot.
text: INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two
text: sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up,
dialog: but cannot.
text: INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath
text: the stained-glass window.
text: INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the
text: Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.
dialog: 
text: INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still
text: puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.
text: Finally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a
scene_heading: TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.
text: Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Bingo.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones.
dialog: You're a great deal like your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Except he's lost, and I'm not.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Lower me down.
text: INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by
text: the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground
text: below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Look after this for me, will you?
text: Then INDY disappears into the hole.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY
text: INDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Come on.
text: INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank.
text: foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory

speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth
dialog: Century.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Right. Six hundred years before
dialog: the Crusades.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: The Christians would have dug
dialog: their own passages and burial
dialog: chambers centuries later.
text: INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: That's right. If there's a
dialog: Knight of the First Crusade
dialog: entombed down here, that's where
dialog: we'll find him.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an
text: unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down
text: hard on Brody's head.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Ohhhh. . .
text: KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two
text: men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY
text: DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque
text: skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones.
text: INDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: ELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows
dialog: away some cobwebs:
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: What's this one?
text: INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: The Ark of the Covenant.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Pretty sure.
text: INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
text: INDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs
text: away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Watch out.
text: ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall
text: collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS
text: as INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling,
text: green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches.
text: ELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Petroleum. I could sink a well
dialog: down here and retire.
text: INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which
text: breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.
text: INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then
text: dips into the oily water.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Give me the lighter.
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
text: Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come
text: upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH
text: RATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING.
text: Squirming. Thrashing in the water.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Oh, rats...
text: ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.
text: INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping
text: in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out
dialog: to Elsa.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Come onl
text: She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves
dialog: forward.
scene_heading: THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL
text: KAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their
text: flashlights through to the rat-infested water.
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
text: More rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through
text: another passageway lined with skulls and bones.
text: INDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A
text: bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all
dialog: directions.
text: He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's
text: side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Come here.
scene_heading: LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER
text: The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Look. . .
text: In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an
text: "island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the
dialog: altar.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: INDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of
text: antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of
text: etched brass.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: It must be one of these...
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Look at the artistry of these
text: carvings and the scrollwork.
text: One coffin is elevated above the others.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: It's this one.
text: Together they begin to push on the lidSTRAINING and GROANING until it
text: slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE COFFIN
text: lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. INDY and ELSA look
text: in...Elsa gasps.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: This is itl we found it! Look
dialog: the engraving on the Shield. It's
dialog: the same as on the Grail Tablets
dialog: The Shield is the Second Marker!
text: INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: It's a rubbing Dad made of the
dialog: Grail Tablet.
text: The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Just like your fathergiddy
dialog: as a schoolboy.
text: INDY laughs.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Wouldn't it be wonderful if he
dialog: were here now to see this?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: He never would have made it past
dialog: the rats! He hates rats! He's
dialog: scared to death of them!
speaker_heading: CLOSE - A HAND
text: as it lights a match.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: INDY AND ELSA
text: ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And
text: then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.
text: This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the
text: Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYSHRIEKING and
text: SQUEALING as they approach.
text: The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to
dialog: escape a:
text: HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE
text: ROARING around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick;
dialog: consuming the oxygen.
speaker_heading: ELSA SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Get back! Back against the wall.
text: INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet.
text: It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Quick! Under it!
text: They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Air pocket!
text: ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.
scene_heading: UNDER THE COFFIN
text: ELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and
text: SPITTING.
text: Now INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSAthey are both soaking
dialog: wet.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Don't wander off.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: What?
text: INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: UNDER THE WATER
text: INDY swims, looking for an escape route.
scene_heading: UNDER THE COFFIN
text: The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water
text: and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror.
text: INDY pops back up through the water.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I think I've found a way out.
text: Deep breath.
text: ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY
text: The perfect picture postcardSt. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.
text: Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet
text: and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (wryly)
dialog: Ah, Venicel
text: Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH
text: AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.
text: He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP
text: INTO A MOTORBOAT.
scene_heading: INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY
text: INDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a
text: Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him.
text: ELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade
dialog: punches.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY
text: Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of
text: the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.
text: KAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock.
text: They chase after INDY.
text: INDY grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in
text: the Agent's hand. It FIRES.
text: As INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him
text: and two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.
text: INDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.
speaker_heading: INDY
speaker_heading: (to ELSA)
dialog: Are you crazy?! You don't go
dialog: between them!
text: ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Go between them? Are you crazy?!
text: INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard.
text: Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN
text: the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I said go around!
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: You said go between them!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I said don't go between them!
text: It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom
text: up on either side of them like cavern walls.
scene_heading: EXT. FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR - DAY
text: One Enemy Speedboat chases INDY between the two Freighters. But the Speedboat
text: containing KAZIM veers off and goes around.
scene_heading: EXT. BETWEEN THE TWO FREIGHTERS - DAY
text: It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever closer to one another.
text: Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the Enemy
text: Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO
text: THE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.
speaker_heading: INDY AND ELSA
text: spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear
text: racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at
speaker_heading: INDY and ELSA.
speaker_heading: KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT
dialog: 
text: matches Indy's move for move.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR
text: The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING
text: MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until
text: finally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.
text: The machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control
text: of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.
text: As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of
text: ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY
text: steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then
text: turns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins
text: helplessly in the churning water.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: No!!
text: INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back
text: into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the
text: Steamer's giant propeller blades.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Why are you trying to kill us?
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: Because you're looking for the
dialog: Holy Grail.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: My father was looking for the
dialog: Holy Grail. Did you kill him
dialog: too?
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Where is he? Talkor you're
dialog: dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: If you don't let go, Doctor Jones,
dialog: we'll both die.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Then we'll die.
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: My soul is prepared. How's yours?
text: By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are
text: getting closer.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: This is your last chance.
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
text: The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and
text: jumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: All right! Where's my father
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: If you let me go, I will tell you
dialog: where he is.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: My name is Kazim.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: And why were you trying to kill
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: The secret of the Grail has been
dialog: safe for a thousand years. And
dialog: for all that time the Brotherhood
dialog: of the Cruciform Sword has been
dialog: prepared to do anything to keep
dialog: it safe.
text: KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it
text: is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of
text: a broadsword.
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: Let me get off at this jetty.
text: The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to
text: bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: Ask yourself, why do you seek
dialog: the Cup of Christ? Is it for His
dialog: glory, or for yours?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I didn't come for the Cup of
dialog: Christ. I came to find my father.
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: In that case, God be with you in
dialog: your quest. Your father is being
dialog: held in the Castle of Brunwald on
dialog: the Austrian-German border.
text: KAZIM walks away.
scene_heading: INT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from
text: the shield of the Grail Knight.
text: BRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head
text: with an ice pack.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: How's the head?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: It's better, now I've seen this.
dialog: It's the name of a city.
dialog: "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
text: INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: The Knights of the First Crusade
dialog: laid siege to the city of
dialog: Alexandretta for over a year.
dialog: The entire city was destroyed.
text: BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: The present city of Iskenderun
text: is built on its ruins. Marcus

dialog: (pause)
dialog: But where exactly?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Your father would know. Your
dialog: father did know. Look. He
dialog: made a map.
text: BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: He must have pieced it together
dialog: from clues scattered through the
dialog: whole history of the Grail Quest.
text: A map with no names.
scene_heading: INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP
text: It covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Now, he knew there was a city
text: with an oasis due east. Here.
dialog: He knew the course turned south
text: through the desert to a river, and
text: the river led into the mountains.
text: Here. Straight to the canyon.
dialog: He knew everything except where
dialog: to begin, the name of the city.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (solemnly)
dialog: Alexandretta. Now we know.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Yes. Now we know.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell

speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I'm going after Dad.
scene_heading: INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: INDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: INDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa?
text: He goes in.
scene_heading: INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: ... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The
text: room is empty.
text: He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa?
text: He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa?
text: He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa?
scene_heading: INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as

scene_heading: INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: My room!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Mine, too.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: What were they looking for?
text: She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: This.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: The Grail Diary.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: You had it? You didn't trust
dialog: me!
text: She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I didn't know you.
dialog: She's awfully hard to resist.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: At least I let you tag along.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Oh, yes. Give them a flower and
dialog: they'll follow you anywhere.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Knock it off. You're not mad.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: No. You like the way I do things.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: It's lucky I don't do things the
dialog: same way. You'd still be standing
text: at the Venice pier.
text: She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy
text: grabs her.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Look, what do you think is going
dialog: on here? Since I've met you,
dialog: I've nearly been incinerated,
text: drowned, shot at, and chopped into
dialog: fish bait. We're caught in the

dialog: My guess is Dad found out more

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)

speaker_heading: ELSA

speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Leave me alone. I don't like

speaker_heading: ELSA

speaker_heading: ELSA

speaker_heading: BUTLER

speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: And not before time! Did you
dialog: intend to leave us standing on
dialog: the doorstep all day? We're
dialog: drenched!
text: As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a

scene_heading: SNEEZES HARD.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Now look! I've gone and caught
text: a sniffle.
text: INDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused
dialog: amazement.
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: (coldly; with
dialog: Austrian accent)
dialog: Are you expected?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Don't take that tone with me, my

dialog: are here to view the tapestries.
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: Tapestries?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dear me, the man is dense. This

speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: This is a castle. And we have
dialog: many tapestries. But if you're a

speaker_heading: INDY

text: INDY reacts to the sight of them.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (to ELSA; softly)
dialog: Nazis. I hate these guys.
text: INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and
text: his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: This one. I think he's in here.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: How do you know?
text: INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Because it's wired.
text: He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other
text: doors. He knocks at the doorthere is no response. He looks back at ELSA and
text: enters.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
text: The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks
text: out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window
text: but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge,
text: which is several yards away.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Indy? Indy?
text: INDY reassures her.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Don't worry... this is kid's play.
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude
text: from the castle wall above the next window.
text: He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY
text: INDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.
text: CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE
text: A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.
text: INDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet...
text: swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING
text: THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROOM - DAY
text: INDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken
text: shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window.
text: No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON
text: THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.
text: Stunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES,
text: steps out of the shadows.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Junior?

speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (a reflex)
dialog: Yes, sirl
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: INDY

speaker_heading: HENRY

dialog: But what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I came to get you! What do you
dialog: think?
text: NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves

speaker_heading: HENRY

dialog: Late Fourteenth Century, Ming

speaker_heading: INDY

dialog: And the head.
dialog: (to HENRY, aggrievedly)
dialog: You hit me, Dad!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (referring to the
dialog: vase)
dialog: I'll never forgive myself
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (surprised,
dialog: misunderstanding)
dialog: Don't worryI'm fine.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Thank God!
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: HENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the
text: broken end carefully.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: ... it's fake. See, you can tell
text: by the cross section.
text: HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: No! Dad, get your stuff. We've
dialog: got to get out of here.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Well, I am sorry about your head,
dialog: though. But I thought you were
text: one of them.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad, they come in through the
dialog: doors.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Good point.
text: INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: But better safe than sorry.
text: HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Humpfso I was wrong this time.
dialog: But by God, I wasn't wrong when I
dialog: mailed you my Diary. You obviously
dialog: got it.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I got it and I used it. We found
text: the entrance to the catacombs.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Through the library?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I knew it. And the tomb of Sir
dialog: Richard?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: INDY nods.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Found it.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: He was actually there? You saw
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Well, what was left of him.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (trembling with
dialog: anticipation)
dialog: And his shield... the inscription
dialog: on Sir Richard's shield...?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Alexandretta.
dialog: (beat)
text: It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a
text: moment, then turns to INDY with joy.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Alexandretta... of course... on
dialog: the pilgrim trail from the Eastern
dialog: Empire. Oh, Junior...
text: INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: ... you did it.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: If only I could have been with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: There were rats, Dad.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Rats?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Yeah. big ones. What do the
dialog: Nazis want with you Dad?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: They want my diary.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (interested)
dialog: Yeah?
text: INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I knew I had to get that book as
dialog: far away from me as I possibly
dialog: could.
text: INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: Yeah. . .
text: Then... BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S.
text: OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY
text: raise their hands.
speaker_heading: S.S. OFFICER
dialog: Doctor Jones!!
scene_heading: HENRY &amp; INDY
dialog: Yes!!
speaker_heading: S.S. OFFICER
dialog: I will take the book now.
speaker_heading: INDY/HENRY
dialog: (simultaneously)
dialog: What book?
speaker_heading: S.S. OFFICER
speaker_heading: (to INDY)
dialog: You have the Diary in your pocket.
text: HENRY laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the
scene_heading: S.S. OFFICER.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You doltl Do you think that my
dialog: son would be that stupid that
dialog: he would bring my Diary all the
dialog: way back here?
text: At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You didn't, did you?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You didn't bring it, did you?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Well, uh...
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You did!!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Look, can we discuss this later?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I should have mailed it to the
dialog: Marx Brothers.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Will you take it easy....!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Take it easy?! Why do you think
dialog: I sent it home in the first place?
dialog: (points towards
speaker_heading: the NAZIS)
dialog: So it wouldn't fall into their
dialog: hands!!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I came here to save you.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to
dialog: save you, Junior??
text: INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A
text: MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment
dialog: we think he's going to use it on his dad.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I told you--
text: He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to
text: ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: --don't call me Junior!
text: HENRY looks shocked and horrified.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Look what you did!!
text: Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: I can't believe what you just....
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY
text: INDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa? Elsa?
text: He opens a door and enters:
scene_heading: INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY
text: INDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to
text: find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.
text: His name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped
text: around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: That's far enough Put down the
text: gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the
text: gun or the Fraulein dies.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: But she's one of them!
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Indy, please!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: She's a Nazi!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What?!
text: INDY is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his
text: father. Everyone is yelling at once:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Trust me!
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Indy, no!
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: I will kill her!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh yeah? Go ahead!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: No! Don't Shoot!
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Indy)
dialog: Don't worry. He won't.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Indy, please! Do what he says!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: And don't listen to her!
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Enough! She diesl
text: VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Wait! Waitl
text: And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides
text: across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.
text: VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled
text: directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: INDY comforts her.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: No, don't be.
text: Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: But you should have listened to
dialog: your father.
text: She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most
text: withering look of reprimand.
scene_heading: INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY
text: A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor.
text: Firelightfrom the giant fireplacedances across the ceiling and walls.
text: INDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL
text: and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS.
text: ELSA crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. INDY and
text: HENRY do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They
text: only see a HAND REACH OUT AND TAKE THE BOOK.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (quietly to HENRY)
dialog: She ransacked her own room and I
dialog: fell for it. How did you know
dialog: she was a Nazi?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Umh?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: How did you she was a Nazi?
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: She talks in her sleep.
text: INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY
text: with surprise.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I didn't trust her. Why did
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MAN IN CHAIR
dialog: Because he didn't take my advice.
text: The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be...
text: WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Donovan
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Didn't I warn you not to trust
dialog: anybody, Doctor Jones?
text: DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I misjudged you WalterI knew
dialog: you'd sell your mother for an
text: Etruscan vase.
dialog: But I didn't know you'd sell your
dialog: country and your soul to the slime
dialog: of humanity.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: (suddenly erupting)
dialog: Doctor Schneider There're pages
dialog: torn out of thisl
text: ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes
text: a look for herselfthen glances up at Indy.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: This book contained a mapa
dialog: map with no namesprecise
dialog: directions from the unknown city
dialog: to the secret Canyon of the
dialog: Crescent Moon.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: So it did.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Where are these missing pages?
dialog: This maps we must have these
dialog: pages backs
text: HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: (to Donovan)
dialog: You're wasting your breath. He
dialog: won't tell us. And he doesn't
dialog: have to... it's perfectly obvious
dialog: where the pages are...
dialog: (looking at Indy)
dialog: ... he's given them to Marcus
dialog: Brody.
text: HENRY now wears a pained expression.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Indy)
dialog: Marcus?! You didn't drag poor
dialog: Marcus along, did you? He's not
dialog: up to the challenge.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
text: He sticks out like a sore thumb.
dialog: We'll find him.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: The hell you will. He's got a
dialog: two-day head-start on you, which
dialog: is more than he needs.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Brody's got friends in every town
dialog: and village from here to the Sudan.
dialog: He speaks a dozen languages, knows
dialog: every local custom. He'll blend
dialog: in. Disappear. You'll never see
dialog: him again. With any luck, he's
dialog: got the Grail already.
text: HENRY looks amazed and impressed.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY
text: BRODY disembarks from the train along with the other PASSENGERS, a cross-
text: section of ARABS and TUSKS.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Does anyone here speak English?
dialog: Or even ancient Greek?
text: A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: No water, no thank you. No, fish
dialog: make love in it.
text: BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman
text: holds a chicken out to him.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Thank you so much. No, I don't
dialog: like that. No, I really don't
dialog: want... No, no, thank you very
dialog: much. No, thank you, madam.
dialog: I'm a vegetarian.
text: The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Does anyone understand a word I'm
dialog: saying here?
text: SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Mister Brodyl
text: They meet and hug, then begin to walk.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Oh, Sallahl What a relief!
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Marcus Brody, sir. And where is
dialog: Indy?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Oh, he's in Austria. A slight
dialog: detour.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: You are on your own?
text: A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Yes, but don't panic. Everything's
dialog: under control. Have you. . .have
dialog: you arranged our supplies?
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Oh, yes, of course. But where
dialog: are we going?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Oh, this map will show you. It
dialog: was drawn by, uh...
text: BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.
speaker_heading: SINISTER MAN
dialog: Mister Brody?
text: BRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and
text: bows quickly.
speaker_heading: SINISTER MAN
dialog: Welcome to Iskenderun. The
dialog: Director of the Museum of
dialog: Antiquities has sent a car for
dialog: you.
text: BRODY takes off his hat.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: And I am his.
speaker_heading: SINISTER MAN
dialog: Follow me, please.
text: The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: My reputation precedes me.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: There is no museum in Iskenderun.
text: The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.
speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: Papers please.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Papers?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Run.
text: BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Papers, sir. Got it here.
text: SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Just finished reading it myself.
dialog: (laughs; then, to
dialog: Brody)
dialog: Run!
text: BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
text: Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.
dialog: (to Brody)
dialog: Run!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Did you say...? Uh, uh...
text: SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches
text: him through the newspaper.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Run!
text: The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY
text: begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The
text: STAND COLLAPSES on impact.
text: SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: (to Brody; pointing)
dialog: Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl
dialog: Hide in that doorl Hide in that
dialog: door!
text: SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a
text: ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into
dialog: the darkness.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: ThenMETAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has
text: actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.
text: SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall
text: dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
text: The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE
text: FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates
text: one wall.
text: The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs.
text: ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Intolerable.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Doctor Schneider. Message from
dialog: Berlin. You must return immediately:
text: a rally at the Institute of Aryan
dialog: Culture.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Your presence on the platform is
dialog: requested... at the highest level.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Thank you, Herr Oberst.
speaker_heading: (to DONOVAN)
dialog: I will meet you at Iskenderun.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Take this Diary to the Reich
dialog: Museum in Berlin. It will show
dialog: them our progress, ahead of
dialog: schedule. Without a map, I'm
dialog: afraid it's no better than a
dialog: souvenir.
text: He hands her the Grail Diary.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
speaker_heading: (to DONOVAN, meaning
dialog: Indy and Henry)
dialog: Let me kill them now.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: No. If we fail to recover the
dialog: pages from Brody, we'll need them
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: (to VOGEL, with a
dialog: helpless shrug)
dialog: Always do what the doctor orders.
text: DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone,
text: ELSA turns to INDY.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Don't look at me like thatwe
dialog: both wanted the Grail, I would
dialog: have done anything to get it.
dialog: You would have done the same.
text: INDY shakes his head "no."
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I'm sorry you think so.
text: She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.
text: INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak
text: quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I can't forget... how wonderful
dialog: it was.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Thank you. It was rather wonderful.
text: She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather
dialog: disappointed.
text: VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Doctor Schneider! Your car is
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: (to INDY, after
dialog: finishing the kiss)
dialog: That's how Austrians say goodbye.
text: ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: And this is how we say goodbye in
dialog: Germany, Doctor Jones.
text: VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Ohh. . .
text: VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Ooooh... I like the Austrian way
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: So did I.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Let's try and get these ropes
dialog: loose. We've got to get to Marcus
dialog: before the Nazis do!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You said he had two days' start.
dialog: That he would blend in. Disappear!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Are you kidding?I made that
dialog: up! You know Marcushe got
dialog: lost once in his own museum!
text: Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Can you try and reach into my
dialog: left jacket pocket?
text: HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his
text: body around towards Henry's hand.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What am I looking for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: My lucky charm.
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: Feels like a cigarette lighter.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: INDY
text: Try and burn through the ropes.
text: HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Very good.
text: HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the
text: floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to
text: burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I ought to tell you something.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Don't get sentimental now Dad
dialog: save it 'til we get out of here.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: The floor's on fire! See?!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (turns and sees)
dialog: What???
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: And the chair.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: All right, movel Move! Rock
dialog: your Chair. Do what I do.
text: They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE - DAY
text: as ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS .
text: Another car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into
text: the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Etwas wichtig, mein Herr.
text: DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Well, we have Marcus Brody. But
dialog: more important, we have the map.
text: A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for
speaker_heading: DONOVAN.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RADIO OPERATOR
dialog: Aus Berlin, mein Herr.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "By the personal command of the
dialog: Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to
dialog: success. Eliminate the American
dialog: conspirators."
speaker_heading: (to VOGEL)
dialog: Germany has declared war on the
dialog: Jones boys.
speaker_heading: (to DRIVER)
dialog: Los fahren.
text: The car drives off.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
text: INDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to
text: communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in
dialog: opposite directions.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
text: Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Head for the fireplace!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh.
text: BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE
text: FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I think I can get these ropes
dialog: off.
text: Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal
text: grill that operates a Secret Door.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Whoopsl
text: The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find
dialog: themselves in the:
scene_heading: INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
text: where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials,
text: switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates.
text: Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY.
text: The floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in:
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
text: inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Our situation has not improved.
text: INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Listen Dad... I'm almost free.
text: INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to:
scene_heading: INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
text: FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and
text: coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She
dialog: screams.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Alarm!
text: Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Schnel!!
text: TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN
text: INDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet,
text: drapes and furniture are all ablaze.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: This is intolerable!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I'm out, Dad!
text: INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Well done, boy!
scene_heading: INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
text: All FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and
text: begin to rotate through the Secret Door.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
text: The RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other sidebut there is NO SIGN
text: OF INDY AND HENRY.
text: The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one
text: hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY
dialog: escaped through these flames?
dialog: Not a chance.
text: They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN,
text: BEHIND the RADIOMEN.
text: One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against
text: the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY
dialog: behind.
text: HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the
text: next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS
text: rush forward to him.
scene_heading: INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
text: INDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place,
text: sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY
text: Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO
text: MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.
scene_heading: INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
text: INDY grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from a table. He hands
text: the case to HENRY and they begin to run.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Come on Dad.
scene_heading: INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY
text: INDY and HENRY step into an empty room.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dead end.
text: HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches
text: frantically for an exit.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: There's got to be a... a secret
text: door around. A passageway or
dialog: something.
text: INDY begins to run his hands over the wallsfrantic.
speaker_heading: HENRY

text: HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at
text: INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI
text: INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through
text: the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: ... the solution presents itself.
text: HENRY follows INDY down the staircase.
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY
text: The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY CAVERN
text: beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.
text: A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. We see
scene_heading: MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Great. More boats.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: INDY boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Would you say this has been just
dialog: another typical day for you? Huh?
text: HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (ironically)
dialog: Ooofl No! It's been better than
dialog: most.
text: INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Come on, Dad. Come onl
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What about the boat? We're not
dialog: going on the boat?
scene_heading: INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY
text: VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS enter the room and spot the spiral staircase
text: leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY
text: as VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS rush to the dock. Vogel sees that a motorboat
text: is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers into a boat.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART
text: as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE
text: DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.
text: VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.
scene_heading: STRAIGHT CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
text: INDY looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, but HENRY
text: appears worried.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Ha!
scene_heading: FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES
text: They chase down the road after INDY and HENRY.
text: INDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps
text: as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along
text: a higher road running in the same direction.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY
text: INDY approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the NAZI SOLDIERS
text: approaches from a higher road.
text: A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as INDY and
text: HENRY SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Halt! Halt!
text: THE NAZI SOLDIER rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier--
text: IT SHATTERS.
speaker_heading: INDY AND HENRY
text: INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar pastit snaps off in his hand.
text: The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He
text: unshoulders his machine gun.
text: INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his
dialog: motorcycle.
scene_heading: THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE
text: drives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse,
text: COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.
text: The remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen
text: comrades and continues the chase.
speaker_heading: INDY AND HENRY
text: As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun,
text: preparing to fire.
text: INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the
text: Nazi's front wheel.
text: The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: INDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to
text: see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the
text: way to BERLIN or VENEDIG.
text: Indy starts down the road marked VENEDIG.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Stop!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Stop! Stop!
text: The motorbike skids to a stop.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You're going the wrong Way! We
dialog: have to get to Berlin!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (pointing towards
dialog: Venedig)
dialog: Brody's this way.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: My Diary's in Berlin.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: You don't need the Diary, Dad.
text: Marcus has the map.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: There is more in the Diary than
dialog: just the map.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: All right Dadtell me.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Well, he who finds the Grail must
dialog: face the final challenge.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What final challenge?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Three devices of such lethal
dialog: cunning.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Booby traps?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh, yes. But I found the clues
dialog: that will safely take us through,
dialog: in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: But what are they? Can't you
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I wrote them down in my Diary so
dialog: that I wouldn't have to remember
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Half the German Army's on our
dialog: tail and you want me to go to
dialog: Berlin? Into the lion's den?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Yes! The only thing that matters
dialog: is the Grail.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What about Marcus?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Marcus would agree with me.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Two selfless martyrs. Jesus
dialog: Christl
text: HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any
text: means entirely by the blow itself.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: That's for blasphemy. The quest
dialog: for the Grail is not archaeology.
dialog: It's a race against evil.
dialog: If it is captured by the Nazis,
dialog: the armies of darkness will march
text: all over the face of the earth.
dialog: Do you understand me?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: This is an obsession Dad. I never
dialog: understood it. Never. Neither
dialog: did Mom.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh yes, she did. Only too well.
dialog: Unfortunately she kept her illness
dialog: from me until all I could do was
text: mourn her.
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY
text: Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES
text: IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT
text: A Nazi Rallya book-burning is in process.
text: The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College
text: Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.
text: Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically
text: from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous
dialog: crowd.
text: INDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi
text: Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes
dialog: too big.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: My boy, we are Pilgrims in an
dialog: unholy land.
text: Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG
scene_heading: HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:
speaker_heading: THE PODIUM
text: where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as
text: they oversee the rally.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: ELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi
text: Officers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she
text: knows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?
text: Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: How did you get here?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Where is it? I want it.
text: INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the
text: Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: You came back for the book?
dialog: Whv?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: My father didn't want it
text: incinerated.
text: She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Is that what you think of me?
dialog: I believe in the Grail, not the
dialog: Swastika.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (vicious)
dialog: Yet you stood up to be counted
dialog: with the enemy of everything the
dialog: Grail stands forwho gives a
dialog: damn what you think?
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: (hard and fast)
dialog: You do.
text: Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: All I have to do is squeeze.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: All I have to do is scream.
text: It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And
dialog: the same goes for screaming.
text: INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He
text: moves over to HENRY.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I've got it. Let's get the hell
dialog: out of here.
text: They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage
text: coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's
dialog: signature.
text: HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It
text: only lasts a moment but the moment is electric.
text: HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first
text: page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD - BERLIN, GERMANY- DAY
text: Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.
scene_heading: INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - DAY
text: A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S PICTURE to Nazi
text: Soldiers inside the terminal.
text: HENRY leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as INDY enters down the stairs
text: and taps Henry's shoulder.
text: They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What did you get?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I don't know. The first available
dialog: flight out of Germany.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Good.
text: INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of
text: passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:
speaker_heading: MOORED ZEPPELIN
text: Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying in the grand tradition!
scene_heading: INT. THE ZEPPELIN - PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DAY
text: The Zeppelin is about to take off. INDY and HENRY make themselves comfortable
text: in one of the compartments.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Well, we made it.
text: HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: When we're airborne, with Germany
dialog: behind us, then I'll share that
dialog: sentiment.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Relax.
text: But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:
scene_heading: VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT
text: rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!
speaker_heading: INDY
text: sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper.
text: A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and
text: HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the
text: Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk
text: up a flight of stairs.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
text: now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a
text: newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the
text: Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Haben sie disen Mann gesehen?
text: The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the
dialog: picture to other Passengers.
speaker_heading: FEMALE PASSENGER
dialog: Nein.
speaker_heading: INDY (O.S.)
dialog: Fahrscheine, bitte.
speaker_heading: MALE PASSENGER
dialog: Nein.
text: VOGEL turns to see:
speaker_heading: INDY
text: WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD.
speaker_heading: MALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: Ich habe ihn night gesehen.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Tickets please.
text: The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
text: approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his
text: walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Guten Tag, Herr Jones.
text: Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Fahrscheine meine Herr.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Weg.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Tickets please.
text: HENRY looks confused.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Was?
text: VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face,
text: knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT
text: THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below.
text: Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (in German; with a
dialog: shrug)
dialog: No ticket.
text: Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY
text: VOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him,
text: revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at
text: the rising Zeppelin.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!
scene_heading: INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY
text: INDY and HENRY together again in their compartment.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You know, sharing your adventures
dialog: is an interesting experience.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: INDY
speaker_heading: (meaning ELSA)
dialog: That's not all we shared. It's
dialog: disgraceful. You're old enough to
dialog: be her fa---er, her grandfather!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Well, I'm as human as the next
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I was the next man.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Ships that pass in the night...
text: HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Do you remember the last time we
dialog: had a quiet drink? I had a milk
dialog: shake.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Hmmm... What did we talk about?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: We didn't talk. We never talked.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: And do I detect a rebuke?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: A regret. It was just the two of
dialog: us, Dad. It was a lonely way to
dialog: grow up. For you, too. If you
dialog: had been an ordinary, average
dialog: father like the other guys' dads,
dialog: you'd have understood that.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Actually, I was a wonderful father.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: When?
text: HENRY looks up from his Diary.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Did I ever tell you to eat up?
dialog: Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do
dialog: your homework? No. I respected
dialog: your privacy and I taught you self-
dialog: reliance.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What you taught me was that I was
dialog: less important to you than people
dialog: who had been dead for five hundred
dialog: years in another country. And I
dialog: learned it so well that we've
dialog: hardly spoken for twenty years.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You left just when you were
dialog: becoming interesting.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad, how can you --?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Very well. I'm here now.
text: He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What do you want to talk about?
dialog: Hmmm?
text: INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Well... I can't think of anything.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Then what are you complaining
dialog: about?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Look, we have work to do. When
dialog: we get to Alexandretta we will
dialog: face three challenges.
dialog: (he reads from the
dialog: Diary)
dialog: "First, the breath of God. Only
text: the penitent man will pass.
dialog: Second, the Word of God, only in
dialog: the footsteps of God will he
dialog: proceed. Third, the Path of God,
text: only in the leap from the lion's
dialog: head will he prove his worth. "
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I don't know. We'll find out.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Sunlight falls across the table from the window. INDY reaches for the drink. The
text: bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks.
text: We see INDY puzzled. Only for a moment.
speaker_heading: INDY
text: They're turning around. They're
dialog: taking us back to Germany.
scene_heading: INT. FRAMEWORK OF ZEPPELIN - DAY
text: INDY and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin.
text: The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed.
text: INDY and HENRY hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a PAIR OF
text: DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Well, I thought it would take
dialog: them a lot longer to figure out
dialog: the radio was dead. Come on,
dialog: Dad. Move!
text: Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also
text: see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK &amp; CRANE
speaker_heading: DEVICE.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Come on, Dad. Come on!
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY
text: INDY climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as HENRY takes the tail gunner's
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (with delight)
dialog: I didn't know you could fly a
dialog: plane.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Fly--yes. Land--no.
scene_heading: INT. THE BIPLANE - DAY
text: INDY turns in his seat to give HENRY the "thumbs up." Henry smiles valiantly
text: and points down to the ground.
text: Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies behind them.
text: Something between a ROAR and a WAIL.
scene_heading: TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS
text: streak out of the clouds and race across the sky.
speaker_heading: INDY AND HENRY
text: shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they
text: are) SCREAM past on either side.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad, you're gonna have to use the
dialog: machine gun. Get it ready.
text: HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (turning; pointing)
dialog: Eleven o'clock!
text: HENRY pulls out his watch.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dadeleven o'clock!!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What happens at eleven o'clock?
text: INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Twelveeleventen. Eleven
dialog: o'clock. Fire!
text: HENRY doesand the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat.
text: Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding
text: Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blurmaking
text: wide turns miles away in the sky.
text: HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger
scene_heading: --RATTA-A-TAT-TAT! RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!
text: The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but HENRY keeps it in his gun sight. Henry
text: swings the gun around, inadvertently CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN
speaker_heading: HALF.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad, are we hit?!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: More or less.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
text: INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father.
text: The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Hang on, Dads We're going in!
text: HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.
scene_heading: EXT. A FIELD - DAY
text: The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE SKIDS and
text: CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending
text: a cloud of dust into the air.
text: As INDY pulls himself from the cockpit:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Nice landing.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:
scene_heading: TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS
text: coming in low. Guns BLAZING.
text: As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone
text: barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Those people are trying to kill
dialog: us!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I know, Dadl
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's a new experience for me.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: It happens to me all the time.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
text: An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward,
dialog: startling the Old Man.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY
text: INDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel.
text: HENRY is a very nervous passenger.
text: INDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE
speaker_heading: MIRROR.
text: As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them,
text: narrowly missing the car.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: This is intolerable!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: This could be close.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY
text: The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE.
text: The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING.
text: The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It
text: SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS.
scene_heading: INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY
text: The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet
text: down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the
text: pavement and the sides of the tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR - DAY
text: Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE
text: gaining on them; about to overtake them.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Faster, boy --faster!
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
text: The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the
text: road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and
text: EXPLODES in the middle of the road.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR - DAY
text: As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Well, they don't come any closer
dialog: than that!
text: HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING
text: out of the sky toward them.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY
text: The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in
text: the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet.
speaker_heading: THE CAR
text: FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY
text: INDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad, he's coming back.
text: INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:
scene_heading: A DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY
text: INDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his
text: pants. He opens the chamberthe GUN HAS NO BULLETS.
scene_heading: THE MESSERSCHMIDT
text: swings around and is coming in for another pass.
speaker_heading: INDY AND HENRY
text: exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no
text: place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.
text: Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and
text: shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...
text: THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.
speaker_heading: INDY
text: Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then
text: THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea
text: gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a
text: FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE
speaker_heading: ENGINE.
text: ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies
text: and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.
text: INDY stands as beforestunneda statue.
text: HENRY walks back to INDY.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I suddenly remembered Charlemagne.
dialog: "Let my armies be the rocks and the

speaker_heading: DONOVAN

speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: You're welcome.
text: Somebody else is also taking note...and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the

text: ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: We have no time to lose. Indiana
text: Jones and his father have escaped.
scene_heading: EXT. ISKENDERUN STREET - DAY
text: SALLAH drives his car through the crowded streets, INDY beside him and HENRY
text: in the back seat.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: We go this way.
text: SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Get that camel out of the way!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Ah, they set out across the desert
dialog: this afternoon. I believe they

text: HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Now they have the map! And in
dialog: this sort of race, there's no
dialog: silver medal for finishing second.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: Elsa and Donovan's partyconsisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, OPEN CAR, TUhKISH
text: SOLDIERS RIDING CAMELS, SPARE HORSES AND A TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER
text: VEHICLESall moving along through the ramble of this box canyon.
text: ELSA, DONOVAN and VOGEL travel in the open car. The TANK is a vintage World
text: War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish soldiers wear native dress and
text: carry both carbines and sabers.
text: BRODY sits alongside ELSA in the rear of the car carrying DONOVAN. Donovan
text: hands a canteen back to him.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: I'd rather spit in your face.
dialog: But as I haven't got any spit...
text: VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: We must be within three or four
dialog: miles. Otherwise we are off the
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to
speaker_heading: DONOVAN.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Well, Marcus, we are on the brink
dialog: of the recovery of the greatest
dialog: artifact in the history of mankind.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: You're meddling with powers you
dialog: cannot possibly comprehend.
text: HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the
text: distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay.
dialog: They've got a tank. Six-pound
dialog: gun.
text: Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.
text: What he sees is:
text: THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What do you think you're doing?!
dialog: Get down!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad, we're well out of range.
text: At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.
text: It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and
text: SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: That car belonged to my brother-
dialog: in-law.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (gesturing to the
dialog: others)
dialog: Come on--come on!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: I can't see anyone up there.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Maybe it wasn't even Jones.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: No. It's him all right. He's
dialog: here somewhere.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
speaker_heading: (to VOGEL)
text: Put Brody in the tank.
text: KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
speaker_heading: (to ELSA)
dialog: Well, in this sun, without
dialog: transportation, they're as good
dialog: as dead.
text: BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck.
text: A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him.
scene_heading: KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA
text: and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: It's Jones, all right.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP
text: INDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch
text: Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Now, who are all these people?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Who cares? As long as they're
dialog: keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you
dialog: stay here while Sallah and I
dialog: organize some transportation.
text: CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the
text: DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.
text: TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE,
text: killing one of Kazim's Brethren.
text: The battle continuesa fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and
text: MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.
speaker_heading: INDY AND SALLAH
text: crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst
text: camels and horses.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I'm going after those horses.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: I'll take the camels.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I don't need camels.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: But, Indy
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: No camels!
speaker_heading: DONOVAN AND ELSA
text: They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet.
text: ELSA looks saddened.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
speaker_heading: (re KAZIM)
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: KAZIM
dialog: A messenger from God. For the
dialog: unrighteous, the Cup of Life
text: holds everlasting damnation.
text: KAZIM dies.
speaker_heading: INDY
text: leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to
text: the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; INDY mounts the
text: horse, knocking both Turks to the ground.
scene_heading: INT. THE TANK - DAY
text: BRODY has been left alone in the tank. HENRY climbs down into the tank and
text: taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Marcus!
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Arghhh! Oh!
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They exchange an old University Club toast, swinging their arms at one another
text: and missing. Then HENRY flaps his arms and tugs his ears.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: "Genius of the Restoration"
text: Now BRODY tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: "aid our own resuscitation!"
text: They exchange a handshake.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Henryl What are you doing here?!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's a rescue, old boys Come on.
text: As HENRY starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS DROP DOWN from
text: above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed by VOGEL.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
speaker_heading: (re HENRY)
dialog: Search him.
text: The NAZI SOLDIERS point their guns at HENRY and BRODY.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
speaker_heading: (to HENRY)
dialog: What is in this book? That
dialog: miserable little Diary of yours!
text: VOGEL removes a glove and slaps HENRY with it.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Here's the map. The book is
dialog: useless, and yet you come all the
dialog: way back to Berlin to get it.
dialog: Why?
text: He slaps HENRY again.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: What are you hiding?
dialog: Another slap.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: What does the Diary tell you that
dialog: it doesn't tell us?!
text: VOGEL reaches out to slap HENRY yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It tells me that goose-stepping
dialog: morons like yourself should try
dialog: reading books instead of burning
dialog: them.
text: DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
text: Colonel? Jones is getting away.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
speaker_heading: (indicating HENRY)
dialog: I think not, Herr Donovan.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK - DAY
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Not that Jonesthe other Jones!
speaker_heading: NAZI SOLDIER
dialog: Herr Colonel!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: INDY rides away on one horse, leading three others as he goes.
text: SALLAH approaches on horseback leading five camels.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Sallah, I said no camels! That's
dialog: five camels. Can't you Count?
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Compensation for my brother-in-
dialog: law's car. Indy, your father and
dialog: Brody
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Where's my father?
speaker_heading: SALLAH
text: They have them. In the belly of
dialog: that steel beast.
text: INDY and SALLAH charge forward leading their horses and camels.
text: Then VOGEL commands the Tank Driver to give chase.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: VOGEL shouts to the Tank Driver.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Fire!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: The tank starts firing at INDY on horseback. Indy zigs and zags as the tank fires
text: two rounds at Indy, barely missing him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume
text: of desert dust, hanging like a toadstool in the air.
scene_heading: INT. TANK- DAY
text: HENRY and BRODY hold their hands over their ears.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: DONOVAN shouts orders to the Troops. INDY is followed by various vehicles in
dialog: the caravan.
text: INDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far.
text: Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank,
text: turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.
text: POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT
text: VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with
speaker_heading: INDY.
text: Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on
text: collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.
text: The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan
text: becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of
text: the six-pound cannon on the turret.
text: INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of
text: a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about
text: inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.
scene_heading: INT. TANK- DAY
text: VOGEL shouts to the Gunner.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Der Kubelwagon sprengen!
text: The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE
text: KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES. The tank drives through the
text: resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: INDY gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging
text: several rocks inside. Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: A NAZI SOLDIER pushes HENRY away from the window.
speaker_heading: NAZI SOLDIER
dialog: Keine Bewegung.
text: He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY.
speaker_heading: NAZI SOLDIER
dialog: Keine Bewegung.
text: The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into
text: the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke.
text: BRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: INDY rides his horse alongside the tank.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad! Dad! Dad!
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: HENRY and BRODY still held at gunpoint by the NAZI SOLDIER.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Junior? Junior? Junior!
text: The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. VOGEL emerges
text: and aims his gun at INDY.
text: INDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse.
text: INDY pulls the trigger againhis gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the
dialog: high trail.
text: Now INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of
text: the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - VOGEL
text: Hate-staring at INDY
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP - INDY
text: Hate-staring back at VOGEL.
text: Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SIDE ANGLE
text: One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a
text: galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY.
text: INDY is struggling with a German's Luger.
text: INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a
text: shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes
text: through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top
text: and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.
dialog: 
text: Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he
text: grabs INDY. They struggle and fall.
text: INDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's
dialog: neck.
scene_heading: INT. TANK- DAY
text: INDY appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by
speaker_heading: VOGEL.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
text: He drops the gun down into the tank.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad! Dadl Get it!
text: VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around
text: his neck.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK - DAY
text: A NAZI SOLDIER approaches.
text: INDY hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi Soldier screams as he
text: is dragged under the rolling tank.
text: Now INDY and VOGEL struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around
text: Indy's neck.
scene_heading: INT. TANK- DAY
text: THROUGH THE PERISCOPE
text: We SEE INDY and VOGEL struggling atop the tank. Indy lifts his feet, lunging
text: toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him.
text: INDY's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: The NAZI SOLDIER looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then
text: turns back to it.
text: THROUGH THE PERISCOPE
text: INDY's face, still pressed against the lens.
text: VOGEL pulls INDY from the periscope.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: The NAZI SOLDIER pulls away from the periscope again.
speaker_heading: PERISCOPE SOLDIER
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Diese Amerikane. Sie Kampfen wie
dialog: Weiber.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK - DAY
text: INDY now lies on top of VOGEL. He kicks out at the periscope which spins
dialog: around.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE SOLDIER in the head.
text: He falls against the NAZI SOLDIER guarding HENRY and BRODY.
text: HENRY pushes the NAZI SOLDIER aside and grabs the gun. The PERISCOPE
text: SOLDIER struggles to take the gun from Henry.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK- DAY
text: VOGEL holds the chain around INDY's neck, pushing his head downward toward
text: the revolving tread.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: The PERISCOPE SOLDIER holds HENRY from behind, forcing the gun toward him.
text: Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen from his coat pocket.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: As the PERISCOPE SOLDIER pulls on HENRY's face, Henry lifts the fountain pen
text: and squirts ink into his face. The Soldier falls, his head smashing into the wall of
text: the tank. At the same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Henry, the pen
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: But don't you see? The pen is
text: mightier than the sword.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
text: A troop truck pulls near the tank.
scene_heading: INT. TANK- DAY
text: HENRY fires the TANK GUN at the troop truck. SOLDIERS FLY INTO THE AIR.
text: The TROOP TRUCK flips over and EXPLODES.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK - DAY
text: The EXPLOSION knocks INDY off the tank and onto the tread. He grabs onto the
text: shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank.
text: VOGEL looks down at INDY and smiles smugly.
text: The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As INDY tries to secure footing, VOGEL
text: steps on his hands.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: BRODY looks at HENRY.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Look what you didl
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's war.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK - DAY
text: VOGEL now swings a shovel at INDY, smashing at his hands.
text: BRODY climbs up out of the tank, followed by HENRY.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Didn't I tell you it was a rescue,
dialog: huh?
text: A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls HENRY down.
text: VOGEL raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on INDY,
text: still hanging from the protruding gun.
text: INDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of
text: his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending
text: stones tumbling down over him.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: The NAZI SOLDIER knocks HENRY into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the
dialog: face.
text: As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head
text: with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air.
text: The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is
text: manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS
text: AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH
text: THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver
text: slumps forward, his body depressing the levers.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK - DAY
text: INDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely
text: missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull
text: himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then
text: peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You call this archaeology?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Get out of there, Dad!
text: INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the
text: tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs
text: Vogel's arm.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: How does one get off this thing?
text: As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the
text: backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK- DAY
speaker_heading: HENRY
speaker_heading: (to INDY)
dialog: Where's Marcus?!
text: Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks
text: but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving
dialog: tread.
text: INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside.
text: As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with
text: lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around
text: Henry's right ankle.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad!
text: HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto
text: the end of the bullwhip.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Hang on, Dad!
text: SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Father of Indygive me your
dialog: hand!
text: VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still,
text: INDY refuses to let go of the whip.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Sallah! Get Dadl
text: SALLAH reaches out to HENRY.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Give me your hand!
text: SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the
text: cliff's edge.
text: INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away
text: from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.
speaker_heading: INDY
text: looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror. We SEE his
text: HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
text: He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top
dialog: of his lungs!
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT
text: The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY
text: HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage
dialog: of the tank.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Junior?!
text: We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Indy?!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh, God. I've lost him. And I
dialog: never told him anything. I just
dialog: wasn't ready, Marcus. Five
dialog: minutes would have been enough.
text: And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM.
text: He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below
text: with a bewildered expression.
text: Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.
text: HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he
text: throws his arms around him.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I thought I'd lost you, boy.
text: After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's
text: embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him.
text: He hugs his father back.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I thought you had too, sir.
text: BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Wellwell done! Come on!
text: HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff
dialog: edge.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to
text: see INDY still sitting on the ground.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Let's go then. why are you
dialog: sitting there resting when we're
dialog: so near the end? Come on
dialog: let's go!
text: HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly
text: the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY
text: DONOVAN peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE CRESCENT
text: MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to ELSA.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
text: Now ELSA peers through the binoculars.
scene_heading: EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY
text: INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING
text: WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger.
text: Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian
text: facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles,
text: camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE - DAY
text: INDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see:
text: THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER
text: He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath.
dialog: What's going on here?
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE
text: THE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT
text: COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.
speaker_heading: ELSA AND DONOVAN
text: watch him from a safe distance.
speaker_heading: THE TURK
text: is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't
text: notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED.
text: THE TURK stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier.
speaker_heading: THE TURK
text: takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROARA WHOOSH
text: of airbut we SEE NOTHINGexcept THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND
text: BOUNCE across the ground.
scene_heading: INDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH
dialog: react to the sight.
speaker_heading: ELSA AND DONOVAN
text: She looks at him, horrified.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Helmut, another volunteer!
text: TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...
text: The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and
text: his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE
text: INDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers.
text: ELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues
text: more coldly.
speaker_heading: ELSA
speaker_heading: (to INDY)
dialog: I never expected to see you again.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I'm like a bad penny. I always
dialog: turn up.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Step back now, Doctor Schneider.
dialog: Give Doctor Jones some room. He's
dialog: going to recover the Grail for us.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: INDY laughs.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Impossible? What do you say,
dialog: Jones? Ready to go down in
dialog: history?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: (scornfully)
dialog: Nazis?!Is that the limit of
dialog: your vision?! The Nazis want to
dialog: write themselves into the Grail
dialog: legend and take on the world.
dialog: Well, they're welcome. But I want
dialog: the Grail itself. The cup that
dialog: gives everlasting life.
dialog: Hitler can have the world, but
dialog: he can't take it with him. I'm
dialog: going to be drinking my own health
dialog: when he's gone the way of the
dialog: Dodo.
dialog: (he draws his
dialog: pistol)
dialog: The Grail is mine, and you're
dialog: going to get it for me.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: You know something, Doctor Jones?...
dialog: you're absolutely right.
text: Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters
text: his side below the ribs.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad?!
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Junior. . .
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: No!!
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
speaker_heading: ( to ELSA)
dialog: Get back!
text: HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to
dialog: his assistance.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: INDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.
text: DONOVAN points the gun at him:
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: You can't save him when you're
dialog: dead.
text: INDY hesitates.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: The healing power of the Grail is
dialog: the only thing that can save your
dialog: father now. It's time to ask yourself
dialog: what you believe.
text: INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of
text: him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent
text: reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their
dialog: different emotions
text: INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: "The Breath of God... Only the
dialog: penitent man will pass. Only
dialog: the penitent man will pass. . . "
text: INDY takes a few steps forward.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: "The penitent man will pass.
dialog: The penitent man..."
text: INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.
text: HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (in a raspy voice)
dialog: "Only the penitent man will pass.
dialog: Only the penitent man will pass."
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (quietly to himself)
text: The penitent man will pass. The
dialog: penitent... the penitent. The
dialog: penitent man...
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: The penitent man. The penitent...
text: INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: INDY
text: The penitent man is humble before
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Penitent. Penitent...
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: The penitent man is humble...
text: The cobwebs begin to move....
speaker_heading: INDY
text: He kneels before God.
dialog: (to himself; suddenly)
dialog: Kneel!!
text: We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of
text: kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.
text: Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up.
text: From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR
scene_heading: SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.
text: INDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a
text: SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden
text: wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope
text: around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I'm through!
speaker_heading: ELSA AND DONOVAN
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: We're through!
text: BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
speaker_heading: (to HENRY)
dialog: He's all right.
text: HENRY shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No.
dialog: BACK TO INDY
text: holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: "The second challenge is the
dialog: Word of God. Only in the
dialog: footsteps of God will he proceed."
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: The Word of God... The Word of...
text: INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is
text: engraved with a letter.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: "Proceed in the footsteps of the
dialog: Word."
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: lifts his head painfully.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: The Word of God...
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: No, Henry. Try not to talk.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: The Name of God...
dialog: BACK TO INDY
text: as he studies the cobblestones before him.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: The Name of God... Jehovahl
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: But in the Latin alphabet,
text: "Jehovah" begins with an "I."
dialog: BACK TO INDY
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: "J."
text: INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his
text: hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: reacts.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh dear!
dialog: BACK TO INDY
text: who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand.
speaker_heading: INDY
text: In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with
dialog: an "I." "I"...
text: Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward.
text: DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: "E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...
text: INDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:
speaker_heading: THE GREAT ABYSS
text: INDY stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze
text: through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across,
text: nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.
dialog: BACK TO INDY
text: He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: "The path of flood. Only in the
dialog: leap from the lion's head will
dialog: he prove his worth."
text: INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into
text: the rock above his head is the head of a lion.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Impossiblel Nobody can jump this!
text: INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it
text: is asking him to do.
speaker_heading: BRODY
text: rushes forward and calls to INDY.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Indy... Indy, you must hurry!!
dialog: Come quickly!
dialog: BACK TO INDY
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: It's... a leap of faith. Oh,
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: calls to his son.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You must believe, boy. you must...
dialog: believe.
text: We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We
text: see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is
text: going to fall 100 feet to his death. And thenhe doesn't! He appears to be held
text: up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.
text: INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.
text: Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks
text: 100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with
text: lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet
dialog: are stepping.
text: It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in
dialog: perfect alignment with everything we see below.
text: When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect
text: alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and
text: he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.
text: Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.
text: A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a
text: hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all
text: glitter and shine.
text: INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that
text: a man is praying at the altarl
text: He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL
speaker_heading: KNIGHT.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT
text: But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.
dialog: Perhaps we see his eyes.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,
text: prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at
text: Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too
text: much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt
text: to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy
text: approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: I knew you'd come, but my strength
dialog: has left me.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: The last of three brothers who
dialog: swore an oath to find the Grail
dialog: and to guard it.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: That was seven hundred years ago.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
text: A long time to wait.
text: The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: You're strangely dressed...for a
dialog: knight.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I'm not exactly...a knight. What
dialog: do you mean?
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: I was chosen because I was the
dialog: bravest and the most worthy. The
dialog: honor was mine until another came
dialog: to challenge me to single combat.
dialog: I pass it to you who vanquished me.
text: The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (gulp)
dialog: Listen, I don't have time to
dialog: explain, but
text: At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display
dialog: of cups.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Which one is it?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: You must choose.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But choose wisely. For as the
dialog: True Grail will bring you life
dialog: the False Grail will take it from
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: I'm not a historian. I have no
dialog: idea what it looks like. Which
dialog: one is it?
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Let me choose.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Thank you, Doctor.
text: ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.
text: ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.
text: DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than
dialog: I'd ever imagined. This certainly
dialog: is the cup of the King of Kings.
text: DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: Eternal life!
text: DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.
text: Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He
text: grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . .
dialog: me. . .?
text: He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks.
text: Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes.
text: ELSA gasps and screams.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?
text: His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits.
text: His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS
text: INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: He chose...poorly.
text: INDY studies the array of chalices.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: It would not be made out of gold.
text: INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: That's the cup of a carpenter.
text: He and ELSA exchange a look.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: There's only one way to find out.
text: INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.
text: INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.
text: A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we
text: see his wounds begin to heal.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: You have chosen wisely. But the
dialog: Grail cannot pass beyond the
dialog: Great Seal. That is the boundary
dialog: and the price of immortality.
text: CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.
text: INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.
text: The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put
text: down their guns and kneel.
text: INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to
text: his lips.
text: HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.
text: HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his
text: mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in
text: astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The
text: color returns to Henry's face.
text: HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then
text: they shift to INDY's faceand they light up even more...
speaker_heading: NAZI SOLDIERS
text: run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them.
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Drop your guns. Please.
text: The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in
dialog: surrender.
speaker_heading: INDY
speaker_heading: (to HENRY)
dialog: Dad, come on. Get to your feet.
speaker_heading: ELSA
text: steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with
dialog: possession of the Grail.
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: We have got it. Come on.
text: ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa! Elsa, don't movel
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The
dialog: Knight warned us not to take the
dialog: Grail from here.
text: A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from
text: the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away
text: from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT
text: OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.
text: ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach.
text: As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself
text: sliding forward across the slanted floor.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Junior! Junior!
text: With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless
text: she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa.
dialog: Give me your other hand,
dialog: honey. I can't hold you.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: I can reach it. I can reach it...
text: Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Elsa! Give me your hand. Give
dialog: me your other hand!
text: ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too
text: farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to
dialog: her death.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Elsa!!
text: Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his
text: hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Junior, give me your other hand!
dialog: I can't hold on!!
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I can get itI can almost
dialog: reach it, Dad.
text: INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing
dialog: can ever be retrieved.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Indiana. Indiana!!
text: INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (very calmly)
dialog: ... let it go...
text: INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands.
text: HENRY pulls him up to safety.
speaker_heading: THE GRAIL KNIGHT
text: looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush
text: from the crumbling Temple.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Dad. . .
text: The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Please, Dad...
text: INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles
text: down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he
text: watches them leave.
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON
text: INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY emerge from the Mountain Temple through
dialog: the Grecian Facade.
text: From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN IS HEARD. A
text: cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance.
text: HENRY turns to INDY.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Elsa never really believed in the
dialog: Grail. She thought she'd found a
dialog: prize.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: What did vou find, Dad?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Me?... Illumination.
text: HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What did you find, Junior?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Junior?! Dad...
speaker_heading: SALLAH
dialog: Please...What does it always
dialog: mean, this...this "Junior?"
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: That's his name. Henry Jones,
dialog: Junior.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: I like Indiana.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: We named the dog Indiana.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: May we go home now, please?
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SALLAH
speaker_heading: (to INDY)
dialog: The dog!?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You are named after the dog...
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I've got a lot of fond memories
dialog: of that dog.
text: A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh
speaker_heading: at INDY.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Ready.
speaker_heading: BRODY
dialog: Indy! Henryl Follow met I know
dialog: the way!
dialog: (to his horse)
dialog: Haaa!
speaker_heading: HENRY
speaker_heading: (to INDY)
dialog: Got lost in his own museum, huh?
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: After you, Junior.
speaker_heading: INDY
dialog: Yes, sir!
dialog: (to his horse)
dialog: Haaa!
