dialog: Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary

text: shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons
text: all in their natural tropical environment.
dialog: Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June
dialog: 1968
dialog: Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a
text: static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down
text: in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the
text: island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously
dialog: move about.
text: Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a
text: nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.
text: We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the
dialog: over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
dialog: French government held in this tropical region.
text: Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One
text: building after the next, accelerating in momentum,
text: culminating in one final EXPLOSION.
text: The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like
text: fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands
dialog: below.
text: We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,
text: unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the
text: lizard's eggs.
text: Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
text: clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the

scene_heading: 2 EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - OIL TANKER - RAINSTORM - NIGHT 2
text: Smashing through the choppy waters, barely by the storm
text: we SEE the CORI AKIDO, a Japanese oil supertanker.
dialog: Super: Pacific Ocean, present day
scene_heading: 3 INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT 3
text: We TRACK across the complicated computerized
text: navigational console that is actually steering the
text: immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v.
dialog: program playing.
text: At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an
text: overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy
text: satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.
text: Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled,
text: the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to
dialog: the console.
text: The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly
text: toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a
text: KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the
text: radio/intercom.
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: (in Japanese)
dialog: Captain. This is the bridge. We have
dialog: an emergency.
scene_heading: 4 INT. SUPERTANKER'S HALLWAYS - SAME - NIGHT 4

scene_heading: 5 INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN 5
text: The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the

speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: (in Japanese)
dialog: What's going on? What's happening?
text: Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an

text: The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up
dialog: nervously.
scene_heading: 6 INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT 6

dialog: console.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (in Japanese)
dialog: What was that!?
speaker_heading: SKIPPER
dialog: (in Japanese)
dialog: I can't tell...
text: Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is
text: HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain
text: and Skipper to the floor.
text: Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of
text: our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in
text: the Captain's eyes at the sound.
scene_heading: 7 INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 7
text: The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the
text: horrible WAILING SOUND.
text: Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something
text: enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew
text: members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.
text: Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly
text: filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the
text: crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases
dialog: them.
scene_heading: 8 INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT 8
text: The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights
text: and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls
text: in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (in Japanese)
dialog: Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the
dialog: lifeboats...
text: But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS
text: across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE
dialog: GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT 9
text: The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out
text: onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it
dialog: violently.
speaker_heading: A TARP
text: is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life
text: boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately
text: tries to hoist them up and over the side.
scene_heading: ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER
text: Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the
text: ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what
text: it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING
text: INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does.
dialog: Could that have been a CLAW?
speaker_heading: THE CREW
text: Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY,
text: several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against
dialog: the ship.
speaker_heading: THE CLAW
text: Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time
text: the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.
speaker_heading: A LIFEBOAT
text: Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following
dialog: it is the Cook.
text: Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing
text: to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES
text: something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets
dialog: go of the railing.
text: The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
speaker_heading: FLIPS OVER.

scene_heading: 11 EXT. CHERNOBYL DIRT PARK - RAIN - DAY 11
text: With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the
text: distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this
text: field of dirt.
text: Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van.
text: He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic
dialog: cases.
text: Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the
text: cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an
text: assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment.
text: Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll
text: meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young
text: and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily
dialog: together.
text: With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to
text: life. Inside one of the cases are several cables
text: attached to long SPIKES. He grabs them and dashes away.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: ..."I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up
dialog: above..."
text: Nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to
text: SHOVE the spikes into the muddy earth.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ..."The sun's in my heart and I'm
dialog: ready for love..."
text: Once firmly in the ground, he rushes back over to the
text: van and pops the hood.
scene_heading: CLOSE - VAN'S ENGINE
text: We SEE the steaming engine and a large electric car
scene_heading: BATTERY.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ..."Let the cloudy skies chase..."
text: He attaches the cables to the battery and they SPARK!
text: Nick YELPS and jumps back. Shaking off the shock, he
text: rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his
dialog: knees.
text: Suddenly, raising from the mud we see DOZENS OF
text: EARTHWORMS. Excitedly Tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass
text: jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in
dialog: his element.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ..."I'm singin' in the mud, just
dialog: scooping up my worms..."
text: Unable to hear over his Walkman, he is oblivious as an
text: enormous RUSSIAN MILITARY HELICOPTER lands right behind
dialog: him.
text: From the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter,
text: Tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several RUSSIAN
text: OFFICERS coming toward him. Nick scrambles to his feet.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (broken Russian)
dialog: Good day. I am here with

dialog: Permit. How do you say permit?
text: He goes through his pockets looking for his permits.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Dr. Nick Topopolosis?
text: Tatopoulos looks up as the Russian soldiers move past

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's Tatopoulos.
speaker_heading: TERRINGTON
dialog: The worm guy, right?
text: (extending his hand as he
dialog: approaches)

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What are they doing?
speaker_heading: TERRINGTON
dialog: You've been reassigned.
speaker_heading: NICK

scene_heading: 13 EXT. PAPEETE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - DAY 13
text: The doors to the sedans open as a group of very official

dialog: and worst of all...French.
scene_heading: 14 INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 14

scene_heading: RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - THROUGH OPEN DOOR
text: In the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Get them out of there.
text: Two of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and

text: including a video camera.
scene_heading: 15 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME 15
text: Raymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling
text: down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The
text: old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back
text: and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (in French)
dialog: Ask him what happened.
text: The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old
text: Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook
text: seems to be in a world of his own.
speaker_heading: BRIEFING OFFICER
dialog: (in English)
dialog: It's no use. He's been like this since
dialog: we fished him out of the ocean.
dialog: Whatever happened to that tanker put
text: him in a complete state of shock.
text: Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high.
text: The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed
text: by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old
text: Cook's face.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (in English)
dialog: What did you see, old man?
text: Drawn out of himself by the flame...
speaker_heading: OLD COOK

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You didn't answer my question. In

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: We have a situation on our hands that
dialog: requires your particular expertise.
scene_heading: ANGLE - DESTROYED VILLAGE HUT
text: Several soldiers and researchers are investigating the

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Look, I may work for the Nuclear
dialog: Regulatory Commission but accidents

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: We know.
text: Major Hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade
text: away from a jungle pathway. Major Hicks takes the
dialog: pathway.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you know that you just interrupted
dialog: a three year study of the Chernobyl
dialog: earthworm?
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: Yeah, you're the worm guy.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The radioactive contamination in that
dialog: area altered the earthworm's DNA! You
dialog: have any idea what that means?
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: No, but I have the feeling I'm about
dialog: to find out.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It means that due to a man made
dialog: accident the Chernobyl earthworms are
text: now over seventeen percent larger than
dialog: they were before. Mutated by seventeen
dialog: percent?
text: Major Hicks stops, turns to Nick.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: (bemused)
dialog: Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: They're enormous! A new species
dialog: created by man's recklessness. That's
dialog: what I've been trying to tell you, I'm
dialog: only a biologist. I take radioactive
dialog: samples and study them.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: Then you're perfect.
dialog: (pointing to the ground)
dialog: Here's your radioactive sample. Study
dialog: it.
text: With that Major Hicks walks away.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What sample?
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: You're standing on it.
text: Nick looks down, sees nothing.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't see it.
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Where is it?
text: We CRANE UP above him, pulling back farther and farther,
text: until we SEE he's standing inside of a 15 YARD LONG
text: GIGANTIC FOOTPRINT in the sand.
speaker_heading: NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't see it!
text: Two scientists have spread out a tape measure to

scene_heading: OVERHEAD TITLT SHOT - Foot steps...-

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: But there's no animal in the world
dialog: that can make prints like that? Is
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: We're hoping you're going to help us
dialog: figure that out.
text: The Major gestures to the many villagers who are being
text: attended to. Some are injured, others are being examined
text: for radiation. The village has been decimated.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Somebody must have seen it.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: It happened so fast no one knew what
dialog: hit them 'til is was over.
text: A jeep pulls up and PETERS, a young researcher, comes

dialog: Major Hicks...
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: (on the run)
text: Tape's in. The French finally released

speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: What could have possibly done all

text: We REVERSE ANGLE and SEE what they are staring at.

speaker_heading: ANGLE - SHIP
text: Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the
text: hull. He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking
dialog: radiation counts of the ship.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Mind if I borrow this?
text: Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the
text: cracked hull of the ship.
scene_heading: 22 INT. CARGO HULL - CONTINUOUS - DAY 22
text: Inside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship
text: are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets
text: readings from all over the area. One particular spot,
text: above him, seems slightly stronger.
text: Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and
text: puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like
dialog: the ones from Chernobyl)
text: Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp
text: shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF
scene_heading: REPTILE FLESH.
text: He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it
text: into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half,
text: SOMETHING GIVES WAY.
text: With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of
text: water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front
dialog: of him.
text: Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body
text: swings lifelessly as it hangs from above.
text: The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: PETERS
dialog: You okay, Nick?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost...
text: Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Are you looking for this?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thanks.

scene_heading: UNDERWATER - NETS - MOVING P.O.V.
text: We are moving very quickly underwater. Ahead of us are
text: some large FISHING NETS with a catch of fish carried in
text: the bunt. Quickly we are heading for a collision.
scene_heading: 23 EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - OFF NEW ENGLAND COAST - DAY 23
dialog: A great day for fishing. Slicing through the water we
text: SEE three New England Fishing TRAWLERS, the HARPO, the
text: CHICO, and the GROUCHO.
scene_heading: 24 EXT. THE HARPO - SAME - DAY 24
text: ARTHUR is at the wheel. Suddenly the engines WHINE as

scene_heading: 25 EXT. THE CHICO - SAME - DAY 25

speaker_heading: LEONARD

speaker_heading: JERRY (O.S.)
text: She's heavy in the bunt.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: That was fast.
scene_heading: 26 EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY 26
text: The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on
text: his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to
text: him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules
text: slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps.
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: The nets are full!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Then bring 'em in!
speaker_heading: DECK HAND
dialog: We can't. She won't budge!
text: Jules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship
text: ROCKS.
text: ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL
text: Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon
text: all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What is going on?
text: Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move
text: BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS!
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: She's going sternway!
speaker_heading: FIRST MATE
dialog: What the hell did we catch?
text: The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS
text: in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches
text: begin to CRACK under the building pressure.
text: The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards.
text: Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto
text: the decks of the ships.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Cut us free! Cut the nets!
text: The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs
text: an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines.
text: Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are
text: brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets.
text: Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats
text: are dragged helplessly backwards.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (screaming at his men)
dialog: Cut the damned cables!
dialog: A CABLE SNAPS!
text: Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either
text: cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops.
text: ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS!
text: Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is
dialog: freed.
speaker_heading: THE HARPO
text: Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards,
text: faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then
text: suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN,
text: dipping into the water.
text: With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER
text: WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is
text: CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE
speaker_heading: SEA.
text: For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just
text: happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath.
text: Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out
text: of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on
text: its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves
dialog: of Jules and Leonard don't.

speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Major, we just got a report of a

dialog: position, forty seven degrees
dialog: latitude, 67 longitude.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: What makes you think it's related?
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
text: The trawler was pulled under.
text: The team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to

text: traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits
text: the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred
dialog: miles off the American Eastern

dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: <i>Theropoda Allosaurus</i>. Some type of

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: So where's been hiding the last sixty

speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: The depth and breath of the ocean

dialog: kind could have survived there
text: completely undetected.
speaker_heading: NICK (O.S.)
dialog: What about the traces of radiation?
text: Everyone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding
text: his loosely scribbled notes in his hand.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The radiation is not an anomaly, it's
dialog: the clue. This creature is far too
dialog: unique on every level to be some lost
dialog: dinosaur.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: Don't tell me why it's not, tell me
dialog: what the hell it is.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What do we know? It was first sighted
dialog: off the French Polynesian Pacific. An
dialog: area that has been exposed to dozens
dialog: of nuclear tests over the last thirty
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Hence the radiation.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: More than that. I believe this is a

speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: (sarcastic)

scene_heading: ANGLE FISH MARKET

speaker_heading: MAYOR

speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: ...and I did. The city is a safer

text: Before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with

speaker_heading: CRUMBLE.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (to his aides)
dialog: What the hell....
text: People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the

text: Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we
text: SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris
text: out of its way.
scene_heading: SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT
text: Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET
text: of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and

text: After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the

speaker_heading: MAYOR

speaker_heading: SECRETARY

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: ANIMAL

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That's the problem. He did.

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Tell me that's not another goddamned

speaker_heading: ANIMAL
dialog: That's ain't no parade...
text: Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING.
text: Through the front window we SEE...
scene_heading: GODZILLA'S FOOT
text: Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Victor, wait!
scene_heading: 36 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - RAIN - DAY 36
text: Animal comes rushing out. Water sprays from displaced

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Victor, don't!
scene_heading: ANIMAL RUNNING
text: Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the

dialog: It won't fit. He SEES up ahead...
scene_heading: P.O.V. THE TAIL
text: Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks

text: alleyway.
scene_heading: 37 EXT. OTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS 37
text: His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape
text: inside as he exits the other side of the alley. He darts

text: The THUMPING is OVERPOWERINGLY LOUD. He looks up to see,
scene_heading: CARS FLIPPING, PEOPLE SCATTERING.
text: Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire
dialog: massive creature that is...
speaker_heading: GODZILLA
text: as he comes barreling towards us. The titanic lizard is
text: ferocious and agile. Swiftly he moves closer.
text: Animal's hands fumble with the tape. He JAMS it in,
text: sweating. He fingers the POWER BUTTON, the red light
text: goes on. Quickly he shoulders the camera.
scene_heading: P.O.V. THROUGH CAMERA - GODZILLA
text: Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly
text: covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about
dialog: to come down directly on us.
speaker_heading: ANIMAL
dialog: Oh shit!
dialog: Before he can do anything about it...
scene_heading: GODZILLA'S FOOT
text: Towering above him. He has no time to flinch as the

speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (quick salute)
dialog: Sergeant O'Neal, Sir.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: Any word from the Mayor's office?

speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: They've agreed to evacuate the city.

speaker_heading: ELSIE

speaker_heading: OFFICER

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't understand. How can something

speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: We're not sure. We're scanning the
dialog: area now.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
text: He probably returned to the river.
dialog: Just like everywhere else we've been,

text: Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open

text: Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't think so.
text: Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from

text: Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An

speaker_heading: SOLDIER

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Merci.
text: He opens the bag and takes out a croissant. He bites

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: But you don't know for sure!
text: Just then Sergeant O'Neal enters hurriedly. He wants to

speaker_heading: MAJOR
dialog: (controlling his temper)
dialog: Mr. Mayor, if he's not in one of those
dialog: buildings then we give the all clear.
dialog: But not until we've checked each

scene_heading: SERGEANT O'NEAL
dialog: Sir, that may be more difficult than

scene_heading: 61 INT. SUBWAY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS - SUNSET 61
text: Marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very

scene_heading: SERGEANT O'NEAL
dialog: Lt. Anderson and his men found this
dialog: late this afternoon.

scene_heading: AN ENORMOUS HOLE

scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - REVEALING THE HOLE IN THE CEILING

scene_heading: LT. ANDERSON

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: Christ. How many tunnels lead off the
dialog: island?
scene_heading: LT. ANDERSON
dialog: Only five, Sir. We've checked them

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: Have them sealed off.
scene_heading: LT. ANDERSON
dialog: And how should we do that, Sir?
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS

scene_heading: ANGLE - INSIDE DARKENED TUNNEL

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You know, he's not an enemy trying to

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: What are you suggesting?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: When I needed to catch earthworms, I
dialog: knew the best way to catch them was
dialog: not to chase them. I had to draw them
dialog: out.
scene_heading: ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS
text: Still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: All we need to do is find out what it

scene_heading: ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

speaker_heading: A FISH

speaker_heading: STEAM VENT

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: We need to open all the manhole covers

text: Then with a DEAFENING ROAR, the ground behind Nick
text: ERUPTS and GODZILLA RISES, ripping up the boulevard as
dialog: he does.

text: All around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder

speaker_heading: GAS CANISTERS
text: Firing from the air cannons, the GAS CANISTERS streak

scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - OPPOSITE CORNER

speaker_heading: ANGLE - NICK

speaker_heading: GODZILLA

speaker_heading: BLASTS!

scene_heading: MOBILE MISSILE LAUNCHERS
text: Blocking off the street in front of him. They FIRE.

scene_heading: HELICOPTER PILOT #4

speaker_heading: REPORTER #1

speaker_heading: REPORTER #2

speaker_heading: CAIMAN
text: ...Maintaining a total media blackout,

dialog: as to their progress in containing

text: She turns and sees Caiman. Quickly she ducks down and
text: moves deeper into the crowds.
text: Suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their

text: nearby. Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening.
text: The cars are BLOCKED from returning to the command tents

speaker_heading: NICK

scene_heading: NICK'S P.O.V. - MEDIA CIRCUS - CROWDS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: STREET STANDS

speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Can I help you, young man?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do you have any home pregnancy tests?
dialog: Especially ones that test for

speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: This is all we've got.
text: The Pharmacist puts onto the counter six different off

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'll take them all.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (O.S.)
dialog: You must have quite some harem.
text: Nick spins to find Audrey standing right behind him.
text: Embarrassed, Nick awkwardly pays for the tests.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You
dialog: look, wow, uh, how've you been?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It's good to see you, Nick.
text: The Pharmacist puts out Nick's change. He scoops it out
text: and we FOLLOW them as they exit together.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So you made it.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What?
text: He points to her fake press ID she's still wearing.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You're a reporter. That's what you
dialog: always wanted to be, right? I'm happy
dialog: for you. Really, I am.
speaker_heading: AUDREY

scene_heading: 108 EXT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 108
text: Nick opens the door for Audrey and follows her out.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So, you still picking apart
dialog: cockroaches?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, I'm into earthworms now. You
dialog: wouldn't be interested. They're real
dialog: "boring" creatures. Very reliable,
dialog: dependable, no surprises...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You're still mad at me, aren't you?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You just left me without a phone call,
dialog: a letter, nothing. All this time.
dialog: Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: That was eight years ago. Some people
dialog: change, you know.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Most people don't.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I'm sorry you feel that way.
text: Audrey turns and walks away. Nick regrets his behavior
text: and calls after her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight
dialog: years is a long time. Can I offer you
dialog: a cup of tea?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Sure. I'd like that.
text: There's an awkward moment as neither knows what to say.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: One, thing, though. Who'd you get
dialog: pregnant?
text: Off Nick's awkward reaction...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 109 INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - NIGHT 109
text: Nick has set up a mini-lab in his private, small, tent.
text: The home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart. Nick
text: mixes some of the contents together.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I still can't believe it. How does a
dialog: guy go from an anti-nuke activists to
dialog: working for the Nuclear Regulatory
dialog: Commission?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: When you and I use to attend rallies
dialog: in college, we helped to create
dialog: awareness. But from the inside now I
dialog: can actually effect change.
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: I never lost my idealism.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: And exactly what changes are you
dialog: trying to effect?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I have this theory that we're
dialog: inadvertently creating new species as
dialog: a direct result of what we've done to
dialog: nature.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: And you think this creature is one of
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes. The first of its kind. I found
dialog: this blood sample earlier this
dialog: evening...
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Blood sample? How close did you get to
dialog: that thing?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I got pretty close.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What else do you know about it?
text: Nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample
text: into it He takes the piece of litmus paper from one of
text: the home test boxes and dips it in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, we know he eats fish, he's of
dialog: reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's
dialog: amphibious and...
text: Nick points out the litmus paper. It turns RED.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ...he's pregnant.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Are you sure?
text: Nick gets up and starts to gather his materials.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Well, obviously these tests weren't
dialog: designed for this but fundamentally
dialog: they're looking for the same hormonal
dialog: patterns that would indicate
dialog: pregnancy.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I don't get it. If it's the first of
dialog: its kind, how can it be pregnant?
text: Excitedly Nick begins to pace.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The ultimate expression of evolution,
dialog: it reproduces asexually. Think about
dialog: it, all kinds of creatures have been
dialog: known to travel great distances for
dialog: reproduction. That's why he came to
dialog: New York. Like every species of
dialog: insufficient progenitors, he's
dialog: nesting!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Nesting?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yes. Do you realize that a creature
dialog: like this could lay as many as a dozen
dialog: eggs at a time!
text: Nick moves to the front exit of the tent.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Forgive me but I've got to get this
text: into the lab, to confirm all this.
dialog: I'll be right back.
text: Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but
text: poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to
dialog: the roof of the case she SEES...
scene_heading: INSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY
text: Happy times long ago. They're both young and in love.
text: Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's
dialog: touched.
text: Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back
text: down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled
text: FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and
text: turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook
text: appears.
speaker_heading: COOK
dialog: (filtered through t.v.)
dialog: ...Gojira...Gojira...
text: She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous
text: footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees
text: the beached cargo ship in Jamaica.
text: Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back
text: out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the
text: tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front.

speaker_heading: AUDREY

dialog: So, what do you think?
speaker_heading: ANIMAL
dialog: It's good. It's a real good piece. But
dialog: how'd you get a hold of this

text: Audrey covers her own mixed emotions.
speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: MURRAY

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: General Anderson, the problem was the

dialog: Central Park...
dialog: (points to the map)
dialog: We should be able to take him down.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Last time you didn't even scratch it!
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: You see, all we need to do is get a
dialog: better shot at it with weapons that
dialog: don't rely on heat seeking...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Um, excuse me, sir, but the
dialog: situation's more complicated than
dialog: that. The blood I recovered revealed
dialog: that the creature is either about to
dialog: lay eggs or already has.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Are you trying to tell us there's
dialog: another one of those things out
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't believe so.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Then how can it be pregnant? What is
dialog: this, the "virgin lizard?"
text: There's a smattering of laughter in the room.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, it reproduces asexually. That's
dialog: why we must find the nest. If we
dialog: don't, dozens will be born, each one
text: capable of laying eggs of its own.
dialog: Very quickly we could be looking at an
dialog: enormous population.
speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS
dialog: So after we kill the creature we'll
text: begin a search for the nest.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It may be too late by then. These eggs
dialog: will hatch very quickly.
speaker_heading: CLIVE
dialog: How could you possible know that?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: The fish. The fish we found down in

speaker_heading: GENERAL ANDERSON

speaker_heading: MAJOR HICKS

speaker_heading: GENERAL ANDERSON
dialog: Come through for you!? Major, your

speaker_heading: ANIMAL

text: He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like
text: fish, quickly he turns and RUNS.
text: But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and

text: covering of a nearby FIRE HOSE and raps it around the
text: door handles, locking it closed.
text: Suddenly a loud THUD as something begins to BANG against
text: the locked doorway.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: NICK AND AUDREY
text: Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and
text: lifeless face.
text: The stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them
text: begins to applaud nervously, then vigorously. The mob

text: heroes, surrounding them. Cheering enthusiastically.

speaker_heading: CAIMAN
dialog: We did it! We've got the exclusive!
dialog: Way to go, Audrey!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: We? I don't think so.

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Where's Raymond?

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: NICK

text: Off Audrey's confused expressions we PULL BACK, farther

text: Godzilla's mighty head laying on the end of the bridge.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 281 INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT 281
text: We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though
dialog: we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the
text: debris of the station into one of the tunnels.
text: We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft
text: of light up ahead. We move closer to it.
text: As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's
text: gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary
text: egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. CRACK. IT
speaker_heading: OPENS.
