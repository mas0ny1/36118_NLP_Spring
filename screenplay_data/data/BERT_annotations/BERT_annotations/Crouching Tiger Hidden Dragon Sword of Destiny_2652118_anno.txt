scene_heading: EXT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY
text: Security men and porters are loading wagons for a convoy.
text: As they work, we see across the lake a lone horseman entering
text: the village. One of the men recognizes him.
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: Master Li is here!
text: ANGLE ON: Li Mu Bai, thirties, powerful and handsome.
text: In the background, old Aunt Wu, at the sight of Li Mu Bai,
text: drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building.
scene_heading: INT. YUAN HALLWAY - DAY
text: Aunt Wu runs hurriedly through the halls.
speaker_heading: AUNT WU
dialog: Shu Lien!
scene_heading: INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY
text: Yu, a beautiful woman in her early 30s, is finishing packing
text: for the convoy, wrapping a few small items in a linen
text: wrapper, as Aunt Wu bursts in.
speaker_heading: AUNT WU
dialog: Li Mu Bai is here!
scene_heading: INT. YUAN PRACTICE HALL - DAY
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: How's everything?
speaker_heading: AUNT WU
dialog: Fine. Please come in.
text: Yu sits, composed, as Aunt Wu ushers Li in. Li carries a
text: large object, wrapped in silk.
text: Yu smiles.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Mu Bai...It's been too long.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: It has.
text: (he glances around
dialog: the room)
dialog: How's business?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Good. And how are you?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Fine.
text: An awkward pause.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan
dialog: Mountain. He said you were
text: practicing deep meditation.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: The mountain must be so peaceful...
dialog: I envy you. My work keeps me so
dialog: busy, I hardly get any rest.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I left the training early.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Why? You're a Wudan fighter.
dialog: Training is everything.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: During my meditation training... I
text: came to a place of deep silence...
dialog: I was surrounded by light... Time
dialog: and space disappeared. I had come
dialog: to a place my master had never told
dialog: me about.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You were enlightened?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: No. I didn't feel the bliss of
dialog: enlightenment. Instead... I was
dialog: surrounded by an endless sorrow. I
dialog: couldn't bear it. I broke off my
dialog: meditation. I couldn't go on.
dialog: There was something... pulling me
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Something I can't let go of. You
dialog: are leaving soon?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: We're preparing a convoy for a
dialog: delivery to Peking.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Perhaps I could ask you to deliver
dialog: something to Sir Te for me.
text: Li unwraps the object. It is an ancient, astonishingly
text: beautiful sword.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: The Green Destiny Sword? You're
dialog: giving it to Sir Te?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I am. He has always been our
dialog: greatest protector.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I don't understand. How can you
dialog: part with it? It has always been
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Too many men have died at its edge.
dialog: It only looks pure because blood
text: washes so easily from its blade.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You use it justly, you're worthy of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: It's time for me to leave it behind.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: So what will you do now?
text: Li doesn't reply.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Come with me to Peking. You can
dialog: give the sword to Sir Te yourself.
dialog: It'll be just like old times.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: First I must visit my master's
dialog: grave. It's been many years since
dialog: Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet
dialog: to avenge his death. And yet I'm
dialog: thinking of quitting. I must pray
dialog: for his forgiveness.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Join me once you have finished. I
dialog: can wait for you in Peking.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Perhaps.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GATE TO PEKING. DAY
text: Customs officials have just finished checking the contents
text: in a row of carriages bearing the Sun Security insignia.
text: The caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the
text: boundaries of Peking. Yu, riding a handsome horse and
text: clearly the leader, watches as her crew clears inspection.
speaker_heading: GUARDS
dialog: Ok. Pass.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Thanks. Let's go into the city.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE A DEPOT. DAY
text: Workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages.
text: Boss Giao is checking off the merchandise -- a cargo of
dialog: medicinal herbs.
speaker_heading: GIAO
dialog: Everything got here safely. I'm
dialog: much obliged.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Just doing my job.
speaker_heading: GIAO
dialog: Sun Security has been the best
dialog: since your father started it.
dialog: You're a credit to his memory.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: GIAO
dialog: I mean it.
scene_heading: EXT. DAY. PEKING
text: From a gray tiled roof, we can see Peking's magnificent grid
text: of houses extending miles and miles out, freshly painted by
text: the morning sun.
scene_heading: EXT. PEKING STREET. DAY
text: Dusty and congested as always, people, horses, and carriages
text: are fighting to get through the boulevards.
text: A group of jugglers perform at a corner.
text: Yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse.
scene_heading: INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Yu presents the sword to Sir Te.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
text: This is Li's personal sword, a
dialog: great hero's weapon! He is the
dialog: only one in the world worthy of
dialog: carrying it. It's too fine a gift.
dialog: I cannot accept it.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Sir Te! It has brought him as much
dialog: trouble as glory. Help him to
dialog: leave these troubles behind.
dialog: Otherwise, he'll never be able to
dialog: start anew.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: All right. I'll act as the sword's
dialog: custodian.
text: De Lu, the head servant, enters.
speaker_heading: DE LU
text: Governor Yu has arrived.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: I must change.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: You've always been so good to Li Mu
dialog: Bai and me. Please accept our
dialog: thanks.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: Please do not be such a stranger.
dialog: You'll stay the night as my guest.
dialog: Now, Shu Lien... tell me something.
dialog: And forgive me for prying. Your
dialog: father was a great friend to me,
dialog: and I think of you as my own
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Please, Sir Te, what is it?
speaker_heading: SIR TE
text: Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and
dialog: his warrior days... maybe he's
dialog: trying to tell you something?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: Don't be coy. I've always known
dialog: about your feelings for each other.
dialog: All these years, it's a shame...
dialog: neither of you is brave enough to
dialog: admit the truth to the other.
dialog: You're both wasting precious time.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I
dialog: aren't cowards.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: When it comes to emotions, even
dialog: great heroes can be idiots. Tell
dialog: me if Li Mu Bai is not more open
dialog: the next time you see him. I'll
dialog: give him an earful!
scene_heading: INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY
text: Yu and De Lu approach the study.
speaker_heading: DE LU
dialog: Sir Te said to leave the sword in
dialog: here.
text: De Lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman
text: inside. The woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy
text: hanging on the walls.
speaker_heading: DE LU
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'm your guest today. I am Governor
dialog: Yu's daughter.
speaker_heading: DE LU
dialog: This is Sir Te's study. You are
dialog: here to...
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I was looking for a quiet corner.
speaker_heading: DE LU
dialog: I am Sir Te's head servant. And
dialog: this is another of our guests.
scene_heading: INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY
text: Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: It's heavy for such a thin piece of
dialog: metal!
speaker_heading: YU
text: The handle is heavy. And the blade
dialog: is no ordinary metal. Still, the
dialog: sword is the lightest of weapons.
dialog: You're just not used to handling it.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: But I have had much practice. As a
text: child in the West, a platoon lived
dialog: with us. They'd let me play with
text: their weapons. The scabbard is so
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Beautiful but dangerous. Once you
dialog: see it tainted with blood, its
dialog: beauty is hard to admire. It's 400
dialog: years old.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Exquisite! You said it belongs to...
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it
dialog: to Sir Te as a gift.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior?
dialog: Why would he give his sword to Sir
dialog: Te?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You're too young to understand.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You're a sword fighter too?
text: Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath. An eerie sound
text: resonates within the study. Jen is even more impressed.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Yes, I am. But I prefer the
text: machete. Certain moves, however,
dialog: call for a sword.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Really?
text: Yu puts the sword back in the case.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: (longingly)
dialog: It must be exciting to be a fighter,
dialog: to be totally free!
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Fighters have rules too: friendship,
dialog: trust, integrity... Without rules,
dialog: we wouldn't survive for long.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I've read all about people like you.
text: Roaming wild, beating up anyone who
dialog: gets in your way!
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Writers wouldn't sell many books if
dialog: they told how it really is.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: But you're just like the characters
dialog: in the stories.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Sure. No place to bathe for days,
text: sleeping in flea-infested beds...
dialog: They tell you all about that in
dialog: those books?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You know what I mean. I'm getting
dialog: married soon, but I haven't lived
dialog: the life I want.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: So I heard. Congratulations. It's
dialog: the most important step in a
dialog: woman's life, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You're not married, are you?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: No! You couldn't roam around
dialog: freely if you were.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You're probably right.
text: Yu studies Jen. The room falls silent for a moment.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE COURT YARD - DAY
text: It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple. Jen
text: is leaving the study escorted by her maid. She turns to Yu
text: for a final good-bye. Yu seems intrigued by the encounter.
scene_heading: EXT. SIR TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Two lighted lanterns are raised up.
scene_heading: INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: Go ahead, Governor Yu.
text: Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
text: sword. He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword.
text: Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword
text: out from its sheath. The sword gives off a luminous blue
text: glow in the dark.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: Two feet 9 inches long. 1 inch
text: wide. The handle is 1 inch deep,
text: 2.6 inches wide. Seven-tenths of
text: an inch thick. With seven rubies
dialog: missing from the hilt. You can
dialog: tell the design dates back to
dialog: before the Chin era. Engraved with
dialog: a technique lost by the time of the
dialog: Han Dynasty.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR YU
dialog: Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
text: A sword by itself rules nothing.
text: It comes alive only through skillful
dialog: manipulation.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR YU
dialog: I see your point. Please continue.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: The Imperial Court isn't the
dialog: problem. With royalty and officials
text: everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps
dialog: security tight. But Peking is not
dialog: like the West. Here, you'll find
dialog: all sorts of characters. Proceed
dialog: with caution in your quest for law
dialog: and order. Don't depend only on
text: the court. Contacts in the Giang
dialog: Hu underworld can ensure your
dialog: position. Be strong, yet supple.
dialog: This is the way to rule.
scene_heading: INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: A maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then
text: walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings. Someone
text: knocks and the maid goes to answer the door.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Governess...
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
dialog: Let me do it.
text: The maid leaves as the governess enters the room.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Please sit.
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
dialog: I've made you silk pajamas. Do you
dialog: want to change into them?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Put them down.
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
dialog: I heard you met Shu Lien today.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Do you know her?
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
dialog: She's one of those. Your mother
dialog: would not want you consorting with
dialog: her kind.
text: Jen shoots her an angry look.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'll socialize with whomever I
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
dialog: Don't invite danger into your
dialog: father's house.
text: She's about to say something, then thinks better of it.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'm tired now.
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
dialog: Go to bed then. Miss has grown up,
dialog: and is getting married soon. God
dialog: knows what the future will bring.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: It will be just the same. Enough!
dialog: I'm tired.
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
dialog: Autumn is coming. I'll shut the
dialog: windows for you.
text: The governess leaves. Jen sits on the side of her bed,
dialog: thinking.
scene_heading: EXT. TE'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: A wide shot of the compound. A patrol man greets Master Bo,
text: Sir Te's head of security. The place is serene.
speaker_heading: MASTER BO
dialog: Chilly, eh?
speaker_heading: NIGHTMAN
dialog: Yes, Master Bo.
text: As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the
text: room. It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and
text: wraps the sword.
text: Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling. The
text: thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard. Bo tries to
text: stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the
text: roof as Bo yells out.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Someone help! Stop him! He's on
dialog: the roof! The sword's been stolen!
dialog: Stop thief! Stop him!
text: The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street.
text: Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting
text: people to the theft. People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among
dialog: them.
scene_heading: EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT
text: Bo runs through the streets. The thief is nowhere in sight.
text: Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing. Bo hurries
dialog: towards the source.
scene_heading: EXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two
text: other fighters -- Tsai (male, 40s) and May, his daughter.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: It's Jade Fox!
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: We must avenge mother!
text: The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over
text: a wall, just as Bo arrives.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Do something! He's getting away!
scene_heading: EXT. PEKING ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: The thief runs atop a roof -- right into Yu. Yu and the
text: hooded figure face off.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Return the sword, and I'll let you
dialog: go.
text: The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight.
text: Yu attacks, but the figure repels her.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You've been trained at Wudan?
text: The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop. Yu
text: catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series
text: of lightning-quick blows.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: You're mistaken. We're just street
dialog: performers. We were rehearsing.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Father!
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: You were rehearsing? Who are you
dialog: trying to fool?
text: May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai. They run
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Where did that thief go?
text: Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into
dialog: Governor Yu's compound.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Governor Yu's house!
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF TOP
text: Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Get down here! Give back the sword!
scene_heading: EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S - NIGHT
text: Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief.
text: A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu.
text: She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity
dialog: to get away.
text: Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the
text: empty courtyard.
scene_heading: EXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: De Lu escorts Yu into Te's.
speaker_heading: DE LU
dialog: Sir Te awaits you.
scene_heading: INT. TE'S GREAT HALL - DAY
text: Men are standing at attention. Bo is giving his account of
text: what happened, as Yu enters.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: I'm sure the thief is in the Yu
dialog: household.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: How dare you imply?
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: But I say --
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: -- Enough.
text: The men hustle out. Bo can barely contain his frustration.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: Yes, though I doubt he's involved
dialog: in this.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: But the sword could be in his
dialog: compound.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
text: Then someone's trying to set him up.
dialog: We should inform Li Mu Bai.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Madam Yu is returning from temple. The governess is helping
text: her out of the carriage. Servants are peeling bills off a
text: wall across the street.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MAID
text: Madam Yu, someone's put up posters.
text: A partially torn flyer with the words "Jade Fox will not
text: escape justice!" is seen on the ground.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: Let me see.
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
text: Someone is after Jade Fox.
dialog: Preposterous, looking for her here!
text: Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the
text: flyer away and follows her.
text: A hand scoops up the flyer -- it is Yu. She studies it,
text: then puts it in her pocket, and moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - DAY
text: Bo is searching for the Tsais. The bridge is full of
text: jugglers. But the two are nowhere to be found.
scene_heading: EXT. PEKING STREET - DAY
text: Bo quizzes a homeless man.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: I don't know. I haven't seen them
dialog: in two days.
text: Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking
text: quickly into an alley. Bo follows her.
scene_heading: EXT. IN FRONT OF TSAI'S HOUSE
text: May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken-
text: down bamboo fence. Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai
text: oiling their weapons.
scene_heading: INT. BO'S ROOM - DAY
text: Jen practices calligraphy. The governess is by her side
text: embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen. The
text: maid enters.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: There is a Miss Shu Lien here to
dialog: see you.
text: Jen stops and looks up at them.
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
text: Miss is busy right now.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: I'll tell her.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Show her in.
text: The governess shoots her a look.
speaker_heading: GOVERNESS
dialog: This spells trouble.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I have a guest.
text: The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: This way please.
text: The governess and Yu exchange quick glances. The governess
text: bows slightly and departs.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I've missed you.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'm bored.
text: Yu sees the calligraphy.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You're doing calligraphy?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'll write your name. Just for fun.
text: Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I never realized my name looks like
dialog: "sword."
text: Jen freezes slightly.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You write gracefully. Calligraphy
dialog: is so similar to fencing.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.
text: The maid enters with tea.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Thank you for seeing me. I hear
dialog: your wedding day is near. You must
text: be overwhelmed by the preparations.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'm hardly doing a thing. The less
dialog: I think of it the better. My
text: parents are arranging everything.
dialog: The Gous are a very powerful family.
dialog: My marrying one will be good for my
dialog: father's career.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You are fornuate to marry into such
dialog: a noble family.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Am I? I wish I were like the
dialog: heroes in the books I read. Like
dialog: you and Li Mu Bai. I guess I'm
dialog: happy to be marrying. But to be
dialog: free to live my own life, to choose
dialog: whom I love... That is true
dialog: happiness.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Do you think so? Let me tell you a
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: About you and Li Mu Bai?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Yes. Did you know I was once
dialog: engaged to be married?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: No, really?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was
text: a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath.
text: One day, while in battle, he was
text: killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's
dialog: enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went
dialog: through a lot together. Our
dialog: feelings for each other grew
dialog: stronger. But how could we dishonor
dialog: Meng's memory? So the freedom you
dialog: talk about, I too desire it. But I
dialog: have never tasted it.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Too bad for Meng, but it's not your
dialog: fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I am not an aristocrat, as you
dialog: are... but I must still respect a
dialog: woman's duties.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Don't distance us. From now on,
dialog: let's be like sisters.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Then as a sister, let me wish you
dialog: happiness in your marriage.
scene_heading: EXT. YU'S GARDEN - DAY
text: The maid escorts Yu out. Yu pauses, looks around, and sees
text: the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a
dialog: corner.
scene_heading: INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly
text: from bed and looks out the window. A light breeze stirs her
text: hair. The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face
text: dissolves, into...
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY
text: ...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she
text: lets the dry desert air flow through her hair. She sits in
text: a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback,
text: that is traveling through the spectacular desert. Across
text: from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: What a godforsaken place! Can't
dialog: your father be appointed closer to
dialog: civilization? Jen... are you
dialog: listening to me?
text: Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a
text: beautiful mountainside.
scene_heading: INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a
text: tree, watching Jen.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: Let's go!
text: They drop down silently and walk away. From another rooftop,
text: Lo looks silently on.
scene_heading: EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Tsai and May enter the house.
scene_heading: INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going
text: through their belongings.
text: Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's
text: mask -- revealing Bo. Tsai has another long knife at his
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Wait! I'm a friend!
text: Tsai pauses.
scene_heading: INT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)
text: May fans a small coal-fired grill that is boiling a sizzling
text: pot of vegetable and meatball soup. Her father and Bo are
text: now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: I don't care about your sword.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Why were you spying on the Yus?
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.
dialog: I'm a police inspector from Shaan
dialog: Xi, Gen Su district. Jade Fox is a
dialog: master criminal. I hear she
text: infiltrated the Yus. She must have
dialog: come with them when they transferred
dialog: here. But with Yu's reputation, I
dialog: can't just go in and accuse her.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: This Jade Fox is a woman?
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Then leave her to me.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: Pardon me, but I doubt you can
dialog: handle her. My wife was quite a
dialog: martial arts expert. Jade Fox
dialog: killed her. So you see, this is
dialog: personal. Leave her to me.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: It's ready!
dialog: (re: the soup)
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: I'm ready for anything!
text: Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks. May intercepts
text: him with her own chopsticks.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Father gets first dip.
text: Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a
text: meatball but to catch an incoming dart. A dart wrapped with
text: a note. Bo jumps up.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: They're gone.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: "We'll settle this at midnight on
dialog: Yellow Hill." Good, the fox is out
dialog: of her hole.
scene_heading: INT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to
text: another man, whose back is to her.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: Shu Lien, look who's here.
text: The man turns around -- it's Li Mu Bai.
scene_heading: EXT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT
text: Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast
text: suspicion on Governor Yu.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: But something is going on at the Yu
dialog: household.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: What have you discovered?
text: From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer. Li takes it, his
text: face darkening.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Jade Fox? Impossible.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You always suspected she'd fled to
dialog: the West.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I didn't think she'd dare come back
dialog: to Peking!
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Is there any place safer than under
dialog: the nose of Governor Yu?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: So I shall avenge my master's death
dialog: after all.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Be careful. Sir Te requires
dialog: discretion. Official business is
dialog: difficult enough. Don't let
dialog: personal feelings make it worse.
dialog: And I don't know... even this
dialog: poster... could be some sort of trap.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Did you see who posted it?
text: Yu pauses.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LI
text: It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's.
dialog: On the night of the theft there was
dialog: a brawl near Yu's. Were you
dialog: involved?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he
dialog: followed the thief to the Yus'.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Have you questioned him yet?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: No, not yet...
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: But your men are watching over Yu's
dialog: compund?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: No, I'd already sent them home.
dialog: You can blame me for losing the
dialog: sword, but please trust that I'll
dialog: get it back soon using my own
dialog: methods.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: That's not what I meant. I don't
dialog: care about the sword.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: What do you mean? Didn't you come
dialog: back here for it?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I don't know it was stolen until I
dialog: got here.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Then, why did you come?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Well, we had talked...
text: De Lu enters.
speaker_heading: DE LU
dialog: Pardon my intrusion. Master Li,
dialog: your room is ready.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Thank you. Please lead the way.
scene_heading: EXT. YELLOW HILL - NIGHT
text: Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree. Bo stifles a
text: yawn.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: The fox doesn't care much for
text: punctuality. Still no sign of her.
text: An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over
text: her face, holding a cane. The three exchange glances.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: Enough! Show yourself.
text: The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her
text: disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Tsai... you dog! You will pay for
dialog: your stubbornness.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: That's what you think, old witch!
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: If you surrender now, you'll suffer
dialog: less. But if you resist, I won't
dialog: stop until you're dead.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Father! Let me avenge my mother's
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You'll soon end up like her, you
dialog: little whore!
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: You'll pay for that!
text: A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and
text: Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when
text: the opportunity presents itself.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: (to Bo)
dialog: She's going to paralyze you!
text: Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo. May shoots an arrow at
text: her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May.
speaker_heading: TSAI
dialog: May!
text: Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill,
text: Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Tsai, you filthy mongrel! An ambush!
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Father, are you all right?
text: Li addresses Fox.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Wudan should have gotten rid of you
dialog: long ago. It's been a long time,
dialog: Jade Fox! You don't remember me...
dialog: But you should remember my master.
dialog: You infiltrated Wudan while I was
dialog: away. You stole our master! Now
dialog: it's time for you to pay!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Your master underestimated us women.
dialog: Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he
dialog: would never teach me. He deserved
dialog: to die by a woman's hand!
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: You stole the secrets of Wudan's
dialog: highest martial arts. But after
dialog: ten years of training, your moves
text: are still undisciplined. And
dialog: today, under a Wudan sword... you
dialog: will die!
text: Li easily brings Fox to the ground.
text: Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox. A figure masked
text: in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Disciple, we'll kill them all!
scene_heading: FIGURE IN BLACK
dialog: Let's go!
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Another one!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I must get rid of Tsai!
text: Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked
dialog: figure.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Who are you? Why is the Green
dialog: Destiny in your possession?
scene_heading: FIGURE IN BLACK
dialog: What's it to you?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: My name is Li Mu Bai. The Green
dialog: Destiny is mine. Jade Fox can't be
dialog: your master. Where did you learn
dialog: that "Xuan Piu" move?
scene_heading: FIGURE IN BLACK
dialog: I'm just playing around.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Tell me, who is your master?
scene_heading: FIGURE IN BLACK
dialog: Let's go!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: We must kill them!
text: Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it
text: back, hitting him in the head. Fox and the masked figure
dialog: leap away.
text: May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head.
text: Bo kneels beside her.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Father!
scene_heading: EXT. TE'S - DAY
text: Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed
text: from over the body of Tsai. Bo and May stand before them.
speaker_heading: TE
dialog: This is Tsai?
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: My father. Police Inspector from
dialog: Shaan.
speaker_heading: TE
dialog: This should be reported to Governor
dialog: Yu. The victim is an officer. You
text: believe the killer is hiding out in
dialog: his compound.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I'd bet my life on it!
speaker_heading: TE
dialog: (to Li and Yu)
dialog: Come with me.
text: He exits the room.
scene_heading: INT. TE'S STUDY - DAY
text: Te, Li, and Yu are seated.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: This needs to be resolved, and
dialog: quickly.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I'll get into the Yu household and
dialog: get her. I'll ferret out Fox and
dialog: her gang.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: We must be careful. Governor Yu is
dialog: a court official, and in charge of
dialog: security. Any disturbance will
dialog: cast suspicion on him. It might
dialog: get Sir Te in trouble.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: This is a delicate matter.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Sir Te, can you find some excuse to
dialog: invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: What do you have in mind?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: The best way to trap a fox is
text: through her cubs.
text: Sir Te and Li look puzzled.
scene_heading: EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN - DAY
text: Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen. They busy themselves with
text: various items for her trousseau.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
dialog: with these wedding gifts. She's
dialog: being so considerate.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I'm sorry she's not feeling well
dialog: enough to receive you today.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: I heard Sir Te lost something. And
dialog: now Madame Te's not feeling well...
text: Jen sits silently reading.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: We know who stole the missing item.
dialog: If the thief returns it, I'm sure
dialog: Sir Te will pursue the matter no
dialog: further.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: That's good. Sometimes the help
dialog: can't keep their hands to themselves.
text: It's very embarassing.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
dialog: people can make mistakes... that
dialog: can bring ruin to themselves and
dialog: their families.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: But don't be too lenient.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: No mercy will be shown toward the
text: murderer who turned up in Peking.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: A murderer?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Yes. The very killer of Li Mu
dialog: Bai's own master. Last night, she
dialog: killed a policeman who had tracked
dialog: her down.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: A female criminal! Now that's news!
text: Jen becomes visibly upset.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You say she killed a policeman?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Yes, from the West. He went
dialog: undercover and and followed her
dialog: here,
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: Maybe the murderer and the thief
dialog: are one and the same.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I doubt it. This thief... it very
dialog: unusual...
text: As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea.
text: As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the
text: pot slips from her hand. Without even looking down, Jen
text: instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: ...And most likely smarter than a
dialog: mere killer.
text: Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: (formal)
dialog: Greetings, Sir Te.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: Hello, Madam Yu. This is Li Mu
dialog: Bai, the renowned swordsman.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Delighted to meet you.
text: Li sizes Jen up.
speaker_heading: TE
text: Miss Yu is soon to be married.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Congratulations.
scene_heading: EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Why don't you come in?
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: I'm standing guard.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Come in. It's cold.
text: She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Come in. We don't have to fear
dialog: Jade Fox if we're together.
scene_heading: EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: A still, dark night.
scene_heading: EXT. TE'S STUDY - NIGHT
text: Something moves in the moonlight. A hooded figure jumps down.
text: Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Isn't it a bit too late to be out?
dialog: You've brought me the sword?
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: I do as I please.
text: The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with
text: incredible speed and grabs the sword from her.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Where's your master?
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: What's it to you?
text: The figure floats away. Li chases after her.
scene_heading: EXT. PEKING STREET - NIGHT
text: The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops,
text: displaying amazing floating skills.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT
text: The figure bounces into an old monastery. Li is already
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Had enough flying? You've got
dialog: potential. You've studied the
dialog: Wudan Manual but you don't
dialog: understand it. You need a real
dialog: master.
text: The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Do you think you are a real master?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Like most things, I am nothing.
dialog: It's the same for this sword. All
dialog: of it is simply a state of mind.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Stop talking like a monk! Just
dialog: fight!
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: On guard!
speaker_heading: LI
text: Real sharpness comes without effort.
scene_heading: EXT. MONASTERY - NIGHT
text: The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of
dialog: her.
text: The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her.
text: Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack.
text: The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly. Li gets even
text: more elusive, using a branch to repel her.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: No growth without assistant. No
dialog: action without reaction. No desire
dialog: without restraint. Now give
dialog: yourself up and find yourself again.
dialog: There is a lesson for you.
text: Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it
dialog: slightly.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Why should I? You need practice.
dialog: I can teach you to fight with the
dialog: Green Destiny, but first you must
dialog: learn to hold it in stillness.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Why do you want to teach me?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I've always wanted a disciple
dialog: worthy of Wudan's secrets.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: And if I use them to kill you?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: That's a risk I'm willing to take.
dialog: Deep down, you're good. Even Jade
dialog: Fox couldn't corrupt you.
text: The figure's eyes cloud with tears.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Wudan is a whorehouse! Keep your
dialog: lessons!
text: The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing
text: alone in the monastery.
scene_heading: INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jen slips in through the window. She pulls off her mask, as
text: she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You're home late... or should I say
dialog: early?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Why are you still here? You killed
dialog: a policeman. You should leave!
dialog: You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: They wouldn't have found me if you
dialog: hadn't stolen the sword. Like a
dialog: little girl, you thought stealing
dialog: would be fun? You, too, are
dialog: responsible for that death. Come
dialog: with me. You don't want to waste
dialog: your life as the wife of some
dialog: bureaucrat. Denied your talent...
dialog: As a master and disciple we will
dialog: rule.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'll never live as a thief!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You're already a thief.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: That was just for fun. How can I
dialog: leave? Where would I go?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Wherever we want. We'll get rid of
dialog: anyone in our way. Even your father.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: It's the Giang Hu fighter
dialog: lifestyle... kill or be killed.
dialog: Exciting, isn't it?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I owe you nothing.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Yes, you do! You are still my
dialog: disciple.
text: Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few
text: blows. Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's
text: pressure points, disabling her. Jen pushes her across the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You think you've been teaching me
dialog: all these years from the manual?
dialog: You couldn't even decipher the
dialog: symbols!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I studied the diagrams. But you
dialog: hid the details!
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You wouldn't have understood, even
dialog: if I had tried to explain. You
dialog: know... you've gone as far as you
dialog: can go. I hid my skills so as not
dialog: to hurt you.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: If I hadn't seen you fight with Li
dialog: Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of
dialog: all you've hidden from me.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Master... I started learning from
dialog: you in secret when I was 10. You
dialog: enchanted me with the world of
dialog: Giang Hu. But once I realized I
dialog: could surpass you, I became so
dialog: frightened! Everything fell apart.
dialog: I had no one to guide me, no one to
dialog: learn from.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Believe me, I've a lesson or two
dialog: left to teach you!
text: Fox exits.
scene_heading: EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE - DAY
text: The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back.
scene_heading: EXT. TE'S COURTYARD - DAY
text: Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully
text: at ease with the weapon. He spins around to find Yu standing
text: in the doorway.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: The sword is back... are you happy?
text: Li smiles.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I admit, getting it back makes me
dialog: realize how much I'd missed it.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: But it's not your sword anymore.
dialog: You gave it to Sir Te.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: True. But I must borrow it for one
text: last mission. Jade Fox must die at
dialog: its edge. Did you know what you
dialog: were hiding when you covered for
dialog: that girl?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: My job was to get the sword back,
dialog: without embarassing anyone. I
dialog: wasn't about to ruin her life, or
dialog: her father's.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: You did your job well. But, this
dialog: girl... I saw her last night.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I knew she would intrigue you.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: She needs direction... and training.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: She's an aristocrat's daughter.
dialog: She's not one of us. In any case,
dialog: it will all be over soon. You'll
dialog: kill Fox, and she'll marry.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: That's not for her. She should
text: come to Wudan and become a disciple.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: But Wudan does not accept women.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: For her, they might make an
dialog: exception. If not, I'm afraid
dialog: she'll become a poisoned dragon.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: It's not our affair. Even if Wudan
dialog: accepts her, her husband might
dialog: object.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I thought by giving away the sword,
dialog: I could escape the Giang Hu world.
text: But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I wish there were something more I
dialog: could do to help you.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
scene_heading: INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jen is asleep. A noise awakens her.
text: Lo opens the window and sneaks in -- right into the point of
text: Jen's waiting sword.
text: Jen's sword drops to the ground.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Lo?
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Jen!
text: Lo grabs her by the wrist.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You shouldn't have come.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: With all the traffic on your
dialog: rooftop these days... it took me a
dialog: while to get in here. I can't wait
dialog: any longer. I was wrong to let you
dialog: go. Come back with me. You'll be
dialog: happy in the desert. You'll be
dialog: free there.
text: Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You've been looking for me all this
dialog: time?
scene_heading: FLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY
text: Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it. Jen
text: admires the piece, her most prized possession.
text: Madam Yu sits opposite her.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: Jen... stop playing with it.
text: Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the
text: sky darkens.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I won't break it.
scene_heading: EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT - DAY
text: Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan.
speaker_heading: GUARD A
dialog: It's Dark Cloud! Dark Cloud is
dialog: coming!
text: His warning is useless. From Jen's pov, we see the guards
text: slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords.
speaker_heading: MADAM YU
dialog: Lower the shade, don't let them see
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: DARK CLOUD (LO)
dialog: Don't touch the women!
text: Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints. Lo approaches
text: the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.
text: She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down
text: and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse
text: flails beside him.
text: She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
text: escape on horseback.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Let's go!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Come get your comb.
text: She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and
text: flings her off her horse.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Hurry back to your mother.
text: Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY
text: A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,
text: keeping a respectable distance. They notice her and rise as
text: she dismounts.
text: One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few
text: feet away.
text: In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and
text: knocked his nose into his face. He crumples to the sand.
text: The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances,
dialog: and charge her at once.
text: In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or
text: dragging their fallen comrades back.
text: Lo calls out and stops the fight.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: She's mine.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: Lo and Jen ride, if not side-by-side, then parallel, about
text: 20 feet apart. Their pace has slowed considerably. In
dialog: fact, they're dead tired.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Let's stop a moment.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Give it back!
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: (shouting a bit)
dialog: You're tired. You need rest. Your
dialog: horse needs water. There's a creek
dialog: up here.
text: He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Well, there used to be! What's
dialog: your name? I'm Lo. The Hans call
dialog: me Dark Cloud. I'm not that tall
dialog: or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: My comb!
text: She kicks him. They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted,
text: collapses. She kicks him a few times, then collapses too.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - DAY
text: Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
text: animal fur. She sits up with a start and checks her clothes.
text: Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave. Next to her
text: are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp
text: arrows. She quickly grabs one of the arrows.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: If you like that arrow, I can make
dialog: you a bow. Great for hunting wild
dialog: chicken. They're delicious.
text: Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but
text: her legs betray her and she falls.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: You need to eat, understand? Then
dialog: you'll have the strength to fight.
dialog: Understand?
text: He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac.
text: He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts
text: grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she
text: starts to wolf it down.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: You're eating too fast. Slowly.
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE - DAY
text: Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape. A chicken
text: roasts over a fire. Lo whistles.
text: Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head.
text: Lo passes out as Jen scurries away.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT - DAY
text: Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony
text: terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered.
text: But soon she passes out.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - NIGHT
text: Jen again awakes inside the cave. Lo tries to feed her some
text: water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to
text: find that her legs and hands are tied up.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: You've got quite a temper. It's
dialog: better this way.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You coward!
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Still in a bad mood? At least
dialog: you're speaking. What's your name?
text: Jen spits at Lo.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: I didn't think the Hans had names
dialog: like that.
text: Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness. In the
text: flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.
text: Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
text: bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.
text: He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
text: dishevelled body. He comes over and unties her.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Relax. If I had wanted to, I would
dialog: already have done it. You must be
dialog: dying for a bath. Fresh water's
dialog: hard to get here. But I managed to
dialog: bring some up. You can wear my
dialog: clothes when you're done. They're
dialog: clean. Don't worry. I'll sing, so
dialog: you'll know where I am. After the
dialog: bath, you'll be calmer.
text: Jen nods and the bandit releases her. He starts to sing as
text: he walks out. Jen waits until the sound recedes before
text: closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit.
text: While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud
text: rendition of a tribal song. Lo apparently doesn't remember
text: all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few
text: passages. Jen smiles.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - NIGHT
text: Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
text: from the soles of her feet.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: No more hitting on the head! All
dialog: this trouble for a comb?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: It's mine. It means a lot to me.
dialog: A barbarian like you wouldn't
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Not true. I can use it to pick
dialog: fleas from my horse.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I
dialog: though you were a Han.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Give me back my comb.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: I don't take orders from anyone.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Give it back.
text: Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a
text: little blood from his chest. Furious, Lo lunges at her and
text: they tussle briefly. Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and
text: the scuffling becomes more like foreplay. Violence turns
text: into unleashed passion.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT OASIS - DAY
text: Lo and Jen ride across the desert. Jen holds tightly to him.
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE - NIGHT
text: Lo and Jen lie in the bath together.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: When I was a boy, one night, I saw
dialog: a thousand shooting stars. I
dialog: thought, where did they all go?
dialog: I'm an orphan. I used to look for
dialog: stars alone. I thought if I rode
dialog: to the other end of the desert, I'd
dialog: find them. I've been riding in the
dialog: desert ever since.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: And so, the little boy became a
text: fearsome bandit. He couldn't find
dialog: the stars, so he stole my comb.
text: Lo pauses.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Out here, you always fight for
dialog: survival. You have to be part of a
text: gang to stand a chance. Slowly,
dialog: your gang becomes your family. All
dialog: that Dark Cloud stuff is just to
dialog: scare people and make my life easier.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: So you're still that little boy
text: looking for shooting stars.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: I am a man. And now I've found the
dialog: brightest star of all.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Your father's men are looking for
dialog: you.
text: Jen doesn't respond.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF - DAY
text: Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff. Lo looks over,
text: viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him. They see
text: a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Your father's men are still looking
dialog: for you. They're still out there,
text: circling closer.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Let them look.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: It is trouble for me.
text: Jen bites her lip.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Don't send me back!
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: You must decide. You might get
dialog: tired of this life. You might
dialog: begin to miss your family. If it
dialog: were our daughter, we'd look for
dialog: her too. She would miss us. Jen...
dialog: I want you to be mine forever. I
dialog: will make my mark on the world. I
dialog: will earn your parents' respect.
dialog: We have a legend. Anyone who dares
dialog: to jump from the mountain, God will
text: grant his wish. Long ago, a young
dialog: man's parents were ill, so he
dialog: jumped. He didn't die. He wasn't
text: even hurt. He floated away, far
dialog: away, never to return. He knew his
dialog: wish had come true. If you believe,
dialog: it will happen. The elders say, "A
dialog: faithful heart makes wishes come
dialog: true."
scene_heading: INT. TENT - DAY
text: Jen and Lo kiss. Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair
text: and presses it into his palm. Jen starts to cry. They
dialog: embrace.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Keep it safe. Return it to me when
dialog: we are together again.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: (smiling painfully)
dialog: If you don't, I'll come after you.
dialog: And I won't let you off so easy.
scene_heading: EXT. TENT - DAY
text: Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning
text: light.
text: End of flashback.
scene_heading: INT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Wherever I went, someone always
dialog: recognized me. I really tried.
dialog: Later, I heard you came to Peking.
dialog: I was afraid I'd never see you
dialog: again. So I came. I can't let you
dialog: marry.
text: Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from
text: outside the door.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Go.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Jen...
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: (through her tears)
dialog: Don't ever come back.
text: Lo hovers at the window frame.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: So it's over?
text: Jen pauses.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Yes.
text: Lo thrusts a small object in her hand.
text: He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of
text: sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: We heard noises.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: It was just a cat.
text: The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door.
text: Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo
dialog: has given her.
scene_heading: EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY
text: The noise and color of a wedding procession. A marching
text: band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to
text: get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a
text: handsome white horse.
scene_heading: INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY
text: Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides
text: silently in the bride's carriage.
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION - DAY
text: Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city
dialog: gate.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You think Jade Fox will show up?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: She's out there, but I doubt she'll
dialog: show herself. We'll keep our eyes
dialog: open. Sooner or later, she'll come
dialog: for the girl.
scene_heading: INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE - DAY
text: A small arrow flies into the carriage. Jen calmly lifts the
text: red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the
text: panelling inside the carriage.
text: We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen
text: doesn't seem to notice.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: (v.o.)
dialog: Jen! Come with me! You're mine!
text: Lo runs wildly into the crowd.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: Come with me to the desert! Jen!
dialog: Come with me to Xin Jiang!
text: The guards surround Lo, but he escapes.
scene_heading: EXT. BEIJING STREET - DAY
text: Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers
text: pressed against Lo's neck. Yu comes running around the
text: corner and sees them.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Where is Jade Fox?
text: Yu jumps in and pushes Li away.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: (to Lo)
dialog: Come with me! Hurry!
scene_heading: INT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY
text: Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who
dialog: look him over.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: (to Lo)
dialog: You thought she'd give it all up
dialog: and go back West with you?
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: She's mine.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Either way, you are no good to her
text: dead. With the Gou and Yu clans
dialog: hunting you, you'll soon be in
dialog: their hands.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: I don't care anymore.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: If you truly loved her, you wouldn't
dialog: say that.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Don't you want to see her again.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: All right. I'll write you an
dialog: introduction. Take it to Wudan.
dialog: Wait there for news from me.
speaker_heading: LO
dialog: All right.
scene_heading: EXT. TE COMPOUND - NIGHT
text: Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the
text: compound, a sense of panic in the air. Yu gives Li a look.
text: Li shrugs.
scene_heading: INT. TE'S HALL - NIGHT
text: A crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty
text: sword case, his voice rising.
speaker_heading: SIR TE
dialog: When will this end? They take it,
dialog: they put it back, they take it
dialog: again. My home is turning into a
dialog: warehouse.
text: Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te.
speaker_heading: TE
dialog: Speak!
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Jen has run away! Gou found the
text: wedding chamber empty. Governor Yu
dialog: requests your assistance. You know
dialog: the Giang Hu underworld. He wants
dialog: to find her, and keep her from harm.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Sir Te, leave this to us. Don't
dialog: worry.
scene_heading: INT. TEA STALL - DAY
text: Jen arrives at the tea stall. She places her sword on the
text: table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu
text: martial arts characters sitting nearby.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: What can I serve you?
text: As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm.
speaker_heading: JEN
text: The cup is dirty.
text: The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away.
text: The men approach Jen.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER A
dialog: Hello. What is your name?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: (without lifting her eyes)
dialog: Long.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER B
dialog: It's young Master Long. My
dialog: apologies. I'm Iron Eagle Sung and
dialog: this is my brother in arms, Flying
dialog: Cougar Li Yun. What brings you to
dialog: Huai An, and where are you headed,
dialog: Master Long?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Anywhere there's action.
text: The two men exchange glances.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER A
dialog: In that case, perhaps we could be
dialog: of assistance.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Don't bother.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER A
dialog: You don't seem to understand.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: So what if I don't?
speaker_heading: GANGSTER B
dialog: We have ways of helping you
dialog: understand.
text: The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped
text: into scraps by Jen.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER A
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: He is my defeated foe!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the
text: horses in the background.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Have some tea.
text: As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch.
text: Embarrassed, Li pulls back.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Shu Lien... The things we touch
dialog: have no permanence. My master
dialog: would say... there is nothing we
dialog: can hold on to in this world. Only
dialog: by letting go can we truly possess
dialog: what is real.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Not everything is an illusion. My
dialog: hand... wasn't that real?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Your hand, rough and callused from
dialog: machete practice... All this time,
dialog: I've never had the courage to touch
dialog: it.
text: Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Giang Hu is a world of tigers and
dialog: dragons, full of corruption... I
dialog: tried sincerely to give it up but I
dialog: have brought us only trouble.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: To repress one's feelings only
dialog: makes them stronger.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: You're right, but I don't know what
dialog: to do. I want to be with you...
dialog: just like this. It gives me a
text: sense of peace.
text: Li Mu Bai smiles.
scene_heading: INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Jen walks upstairs. A waiter greets her.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Please follow me.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I want a clean room.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: We have plenty. Your order?
text: Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down.
speaker_heading: JEN
text: Steamed whole cod, bite-size
text: meatballs, a little starchy, but
dialog: keep the sauce light, shark fin
text: soup, mixed vegetables, and some
text: warm wine.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (dazed)
dialog: I have to order from a bigger
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Hurry then.
text: The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to
text: place the orders. Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not
dialog: much money left.
text: A large group of Giang Hu characters enters. They survey
text: the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs.
speaker_heading: GIANG HU A
dialog: That's him.
speaker_heading: MI BIAO
dialog: I am Iron Arm Mi. I heard a true
dialog: master has arrived. I have come to
dialog: seek a lesson.
text: Jen ignores him.
speaker_heading: MI BIAO
dialog: (bristles)
dialog: You asked for it!
text: Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea.
text: Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at
text: a sensitive pressure point. This provokes a reaction from
text: the other men.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: What kind of Iron Arm are you?
scene_heading: FLYING MACHETE CHANG
dialog: You have amazing technique! I am
dialog: Flying Machete. Are you related to
dialog: Southern Crane?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Southern Duck? I don't eat anything
dialog: with two feet. Who could remember
dialog: such long-winded names?
scene_heading: GOU JUN SIHUNG
dialog: Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and
dialog: you don't know his master, Southern
dialog: Crane?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Who are you?
scene_heading: GOU JUN SIHUNG
dialog: I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Gou? I hate that name. It makes
dialog: me puke! Too bad you're named Gou.
dialog: You'll be the first to feel my
dialog: sword today.
text: Jen leaps up and dives into battle. The men all use
text: different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the
dialog: powerful Green Destiny.
speaker_heading: MONK JING
dialog: Hold it! Don't you know Monk Jing?
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: A monk, in a place like this? You
dialog: need a lesson!
speaker_heading: MONK JING
dialog: Who are you?
text: She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing
dialog: the Green Destiny.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Who am I? I am... I am the
dialog: Invincible Sword Goddess. Armed
dialog: with the Incredible... Green
dialog: Destiny. Be you Li or Southern
dialog: Crane... lower your head... and ask
dialog: for mercy. I am the desert dragon.
dialog: I leave no trace. Today I fly over
dialog: Eu-Mei. Tomorrow... I'll kick over
dialog: Wudan Mountain!
text: Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks.
scene_heading: INT. STAR RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who
dialog: battled with Jen.
scene_heading: FLYING MACHETE CHANG
dialog: We politely asked for a friendly
dialog: match, but she showed no respect,
dialog: and attacked us. Everyone came by
dialog: to teach her a lesson.
speaker_heading: MI BIAO
dialog: Her sword was just too powerful.
speaker_heading: MONK JING
dialog: I've traveled everywhere, but never
dialog: met anyone so uncivilized.
scene_heading: SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD
dialog: (heavily bandaged)
dialog: She kept accusing me of being Gou
dialog: Jun Pei's brother. Who is this
dialog: Gou, anyway?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Her husband.
text: The men all nod their heads.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN - DAY
text: Li and Yu ride together.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: (to Yu)
dialog: We're close to your headquarters.
dialog: Go home and check in.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I'll look around and catch up later.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Not a bad idea. Tonight we'll get
text: a good night's sleep at headquarters.
text: Yu takes a fork off the road. Thunder can be heard in the
text: darkening sky.
scene_heading: EXT. SUN COMPOUND - DAY
text: A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front
text: yard of Sun Security. They stop when Yu enters.
scene_heading: SECURITY MAN A
dialog: Mistress, you're back.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: It's you! How's everything here?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Fine. You've been gone a while.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Yes, and I leave again tomorrow.
dialog: Your wife was due?
speaker_heading: AH WAI
dialog: Yeah, a baby girl.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Good!
speaker_heading: AH WAI
dialog: I'll be happy if she's half as
dialog: strong as you.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Mrs. Wu...
speaker_heading: AUNT WU
dialog: You're back!
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: How's the arm? Still sore?
speaker_heading: AUNT WU
dialog: Much better. You've been gone so
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: AUNT WU
dialog: (excited)
dialog: I'll go and make up his room!
text: Aunt Wu hustles out. Yu goes into her own room.
scene_heading: INT. HALL OF ANCESTRAL WORSHIP
text: Yu lights incense for her former fiancé Meng. Hearing
text: something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing
text: outside downstairs.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Sister Shu Lien...
scene_heading: INT. YU'S ROOM - DAY
text: Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some
text: clothes. Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets
text: herself on the edge of Yu's bed. Yu brings over the clothes.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Here you must be in proper attire.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I'm just borrowing some clean
dialog: clothes. I'm not staying.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I'll give them to you.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: I was just passing by and wondered
dialog: how you were.
text: Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on
text: Yu's shoulder in tears.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You, sister...
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Look at the trouble you've caused.
dialog: Now you know what Giang Hu life is
dialog: really like. If you think of me as
dialog: your sister, let me give you some
dialog: sisterly advice. You can run from
dialog: marriage, but not your parents.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: They forced me to marry!
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Go back to them first. Then you
dialog: can decide about Lo.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You know about Lo?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: He really loves you. Come back to
dialog: Peking with me. We'll find a
dialog: solution.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.
dialog: He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: You're working together to set me
dialog: up! I'm leaving!
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: How dare you accuse us? I always
dialog: knew you had stolen the sword!
dialog: I've done nothing but protect you
dialog: and your family. And you're repaid
dialog: me with nothing but contempt. Li
dialog: Mu Bai himself spared you, and all
dialog: you do is insult him. We wanted
dialog: some peace and you've ruined it all!
dialog: You're no sister of mine!
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: What do I care? You were never a
dialog: real friend anyway. But I wonder,
dialog: how long could you last as my enemy?
text: Jen gets up to leave. Yu intercepts her.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Put the sword down!
text: Jen jumps out.
scene_heading: INT. YUAN COURTYARD - DAY
text: Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are
text: still practicing.
text: They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Jen!
text: Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny.
speaker_heading: YU
text: Everyone out. Shut the doors.
text: The men leave.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Fine... the friendship is over.
text: Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and
text: begins her battle with Jen.
dialog: Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none
dialog: are any match for the Green Destiny.
text: After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks
text: admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's
dialog: sword.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Come and get it if you can.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Without the Green Destiny, you are
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Don't be a sore loser. Go ahead.
dialog: Take your pick. I'll wait. Go
dialog: ahead.
text: Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks. Just as the
text: Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade
text: at Jen's neck. She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: Give me the sword.
text: Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Take it!
text: Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: (enraged)
dialog: Stop it! You don't deserve the
dialog: Green Destiny.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Not another lecture! On guard!
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Let's end this here.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Only the sword will settle this.
text: Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DAY
text: Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind.
scene_heading: EXT. BAMBOO FOREST - DAY
text: Jen runs into a sea of bamboo. She appears to have lost Li
text: but is not slowing down. Her white clothes are now stained
text: with blood and mud. The wind had picked up and every breeze
text: sounds like an air attack by Li.
text: The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin
text: their dances and dodges. They glance off bamboos and each
text: other while staying afloat. Finally Jen lands on the same
text: stick of bamboo as Li. The two hold their positions for a
text: while, as the bamboo bends.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: I only let you go because I wanted
dialog: to see the real you.
text: Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: What do you know about a true heart?
text: Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree. The bamboo
text: straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground. Jen
text: quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li.
text: Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo
dialog: forest.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER - DAY
text: Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock
text: about a few feet wide amid the rapids. Jen vaults onto the
text: rock and scuffles with Li. Jen loses her balance.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: What I've always wanted, to teach
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: All right. If you can take back
dialog: the sword in three moves, I'll go
dialog: with you.
text: Li takes the sword back.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Give it back!
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Kneel!
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Never!
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Then you have no use for the sword.
text: Li throws the sword into the rapids.
text: Jen dives in to retrieve it. He follows Jen downstream by
text: hopping from one rock to another. Jen recovers the sword
text: but is herself drowning. Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the
text: rapids and fishes Jen out. Jade Fox carries the unconscious
text: Jen away. Li gives chase, but loses them.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
text: It's raining. Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine
text: paste and then dips a needle in the paste. She burns the
text: needle point, causing a blue smoke. She lights some incense
text: and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Sooner or later, they'd drag you
dialog: back to Peking. Your parents will
dialog: never accept you again. But why go
dialog: home? We've gone this far, we
dialog: won't stop now. You'll always be
dialog: my lady. At last, we'll be our own
dialog: masters. We'll be happy. That's
dialog: the most important thing. All we
dialog: have left is each other, right?
dialog: Lie down and rest.
text: Jen is too weak to respond.
text: Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
text: Fox scurries ahead in the rain. Her eyes catch something,
text: but she keeps moving.
scene_heading: INT. YUAN COMPOUND - DAY
text: Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu.
speaker_heading: AUNT WU
dialog: She's crazy. You should have
dialog: killed her.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: I didn't have the heart.
speaker_heading: AUNT WU
dialog: Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
text: Yu senses movement at the window. Looking out, she sees
text: Jade Fox in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
text: Jen wakes up, flushed from fever. She takes a sip from a
text: cup of water -- it's empty. She tosses the cup, gets up,
text: and walks into the rain.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
text: Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the
text: raindrops. Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li
text: standing there. Jen limps towards him while mumbling.
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: Is it me or the sword you want?
text: Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: You've been drugged!
text: Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
text: Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Where is Jade Fox?
text: Jen gestures that she doesn't know. Yu and Bo enter. Yu
text: looks at Jen.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: Jade Fox drugged her. How did you
dialog: get here?
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: We followed Jade Fox.
text: Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's
text: direction. Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all,
text: sending them flinging hither and thither.
text: Fox shows herself. Li attacks her. She falls back, bleeding
dialog: to death.
speaker_heading: LI
dialog: And so you die.
text: Li touches his neck.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: And so shall you!
text: Li pulls a single needle from his neck.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: A poisoned needle!
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You deserve to die, but the life I
dialog: was hoping to take... was Jen's.
dialog: Ten years I devoted to you. But
dialog: you deceived me! You hid the
dialog: manual's true meaning. I never
dialog: improved... but your progress was
dialog: limitless! You know what poison is?
text: An eight-year-old girl, full of
dialog: deceit. That's poison! Jen! My
dialog: only family... my only enemy...
text: Jade Fox dies.
speaker_heading: YU
dialog: You can't die! Tell us what poison
dialog: you used! You can't die! Tell us
dialog: the antidote! You can't let Li Mu
dialog: Bai die!
speaker_heading: JEN
dialog: She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin
dialog: poison. It goes straight to the
