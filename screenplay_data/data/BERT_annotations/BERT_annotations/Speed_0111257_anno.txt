dialog: Dies.
text: HOWARD FISK takes off the guard's hat. Dripping knife
text: aside, he is an ordinary-looking man. His face is dead

text: He drags the body into a dark corner, grabbing a duffle bag
text: from out of the shadows. Then checking his watch, he goes

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

scene_heading: INT. SHAFT

text: Jack points at the hatch cover on the elevator roof. Harry

text: cover. Jack grabs the handle. Harry makes the countdown
dialog: hand signals. Three, two -
text: A shotgun BLAST nearly takes their heads off, splintering
text: part of the hatch cover. Both men jump back. A second

text: THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN
text: He hears a voice out of the smoke.
speaker_heading: FISK
