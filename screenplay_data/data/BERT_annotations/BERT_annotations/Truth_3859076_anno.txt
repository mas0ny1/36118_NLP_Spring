text: MARY MAPES sits. Career woman. Spitfire. Can drink and

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Mr. Hibey will see you now.
scene_heading: INT. DICK HIBEY'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Richly appointed. A scotch and cigar feel. Attorney DICK
text: HIBEY (50's, bearded) rises as Mary enters.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Ms. Mapes. I'm Dick Hibey. What
dialog: can I do for you?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, I think you know.
text: Hibey smiles, gestures for her to sit. Noticing:
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: You knit?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You don't expect a woman like me to
dialog: knit.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: No. But it's good. Helpful.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You mean it blunts my radical feminist
dialog: agenda?
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Do you have a radical feminist agenda?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You meet a lot of radical knitters?
text: Hibey smiles politely at the joke. Then:
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Do you have a substance abuse problem?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm working on developing one.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: I'm serious.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So am I.
text: Hibey's not smiling anymore.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: You came to me, Ms. Mapes. If you're
dialog: not up for this-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I've been in news for twenty years.
dialog: I've won two Emmys, I broke Abu
dialog: Ghraib, I've done jail time for not
dialog: revealing sources. I have neither a
dialog: radical feminist agenda nor a
dialog: substance abuse problem, although
dialog: right now I'm gonna take a xanax
dialog: because this is really freaking me
dialog: out - do you have any water?
text: A beat. Hibey rises and pours Mary a glass of water from a
text: pitcher on the side table. Handing it to her.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: You're going to have to be ready for
dialog: questions like that.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm up for this.
text: Hibey retakes his seat. Sizing her up.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: There's an interesting reoccurring

dialog: People abusing their power.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't like bullies.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Tell me about your work.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You want to know if I'm responsible

speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Aren't you?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I did my job, believe me.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: I don't have to believe you. What
dialog: matters is that they believe you.
dialog: Now tell me about your work.
text: Mary takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm the producer. I find the story,
dialog: I put the team together, I write and

speaker_heading: HIBEY

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They're going to run it, Roger.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: You want me to paint them out like

text: man's crotch blurred out with a field of squares.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Jesus, no, it looks like his genitals
dialog: were attacked by mad cubists. Maybe
dialog: you could just darken the area?
text: The Technician hits a few keys. A beat.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, now it just looks like there's
text: a black hole there.
speaker_heading: DANA ROBERSON
text: From which no light can escape.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: They're really going to run it?
dialog: Because Sy Hersh has this and he's

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Dana, tell Roger they're going to

scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN CENTER -- NIGHT
text: THE MAN IN PROFILE. Seated in a chair on the wings of a
text: stage. Silhouetted by a spotlight. From ONSTAGE:
speaker_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD (0.S.)
dialog: He is, among other things, a piss
dialog: poor speller. That's why the Houston
text: Chronicle put him on the radio instead
text: of a desk. Three years later, he
dialog: was their news director.
text: Chuckles from the crowd. Our man withdraws a NOTEPAD from
text: his pocket. Jotting something down. His speech maybe?
dialog: On stage Andrew Heyward - President of CBS News (50's,
text: mustached) addresses the crowd; a sea of tuxedos and gowns.
speaker_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: To call his beginnings humble would
dialog: be generous. A graduate of that
dialog: most notable of journalism schools,
dialog: The Sam Houston State Teacher's
dialog: College, in 1959 he took his first
dialog: job in the burgeoning medium of
dialog: television. A year later, when a
dialog: hurricane hit Galveston, he convinced
text: his cameraman to shoot the radar
dialog: screen, showing Americans for the
dialog: first time how a storm worked. He
dialog: was the first journalist to report
dialog: that John F. Kennedy had been shot.
dialog: He described the Zapruder film in
dialog: detail to a nation that was not
dialog: allowed to see it. He became the
dialog: White House Correspondent at 33 years
dialog: of age and the Chief London
dialog: Correspondent a year later. He helped
dialog: bring the horrors of the Vietnam War
dialog: into American living rooms for the
dialog: first time.

speaker_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: At a Broadcaster Convention in 1974
dialog: where President Nixon was scheduled
dialog: to appear but not take questions,
dialog: he, of course, asked a question.
dialog: Nixon, upset, asked "Are you running
dialog: for something?" My friend politely
dialog: replied "No, sir, Mr. President.
dialog: Are you?"
text: Laughter. Mary slips into the back of the room.
speaker_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: He covered the Russians in Afghanistan
dialog: and the hostages in Iran. And in
dialog: 1981 he became anchor of the CBS
dialog: Evening News. He has now anchored a
dialog: nightly newscast for longer than
dialog: anyone else in U.S. history. He has
dialog: dined with kings, angered Presidents,
dialog: questioned dictators. Not bad for
text: the son of a ditch-digger from
dialog: Wharton, Texas.
text: In the wings, the Man flips his notepad shut and gets ready...
speaker_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my
dialog: friend, and the reason I have this
dialog: job, Dan Rather.
text: The Crowd rises in applause as DAN RATHER steps from the
text: wings. Mary smiles. Dan takes the lectern and pulls a pre-
text: written speech from his jacket. What was the notepad?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Thank you, Andrew, for that wonderful
dialog: introduction. And yes, I will honor
dialog: your speaking fee.

scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN CENTER LOBBY -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hey, Andrew. I need him.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: You're not taking him-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You say that, and yet here I am.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to Mary)
dialog: You've got him?
speaker_heading: MARY
text: Stashed in a hotel two blocks up.
text: They move for the door. Heyward panics, following them:
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Dan, you're not leaving your own
dialog: party! I got fifty affiliates and
dialog: their wives waiting to meet you--
dialog: Goddammit, Mary!
scene_heading: EXT. LINCOLN CENTER -- NIGHT
text: Mary and Dan exit the gala. Among the fountains, Dan pulls
text: off his bow-tie like a kid after Sunday School, barely
text: containing his glee. Pretending to be upset.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I was receiving an award, you know.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You don't say.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: For a "Lifetime of Achievement".
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So it's pretty much all downhill
dialog: from here, then?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Brother, you ain't kidding.
dialog: (pause; then)
dialog: We are going to run it, right?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm going to start hurting you people
dialog: soon, I swear to God-
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'm just saying, I've already done
dialog: cut-ins for it. We kill it now, we
dialog: look like fools.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not that that's stopped us before.
dialog: (crossing the street)
dialog: They're worried about the Superbowl--
dialog: Andrew thinks the FCC may fine Viacom
dialog: per station.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: So the CBS News division has to tread
dialog: softly because of Janet Jackson's
dialog: left breast?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We're about to go on national
dialog: television and accuse the U.S.
dialog: Military of committing atrocities
dialog: while hip deep in two wars during an
dialog: election year.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But yes, mostly I think they're
dialog: worried about the boob thing.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. BROADCAST BOOTH -- EVENING

scene_heading: INT. 60 MINUTES OFFICES -- BULLPEN -- NIGHT

scene_heading: ON TV - THE 60 MINUTES BROADCAST
text: The image of an IRAQI MAN standing on a box WEARING A HOOD.
text: Electrodes run to his body. OVER THIS:
speaker_heading: DAN (V.0.)
dialog: Americans did this to an Iraqi
dialog: prisoner. According to the US Army,
text: the man was told to stand on a box
text: with his head covered with wires
text: attached to his hands. He was told
dialog: that if he fell off the box, he would
dialog: be electrocuted.
text: CUT TO Dan, addressing the camera:
speaker_heading: DAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It was this picture and dozens of
dialog: others that prompted an investigation
dialog: by the U.S. Army. Yesterday, we
dialog: asked General Mark Kimmitt, deputy
dialog: director of Coalition Operations in
dialog: Iraq, what went wrong.
scene_heading: INT. 60 MINUTES -- MARY'S OFFICE-- NIGHT
text: And finally to Mary, watching her story come out...
speaker_heading: GENERAL KIMMITT
dialog: Frankly, I think all of us are
dialog: disappointed at the actions of the
dialog: few. You know, every day we love
dialog: our soldiers, but frankly, some days
dialog: we're not always proud of our
dialog: soldiers.
speaker_heading: DAN (V.0.)
dialog: Abu Ghraib under Saddam Hussein was

speaker_heading: DANA ROBERSON
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (mock wounded)
dialog: They did. Me. Can you believe it?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Apparently they thought times back

dialog: such a sign off.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Give us a "Courage", Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I don't think-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Come on, just one. For me?
text: A beat. Dan leans forward. In his best newscaster baritone:
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Courage.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I was in New York working on the

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: And what does that entail?
text: Mary raises an eyebrow at her son's vocabulary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Asking questions. Questions help

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Interesting. Are there any questions
dialog: you shouldn't ask?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No. Never. Why would you say that?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: My friend Louis's Dad says reporters

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: ROBERT

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes.

text: Mary flips open her notebook.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I got something maybe for the

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Bush's oil company?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Could just be lots of sound and fury,
dialog: but Vanity Fair's into it too. That
dialog: whole time period for Bush is funky.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Funky how?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I did some work on it in 2000. You

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Old Texas Pol.

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)

dialog: the Texas House in '68, Sid Adger,
text: this big oilman, comes into his office
dialog: and asks for help getting young George
dialog: Bush into the National Guard as a
text: pilot. Poppy Bush at this point is
dialog: a Congressman and Barnes figures he
dialog: can use all the connections he can
dialog: get, so he says he called General
dialog: Rose, who runs the Texas Air National
text: Guard, and gets Bush a slot.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Barnes told you this?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Completely off the record, but he's
dialog: been dining out on the story for
dialog: years. Then I talk to Buck Staudt,
dialog: who was Bush's squadron commander.
text: He starts screaming at me about how
dialog: Barnes is full of shit, because
dialog: everybody knows that he's the one
dialog: who pulled the strings to get Bush
dialog: into the Guard, not Barnes.
text: Josh laughs.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Politics in Texas. It's the
dialog: intergalactic capital of shit happens.
dialog: Anyway while Bush is in the Guard,
text: he meets a guy named James Bath and
text: they become running buddies. After
dialog: they get out, Bath, with no resume
dialog: to speak of, becomes chief financial
dialog: representative for the Bin Laden
dialog: Family's interests in Texas. Bush
text: starts up Arbusto and Bath writes
dialog: him a $50,000 check.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Which your guy White claims is Bin
dialog: Laden money.
dialog: (off her nod)
dialog: Okay, run it down. But if we go
dialog: with it, we have to go early; we

dialog: Bush is accepted to the Texas Air
dialog: National Guard for flight training.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: If you believe Ben Barnes, he got
text: Bush onto the waiting list.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: If there even was a waiting list.
dialog: Some people say yes, some people say
dialog: no. That one General...
text: He snaps his fingers, trying to remember.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Belisario Flores?
text: Colonel Charles looks at Smith - not bad.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Former head of the Texas Guard, he
dialog: said there was a waiting list, over
text: a hundred people on it.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: So Bush jumped the list.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: We have no document showing any kind
dialog: of waiting list.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Bush says he got in so quickly because
dialog: they were specifically looking for
dialog: pilots, which is bullshit with so
text: many pilots rotating back from
dialog: Vietnam. And that's another thing -
dialog: training a National Guard pilot from
dialog: start to finish was a huge rarity.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Because it's not cost effective.
dialog: Lot of National Guard jocks are former
dialog: Air Force pilots who want to maintain
dialog: their flight rating.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Why spend a million bucks training a
dialog: new pilot when you can just admit a
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: guy the Air Force already taught how
dialog: to fly? The only thing that makes
dialog: Bush an attractive candidate for the
dialog: Guard is who he's connected to.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Either way, he's in. Signed on for
dialog: a six year commitment. Does his
text: pilot training at Moody and is then
dialog: assigned to the 111th Fighter
text: Intercept Squadron in Houston.
dialog: Records show he does really well
dialog: here, high marks in every rating
dialog: period until the spring of 1972.
dialog: Then nothing. No flights, no
dialog: appearing for duty. Until August 1
dialog: when he is suspended in writing for
text: missing a routine physical.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So how does someone go from being a
dialog: top-notch pilot to not even taking
dialog: your physical?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Not only that, but he requests and
dialog: is granted a reassignment to Alabama
text: to work on a friend's Senate campaign.
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: Wait - he disobeys an order and then
dialog: they let him transfer?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: It gets better. From May 1972 to
dialog: May 1973, his record shows no points
dialog: registered. Points are like hours
text: on a time card in the Guard. It
dialog: basically means he didn't show up.
dialog: The Alabama commander has no
text: recollection of him. No eyewitness
dialog: has ever placed him on base and no
dialog: paperwork exists to prove he was
dialog: ever there.
text: Lucy looks from one of them to the other.
text: A beat.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You're telling me the President of
dialog: the United States may have gone AWOL
dialog: from the military for over a year?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: We have no proof of that.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What does the White House say?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: That Bush served honorably and that
dialog: military records go missing all the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: By the way, military records do not
dialog: go missing all the time. They're
dialog: the military. They're good at shit.
dialog: (looking at file)
dialog: Bush is not heard from in the records
text: again until July 1973 when he shows
dialog: up for drills. And in September
dialog: 1973 he requests and is granted an
dialog: early discharge to attend Harvard
dialog: Business School.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: He asks to quit nine months early
dialog: and they let him?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: And he resigned his commission in
dialog: '74 which is very weird. You're
dialog: commissioned for life, right? Why
dialog: resign it? It makes no sense.
text: Mary looks around the room.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So what are the questions we're
dialog: looking to answer?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: One - did Bush go into the Guard to
dialog: avoid going to Vietnam?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Not to be cynical, but who didn't
dialog: try to get into the Guard to avoid
dialog: Nam back then?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Me.
text: The military man says it without blinking.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Bush's trainer in the 147th said he
dialog: wanted to go to Vietnam.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: (holds up a paper)
dialog: This is the only document in the
dialog: official record that deals with it.
dialog: On the question of desiring overseas
dialog: transfer, Bush checked "No".
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Bush's trainer says that must have
dialog: been a mistake.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Cause that's a question you get
dialog: wrong...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Two - why did he skip the physical?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: He didn't have a drug problem, he
dialog: just liked the way it smelled.
text: Lucy laughs.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And Three - if someone did pull
dialog: strings for him, who? And how the
dialog: hell do we get them to go on the
dialog: record?

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: September 15th we don't have a show -
dialog: CBS is running the Billy Graham
dialog: crusade.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about the 22nd?
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: Preempted again. Dr. Phil special.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So our airdate is being decided by
text: an unholy confluence of Billy Graham
dialog: and Dr. Phil McGraw?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: News doesn't pay the bills.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: There is one more option. The 8th.
text: Mary takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: As in five days from now?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: If it can't be done-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'd need interviews, I'd need to get
dialog: my whole team to New York, I'd need--
dialog: First, I need Dan. Where is he?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON TELEVISION - Dan, screaming into a mic as he is POUNDED
text: by WIND AND RAIN.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Hurricane Frances is pounding Florida

scene_heading: INT. MARY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- EVENING
text: Mary, watching as the wind almost blows him over.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm gonna kill him.
text: As ONSCREEN DAN is almost taken out by a flying tree branch...
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: You may not have to.
dialog: (checking his laptop)
dialog: I can maybe get him on a puddle jumper
dialog: to Austin for the Strong interview.
dialog: Got an email from the Colonel about
dialog: the documents saying "I feel better".

scene_heading: INT. DALLAS BUREAU -- NIGHT
text: The Colonel scoops up his ringing phone.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: A memorandum for record is a memo to
dialog: nobody, right? So why does Killian
dialog: file them?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Killian knows suspending a guy this
dialog: protected is a big deal. He's trying
dialog: to do the right thing here, but wants
text: a paper trail to insulate himself.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Which means W's protection must have
dialog: come from higher up than Killian.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: You're thinking Hodges, aren't you?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He was Killian's direct supervisor...
dialog: I'll call you back.
text: Mary hangs up. Checks her notes for another number - Gen.

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: General Hodges, this is Mary Mapes

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)
text: Cell phone video from a Democratic

text: A MAN is addressing a CROWD. Mary squints at the screen.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Is that Ben Barnes?
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
speaker_heading: BEN BARNES
dialog: Let's talk a minute about John Kerry
dialog: and George Bush, and I know them
dialog: both. And I'm not name dropping.
dialog: See I... I got a young man named
dialog: George Bush into the National Guard
dialog: when I was the Lt. Governor of Texas.
dialog: I'm not necessarily proud of that...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Holy shit.
scene_heading: INT. BEN BARNES' OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Barnes, on the phone with Mary, clearly distressed:
speaker_heading: BEN BARNES
dialog: I didn't know they were taping me!
dialog: Did you see it? I looked like shit!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I thought you looked wonderful, Ben.
speaker_heading: BEN BARNES
dialog: Oh, don't you start.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: The cat's already out of the bag and

scene_heading: INT. MARY'S HOUSE -- FRONT HALL -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Burkett just called, he's got more
dialog: memos he wants to hand off.
text: He moves for the door as Mary comes in.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We need to find out who his source
dialog: is. I have to be at the airport in

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I'll fax you what I get!
text: And he's out the door.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Mary, dressed in travel clothes. Standing with Wrolstad in

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He's gotten so big.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: (nods )
dialog: It's a problem.
text: Mary goes and leans down next to Robert's bed and kisses him
text: on the cheek. He stirs.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I gotta go, kiddo. Big story, gotta
dialog: go ask questions.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (yawning)
dialog: With the men with the cameras?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (smiles at the question)
dialog: Yes, with the men with the cameras.
text: He rolls over. She kisses him again and rises. Goes to the
text: door where Wrolstad stands. He whispers to her:
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: You be careful, okay? This is honor
dialog: and duty. This is where they live.
dialog: 44,
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'll be careful, Mark.
text: Wrolstad nods. Enough for him. She kisses him and starts
text: for the stairs. Turns back, with a thought.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you should let him watch this
dialog: one.
text: Wrolstad nods. Okay. She kisses him once more and goes.
scene_heading: INT. DALLAS/FORT WORTH AIRPORT -- ARRIVALS -- DAY
text: September 5th - 3 Days To Air. An amazingly disheveled Dan
text: Rather comes down the jetway. Mary holds up a folder.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: More memos from Burkett.
scene_heading: INT. ARRIVALS -- DAY
text: Mary and Dan sit in a bank of chairs as travelers swirl around
text: them. Dan, scanning the new memos. He stops, reading aloud:
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: "Staudt has obviously pressured Hodges
dialog: more about Bush. I'm having trouble
dialog: running interference and doing my
dialog: job. Harris gave me a message today
dialog: from Group regarding Bush's OETR...
text: He looks at Mary, questioning.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Officer Effectiveness Training Report.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: "Staudt is pushing to sugar coat it.
dialog: Bush wasn't here during rating period
dialog: and I don't have any feedback from
dialog: 187th in Alabama. I will not rate."
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Bush wasn't here during rating
dialog: period...
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They're trying to get Killian to
dialog: file a rating for Bush while he wasn't
text: even on base.
dialog: (pause)
text: This is proof that he was AWOL.
text: A long beat. Dan looks up at her.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Who am I talking to first?
scene_heading: INT. AUSTIN HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
dialog: Robert Strong - Former Texas Air National Guard (60's)
text: sits in a chair. Dan across from him. CAMERA ROLLING.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Is there any doubt in your mind that
dialog: these memos are genuine?
speaker_heading: STRONG
dialog: Well, they are compatible with the
dialog: way business was done at that time.
dialog: They are compatible with the man
dialog: that I remember Jerry Killian being.
text: Off to the side, Mary, Lucy, and Smith stand watching.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What do you think Colonel Killian
dialog: was trying to do with these memos?
speaker_heading: STRONG
dialog: I think he was trying to get a duty
dialog: performed and I think he was trying
dialog: to protect himself because of the
dialog: political environment in which he
dialog: found himself.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Political considerations were a major
dialog: force in the Guard?
speaker_heading: STRONG
dialog: It verged on outright corruption the
dialog: favors that were done, the power
dialog: that was traded.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: STRONG (CONT'D)
dialog: From a moral and ethical standpoint,
dialog: it was unconscionable.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
text: After the interview. The cameraman is packing up as Dan
text: bids farewell to Robert Strong. Mary looks to the others.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Let's go to New York...
scene_heading: INT. AMERICAN AIRLINES (FLYING) -- NIGHT
text: A night flight. Most people doze in the dark cabin. Smith
text: reads. Someone takes a seat next to him.
text: He looks up to see it is Dan Rather.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I didn't get the chance to introduce
dialog: myself before. Dan Rather.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: (star-struck)
dialog: No shit. I mean, Mike Smith. I
dialog: mean- yes. You are. I'm Mike.
dialog: Smith. Hi.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Mary says you're the one who calls
dialog: me "The Old Man"?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I- wow. Really not happy she shared
dialog: that with you.
text: Dan smiles.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I want to thank you for all your
dialog: hard work on this. It's important.
dialog: Questioning things. People say it
dialog: doesn't matter, one side or the other
dialog: will always say we're being
dialog: partisan... but the day we stop
dialog: asking questions is the day the
dialog: American people lose. It may sound
dialog: hokey, but I really believe that.

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You know what's crazy?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Many things are crazy. Tell me what
dialog: specifically you feel is crazy.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: The fact they kept this secret for
dialog: so long.
text: Colonel Charles looks over to Mary dozing a few seats away.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: You know why Mary didn't get this
dialog: story done in 2000, don't you?
text: Lucy shakes her head.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Her mother died. Right in the middle
dialog: of it. So this story never got
dialog: finished and the election happened.
text: An election decided by 537 votes.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Sometimes I think if Mary's mom hadn't
dialog: died that summer, there's a good
dialog: chance Al Gore would be President
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What about her father?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
text: Mary's father is a drunken piece of
dialog: shit who hated himself so much that
dialog: he beat his daughters. The more
dialog: outspoken they were, the harder he
dialog: hit them. How do you think she fared?
text: Lucy looks at Mary's sleeping form.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: She'd get beat up for asking
dialog: questions?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: And this is what she does for a
dialog: living.
text: Dan retakes his seat next to a sleeping Mary as the Colonel
dialog: and Lucy watch.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: People are funny sometimes. That's
dialog: part of what it is between her and
dialog: Dan, I think. Why they work so well
dialog: together. Why they need each other.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Fathers and daughters.
text: Lucy doesn't know how to respond. Pan to Mary. The plane

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tell me about the document examiners.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: There are four. We have Marcel Matley
dialog: coming in from San Francisco today
text: to do on-camera. Linda James in
dialog: Texas wants to see the originals-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So would I, but we don't have them.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That's what I told her. Jim Pierce
dialog: in Los Angeles just got started today
dialog: and Emily Will in North Carolina
dialog: wants you to call her...
text: As they step into the elevators
speaker_heading: EMILY WILL (0.S.)
dialog: I think you have a problem.
dialog: 49,
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S OFFICE/EMILY WILL'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Mary sits at her desk unpacking her carry-on, on the phone
scene_heading: with Emily Will - Document Examiner. INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: EMILY WILL
dialog: I've been doing some internet
dialog: research. The President was in
dialog: Alabama when these were written, so
dialog: there's no way they could be true.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Have you found anything wrong with
dialog: the documents themselves?
speaker_heading: EMILY WILL
dialog: No, but-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do they appear forged in any way?
speaker_heading: EMILY WILL
dialog: Without the originals to ink test-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Let me worry about the investigational
dialog: side of the story.
speaker_heading: EMILY WILL
dialog: I always work the whole thing.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you know where these originated?
dialog: Establishing exact chain of custody
dialog: would go a long way towards
dialog: determining authenticity.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We're working on it...
scene_heading: INT. BURKETT HOME -- DAY
text: Burkett, on the phone with Mary. INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: I give you the memos, you verify
dialog: them, that was the deal. You call
dialog: the Kerry campaign for me yet? They
dialog: can't lie down on this swift boat
dialog: shit.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: If I could just confirm where you
dialog: got the memos, we would be home free.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: I told you, I can't go on the record-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You wouldn't have to. Just give me
dialog: the name. That's all I need.
text: A beat. Burkett exhaling. Then:
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: George Conn. Buddy of mine in the
dialog: Guard. He was there for the
dialog: scrubbing. But you call him and
dialog: he'll deny it.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Colonel, this is Mary Mapes, I'ma
dialog: producer at 60 Minutes. If you could
dialog: call me back at your earliest
dialog: convenience, it's regarding a story
dialog: we're airing Wednesday night.
text: She hangs up as Colonel Charles pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Matley's ready.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
text: Now set up for an interview. Several ENLARGEMENTS of
text: signatures hang on a board. Marcel Matley - Document Examiner
text: stands taking Dan through them as the CAMERA ROLLS.
speaker_heading: MARCEL MATLEY
dialog: I would say based on our available
dialog: handwriting evidence, yes, this is
dialog: the same person.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: MARCEL MATLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, this signature on the June 24th
dialog: document shows some conspicuous
dialog: differences, but it also shows what
dialog: I call inconspicuous similarities to
text: Colonel Killian's handwriting.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Why might differences like that exist?
speaker_heading: MARCEL MATLEY
dialog: The content of the memo is highly
text: stressful, Killian telling a higher
dialog: up that he cannot rate Bush during
dialog: his absence. This is enough to
text: explain differences in the penstrokes.
text: Dan just stares at him.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Would you give us a moment?
text: He turns and walks over to where Mary stands.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's like listening to someone
dialog: describing paint dry-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He said it, though. It was in there
dialog: somewhere. Can you get the bite?
text: Dan nods and walks back to Matley.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Are you saying that if I present
dialog: these to the American public and
dialog: say, to the best of our knowledge,
dialog: these documents were all signed by
dialog: the same man, I am going to be on
dialog: solid ground?
text: A beat. Everyone leans forward to hear. On Matley.
speaker_heading: MARCEL MATLEY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TIMECUT TO:
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
text: After the interview. Matley has departed, the equipment
text: sits dormant. Dan stands with Mary, Lucy, and Colonel
dialog: Charles.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Matley's a yes, Jim Pierce is a yes,
dialog: Emily Will's still working and Linda
dialog: James wants more documents, but says
dialog: she'll defer to Matley.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: All the dates and content in the
text: Burkett memos mesh perfectly with
dialog: the official record - I'm trying to
dialog: have graphics mock something up to
dialog: show it visually.
text: They look to Dan. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We don't have it yet.
text: Groans from the others. Dan presses forward.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Someone has to confirm the content
dialog: of the memos. Someone who knew the
dialog: players.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: No one from the Guard is gonna step
dialog: up for that. Look at what happened
dialog: to Burkett - you talk, you get your
text: head chopped off.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What about Killian's family?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Super Pro-Bush so they'd never go
dialog: for it, plus there was a divorce
dialog: there. I don't know if she'd know
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Who were Killian's commanders again?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: Buck Staudt, who has figuratively
dialog: and literally told me to go fuck
dialog: myself, and Bobby Hodges, who I've
dialog: left eighteen messages for.
text: Dan stares at her. His meaning clear.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine, I'll go do nineteen...
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Smith lies on the couch. Colonel Charles tosses a ball back
text: and forth between his hands nervously. Mary dials her phone.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: You want to get pizza?
dialog: (to Colonel Charles)
dialog: We should get pizza.
text: The phone is ringing. Picked up. Through the receiver:
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: Hello?
text: Mary blinks, surprised.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: General Hodges?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: Yes.
text: Mary snaps her fingers for them to pick up a second line to
dialog: listen in.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: This is, uh, Mary Mapes with 60
dialog: Minutes? I'd like to speak with you
dialog: about some old memos I've come across
dialog: from the 111th Fighter Interceptor
text: Squadron. They appear to be from
dialog: the personal files of Jerry Killian?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'd like to read them to you if that's
dialog: all right?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Um, the first one is dated June 24,
dialog: 1973 and the Subject is Bush, George
dialog: W, ist Lieutenant.
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Sir: I got a call from your staff
dialog: concerning the evaluation of Ist
dialog: Lieutenant Bush due this month. His
dialog: rater is Lieutenant Colonel Harris.
dialog: Neither Lieutenant Colonel Harris or
dialog: I feel we can rate lst Lieutenant
dialog: Bush since he was not training with
dialog: the 111th FIS since April 1972. His
dialog: recent activity is outside the rating
dialog: period. Advise me how we are supposed
dialog: to handle this.
text: Hodges says nothing. Just breathes.
text: Smith and Colonel Charles are both staring, in disbelief
text: Hodges hasn't hung up. Mary fumbles for a second memo.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, this one is August 18, 1973
dialog: and titled Subject: CYA, which I
dialog: believe means "Cover Your Ass"?
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Staudt has obviously pressured Hodges
dialog: more about Bush. I'm having trouble
dialog: running interference and doing my
dialog: job.
text: No response. She continues.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Harris gave me a message today from
dialog: Group regarding Bush's OETR. And
text: Staudt is pushing to sugar coat it.
dialog: Bush wasn't here during rating period
dialog: and I don't have any feedback from
dialog: 187th in Alabama. I will not rate.
text: Austin is not happy either.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Harris took the call from Group today.
dialog: I will backdate but won't rate.
dialog: Harris agrees.
text: You could hear a pin drop. Mary lowers the paper.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir, are these memos familiar to
dialog: you?
text: A short exhale of breath from Hodges. Then:
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: They are.
text: Smith pumps his fist in victory!
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Using someone's personal notes, that's
dialog: going overboard. You're trying to
dialog: make news, create a story here when
dialog: there isn't one.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We're not trying to create anything,
dialog: General. Colonel Killian was upset
dialog: Bush missed his physical?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: He was an overboard hardnose.
dialog: He didn't like the weekend guys.
dialog: But Bush went to Alabama with
dialog: everyone's blessing. Killian thought
dialog: he was doing the best job he could.
dialog: You're creating a situation here...

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: BEN BARNES

dialog: Mary
text: Mary, Colonel Charles, Smith, Lucy, Mary Murphy, and Josh

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm concerned about the sheer amount
dialog: of story we have. Barnes, the
dialog: documents, missing the physical,
dialog: being AWOL from Alabama--
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
text: It's like four different angles on
dialog: the same story.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Maybe we could split them? Run Barnes
dialog: tomorrow and the documents on the
dialog: Sunday broadcast?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Sunday show won't give us the real
dialog: estate. Where are we with the rest
dialog: of it?
text: Lucy checks her notes.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Got an email from Emily Will, one of
text: the examiners. She has some concerns
dialog: about the superscript thing.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Superscript?
speaker_heading: MARY
text: The raised "th" that comes after
dialog: "111th". She was worried that
dialog: function wasn't available on military
text: typewriters in the 70's.
dialog: (to Lucy)
dialog: I spoke to Matley - he says they
dialog: were available then. Emily told me
text: she deferred to him.
speaker_heading: JOSH

text: ON THE SCREEN - Dan speaking with Barnes:
speaker_heading: BEN BARNES
dialog: I don't think I had any right to
dialog: have the power that I had, to choose
dialog: who was going to go to Vietnam and
dialog: who was not going to go to Vietnam.
dialog: That's power. In some instances,
dialog: when I looked at those names, I was
dialog: maybe determining life or death.
dialog: And that's not a power that I want
dialog: to have.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Too strong or not to say that you
dialog: are ashamed of it now?
speaker_heading: BEN BARNES
dialog: Oh, I think that would be somewhat

dialog: very sorry.

speaker_heading: MARY
text: Sixteen minutes, at least three over.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Some of the document stuff is slow,
dialog: you can definitely trim there.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: How about flipping it - open with
text: Barnes and then do the documents.
dialog: It would keep it chronological.
text: Betsy's nodding, she likes the idea.
speaker_heading: BETSY

speaker_heading: MARCEL MATLEY
dialog: .--Based on our available handwriting
dialog: evidence, yes, this is the same

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It shows where the new documents

speaker_heading: JOSH

text: On Mary. A long beat...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Cut it.
speaker_heading: TIMECUT TO:

speaker_heading: EDITOR

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: We don't start outputting in two

text: Sweat on her brow. Stares at the screen. Finally:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Lock it. Start outputting.
text: She pushes back from the controls as the techs swoop in and

speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: If there's a computer hiccup...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tom, I worship you, but shut the

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: While Senator Kerry has been targeted

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: WROLSTAD

speaker_heading: MARY

scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM

text: Mary smiles. Sips her coffee. A moment of serenity and

speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Mary, what's going on? These blogs
dialog: are saying the memos can be recreated
dialog: exactly in Microsoft Word.
text: Mary blinks.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Who's saying this?
speaker_heading: BETSY
text: A conservative website.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: BETSY (CONT'D)
dialog: (veading a printout)
dialog: Every one of these memos to file is
text: in a proportionally spaced font,
dialog: probably Palatino or Times New Roman.
text: As she continues reading, Mary swivels back to her computer,
text: opens MS Word, grabs a memo and begins to RETYPE IT...
speaker_heading: BETSY (CONT'D)
dialog: In 1972 typewriters used monospaced
dialog: fonts. The use of proportionally
dialog: spaced fonts did not come into common
dialog: use until the introduction of personal
dialog: computers. They were not widespread
dialog: until the mid to late 90's. Before
dialog: then, you needed typesetting
dialog: equipment, and that wasn't used for
dialog: personal memos to file. I am saying
dialog: these documents are forgeries, run
dialog: through a copier for 15 generations
dialog: to make them look old.
text: She stops as Mary holds a copy of the memo up to the screen.
text: Staring at them both. They look nearly IDENTICAL.
speaker_heading: BETSY (CONT'D)
dialog: Mary... what the hell is going on?
text: Mary stares at the screen. She has no idea.

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: Due respect, did you fuck up?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We had four document examiners working
dialog: separately and not one of them said
dialog: the memos weren't real.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: Did any of them try typing them into
dialog: Microsoft Word?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't know, Gil, I'm not a document
dialog: examiner, but I'm assuming part of
dialog: their job was making sure these things
dialog: weren't whipped up last Tuesday.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Just because some guys on the internet
dialog: have a problem with our reporting-
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: It's not just guys on the internet.
text: ABC News is going after this.
dialog: Nightline specifically-
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You mean they're going after Dan.
text: A beat. Schwartz looks to Betsy.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: Tell them about the superscript.
speaker_heading: BETSY
text: It's the little "th" that pops up
dialog: after you type a number like 111th-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know what it is, what about it?
speaker_heading: BETSY
text: Bloggers are saying it's a big red
text: flag this was done on a computer.
dialog: They say it didn't exist on
text: typewriters in the 1970's.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: One of our examiners raised that
dialog: concern as well.
text: Mary shoots her a glance.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Emily Will, yeah, but Matley said
dialog: they did have them and she deferred
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: They will kill us on that. They
dialog: will kill us on that alone.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I don't understand, what do they
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They want us to say we're wrong.
dialog: Because if we're wrong, all the
dialog: questions we asked about the
dialog: President's service go away.
text: They're all looking at her now.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, we have the document examiners.
dialog: We have Bob Strong, who worked at
dialog: Guard headquarters and says the memos
dialog: are written in the vernacular of the
dialog: Guard at the time. And we have Bobby
text: Hodges, Killian's commanding officer,
dialog: who confirmed both the content of
dialog: the memos and that they reflected
text: Killian's state of mind at the time.
dialog: We have this story.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Make sure. Reconfirm with everybody.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: And find us another goddamn "th" in
dialog: the official record, okay? I wanna
text: ram it down their throats.
scene_heading: INT. CBS NEWS -- MAKE UP ROOM -- AFTERNOON
text: Dan, getting made up for the news. Mary pokes her head in.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You've heard?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yes. And it's bullshit, pardon my
dialog: French. People have been attacking
dialog: me for thirty years, it's not going
dialog: to start bothering me now. Are you
dialog: okay?
text: Mary nods. Then:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We're gonna be in a fight here, Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: General Hodges, this is Mary Mapes,

speaker_heading: MARJORIE CONNELL (0.S.)
dialog: Number one, he would not have typed

speaker_heading: JOSH
text: Staudt was already out of the Guard.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (holding it up)
dialog: The CYA memo dated August 18, 1973 -
dialog: "Staudt has obviously pressured Hodges
dialog: more about Bush." Staudt left the
dialog: guard in 1972. So how the fuck could
dialog: he still be pressuring?
text: A beat.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Listen. When a commanding officer-
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: The bloggers are having a field day
dialog: with this!
speaker_heading: MARY
text: When a General leaves his posting

speaker_heading: GARY KILLIAN
dialog: -It was not the nature of my father
dialog: to keep private files like this, nor
dialog: would it have been in his own interest
dialog: to do so.
text: Josh throws the remote on the table and stalks out. A beat.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: This is bad...
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
text: No. When they start asking to talk
dialog: to our source? Then it will be bad.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: They're coming for us, Roger.
text: Silence. The Colonel looks back down to his stack of papers

speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: I got one.

text: Everyone looks it him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: (staring at the page)
dialog: I... have a superscript "th". Here.
text: And they're moving towards him now, taking the paper from

speaker_heading: DAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: In fact, other Bush military records
dialog: already released by the White House
dialog: itself show the same superscript -
dialog: here's one from 1968. Some analysts
dialog: outside CBS say they believe the

dialog: for CBS News. He says he believes
text: they are real, but is concerned about
dialog: exactly what is being examined by
dialog: some of the people now questioning
dialog: the documents, because deterioration
dialog: occurs each time a document is
dialog: reproduced. And the documents being
dialog: analyzed outside of CBS have been

dialog: the documents CBS started with.
text: Shots of Dan and Matley looking at the documents.
speaker_heading: DAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Matley did this interview with us

speaker_heading: MARCEL MATLEY
dialog: We look basically at what's called

dialog: identifying them. I would say based
dialog: on our available handwriting evidence,
dialog: yes, this is the same person.

speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you surprised from some of the
dialog: questions that comes from these?
dialog: We're not, but are you surprised?
speaker_heading: MARCEL MATLEY
dialog: I knew going in that this was dynamite
dialog: one way or the other. And I knew
dialog: that potentially it could do far
dialog: more damage to me professionally
dialog: than benefit me. But we seek the
dialog: truth. That's what we do. You're

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: General Hodges, it's Mary Mapes. I
dialog: have Dan Rather on the line with me-
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: Why is the Washington Post describing
dialog: me as your “trump card" in this?
dialog: You tell 'em that, Dan?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I did not, sir.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: It says a highly placed CBS source
dialog: referred to me as your trump card-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: General, that was not me and it was
dialog: not Dan-
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: Because I'm not. I've seen all the
dialog: coverage, and I have to say, I think
text: the memos are fakes.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You- Excuse me?
text: Dan looks over at Mary - what the hell?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: I do not believe Jerry Killian wrote
dialog: those memos.
text: Mary is frantically going through her notebook.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sir, when we spoke on September 6th-
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm just going through my
dialog: notes- when we spoke, you said the
dialog: content of the memos was familiar to
dialog: you, is that correct?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And that they "reflected Colonel
dialog: Killian's mindset at the time".
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: They do. But I hadn't physically
dialog: seen them-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What physically about the memos makes
dialog: you now doubt their authenticity?
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: Jerry's family says he didn't write
dialog: them.
text: Mary looks like she's about to pop a blood vessel. Dan tries
text: a different tack.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: General, the thrust of our story was
dialog: about what happened with the
dialog: President's guard service. Now if,
dialog: as you say, Colonel Killian really
dialog: felt this way and the things described
dialog: in the memos - pressure from higher
dialog: up to get him in and then to give
dialog: him breaks is true, we would like to
dialog: talk to you about that.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: I'm just telling you I now believe
dialog: the memos are forgeries-
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Forget the memos. Is what we
dialog: presented regarding President Bush
dialog: accurate?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: I don't want to get in the middle of
dialog: this.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Would you be willing to sit down
dialog: with me tomorrow? I can come there-
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: I'm sorry. Maybe after the election.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: General-
speaker_heading: GENERAL HODGES (0.S.)
dialog: The family says they're fake and I'm

dialog: test, so one can say with a hundred
dialog: percent certainty they're real or
dialog: forgeries. That's why they can attack
dialog: us.
text: Heyward and Schwartz stare at her.
speaker_heading: SCHWARTZ
dialog: Jesus Christ...
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: But on the internet they are certain,
dialog: Mary, and it's killing us.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Those are lousy wannabe analysts-
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Then we'll get some lousy analysts
dialog: of our own! We are losing this war!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Our story was about whether Bush's
dialog: connections got him into the Guard
dialog: and covered for him when he missed
dialog: commitments and every bit of research
dialog: we found backs that up! The documents
dialog: were just a small part of that, but
dialog: they weren't the point of the story-
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: It doesn't matter what the point
dialog: was! We need to stop the bleeding-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They do not get to do this!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They do not get to smack us just for
dialog: asking the question!
text: Silence. Josh looks away. Mary doesn't seem to realize
text: what she's said. Heyward turns away from her.
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: I want new analysts backing us by
dialog: Monday morning. Go.
text: It takes Mary a moment to find the door. Josh stays. Heyward
text: looks at him, questioning.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Andrew... The way this entire thing
dialog: has been handled... If you'd like
dialog: my resignation, I understand.
text: Heyward stares at him. Softly:
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Get out of my office.
scene_heading: INT. PIERRE HOTEL -- MARY'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Mary lies on the bed, staring at her ceiling. Bad headache.
text: The lights buzz. Her laptop beeps. She crawls to it. New
text: EMAIL. From Dan Rather. She clicks on it.
dialog: Don't forget to eat.
text: Mary smiles. Then has an idea. Types in a web address.
text: Right-wing message board.
text: Knows she shouldn't, but doing it anyway. Scrolling through
text: comments. Most of them focusing on CBS. Keeps scrolling.
text: And then she stops.
text: Pasted into the comments is a PHOTO OF HERSELF. Next to it --
dialog: Here's the bitch.
text: Mary stares at it. A beat. Scrolls down.
dialog: God, does she look like an evil lefty sneak.
text: Somebody wore out the whole bag of ugly sticks on her.
text: Ugly stick? She fell out of the ugly tree and hit every
text: branch on the way down.
text: Scrolls farther.
dialog: YUP. She sure looks like a socialist to me.
dialog: Mapes: feminazi propagandist.
dialog: 80.
text: Methinks she is also of the "diesel" persuasion. A good
text: many of them are forced to join those ranks because men avoid
dialog: them like the plague.
text: I'm picturing Sean Hannity right now sharpening his knife to
dialog: gut this witch.
text: Eyes focused on the last three words floating on the screen...
dialog: Gut this witch
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Wrolstad blinks awake. Looks at the clock. 3:31. Looks
text: beside him. No one there.
text: The sound of a printer working comes from down the hall...
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S HOME OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Mary sips cold coffee as the printer clacks back and forth.
text: HUGE STACKS OF PRINTOUTS litter the office.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD (0.S.)
dialog: When did you get in?
text: She turns to see him in the doorway.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I was worried there'd be cameras at
dialog: the airport. Didn't want Robert to
dialog: see that.
text: Wrolstad nods, pretending he's okay with that.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: So what are you doing in here?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Working.
text: Wrolstad looks at her.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: You want to go take a walk or-
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, I don't want to take a fucking
dialog: walk, Mark, I want to sit here and
dialog: do this, okay?
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: Okay.
text: He backs out of the room, leaving her to it.
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Wrolstad blinks awake again. Mary's standing over him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: It's okay.
text: She sits on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, it's not. It's like no matter
dialog: what I say or do, I'm gonna get hit.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: This isn't that.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: When my Dad used to start in on me,
dialog: I'd think, "I'm not gonna cry, I'm
dialog: not gonna ask him to stop." I'm not
dialog: going to give him the satisfaction
dialog: of seeing how much it hurts. So
dialog: he'd just go harder. And I'd think,
dialog: Someday, I am going to fight you.
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: But I never did.
text: Wrolstad stares at her.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: Now.
text: She looks up at him, confused.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to fight now.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON TV -- An exhausted Dan, interviewing Bill Glennon, an IBM
text: Typewriter Repairman. One of CBS's new "lousy experts".
speaker_heading: BILL GLENNON
dialog: Everything in those documents that
dialog: people are saying can't be done thirty-
dialog: two years ago are totally false.
dialog: Proportional spacing was available,
dialog: superscripts were available as a
dialog: custom feature, proportional spacing
dialog: between lines was available; you
dialog: could order that any way you like...
dialog: PULL BACK to reveal we are in
scene_heading: INT. 60 MINUTES -- EDITING -- EVENING
text: Mary, cutting the interview, with Smith, Colonel Charles,
text: and the Editor. Josh steps in. Shuts the door.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Word's come down from Andrew. They
dialog: want to talk to your source.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What if my source doesn't want to
dialog: talk to them?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Then you'll convince him. You're
dialog: good at convincing people to do
dialog: things, aren't you?
text: Mary's eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I just want you to know how important
dialog: your support has been through this
dialog: entire process.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Call your fucking source, Mary.
text: He slams the door behind him. The Colonel turns to Smith.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Now it's bad.
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Mary, on the phone with Nicki Burkett. INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: NICKI
dialog: You said he wouldn't have to.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Nicki-
speaker_heading: NICKI
dialog: You said you'd verify the documents
dialog: and he wouldn't have to do anything
dialog: else-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Well, it didn't work out that way,
dialog: did it?
text: No response. Mary sighs.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, Nicki, I'm tired.
speaker_heading: NICKI
dialog: Bill did nothing wrong.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No one's saying he did. I just need
dialog: him to get on the phone with my boss
dialog: and tell him what he told me.
text: Nicki doesn't respond. Mary plays her last card.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: It would mean a lot to Dan. Please?
dialog: Another beat and then...
scene_heading: INT. HEYWARD'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: Mary, Dan, and Betsy on couches. Josh and Mary Murphy sit

scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Bill? This is Andrew Heyward, I'm
dialog: the President of CBS News.
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: Is Dan there?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'm here, Colonel.
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: Heard Hodges turned tail on you.
dialog: All these guys run from it. You
dialog: know I got health problems?
text: Heyward glances at the others - "who is this guy?"
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: I had heard that, which is why I
dialog: don't want to take up too much of
dialog: your time. I was wondering if you'd
dialog: fill me in on a few things.
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: Shoot.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Well, how you came to be in possession
dialog: of the documents. You told Mary it
dialog: was from a man named George Conn?
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: She was bugging me so much about it
dialog: I had to tell her something.
text: On Mary, her face sinking. Heyward shoots her a look.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: So that's not accurate?
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: No, sir, it is not.
text: Mary curses under her breath.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Would you mind telling us what really
dialog: happened?
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: I got a call in March from a guy who
dialog: said a woman named Lucy Ramirez wanted
dialog: to get in contact with me.
dialog: He told me to call the Houston Holiday
dialog: Inn between 7 and 10 and ask for a
dialog: specific room, so I did. This Ramirez
dialog: woman told me she was supposed to be
dialog: a go-between, a person to deliver a
dialog: package of documents to me.
text: Betsy scribbles furiously to get this all down...
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I was supposed to copy the documents
text: inside and then burn the originals,
dialog: which were also copies, and the
dialog: envelope. Destroy the DNA evidence
dialog: of where they come from, you see.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: So she says "When are you gonna be
dialog: in Houston next?" And I tell her
dialog: we're coming to the Livestock Show
dialog: in a few weeks - we sell Simmental
dialog: cattle. The Show is an excellent
dialog: way to advertise our bull semen.
text: On Betsy's notes - burn papers, livestock show, bull semen...
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.) (CONT'D)
text: So the first day at the show, a dark
text: skinned fellah comes up, hands me an
text: envelope, walks away. Inside are
dialog: those memos. I burned the rest like
dialog: he said. Done and done.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: And was this the same man who talked
dialog: to you on the phone?
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: No idea. Maybe.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: And you didn't tell Mary all this
dialog: before because...
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: Said I'd keep it quiet.
dialog: Mary did a good job on this. Don't
dialog: judge her too harshly.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (hollow)
dialog: Thanks, Bill.
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: De nada.
text: Heyward, still reeling.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Bill, this is, uh- this is pretty
dialog: amazing stuff. Maybe you'd be willing
dialog: to sit down and talk about it for
dialog: us? Help clear the air for everyone?
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: Don't know. What do you think, Dan?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I think they can't hit us any harder
dialog: than they already are, Colonel. Go
dialog: on the record and tell the truth.
dialog: Be done with it.
text: Silence. Finally:
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: My office will make the necessary
dialog: arrangements. Thanks for your time.
speaker_heading: BURKETT (0.S.)
dialog: Goodbye.
text: CLICK. Call over. Everyone sits there in silence. And
text: then Mary LAUGHS at the absurdity of it all. Can't help it.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You think this is funny?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You don't? It's The Manchurian
dialog: Candidate meets Hee Haw!
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: We need him on camera as soon as
dialog: possible. Betsy?
text: Betsy nods as the group rises and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Mary, hang back a sec?
text: Mary does. The others leave. Heyward shuts the door behind
text: them and turns back to her. Just the two of them.
speaker_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: When you sit with Burkett, there
dialog: should be a line of questioning about
dialog: his motives. His political leanings,
dialog: his views on the President. Why he
dialog: lied. People are going to cover how
dialog: we cover this. We need to inoculate
dialog: ourselves.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Thou shalt protect the company...
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: Fuck that, I want Dan to survive
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why wouldn't he survive this?
text: Heyward looks at her. Doesn't respond. A beat.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: If Dan feels like this is corporate
dialog: positioning, he won't do it.
scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: He won't for me. He will for you.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE (FLYING) -- MORNING
text: Betsy sits across the aisle. Dan sits at the window, staring
text: out at the clouds. Mary is next to him. Watching him.
dialog: Trying to decide what to do.
scene_heading: EXT. DALLAS/FORT WORTH AIRPORT -- ARRIVALS
text: Mary, Betsy and Dan exit the airport terminal to find
text: PROTESTERS and CAMERA CREWS shouting at them. Pandemonium.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Jesus!
text: A FOX NEWS REPORTER pushes to the front of the scrum, sticks
text: a microphone in Dan's face and breathlessly asks:
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Dan, you broadcast those fake memos!
dialog: Do you feel duped?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You work for Fox News. Do you?
text: Mary hustles him into a waiting car and shuts the door.
scene_heading: EXT. CRESCENT COURT HOTEL -- MORNING
text: Crescent Court Hotel - Dallas, Texas. A lushly appointed
text: hotel. Smith and Colonel Charles stand in front motor-court.
text: Smith eyes the nearby fountain. Familiar.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I think I've been thrown out of this
dialog: hotel...
text: The Colonel spots Mary and Dan's car approaching.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Here they come.
text: The car enters the hotel grounds and pulls to a halt beside
text: the fountain. Mary, Dan, and Betsy get out of the car.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Where are the Burketts?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
text: Upstairs getting ready.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Dan?
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: We need to ask why he lied to us.
dialog: (exchanging looks
dialog: with Betsy)
dialog: We need to make sure we get that.
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
text: Dan, Mary, and Betsy come into the Burkett's room as Bill
text: and Nicki rise to greet him.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Just wanted to come in say and hello
dialog: before we get going.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: Well, thanks for that, Dan.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: These things are fairly easy, we'll
dialog: just sit and talk a bit. I'm also
dialog: going to ask about why you misled
dialog: us, didn't want to take you by
dialog: surprise with that.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: I expected that, and I'll be happy
dialog: to set that straight.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Great. Anytime you need to stop,
dialog: get a drink of water, whatever, let
dialog: us know. If you'll excuse me, I
dialog: gotta go get my war-paint on.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Worst part of this is the make up.
text: Burkett smiles as Dan excuses himself. Off to the side,
text: Nicki stands with Mary and Betsy. Her simple cotton dress
text: no match for the fashionable clothes of the news women.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's going to be fine, Nicki.
text: On Nicki's face. Not buying it.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL -- HOSPITALITY SUITE -- DAY
text: The lights blaze down. Dan sits across from Burkett. Make-
text: up caking on his sweaty face. The interview is into it's
text: second hour. Burkett is visibly tired.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: .--But you told us a different story.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: To protect the people who gave me
dialog: the documents.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Did they ask you to do this?
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: They had wanted me to burn everything
dialog: they- yeah, they didn't want people
dialog: to know they were the source on this.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This man and this mystery woman.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: That's right.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Can I get some more water?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Of course.
text: A PA hands Burkett water. Mary and Betsy walk over to Dan.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: We need a better bite on this. Maybe
dialog: instead of "Did they ask you to do
dialog: that", say "Did they ask you to lie?"
text: Dan looks to Mary, who nods.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Okay.
text: Burkett finishes sipping the water. Dan looks to him.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to go back for a moment.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This man and this mystery woman, did
dialog: they ask you to lie to us?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: They didn't want me to say how I got
dialog: the documents.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And that's why you initially misled
dialog: us?
text: Betsy begins writing something on a card...
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: Yes.
text: She hands the card to Mary - So that's why you lied you us?
text: Mary looks at her. Betsy nods, urging "go on"...
speaker_heading: BURKETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Your producer was pushing me to find
dialog: out where I got the memos from.
text: Mary hands Dan the card who scans it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: So that's why you lied to us?
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: Yes. And I know it caused some
dialog: problems.
text: He reaches for the water again. Dan pauses as he takes a
text: several gulps from it. Betsy is writing another card.
dialog: Why didn't you tell us the truth when you gave us the memos?
text: Mary raises an eyebrow at her. Betsy gives her another "go
text: on" look. Mary hands the card to Dan while Burkett breathes.
text: Dan looks at Mary. Not pleased, but he'll do it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to Burkett; gently)
dialog: Whenever you're ready.
text: Burkett nods. Finishes with the water. Nicki takes it from
text: him, not pleased with how this is going.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You say you knew this would cause
dialog: problems.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: I know it did, I didn't know it would.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: So, again, why didn't you just tell
dialog: us the truth when you gave us the
dialog: memos?
text: An exhale from Nicki on the sidelines. Not happy with this.
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: I was trying to protect people, Dan.
dialog: People who were trying to tell the
dialog: truth about what happened back then.
dialog: Betsy, writing again - So you decided to lie about where the
text: documents came from? Mary shakes her head. Not doing it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And you believe these documents are
dialog: telling the truth?
speaker_heading: BURKETT
dialog: I do.
text: Betsy hands it to Dan herself. Dan looks at it. Frowns.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We have that already.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I want to make sure we have enough
dialog: so it'll cut-
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: We have it. I'm moving on.
text: Betsy moves back to her chair, chastened. Across the room,
text: Nicki Burkett stares at Mary, furious.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM -- AFTERNOON
text: After. Mary, Betsy, Smith and Roger sitting silence. Passing
text: a package of potato chips back and forth. Smith exhales.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: He's a good guy, you know.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You think I enjoyed that? We should
dialog: cut something for Nightly, get it
text: out immediately. Andrew agrees.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: F.E.A.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You guys and Dan always say that,
dialog: what the hell does it mean?
text: A knock at the door.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's open!
text: The door opens to reveal Nicki Burkett. Lips pursed and
text: eyes glistening. A beat.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: How's Bill doing?
speaker_heading: NICKI
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Don't you dare ask how Bill is.
dialog: Bill is sick. He's a sick man. And
dialog: you don't give a damn about him.
dialog: You just spent two hours trying to
dialog: destroy him. You made him crawl on-
dialog: camera. You made him say, again and
dialog: again, that he lied and it still
dialog: wasn't enough for you. You wanted
dialog: More. You wanted to put the blame
dialog: on him for all the things you did
dialog: wrong putting this story together.
dialog: You want to wrap it all up in a neat
dialog: package and say "It's all Bill
dialog: Burkett's fault." Well, it's not,
dialog: and you know it. And you promised
dialog: when we came here to do this
dialog: interview, we would get a fair shake
dialog: and we got nothing from you but lies.
text: She's so mad she's shaking. Everyone else is too.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Nicki-
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: NICKI
dialog: You may think I'm some stupid hick
dialog: who doesn't know a damn thing about
dialog: a damn thing and you are so smart
dialog: and such a big shot. But I keep my
dialog: promises and I don't destroy people
dialog: to protect myself. I don't destroy
text: people and humiliate them and then
dialog: pretend I give a goddamn about how
dialog: they are. To answer your question,
dialog: Bill is not good. But then, you
dialog: knew that already.
text: Silence. No one else can summon a word.
text: Nicki turns and leaves them. Betsy crumples up the chips
text: bag and tosses it on the table. Not hungry anymore.
scene_heading: EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT -- NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CBS NEWS -- LOBBY

scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD
dialog: We need to talk.
scene_heading: INT. PIERRE HOTEL -- MARY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Late. A knocking at the door. Mary clicks on the light and
text: goes to answer it. Dan, in his trench coat.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What are the chances you have
dialog: something alcoholic in there?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Better than average.
scene_heading: INT. PIERRE HOTEL -- MARY'S ROOM -- LATER

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: How long have we known each other?

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, Jesus, it's that bad?
text: Mary hands him his drink and sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: There is going to be an investigation.
dialog: CBS is going to appoint an independent
dialog: panel to look in to how the story
dialog: was put together. I'm to make an
dialog: announcement about it tomorrow.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And I'm going to apologize for the
text: story on air.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Andrew asked you to apologize?
text: Dan looks up at her.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: He did not ask.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's surrender.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Since Burkett changed his story,
dialog: Andrew says CBS will no longer risk
dialog: its reputation on this.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He knew. Even before we went down
dialog: there. He just wanted Burkett on
dialog: tape...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I need you to do me a favor. I need
dialog: you to stop worrying about me.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's not gonna happen-
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You need to protect yourself now.
dialog: We all do.
text: He puts his drink down and withdraws a BUSINESS CARD. Leaves
text: it on the table. Mary looks at it. It is for a lawyer.
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S OFFICE -- EVENING
text: Mary sits on her couch. Josh across from her. ON TV - The

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Last week, amid increasing questions
dialog: about the authenticity of documents
dialog: used in support of a 60 Minutes
dialog: Wednesday story about President Bush's
dialog: time in the Texas Air National Guard,
dialog: CBS News vowed to re-examine the
dialog: documents in question, and their
dialog: source, vigorously. And we promised
dialog: that we would let the American Public
dialog: know whatever the outcome-
text: Mary clicks off her TV. Can't watch anymore. She looks at
dialog: Josh. Then:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm sorry this was your first story
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I'm thinking next week we should
dialog: just have Dan shoot the President.
dialog: Would cause much less drama.
text: Mary laughs. Josh smiles. A nice moment. Broken by Betsy
text: coming through the door, a strange look on her face.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Mary? USA Today wants to know if
dialog: you put Burkett in touch with the
dialog: Kerry campaign in exchange for
dialog: documents?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I know what this is about. Josh,
dialog: remember when I told you Burkett
dialog: wanted to give the Kerry campaign
dialog: advice on the swift boat stuff?
text: Josh just stares at her.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I wanted to do a bullshit check on
dialog: Burkett after he said he'd talked to
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Howard Dean? You said I could contact
dialog: the Kerry people to check and then
dialog: Burkett wanted me to give them his
dialog: phone number and you said I could,
dialog: so I did.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you remember any of this?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I must not have made myself clear.
dialog: You must have misunderstood what I

speaker_heading: DAN (0.S.
dialog: After extensive additional interviews,
dialog: I no longer have the confidence in
dialog: these documents that would allow us
dialog: to continue vouching for them
dialog: journalistically. I find we have
dialog: been misled on the key question of
dialog: how our source for the documents
dialog: came into possession of these papers.
dialog: That, combined with some of the

speaker_heading: DAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: CBS has hired the firm of Kirkpatrick

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You paper trailed them.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Over a thousand lawyers, headquartered
dialog: in Seattle. They specialize in
dialog: internal investigations. They're
dialog: the ones Bush brought in to rip apart
dialog: Worldcom last year.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: The same WorldCom that committed an
dialog: 11 billion dollar fraud leading to

speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES (CONT'D)
dialog: Former governor of Pennsylvania,

dialog: Second campaign was run by Karl Rove.
text: But the crown jewel of his resume is
dialog: serving as U.S. Attorney General
dialog: from 1988 to 1991 under former

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: The man running this "independent

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Jesus. Who goes in first?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Dan, then me, then Lucy, the Colonel,
dialog: then you. You're the grand finale.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: COLONEL CHARLES
dialog: Because they want to have everything
dialog: they can on you before they put you

text: Mary doesn't know what to say. The phone rings again.

speaker_heading: WROLSTAD

dialog: It's Heyward.

speaker_heading: SMITH

scene_heading: ANDREW HEYWARD

speaker_heading: JOSH

dialog: I understand that you're leaving.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Right now Viacom is lobbying a

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Security to the 9th floor now please?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: You don't think Viacom needs the

dialog: don't think they're desperate to

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: You know when the FCC repealed cross

dialog: allowed to own forty-five percent of
dialog: the National Market Share? Forty-
dialog: five percent. People fucking flipped.
dialog: They actually wrote their congressmen.
dialog: So in the 2003 Appropriations Bill,

dialog: Except the President wouldn't sign

dialog: found at thirty-nine percent and
dialog: why? Because at that exact
dialog: percentage, both Viacom and Newscorp
dialog: wouldn't have to sell off any

speaker_heading: MARY

text: Interrupted as Smith slides into the booth across from her.
speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And I hope you told them I regularly

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: This isn't a joke, Mary!
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: SMITH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about my father?

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: RADIO HOST (0.S.)

speaker_heading: DON MAPES (0.S.)
dialog: She's a typical liberal. She went

dialog: Like each word is a slap...
speaker_heading: RADIO HOST (0.S.)
dialog: So this is a pattern of hers?
speaker_heading: DON MAPES (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, sure. When I heard this was a

speaker_heading: DON MAPES (0.S.)
dialog: I'm expressing my opinion. I thought

speaker_heading: WROLSTAD

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Daddy, please, stop.
text: A beat. An exhale of breath from the other end.
speaker_heading: DON MAPES
dialog: Well since you asked, I will.
text: CLICK. He's hung up. Mary swallows. Tosses the phone on
text: the lawn and goes back inside. Done.
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S BEDROOM -- AFTERNOON
text: Mary lies in what almost looks like a catatonic state. No
text: lights on, just the fading sun coming through the slats in

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I can't anymore.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: You can.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't want to. They can have my

dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: I never should have asked the
dialog: question...
text: Wrolstad looks at her. He knows that's not true.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: So they're right and you're wrong?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Guess so.

speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: And Dan?
text: She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's not fair.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: "It's a shame what that woman did to

text: saying on cable.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Don't...
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: How's he's going to go down a

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Fuck you...
text: He puts his hand on her brow.
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: You have to make your case to the

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Even if the system is rigged?
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: The system is rigged. Always has
dialog: been. But you still have to tell
dialog: them what happened.
text: Mary stares at him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why?
text: Wrolstad smiles at his wife - isn't it obvious?
speaker_heading: WROLSTAD
dialog: Because that's what we do.

scene_heading: INT. HIBEY'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Mary sits across from the lawyer. Tale told. Hibey blinks.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you believe I did my job?
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: I told you, it doesn't matter what I

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It does to me.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: If you'd like someone else to
dialog: represent you in this, I understand.
text: He looks to the door. She doesn't move.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tell me why I shouldn't.
text: Hibey leans back in his chair.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: What do you want out of this?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Do you want to get into a debate
dialog: about journalism with them or do you

dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I can't do both?
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Not at this point, no.

dialog: You're the primary breadwinner, is
dialog: that correct?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: And your son is seven?
text: Mary stares at him.
speaker_heading: HIBEY (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn't a trial, this is a hunt.
dialog: This is about assignation of blame -
dialog: who is at fault, because somebody
dialog: has to be. Debate that with them
dialog: and you're done.
text: Mary looks at him. The needles have stopped.
speaker_heading: HIBEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You have one chance here.
dialog: Among all the conservative lawyers
text: on the panel, there is one former
dialog: journalist. One man who can maybe
dialog: understand what happened. You
dialog: convince him... maybe he can turn
text: the rest of them.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But if you antagonize them, if you

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Ms. Mapes, thank you for coming in.
dialog: I'm Larry Lanpher. I'm Lead Council

speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: A pleasure.
dialog: 112.
text: Hibey looks around the room.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
text: I notice there's no stenographer.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: This is an internal investigation.
dialog: We're just going to take some notes
dialog: as we go.
text: He nods to two women with notebooks and pens.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: So there will be no official record?
text: Lanpher ignores the question with a smile.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Would you like to take a bathroom
dialog: break before we begin?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: You're sure?
text: Mary smiles back.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm not that delicate.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: I'd like one.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Okay. Start in ten minutes everyone?
scene_heading: INT. SIDE ROOM -- DAY
text: Hibey pulls Mary into a small room off the conference room.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: I need you to stay calm.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don't I look calm?
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Not even a little. They're going to
dialog: try and catch you off balance. When
dialog: they ask a question, answer it.
dialog: Tell them what time it is, don't
dialog: tell them how to build a clock.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But-
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Don't fight.
text: He holds her gaze. She nods. They head back in.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROCK -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- AFTERNOON
text: Missal slides a stack of papers across the table.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: I'd like to talk a little about
dialog: language.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: These are the printouts of emails
dialog: sent back and forth by your group
dialog: during the investigation.
text: Hibey pages through them.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL (CONT'D)
dialog: In this one to Mike Smith, what did
dialog: the two of you mean when you discussed
dialog: a piece of "tasty brisket"?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That referred to a piece of
dialog: information Mike uncovered working
text: on a documentary for the Germans.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: A piece of information against the
dialog: President.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I think specifically it referred to
text: Bush losing his nerve while flying.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: Which was not mentioned in the report
dialog: you aired on 60 Minutes.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I didn't think we had it nailed down.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: So, is it accurate to say that you
dialog: were looking for anything negative
dialog: about the President?
text: Hibey looks over to Mary. Careful here...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I would say it's accurate that we
dialog: were looking for any information
dialog: about his time in the Air National
text: Guard that had not yet come to light.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: And that's why it's "tasty"? Not
dialog: because it reflected poorly on the
dialog: President?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It was tasty because it had the
dialog: potential to be newsworthy. Mike
dialog: and I are friends, we use a shorthand.
dialog: Sarcasm, jokes.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Is that common in your industry?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: When dealing with matters as serious
dialog: as this, it's common to make jokes?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I can assure you, we take our work
dialog: very seriously.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: I also wanted to ask you about this
dialog: email from Roger Charles where he
dialog: says he "feels better" about the
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL (CONT'D)
dialog: documents because of their formatting.
dialog: Colonel Charles originally thought
dialog: the documents were fake?
text: Mary blinks.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don't believe so.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: Then why would he say here that he
dialog: "feels better"?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Because it seemed that what our source
dialog: was telling us was true.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: I have to disagree. Even the subject
dialog: line of the email is "I feel better"
text: with three exclamation points. It
dialog: seems that Colonel Charles initially
dialog: had doubts.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You would have to ask Colonel Charles.
text: Hibey nods. Good answer. But Mary continues:
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: But also, I'd say he was coming from
dialog: a place of not being sure whether
dialog: the memos were real or not and then
dialog: becoming confident that they were.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Really?
dialog: (smiles )
dialog: You'll forgive me for saying, but
dialog: your testimony so far doesn't bear
dialog: that out.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: (sensing danger)
dialog: This isn't testimony, remember?
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: If it was impossible to authenticate
dialog: the memos, doesn't it stand to reason
dialog: that you initially assumed that the
dialog: memos were real rather than the other
dialog: way around?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I wouldn't say that.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Well, what would you say?
text: Mary stares at him.
dialog: On Hibey.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER (CONT'D)
dialog: It seems to me you assumed these
dialog: memos were real from the outset, and
dialog: you looked to make sure that nothing
dialog: disproved that. Essentially, you
dialog: took the position that the President
dialog: was guilty until proven innocent.
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We took several steps to vet these
dialog: memos .
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Such as?
dialog: There's only two signatures, and two
dialog: sets of initials - hardly enough
text: comparison for a handwriting match.
dialog: You said yourself no ink or carbon
dialog: tests could be performed, in fact
dialog: two of the four analysts you hired
dialog: have said they had strong reservations
dialog: about the memos authenticity.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Much of the formatting and terminology
dialog: used is consistent with the period-
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: That's debatable-
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (insisting)
dialog: Is consistent with the period, as is
dialog: the content of the memos, which was
dialog: verified by several different sources
dialog: who knew Colonel Killian-
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Then what about this?
dialog: (reading a memo)
dialog: "O.E.T.R." Is this one of the
dialog: terminologies that was "consistent
dialog: with the period"?

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: "Officer Effectiveness Training
dialog: Report."
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Actually, the correct acronym is
dialog: O.E.R. - "Officer Effectiveness
dialog: Report". No T.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Isn't it true, Mary, that the phrase
dialog: "Officer Effectiveness Training
dialog: Report" doesn't actually appear
dialog: anywhere on any official documents?
dialog: That this phrase is something you
dialog: created to explain this incorrect
dialog: abbreviation in your memos?
text: Hibey stares at Mary, stricken. Checkmate.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: It isn't?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I wouldn't do something like that.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Then prove it.

text: A beat. All eyes on Mary. She opens up her binder and
text: withdraws a piece of paper. Slides it across the table.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Official document. Top of the page.
text: Lanpher looks. The others around him do too. The top of
dialog: the page reads - Officer Effectiveness Training Report. A
text: beat. Mary looks at Lanpher, pleasantly. Waiting.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Oh. I see that. Sorry, my mistake.
text: Hibey beams.

speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Clearly you did well. They'll regroup

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Next month?
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: They've decided to delay announcing
dialog: the Panel's findings till after the

scene_heading: PRESIDENT BUSH
dialog: I told you that the other day, and
dialog: you probably thought I was just
dialog: seeking votes. But now that you
dialog: voted, I really meant it.
text: LAUGHTER from the press corps.
dialog: Over more
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT BUSH (CONT'D)
dialog: I appreciate the hard work of the
dialog: press corps. We all put in long
dialog: hours, and you're away from your
dialog: families for a long period of time.
dialog: But the country is better off when
dialog: we have a vigorous and free press
dialog: covering our elections. Without
dialog: over-pandering, I'll answer a few
dialog: questions. Hunt?
text: laughter reporter TERENCE HUNT speaks.
scene_heading: TERENCE HUNT
dialog: Mr. President, thank you. As you
dialog: look at your second term, how much
dialog: is the war in Iraq going to cost?
dialog: Do you intend to send more troops,
dialog: or bring troops home? And in the
dialog: Middle East, more broadly, do you
dialog: agree with Tony Blair that
dialog: revitalizing the Middle East peace
dialog: process is the single most pressing
dialog: political issue facing the world?
scene_heading: PRESIDENT BUSH
dialog: Now that I've got the will of the
dialog: people at my back, I'm going to start
dialog: enforcing the one-question rule.
dialog: That was three questions.

speaker_heading: INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Did you know that 60 Minutes was the
dialog: first news program to ever make money?
dialog: Before that, all news divisions
dialog: operated at a financial loss.
text: He looks out at the city.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: When the government gave networks
dialog: the airwaves, it was with the
dialog: stipulation that they would be used
dialog: in some capacity for the public good.
dialog: And that was the news. They made
text: their money elsewhere on the schedule.
dialog: But reporting the news was a duty.
dialog: A public trust.
text: Mary doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: When Hewitt started 60 Minutes in
dialog: 1968, it built to enormous ratings.
dialog: It was wonderful. People were really
dialog: watching news. Caring. And we
dialog: figured out a way to give it to them.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (sips)
dialog: I was there, Mary. I was there the
dialog: day they figured out news could make
dialog: money.
text: The traffic below him is honking. He doesn't seem to notice.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: After a while it dawned on them; how
dialog: come the Evening News isn't a profit
dialog: center too? Why aren't the morning
dialog: shows earning more? If you interview
dialog: Survivor contestants instead of
dialog: survivors of genocide, your ad rates
dialog: go up. Pretty soon we won't even
dialog: run down our own stories cause it's
dialog: too expensive. We'll just pay someone
dialog: else to do it, then read them on the
dialog: air for show.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It was a public trust once. I swear
dialog: to you it was.
text: Very softly, Mary asks him again.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How are you doing, Dan?
text: Dan drains the rest of the scotch and examines his glass.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'm stepping down as anchor.
text: In her kitchen, Mary stands very still.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: After Inauguration.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, Dan...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You didn't cause this, Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You're a shitty liar, you know that?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: (tears in her eyes)
dialog: Why didn't you ask me? Everyone
dialog: else asked after the shit hit the
dialog: fan, why didn't you?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Ask you what?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why didn't you ask me if the documents
dialog: were real?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Because I knew I didn't need to.
text: Mary is silent.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: When you go back in there, you hold
dialog: your head up, understand?

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, Dad.

scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROCK -- SIDE ROOM -- AFTERNOON
text: Thunder and lightning outside. Late in the day. Dinner
text: break. Mary watches Panel members through the open door.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: You're doing great. Another half
dialog: hour and we're done.
text: Mary nods, her mind anywhere but here. Like she's deciding
text: something. Doodling absently on a legal pad. "FEA". Hibey
text: looks at the letters on the page.
speaker_heading: HIBEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What does that mean?
text: She looks up at him.
dialog: 123.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Fuck 'em all.
scene_heading: INT. BLACK ROCK -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- AFTERNOON
text: Mary and Hibey sit across from the panel. One more time.
text: Rain streaks the windows. Things are wrapping up.
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: ...-Well, I'm glad we have
dialog: clarification on that.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Good. If there's nothing else?
text: Missal and the others move to rise. Mary keeps her seat.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Aren't you going to ask about my
dialog: politics?
text: Missal blinks. Hibey shoots her a warning look.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You've asked other people what I
dialog: believe. Aren't you going to ask
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: (hissing to Mary)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: The journalist, LOU BOCCARDI, finally speaks.
speaker_heading: LOU BOCCARDI
dialog: Well, wouldn't you say most people
dialog: you work with think you're a liberal?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you mean, "Am I now, or have I
dialog: ever been a liberal"?
text: A number of the panel shifts in their seats uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: It's a legitimate question.
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: MIKE MISSAL
dialog: You brought it up.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, you did when you asked all my co-
dialog: workers. So I'll tell you. I don't
dialog: believe in labels. I think most
dialog: people have a mixture of views-
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: That's not what we're talking about.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Then what are you talking about,
dialog: Larry?
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: We're talking about you bringing
dialog: your politics into your reporting.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I did nothing of the kind.
speaker_heading: LARRY LANPHER
dialog: Really? Nothing? Is that why when
dialog: Barnes said he got Bush into the
dialog: Guard, you believed him without
dialog: question? That when Bill Burkett,
dialog: an outspoken Bush critic and admitted
dialog: liar brought you memos, you assumed
dialog: their authenticity and didn't bother
dialog: to source them? That when not one
dialog: but two of your four document
dialog: examiners expressed doubts the memos
dialog: were real, you pushed them aside and
dialog: rushed the story on air? And why
dialog: you personally contacted John Kerry's
dialog: campaign on behalf of a man who had
dialog: dedicated himself to smearing the
dialog: President?
dialog: (staring at her)
dialog: Tell me, Mary, where exactly does
dialog: politics not enter into any of this?
dialog: Or are you just that bad at your
dialog: job?
text: A beat. Lanpher's breathing hard. The others stare at him.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you know what it would take to
dialog: fake these memos?
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Mary-
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, this is important. It would
dialog: require the forger to have an in
dialog: depth knowledge of the 1971 Air Force
dialog: manual, including rules, regulations,
dialog: and abbreviations. He would have to
dialog: know Bush's official record backwards
dialog: and forwards to make sure that none
dialog: of these memos conflicted with it.
dialog: He would have to know all the players
text: in the Texas Air National Guard at
dialog: the time - not just their names but
dialog: their attitudes and opinions including
dialog: how they related to one another. He
dialog: would have to know that Colonel
dialog: Killian kept personal memos for
text: himself like this in the first place.
dialog: He would have to know how Killian
dialog: felt at the time, particularly about
dialog: his superiors and then first
dialog: Lieutenant Bush. He would have to
dialog: know or learn all of this in order
dialog: to fool us as you assume he did.
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: Now. Do you really think a man who
dialog: takes that kind of time and precision
dialog: then goes and types these up on
dialog: Microsoft Word?
text: The men stare at her. Nobody has a response to
text: that. Thunder in the distance.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Our story was about whether Bush
dialog: fulfilled his service. But nobody
dialog: wants to talk about that. They want
dialog: to talk about fonts and forgery and
dialog: conspiracy theories. Because that's
dialog: what people do if they don't like a
dialog: story these days. They point and
dialog: scream.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: They question your politics, your
dialog: objectivity - hell, your basic
dialog: humanity - and then they hope to God
text: the truth gets lost in the scrum.
dialog: (shaking her head)
text: And when it's finally over, they've
dialog: kicked and shouted so loud we don't
dialog: even remember what the point was.
text: Rain continues to fall. And then from the back of the room
scene_heading: DICK THORNBURGH
dialog: But you didn't prove it.
text: They all turn to him. The old man finally speaks.
speaker_heading: DICK THORNBURGH (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't prove Ben Barnes got the
dialog: President into the Guard. You didn't
dialog: prove the memos are real. The burden
dialog: of proof is on you.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: By that standard the Times would
dialog: never have run the Pentagon Papers,
dialog: the Post would never have listened
dialog: to Deep Throat-
scene_heading: DICK THORNBURGH
dialog: Ben Barnes is hardly Deep Throat-
speaker_heading: MARY
text: Ben Barnes has confessed to abusing
dialog: his power to keep some of the richest
dialog: and most privileged sons of Texas
dialog: from getting their asses blown up in
dialog: Vietnam!
scene_heading: DICK THORNBURGH
dialog: Ms. Mapes, don't you think that it's
dialog: possible, just possible, that some
dialog: of those fine young men got into the
dialog: National Guard on their own merit?
text: Mary blinks. A beat. And then she answers truthfully.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No, sir. No, I do not.
dialog: 127.
text: Thornburgh nods. A beat. He's heard what he came to hear.
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK ROCK -- EVENING
text: The rain has grown to a downpour. Mary and Hibey step out
text: the door. Pausing at the edge of the deluge.
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: Had to do it, didn't you?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: In the immortal words of Popeye - "I
dialog: am what I am".
speaker_heading: HIBEY
dialog: I would've gone with "To thine own
dialog: self be true" but Popeye works.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: They'1l have their findings in a few
dialog: weeks. I'll call you when I hear.
text: She extends a hand. They shake. Then she turns, heading
text: off down the street.
speaker_heading: HIBEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Mary?
text: Mary turns back. Standing there in the rain.

dialog: For the CBS Evening News, Dan Rather

scene_heading: IN THE STUDIO
text: Dan rises to thunderous applause. Smiling at the people
text: there. A little teary eyed himself. Champagne is popped.
text: Among those clapping, Heyward. Dan catches his eye. Heyward
text: smiles. Dan turns away from him and begins a conversation.
text: Heyward's smile falters just a bit. But he keeps applauding.
text: Dan turns and walks away from camera. Leaving us. Leaving
dialog: the stage.
text: As he goes, these words appear:
dialog: The Independent Panel Report found no political bias in the
text: reporting of the Guard Story. Josh Howard, Mary Murphy, and
dialog: Betsy West were asked to resign.
dialog: Mary Mapes was fired.
text: 10 days later, President George W. Bush was inaugurated for

dialog: You want to take a walk?

text: We hold on the door and slowly pan back to the television.
text: Sitting there, mercifully silent.
text: As we PUSH IN, these words appear on screen...
