dialog: hate selling extended warranties.

scene_heading: INT. MELISSA'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Melissa is dressed in normal school clothes. Her friend
text: CLARISSA, a slightly preppy teenage girl, is sitting next to
text: her. They're doing homework.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What are you wearing for Jason's
dialog: Halloween party?
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: I don't know. I'm thinking of going
dialog: as Catwoman. Do you think I could
dialog: pull it off?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Absolutely, it would be awesome. We
dialog: could get soem black hair dye, maybe
dialog: some leather pants...
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: I don't know, Amy might copy me.
dialog: She's been being such a bitch lately.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: God, I know! She's really a nice
dialog: girl, but she's just so selfish. I
dialog: don't know what it is, but she has
dialog: some weird kind of competition thing
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Me neither...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: But so what if she copies you; you'll
dialog: look better in it anyway.
text: They giggle and continue with their homework.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
text: The girls playing on the bed and tickling each other. They
text: are laughing as Melissa hugs Clarissa. Its obvious they're
dialog: best friends.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Calming down)
dialog: Um... ok. I have a question... do
dialog: you think 23 is too old?
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Too old for what?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Don't freak out on me, OK?
text: Clarissa nods with a curious expression on her face.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Well, I met this guy online, his
dialog: name is Daniel and he's really
dialog: awesome. He's sweet, and wonderful,
dialog: and he's just so amazing.
text: Clarissa listens patiently.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Taking a deep breath)
dialog: The only problem is that he's twenty-
dialog: three.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: You met him online? I don't know...
dialog: that's kind of risky. I mean, what
dialog: if he's some kind of psycho or
dialog: deranged lunatic?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Eagerly)
dialog: No, he's not, he's not, he's totally
dialog: not!
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I can just tell; we connect. When
dialog: I'm talking to him I just feel so
dialog: comfortable. He's sweet, and nice,
dialog: and romantic... he feels like my
dialog: soulmate or something.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: That's cool I guess. It's still weird
dialog: though. What does he look like? Is
dialog: he hot?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Very...
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Let me see... oho, you're right.
dialog: (Teasingly)
dialog: Age might not matter.

speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Hey, I missed you. How's your mom?
speaker_heading: MELISSA (V.O.)
dialog: Doing better. She's been fighting a
dialog: lot less with my dad.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: That's good. Hopefully it will last.
dialog: My parents used to fight like crazy
dialog: and they are always at each other's
dialog: throats. I never want to be like
dialog: that... I wrote you something.
speaker_heading: MELISSA (V.O.)
dialog: No one's ever done anything like
dialog: that for me before.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: You're worth it. Okay, here it is.
dialog: Ode to Melissa
speaker_heading: MATCH CUT:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MELISSA'S FACE
speaker_heading: MELISSA (V.O.)
dialog: (Wonderingly)
dialog: Ode to Melissa I greet the fly that
text: lands on my bed I try to find words
dialog: worthy of your presence.
text: She's very moved as she reads the poem.
speaker_heading: MELISSA (V.O.)
dialog: Outside, you lurk with nervous feline
text: eyes. Day yawns to night, Trees
dialog: become dark bodies -- Giant shadow
text: puppets of street lamp Halos.
text: She grabs her webcam and begins to hook it up to her computer.
text: Daniel looks more and more surprised as he watches his
text: computer screen. Melissa's voice continues to read the poem.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (Reading off screen)
dialog: Accept webcam... YES!
speaker_heading: MELISSA (CONT. V.O.)
text: Eyes close to the warmth of dreams
dialog: Green dreams of happy tomorrows, And

text: are the cool darkness between Days.
dialog: The molecules of time sleep, Their
dialog: quiet undulations Across your starry
dialog: hands
speaker_heading: DANIEL'S POV
text: He's watching Melissa steady a green webcam.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: As I lie and watch your naked skin
text: Bathed by moonlight. Oh... wow.
text: The webcam stops shaking.
speaker_heading: MELISSA (V.O.)
dialog: I have a surprise for you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: (Reading the screen)
dialog: Accept webcam request
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes.

text: to unbutton her shirt slowly.
text: DANIEL LEANS BACK IN HIS CHAIR
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: Ahhh...
text: Melissa opens the shirt completely. She looks into the camera
text: as if looking directly at Daniel.
text: She slowly undoes her bra and lets it open slightly. Her
text: perfect, perky breasts are exposed for a few seconds.
text: Daniel is typing rapidly.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)

speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You should tell your dad how you

speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: You think he'll actually understand?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No, but at least it's a good start.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: The beginning of your script Harmony
dialog: is based off you huh?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: How did you know that?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I could just tell.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: DANIEL WESTON
dialog: So what happened at school?
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: DANIEL WESTON
dialog: If you could do anything right now,
dialog: what would it be?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I don't know, something with you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'd want to feel a cool breeze on a
text: high mountain lake sitting near a
text: bonfire, looking at the stars...
dialog: that's where I'd like to be.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Oho... that sounds nice... but I

speaker_heading: DANIEL

text: CASEY exits his room with happy expression and two beer
text: bottles in hand.
text: He walks a few doors down to Daniel's room.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - CASEY
text: LOUDLY KNOCKS on the door. He takes a large swig from one
text: of the beers he's holding. No answer. He knocks again.
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY
text: Daniel, looking very tired, stumbles to the door and opens
text: it. He sees Casey standing there grinning.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Just get up?
speaker_heading: DANIEL WESTON
dialog: (very sleepy)
dialog: Um.. Yeah.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (Handing Daniel a
dialog: beer)
dialog: Time for some pre-party beer action.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh yeah?
text: Daniel takes the beer and sluggishly takes a drink.
text: Casey takes a seat on Daniel's bed and looks around. He
text: picks up a shirt lying somewhere.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (throwing the shirt
dialog: at Daniel)
dialog: It's Friday night, it's going to be

dialog: (Jokingly)

scene_heading: INT. CASEY'S ROOM - DAY
text: Daniel and Casey both have beers in their hands and are

text: They are both in a very happy mood.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I can't believe you got me to drink
dialog: Steel Piss Tap
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Aw, it's good for you dude.
text: Daniel and Casey clink their beers as they share a cheer.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: It puts the lead in your pencil.
text: Daniel laughs and takes another swig.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: So how's that Melissa thing going?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don't know... well, Melissa's great,
dialog: beautiful, sweet, nice...
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Then what's the problem?
text: Daniel picks up a chess piece and moves it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: She's sixteen... check!
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (negative sigh)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Don't tell me you haven't thought
dialog: about being with a younger chick
dialog: dude. I know you. Casey, Casey
text: Smith on the prowl.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: That's something, ah... sixteen?
dialog: That's pretty young. That's something
dialog: that, you know, you think about and
dialog: you talk about, but you don't actually
dialog: do. Like banging your step mom.
text: Casey moves a chess piece confidently.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You banged your step mom?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: Nevermind, dude.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh man.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Dude, I was joking. Snarfer.
text: Daniel moves a piece and puts CASEY'S king in check.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Check.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Ahhhhhh, shit.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Sarah's going to be back in town
dialog: this month.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Yeah? You two still talk?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah, we managed to stay friends.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Are you still in love with her?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That's good at least.
text: Daniel moves another piece and puts CASEY in check again.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Check.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Damn... Shit ... I'm never playing
dialog: this game again. Why do I suck so
dialog: bad? It's the beer.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Is this party going to be any good?
dialog: What's the back up plan? Walking up
text: and down University Street, smashed,
dialog: causing havoc?.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Actually, that is the backup plan.
scene_heading: INT. RANDOM PARTY - NIGHT
text: Daniel sits on a couch, looking dazed and drunk. His eyes
text: move slowly back and forth, and he looks totally out of it.
text: He's holding a cell phone to his ear and wears and expectant
dialog: expression.
scene_heading: INT. MELISSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Melissa is sleeping. RING RING. She wakes up, dazed, fumbling
text: for her cell phone. She looks at the caller ID. She answers
text: in a SLEEPY VOICE.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (Slurring)
dialog: Hey Melissaaa... this is Daniel...
dialog: I'm bleeding inside... I wanted to
dialog: tell you... I need you.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Concerned)
dialog: Are you okay? Where are you at?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Melissa... I love you. I want to
dialog: hold you... and fuck you... and tell
dialog: you I love you...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Annoyed)
dialog: You're drunk. You need to get home
dialog: and go to sleep.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No I wanted to tell you... and I
dialog: want to be with you... you're perfect.
dialog: I want to see you...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (A little desperately)
dialog: Please, just try and get home safe.
dialog: We can talk tomorrow when you're
dialog: sober.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm serious... I love you, I want to
dialog: be with you... will you marry me?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Now angry)
dialog: Daniel, its 4:30 am. Call me when
dialog: you're sober.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm serious... will you marry me?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Angry and annoyed)
dialog: Good bye, Daniel.

text: Melissa hangs up and curls in a ball with her hands over her
dialog: face.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - MORNING
text: Daniel is still wearing his clothes. He rolls back and forth.
text: He opens his eyes, looking dazed and extremely hung over.
text: There is vomit on his chin, cheeks, and the front of his
text: shirt. He looks nauseous.
text: Daniel slowly stands up. He looks as if he could collapse
text: at any minute. He walks out of his room.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:

speaker_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT #1

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah. I drank way too much last
dialog: night.
text: COLLEGE STUDENT #2 enters. She gives Daniel a funny look.
scene_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT #2

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Daniel is lying on his bed again.

scene_heading: EXT. COMMONS - SIDEWALK - DAY
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hi... this is Daniel. How are you?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I'm OK.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm sorry about last night. I was
dialog: really drunk. I spent all day lying
text: in bed dry heaving.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Why did you do that to yourself? Do
dialog: you even remember all the stuff you
dialog: told me on the phone last night?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Not really. I was feeling lonely.
dialog: I'm sorry for waking you up last
text: night to talk to a drunken idiot.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: It's not OK, but I'm fine.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I still want to meet you though.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DANIEL AND GIRL WALKING - DAY
text: Girl is SARAH. Daniel and Sarah are walking together, but
dialog: not too close.
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
dialog: It's been two weeks since my drunken
dialog: exuberance. Sarah my ex finance is
text: back to walk over me yet again. When
dialog: asked about my love life I mentioned
dialog: Melissa. Of course I changed her
dialog: age to 19. I feel like the proverbial
dialog: loner, mentioning a girl I've never
dialog: met.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - DANIEL AND SARAH - DAY
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why are you still here? You graduated
dialog: two years ago. Shouldn't you be
dialog: moving on?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don't know. I guess I'm just
dialog: waiting for some inspiration. To
dialog: come out and be like... Here I am
dialog: world Daniel Weston. I'm waiting to
dialog: write my masterpiece.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Don't wait too long. So how was
dialog: your weekend? Did you go out?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah and I got hit on by some older
text: chicks.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Is that good?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's not good or bad, they just drank
dialog: a little too much and couldn't help
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Ahh. Okay.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Probably thought that if I got drunk
dialog: enough I'd take them home... kinda
dialog: sad actually.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm sure. So nothing came of that?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Um...not exactly my type. Yeah, there
dialog: were no girls for me; no one that
dialog: was interesting at least.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Interesting enough to what?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: To date. I want to be blown away,
dialog: but I haven't met a girl yet who's
dialog: done that to me. Maybe it's not
dialog: even possible. I mean, I've loved
dialog: girls, but I haven't been blown away
dialog: by them.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Um... thanks.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I didn't mean it like that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yes you did. But that's okay. You
dialog: can care about someone, even love
dialog: them, and not be 'in' love with them
dialog: or 'blown away.'
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I could be in love with Melissa like
dialog: that, but I'd have to see her in
dialog: person to really know. Ah fuck it...
dialog: I'll just stick to working a lot,
dialog: and going out by myself.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Right. Anyway, it would be hard to
dialog: know what your feelings really are
text: without spending time in the flesh.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (teasingly)
dialog: It's all about the flesh
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Mmmm. Apparently it's not, because
dialog: as you say, you have no problem with
dialog: that area.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I was kidding. Sex is easy, but sex
dialog: with passion and meaning... yeah...
dialog: that's the good stuff. Anyway... at
dialog: least part of you still has to find
text: some strange, unexplainable attraction
dialog: to the directionless writer still
dialog: searching for that special thought.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Maybe, but only a little part.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (awkward silence)
dialog: I know. So how are you and your
dialog: husband doing?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: We're fine.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You look really happy together.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thanks, we are. Stop trying to change
dialog: the subject. Why haven't you met
dialog: Melissa yet?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: She says she's not ready to meet me
text: yet and that she feels pressured.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's odd... don't you guys talk
dialog: all the time?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah, but remember she's only si-,
dialog: ah, 19, and I kinda called her drunk
dialog: awhile ago and said some things.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What things?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's embarrassing. I asked her to
dialog: marry me, told her I loved her, and,
dialog: well, you know...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No wonder she doesn't want to meet
dialog: you right away.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Maybe I should stop talking to her,
dialog: tell her I don't want to do the wrong
dialog: thing and mess her life up.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Right. Then you'll start drinking
dialog: and call her and all this shit will
dialog: come out and you won't even remember
dialog: what you said to her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don't do that anymore.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah. Famous last words, Daniel.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I promised I'd stop...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Promised who? You even used to call
dialog: me drunk.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You used call me and beg me to live
dialog: with you, kiss you..., all that stuff.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Ahhh, you never told me all that
dialog: before. I'm sorry about that...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: If I had a boyfriend who was doing
dialog: that. You have a habit of doing this
dialog: and not just in isolated incidents.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So what would you recommend?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No more whacked out phone calls,
dialog: obviously. And honestly, I would
dialog: want to meet her in person, to try
dialog: and see if your feelings are real
dialog: and if she feels the same. You'll
dialog: gain a much clearer and accurate
dialog: idea of the situation and the type
dialog: of relationship that may exist between
dialog: the two of you, in the real world,
dialog: not virtual land. Now, there is a
dialog: huge risk in that, because what if
dialog: they are real and she still doesn't
dialog: feel the same for you? It will hurt
dialog: like a bitch, but at least you'll
dialog: know, and you can stop putting
dialog: yourself out there. Even though
dialog: that's a worst case scenario, there
dialog: is a positive side to it, because
dialog: you will definitely get closure either
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well she doesn't want to meet me
dialog: yet. She's all fucked up.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I think she does; she's just nervous.
dialog: Just explain it to her the way I've
dialog: explained it to you. If she really
dialog: cares about you as a true friend,
dialog: and not some trophy who is infatuated
dialog: with her, then she'll want to do
dialog: whatever she can to help salvage the
dialog: friendship while still respecting
dialog: your honest feelings for her.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Okay, I guess I'll do what I
dialog: originally wanted and take her out.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Okay, let's get your terminology
dialog: right first. You won't be "taking
dialog: her out" you'll be "meeting" her.
dialog: It's the difference between sounding
dialog: sleazy and sounding decent. Those
dialog: are the little things that freak
dialog: girls out.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: All right, we'll see what happens.
dialog: Thank you, though, I appreciate you
dialog: your advice on this.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Daniel and Sarah are getting ready ready to leave.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: My husband's waiting for me, but
dialog: it's been fun catching up with you,
dialog: and I'm sure we'll see each other
dialog: around.
dialog: (teasingly)
dialog: Since you're here.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: Thank you for that.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: No problem.
text: Daniel sets some money on the table.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: There it is. Anyways, it's been fun
dialog: hanging out with you.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You too.
text: They hug.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Have a good night
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, you too, good bye.

scene_heading: INT. COMMONS - DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Too smooth.
text: He changes to a wife beater.
speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Too bland.

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Too young.

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm Daniel Weston. How you doin.'

speaker_heading: DANIEL

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Cool. Did you have a good day at
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: It was good; I only had three classes,
dialog: so...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's so nice to finally see you.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (smiling shyly)
dialog: You too.
text: Daniel tries to cover up an awkward silence.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's a nice day.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (smiling and nodding)
dialog: Yeah it is.
text: More silence, less awkward this time. Daniel looks at Melissa
text: and they giggle a little.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Do you want to take a walk?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Sure.
text: They start to walk.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Daniel and Melissa running up a hill towards a picnic table.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Daniel and Melissa sitting on a picnic table. They are sitting
dialog: very close.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: So what do you want to do?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I don't know. What do you normally
dialog: do on a first date?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (teasingly)
dialog: I thought this wasn't supposed to be
dialog: a date.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: That was before...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well... I want to do something
dialog: special. Something you've never done
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Well name something and I'll tell
dialog: you if I've done it or not.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Skydiving. You ever been skydiving?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Skydiving?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah, jump out of a plane, have some
dialog: fun.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Yes, I know, but why would I want to
dialog: jump out of a plane?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It would be fun. I'm serious, we
dialog: should go skydiving.
text: Melissa shakes her head, amused.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: The only thing is that I heard the
dialog: first time you jump you have to go
text: strapped to someone's crotch.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (shaking her head
dialog: vehemently)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I'm not doing it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Wha... why?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Hello, jumping out of a plane however
dialog: far up that is, and being strapped
dialog: to someone, and maybe having my
dialog: parachute not come out...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (flirtatiously)
dialog: You can go strapped to me if you
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Have you ever skydived before?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Of course, I do it all the time.
text: Melissa is looking at him suspiciously. She suspects he's
text: just teasing her.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Are you just kidding?
text: Daniel is laughing again.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Anyways, um, actually the reason you
dialog: have to go strapped to someone is
dialog: because 1 out of 100 people have
text: faulty parachutes.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Exactly!
text: Daniel nudges her a little, smiling.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (teasingly)
dialog: Just kidding. You're scared.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I am!
text: Daniel leans a little closer, nudging her with his shoulder.
text: It's obvious she likes the attention, but still feels a little
text: nervous around him.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Maybe we should go see a scary
dialog: movie...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I told you how I feel about scary
dialog: movies.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yet you watch them by yourself in
dialog: the dark when you're bored?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (smiling sheepishly
dialog: and giggling)
dialog: Yeah, I like them but they scare the
dialog: hell out of me; I'm a freak.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: But you like it
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Teasing voice)
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Let's see...
text: Daniel moves closer to Melissa and looks straight in her
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What are you looking at?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Your eyes...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, they're beautiful, but they're
text: also dilating.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That you like what you're looking
dialog: at.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Is that really what it means?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Actually, yeah. In magazines they
text: dim the lights before taking the
text: shots so the models look excited and
text: like they enjoy staring at the
dialog: intended audience... so what do you
dialog: want to do?
text: Again, he leans into her a little, trying to be seductive.
dialog: She's shy.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Ah, lets go see a movie.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Zombie killers four.
text: Melissa gives him a "come on" look.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I'm just kidding..
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: Well, nothing can be as bad as Death
dialog: Stalkers 3.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Zombie Killers 4. But the zombie
dialog: genre's been coming back. There have
dialog: been like four new zombie movies;
dialog: there's even a comedy, Shane of the
dialog: Dead.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I saw that one.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Really? You saw Shane of the Dead?
text: Daniel is laughing, surprised.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I did; it was funny.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (agreeing))
dialog: It was hilarious.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I was still freaked out though.
dialog: Please don't laugh at me. Maybe
dialog: I'll see it, but you have to promise
dialog: to stay with me for awhile afterwards.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Cause I get scared. I know it's
dialog: stupid, but I can't help it. It's
dialog: so bad. I get scared by anything.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh, zombie killers isn't really going
dialog: to be that scary.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I got freaked out by the Jaberwokki
dialog: from Alice in Wonderland.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh my god... that is bad.
text: He smiles and takes her hand.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Come on, let's go on a walk.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Where do you want to go?
text: He points in a random direction. They appear more relaxed
dialog: around each other.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, first let's go this way.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (not really paying
dialog: attention)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Then when we're done going that way,
dialog: let's go over there. Then lets go
dialog: talk to some runners.
text: He laughs and Melissa shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What?
text: She realizes he's teasing and laughs with him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - MELISSA'S CAR - DAY
text: Daniel is standing next to Melissa. There is a slight
text: awkwardness and they are both staring at each other. It is
text: quiet for a few seconds. They hug.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I had a really good time.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah, I'm so glad I finally got to
dialog: meet you. This is great. When can
dialog: I see you again?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Really?
text: Melissa smiles sweetly and seductively at him and then slowly
text: turns and starts to walk away. Daniel reaches for her before
text: she goes a couple steps.
text: He pulls her to him and puts his arms around her and gives
text: her a hug. They kiss on the lips. She's shy and a little
text: awkward. More silence, but this time filled with sexual
text: tension as opposed to awkwardness.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Good bye Melissa.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (Smiling back)
dialog: Bye.
text: MELISSA gets in her car and drives away.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. COMMONS - COMMON AREAS - COUCH
text: Daniel is hanging out with CASEY again. They are both
dialog: drinking beer.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Hey I'm going to try and get some
dialog: 'shrooms this weekend. Do you want
dialog: to trip with me.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don't think so. I've never done
dialog: that before.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Have you tried any psychedelics
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That's like dying and having never
dialog: had sex.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don't know about that, I've seen
dialog: them do some bad things to my friends.
dialog: Nightmares, flashbacks, etc.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Oh that only happens if you way over
dialog: do it. It's not something you're
dialog: suppose to do all the time, just
dialog: every once in a great while.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah, but what's the point?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: It gives you a new perspective and
dialog: takes you completely out of your
dialog: element. It's a little hard too
dialog: explain to someone who has never
dialog: experienced it before.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Doesn't it make you stupid?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Do I seem stupid to you? Wait...
dialog: don't answer that. Anyway, it changes
dialog: you, but for the better. It improves
dialog: your creativity. It could give you
dialog: that inspiration you're always looking
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah, but I don't think it's worth
dialog: the bad things It can do.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Well I believe in the 50 times rule.
dialog: After 50 times you have permanent
dialog: psychosis, cause there is only so
dialog: much your mind can take before it
text: completely detaches from reality.
dialog: Well, heave you've ever read or heard
dialog: about the LSD experiments the
dialog: government did? They experimented
dialog: on some their top scientists without
dialog: their knowledge. They were dosed
text: with an insanely high amount and
dialog: tripped for like a week. Afterwards
dialog: they returned to their normal jobs
dialog: and continued working for the
dialog: government, except for one guy, who
dialog: went completely insane and then tried
dialog: to sue the government for causing
dialog: his mental illness. He tried to
dialog: kill everyone that turned completely
dialog: homicidal. My mother works as a
dialog: nurse at Precious Heart Hospital and
text: the third floor is completely devoted
dialog: to mental patients that can't come
dialog: back into society and most of them
dialog: are former drug addicts. People
dialog: that abuse meth really bad can go
dialog: into a homicidal psychosis
dialog: permanently, where they are always
dialog: trying to kill random people and
dialog: have delusions of persecution.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Crazy, you definitely don't make it
dialog: sound very appealing.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Well that's only in the extremes. A
dialog: little bit completely changes you,
dialog: but for the better. You should try
dialog: it sometime.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No thanks. I've talked to too many
dialog: hippy fucks who try to tell me
dialog: everything they've learned from
text: tripping. It usually consists of
dialog: seeing how it's all energy that comes
text: up from the ground and flows through
dialog: everything, cause everything is
dialog: connected and that they've learned
dialog: so much, but can't describe it. I'm
dialog: like OK, you've learned nonsense...
dialog: great.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: How was your date with Melissa?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It was great actually. She's a really
dialog: cool girl.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Have you hit it yet?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No... and I don't want to right away.
dialog: I really like this girl.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Oh come on, Mr. Insomniac. Why would
dialog: you want to wait? Don't you get
dialog: tired of jacking off to internet
dialog: porn?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Haha...
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: The Donkey show is a lot less
dialog: interesting the 18th time.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: You're a fucking pervert.
text: Casey begins making humping noises and moving his hips back
text: and forth. He continues and gets really into it.
speaker_heading: A COLLEGE GIRL
text: enters the common area and stares at Casey. He doesn't notice
text: her at first. Then he stops and looks, embarrassed. He tries
dialog: to play it cool.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Hi. What are you up to?
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - DAY
text: Daniel sits on his bed, writing rapidly.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - NOTEBOOK
speaker_heading: DANIEL (V.O.)
text: Slowly running my hand over her face,
text: the tips pressing ever so softly
text: against her skin, from her lips, to
text: her neck, to her chest... over her
text: belly and down to her...
dialog: (sigh)
text: Gazing into her eyes, enveloped in
text: utter stillness, thrust against her
text: skin, stillness...kisses, lips parted
text: slightly as my tongue caresses the
text: soft warmth of her tender neck. The
text: small quivers of skin, eruptions
text: spilling gently against my fingers
text: as I run them across her naked back,
text: hands exploring the intricacies of
dialog: her soul. Long kisses... hot, as I
text: press my lower lip against her skin,
text: moving slowly, building into fast,
text: deep kisses that touch every inch of
text: her body. Moaning, clenched in my
text: arms... hot... sweaty... hard, then
text: soft... the shock and vibration of
text: her body as I stroke her to
text: distraction, continuing the rhythm,
text: with every thrust slowly increasing,
text: harder... faster... eyes locked...
text: building... skin inflamed... hot,
dialog: scorching, no release... then...
dialog: ahhhhhhhh, ecstasy, sweet, hot and
dialog: intense. When you're lying in post-
dialog: coital sweat, every fiber of your
text: body screaming with exquisite
dialog: sensitivity , drained, the muscles
text: relaxed, poured onto the bed as the
text: breath steadies, lying next to
dialog: perfection... then, my friend, you've
dialog: found heaven.
text: Daniel smiles. He looks down at his writing again.
speaker_heading: DANIEL'S POV
text: The scrawled, jumbled writing on the page.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (Softly, smiling to
dialog: himself)
dialog: Well it's quite obvious I'm a horny
dialog: bastard.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD SOMEWHERE - DANIEL AND MELISSA ARE PLAYING
text: Daniel and MELISSA are running around having fun and being
dialog: goofy.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Have you seen Dirty Dancing?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Who hasn't? That's the best movie
dialog: ever.
text: They continue to play around. They are laughing and having
text: fun. Melissa runs and jumps on Daniel he isn't ready and
text: almost falls over and they are unsuccessful. They both laugh.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Wait, you have to warn me first OK?
dialog: Let's try it slowly this time.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Okay. Don't drop me.
text: They try again. She doesn't balance right and again they
text: fall over, laughing.
text: They go over to a tree. Daniel helps Melissa climb; she has
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Ok, put your foot here. Now pull.
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I can't...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes you can. I've got you. Push.
dialog: Higher. Come on. I've got you. Use
text: some upper body strength.
text: Melissa is laughing. He boosts her up and steps back, leaving
text: her halfway up the tree. Her legs are dangling. They are
text: both laughing.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I need to get up more. Daniel!
dialog: Daniel!
text: She continues to dangle. Daniel laughs, watching, and smacks
text: her bottom. They laugh again. It's obvious they're having
dialog: fun.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. DANIEL'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Daniel and Melissa are hanging out. They are sitting on
text: Daniel's bed. Melissa is holding the script for Harmony.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Harmony is really good; I like the
dialog: how the demon whose haunting him is
dialog: really himself.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That was supposed to be the most
dialog: powerful part. The realization that
dialog: all his problems, all his hate, and
dialog: everything that was combined and
dialog: traced out towards the world is really
dialog: a reflection of his own cruelty rather
dialog: than the cruelty of the world. The
dialog: metaphor of the demon being a young
dialog: version of himself.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I love the symbolism; it's great.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You should help me write something.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Help you how?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: UM... help me with some ideas.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I read...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (teasingly)
dialog: Give me some crazy ideas. I know
dialog: you're a literature nut.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I read books. I like looking at them
dialog: and analyzing them, but as for
dialog: writing, that's all you. I can help
dialog: you edit, help you submit it to
dialog: publishers, but that's about it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That would be cool... how do you
dialog: know so much about publishing and
dialog: editing and stuff?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: My parents have a small publishing
dialog: business. Its actually pretty
dialog: successful, so I've been immersed in
dialog: the publishing world all my life.
dialog: It's probably why I love books, though
dialog: I should be sick of them at this
dialog: point.
text: Daniel is surprised.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Crazy. How come you never mentioned
dialog: that before?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I don't know. I didn't really think
dialog: about it, I guess.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Hmm. I need to write something
dialog: bigger; better than Harmony.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Why bigger? Why not start off little?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I want something... I'm a
dialog: perfectionist. I hate reading my own
dialog: work.
text: He points to Harmony.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: When I read something like that, I
dialog: think 'ah, this is horrible' which
dialog: is normal, I guess. I know its okay,
dialog: but its not what I want.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: So, another random question. What's
dialog: the first thing you look at in someone
dialog: when you're trying to figure out
dialog: what's going on in their head? What's
dialog: going on in their mind?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Where did that come from?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I don't know. Nowhere, I guess.
dialog: Just thoughts.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Just thoughts, huh? There are a lot
dialog: of things I look at. How they're
dialog: body moves, how they move their
text: hands... but mostly their eyes. Their
dialog: eyes show if they're in pain happy,
dialog: or sad; if they're anxious or they
dialog: want something. Get an in depth look
dialog: at their personality.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: You can tell all that from someone's
dialog: eyes?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yes, and a lot more.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What do you see in my eyes?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I see beauty, and innocence, and a
dialog: die-hard romantic... but you are
dialog: kind of hard to read.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You just are. I don't make the rules.
dialog: Why are you laughing?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I don't know... it's hard when
dialog: someone's talking about you and what
dialog: you're like. And I am a hopeless
dialog: romantic... you got that right.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: And much more... what's your biggest
dialog: fear Melissa?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: That I'll never fall in love
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I guarantee that won't happen...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: How do you know? I haven't fallen
dialog: in love yet.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well for one thing, hormones and
dialog: nature will make you fall in love
dialog: sometime no matter what...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I hate that you think like that.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: If you put two people on an island
dialog: with no one else they'll fall in
dialog: love. Nature has a part in love too
dialog: you know. But it's not a bad thing..
dialog: nature is beautiful, love is
dialog: beautiful. I just understand how it
dialog: works. Nature is a catalyst... for
dialog: your feelings... it doesn't create
dialog: your feelings... but it can help you
dialog: realize them. Does that makes sense?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Kinda, but I don't know... I believe
dialog: in soul mates... That there is one
dialog: person you are destined to be with
text: Daniel smiles.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What? I really do! I know it's silly,
dialog: but I can't help it.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It's not silly, it's cute. You're
dialog: cute.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
text: (smiles sweetly up at
dialog: him)
dialog: So what's your biggest fear?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Being alone... like ending up alone.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I thought you said nature would make
dialog: sure you fell in love.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah, but being in love doesn't mean
dialog: you won't be alone... the only thing
dialog: that really exists is the moment
dialog: right now... that's my biggest fear...
text: being trapped in fleeting moments
dialog: where all I can think about is how
dialog: much I love someone and not being
dialog: able to express it... being forever
dialog: alone...no one to care about or share
dialog: myself with... I hate being alone.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I'm sure you'll never be alone for
dialog: any real length of time.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Because you're too nice a guy.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh god, please don't say that.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: You just called me a nice guy.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Girls don't like nice guys
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I do.
text: Melissa leans over and kisses Daniel softly on the cheek.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Have you ever been in love before?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Once.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Why didn't it work out?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: She was very career oriented, which
dialog: is cool, but I was still an undergrad
dialog: and she graduated and was going to
dialog: leave for grad school. I had to stay
dialog: and finish my degree. I don't do
dialog: long distance relationships, so it
dialog: was goodbye. I don't want someone
dialog: without ambition, but I do want
dialog: someone who will support me and will
dialog: make decisions in our best interest.
dialog: And at the time I didn't plan on
dialog: being suck in this same city.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Why are you still here?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Still waiting for my inspiration. I
dialog: am going to write something incredible
dialog: someday.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What happened to her?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: She moved, met someone else, and got
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Wow... that was quick.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Well, she's a little older than me,
dialog: so it was probably her "time."
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What's a little older?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Two years.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: What's name?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Sarah.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Do you still love her?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'll always love her. I think if you
dialog: really love someone that your feelings
dialog: will never go away.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Oh... I guess I sort of understand...
dialog: Daniel, do you care that I'm only
dialog: 16?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Of course not. I think it's hot.
dialog: What's sexier then a beautiful young
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Is that the only reason you like me?
dialog: I mean, why do you like me so much;
dialog: what makes me so different?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Oh, come on now... I love how you
dialog: look at me, how you talk, the
dialog: excitement in your eyes when we talk
dialog: about playing tag on moon... why
dialog: would you ask me that?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
text: (shyly, looking down)
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Melissa...
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Can I kiss you?
text: Melissa looks into Daniel's eyes. He slowly moves his finger
text: to the side of her face. He runs them down her neck and
text: slowly on to her chest.
text: Melissa closes her eyes, then opens them and looks excited,
text: but slightly nervous.
text: Daniel leans forward and kisses her. They pull apart,
text: smiling.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: I like you.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I like you too.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. COMMONS - COMMON AREA - DANIEL AND CASEY - DAY
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Hey, hold on a second, something's
dialog: different.
text: Casey moves a little closer to Daniel and looks at him.
text: Daniel smiles and has a funny grin.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: You're glowing.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Glowing? What?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: You got laid didn't you? You had sex
dialog: with Melissa?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: No. Well, not yet anyway.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Not yet, when are you planning it?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm not, I really like this girl.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What do you guys do together?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: We talk about everything and nothing
dialog: at the same time.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Uh huh... everything and nothing...
dialog: weirdo. Dude, I know what you should
dialog: write about!
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: How she breathes, how she feels,
dialog: what that does to you. I think it
dialog: would be interesting.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: That's a great idea!

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I feel energized, full of life, ready

dialog: or even better, go hiking? Wait.
dialog: What about a road trip? San Francisco
dialog: would be fun.
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Um, no, hello. I have to go to school
dialog: and then back home so my parents
dialog: won't suspect anything.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: What would happen if your parents
dialog: found out about me?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: Well... that's not going to happen.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: But what would happen if they did?
speaker_heading: MELISSA
dialog: They would freak and probably try to

dialog: likely to be okay with it, but my
dialog: dad would absolutely freak.

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (in a more serious,
dialog: calming voice)
dialog: Calm down Daniel. Make sure its for

dialog: test.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Why do you keep saying that?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: 'Cause girls are wrong about that

dialog: that you're free. You want to feel
dialog: every tiny fiber of your limited
dialog: existence... to dwell in an emotional
dialog: sandstorm, to be so flushed with the
dialog: human experience that if even if
dialog: death came in the preceding seconds,
dialog: you would smile, for you knew you
