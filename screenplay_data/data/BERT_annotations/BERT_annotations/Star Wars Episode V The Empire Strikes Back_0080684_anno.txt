scene_heading: EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH
text: A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots
text: from its underside.
text: One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
text: covered surface. An explosion marks the point of
dialog: impact.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY
text: A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind. A
text: strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the
text: smoke-shrouded crater. The ominous mechanical probe floats across the
text: snow plain and disappears into the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY
text: A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. The bundled
text: rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun. Curving
text: plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged
dialog: beast.
text: The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop. Pulling
text: off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the
text: sky. He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and
text: through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.
text: The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink
text: transmitter. His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han,
dialog: old buddy, do you read me?
text: After a little static a familiar voice is heard.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (over comlink)
dialog: Loud and clear, kid. What's up?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: Well, I finished my circle. I
dialog: don't pick up any life readings.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (over comlink)
dialog: There isn't enough life on this
text: ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
dialog: The sensors are placed, I'm going
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: Right. I'll see you shortly.
dialog: There's a meteorite that hit the
dialog: ground near here. I want to check
dialog: it out. It won't take long.
text: Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.
text: He pats the beast on the head to calm it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey, steady girl. What's the
dialog: matter? You smell something?
text: Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when
text: suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind. He hears a
text: monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over
text: him. It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Aaargh!
text: Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white
text: claw. He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified
text: screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck
dialog: being broken.
text: The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away
text: across the frozen plain.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous
dialog: ice cave.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK
text: Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing
text: their new base. The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls
text: off his goggles.
text: He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which
text: is parked among several fighters. Mechanics, R2 units, and various
text: other droids hurry about. Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his
text: Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter. Chewie
text: stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated
text: greeting to his boss.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Chewie!
text: The Wookiee grumbles a reply.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: All right, don't lose your temper.
dialog: I'll come right back and give you
text: a hand.
text: Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han
dialog: leaves.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER
text: A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick
text: ice. The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers,
text: troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and
text: monitoring radar signals.
text: General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN
dialog: Solo?
speaker_heading: HAN
text: No sign of life out there, General.
dialog: The sensors are in place. You'll
dialog: know if anything comes around.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN
dialog: Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
speaker_heading: HAN
text: No. He's checking out a meteorite
text: that hit near him.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN
dialog: (indicates radar
dialog: screen)
dialog: With all the meteor activity in this
dialog: system, it's going to be difficult
dialog: to spot approaching ships.
text: Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: General, I've got to leave. I
dialog: can't stay anymore.
text: Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short
text: white combat jacket and pants. Her hair is braided across her head in
text: a Nordic fashion. She overhears their conversation and seems somewhat
text: distressed.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Well, there's a price on my head.
dialog: If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,
dialog: I'm a dead man.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN
dialog: A death mark's not an easy thing
dialog: to live with. You're a good
dialog: fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Thank you, General.
text: He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (with feeling)
dialog: Well, Your Highness, I guess this
dialog: is it.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: That's right.
text: Leia is angry. Han sees she has no warmth to offer him. He shakes his
text: head and adopts a sarcastic tone.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (cooly)
dialog: Well, don't get all mushy on me.
dialog: So long, Princess.
text: Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.
text: Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Han!
text: Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yes, Your Highnessness?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I thought you decided to stay.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Well, the bounty hunter we ran
dialog: into on Ord Mantell changed my
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Han, we need you!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: We?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Oh, what about you need?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (mystified)
dialog: I need? I don't know what you're
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (shakes his head,
dialog: fed up)
dialog: You probably don't.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: And what precisely am I supposed
dialog: to know?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Come on! You want me to stay
dialog: because of the way you feel about
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Yes. You're a great help to us.
dialog: You're a natural leader...
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: No! That's not it. Come on.
dialog: Aahhh - uh huh! Come on.
text: Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: You're imagining things.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Am I? Then why are you following
dialog: me? Afraid I was going to leave
dialog: without giving you a goodbye kiss?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I can arrange that. You could use
dialog: a good kiss!
text: Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR
text: A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-
text: Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an
text: ice wall toward the main hangar.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Don't try to blame me. I didn't
dialog: ask you to turn on the thermal
dialog: heater. I merely commented that it
dialog: was freezing in the princess'
dialog: chamber. But it's supposed to be
dialog: freezing. How are we going to dry
dialog: out all her clothes? I really don't
dialog: know.
text: Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, switch off.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK
text: The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter. Han and Chewie are
text: struggling with their central lifters.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (to Chewie)
dialog: Why do you take this apart now?
dialog: I'm trying to get us out of here
dialog: and you pull both of these.
text: Chewie grumbles in irritation.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Excuse me, sir.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (to Chewie)
dialog: Put them back together right now.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Might I have a word with you,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
dialog: She's been trying to get you on
dialog: the communicator.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I turned it off. I don't want to
dialog: talk to her.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering
dialog: about Master Luke. He hasn't come
dialog: back yet. She doesn't know where he
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I don't know where he is.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Nobody knows where he is.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: What do you mean, "nobody knows"?
text: Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as
text: night slowly begins to fall on the planet.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Well, uh, you see...
text: Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu...
text: Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: DECK OFFICER
dialog: Yes, sir?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Do you know where Commander
dialog: Skywalker is?
speaker_heading: DECK OFFICER
dialog: I haven't seen him. It's possible
text: he came in through the south entrance.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: It's possible? Why don't you go
dialog: find out? It's getting dark out there.
speaker_heading: DECK OFFICER
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire
dialog: what's going on?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Impossible man. Come along, Artoo,
dialog: let's find Princess Leia. Between
dialog: ourselves, I think Master Luke is
text: in considerable danger.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL
text: The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the
dialog: tunnel.
speaker_heading: DECK OFFICER
dialog: Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't
text: come in through the south entrance.
dialog: He might have forgotten to check in.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
speaker_heading: DECK OFFICER
dialog: Not yet. We're having some trouble
dialog: adapting them to the cold.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Then we'll have to go out on
dialog: Tauntauns.
speaker_heading: DECK OFFICER
dialog: Sir, the temperature's dropping too
dialog: rapidly.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: That's right. And my friends out
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT OFFICER
dialog: I'll cover sector twelve. Have
dialog: com-control set screen alpha.
text: Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.
speaker_heading: DECK OFFICER
dialog: Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you
text: reach the first marker.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Then I'll see you in hell!
text: Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter
dialog: night.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK
text: The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of
text: a Hoth day. Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy
text: stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor. One
text: side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood. He opens
text: his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the
text: gorge walls. Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and
text: futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.
text: Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position. As he hangs there,
text: he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about
text: three feet out of reach.
text: He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he
text: squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.
text: Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into
text: Luke's hand.
text: The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts
text: himself loose from the ice. He flops to the snow in a heap. The
text: startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking. Luke
text: scrambles to his feet. He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams
dialog: in pain.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK
text: Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight. Weak
text: and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK
text: A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile
text: vastness of snow and cold. As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up
text: large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE				 HANGAR - DUSK
text: Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly. Threepio moves
text: stiffly over to him.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: You must come along now, Artoo.
dialog: There's really nothing more we can
dialog: do. And my joints are freezing up.
text: Artoo beeps, long and low.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Don't say thing like that! Of
dialog: course we'll see Master Luke again.
dialog: He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Stupid little short-circuit. He'll
dialog: be quite all right.
text: Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully
text: keeps his vigil.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK
text: The wind is blowing quite strong now. Luke struggles to stay upright,
text: but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over. He struggles to get up,
text: but he can't. The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple
text: of feet and then collapses.
scene_heading: INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base,
text: waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes. She shivers in the cold
text: wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands. In the
text: background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.
text: A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with
dialog: the princess.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Sir, all the patrols are in.
dialog: There's still no contact from
dialog: Skywalker or Solo.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been
text: quite unable to pick up any signals,
dialog: although he does admit that his own
dialog: range is far too weak to abandon
dialog: all hope.
text: Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.
speaker_heading: DERLIN
dialog: Your Highness, there's nothing
dialog: more we can do tonight. The shield
dialog: doors must be closed.
text: He turns to the lieutenant.
speaker_heading: DERLIN
dialog: Close the doors.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: The lieutenant walks away. Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl,
text: somewhat like a coyote. At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex
text: series of efficient beeps.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Artoo says the chances of survival
dialog: are seven hundred seventy-five...
dialog: to one.
text: Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the
text: entrance of the ice cave. The loud booms echo throughout the huge
text: cavern. Chewie lets out another suffering howl.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Actually, Artoo has been known to
dialog: make mistakes... from time to time.
dialog: Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry
dialog: about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll
dialog: be all right. He's quite clever,
dialog: you know... for a human being.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK
text: Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious. Slowly he looks
text: up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow. It is
text: hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Luke... Luke.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Ben?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You will go to the Dagobah system.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Dagobah system?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: There you will learn from Yoda,
dialog: the Jedi Master who instructed me.
text: The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching
text: from the windswept horizon.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (groaning faintly)
dialog: Ben... Ben.
text: Luke drops into unconsciousness.
text: Han pulls up and leaps off his mount. He hurries to his snow-covered
text: friend, cradling him in his arms. Han's Tauntaun lets out a low,
text: pitiful bellow. But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him
text: urgently.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke.
dialog: Come on, give me a sign here.
text: Luke doesn't respond. Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping
text: Luke's unconscious face. As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a
text: rasping sound behind him. He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun
text: stagger and then fall over into the snow.
text: Han carries Luke to the moaning beast. Then, with a final groan, the
text: Tauntaun expires.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Not much time.
text: He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (moaning)
dialog: Ben... Ben...
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Hang on, kid.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Dagobah system...
text: Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe. He
text: quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's
text: inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (reeling from the
dialog: odor)
dialog: Whew...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Dagobah...
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: This may smell bad, kid...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (moaning)
dialog: Yoda...
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: ...but it will keep you warm...
dialog: til I get the shelter built.
dialog: (struggling to get
dialog: Luke inside the
dialog: carcass)
dialog: Ooh... I thought they smelled bad
dialog: on the outside!
text: The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move. Han
text: removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter
text: container. He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection
text: against a bitter Hoth night.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN
text: Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.
scene_heading: INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT
text: There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft. He
text: concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit. He hears a low beep
text: from one of his monitors.
speaker_heading: ZEV
dialog: (into transmitter)
dialog: Echo Base... I've got something! Not
dialog: much, but it could be a life form.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT
text: The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT
text: The pilot switches over to a new transmitter.
speaker_heading: ZEV
dialog: (into transmitter)
dialog: This is Rogue Two. this is Rogue
dialog: Two. Captain Solo, so you copy?
dialog: Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
dialog: This is Rogue Two.
text: There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (filtered over
dialog: Zev's receiver)
dialog: Good morning. Nice of you guys
dialog: to drop by.
speaker_heading: ZEV
dialog: (switching transmitters)
dialog: Echo Base... this is Rogue Two. I
dialog: found them. Repeat, I found them.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY
text: The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side.
text: A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift. Han spots
text: Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his
text: arms frantically at the tiny craft.
scene_heading: INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER
text: Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment. A switch
text: is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank
text: filled with a thick, gelatinous slime. He begins to thrash about,
text: raving in delirium.
scene_heading: INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM
text: Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling. His face shows
text: terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack. Threepio and Artoo enter the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Master Luke, sir, it's so good
dialog: to see you fully functional again.
text: Artoo beeps his good wishes.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
text: Artoo expresses his relief, also.
text: Han and Chewie make their entrance. The Wookiee growls a greeting.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: How are you feeling, kid? You
dialog: don't look so bad to me. In
dialog: fact, you look strong enough to
text: pull the ears off a Gundark.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Thanks to you.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: That's two you owe me, junior.
text: Han turns as Leia enters the room. He looks at her with a big,
text: devilish grin.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Well your Worship, looks like
dialog: you managed to keep me around for
text: a little while longer.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (haughtily)
dialog: I had nothing to do with it. General
dialog: Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for
dialog: any ships to leave the system until
dialog: we've activated the energy shield.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: That's a good story. I think you
dialog: just can't bear to let a gorgeous
dialog: guy like me out of your sight.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I don't know where you get your
dialog: delusions, laser brain.
text: Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner. Han, enjoying himself,
text: regards Chewie good-humoredly.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Laugh it up, fuzzball. But you
dialog: didn't see us alone in the south
dialog: passage.
text: Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: She expressed her true feelings
dialog: for me.
text: Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: My...! Why, you stuck up,... half-
dialog: witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
dialog: herder!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Who's scruffy-looking?
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: I must have hit pretty close to
dialog: the mark to get her all riled up
dialog: like that, huh, kid?
text: Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she
text: focuses on Luke.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Why, I guess you don't know
dialog: everything about women yet?
text: With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips. Then she turns
text: on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly
text: dumbstruck. With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head
text: and grins.
text: Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: (over loudspeaker)
dialog: Headquarters personnel, report to
dialog: command center.
text: The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry
text: out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Take it easy.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Excuse us, please.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER
text: Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen. He calls over to Leia
dialog: and Han.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN
dialog: Princess... we have a visitor.
text: The group hurries over to Rieekan.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN
dialog: We've picked up something outside
text: the base in zone twelve, moving
dialog: east.
speaker_heading: SENIOR CONTROLLER
dialog: It's metal.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Then it couldn't be one of those
dialog: creatures that attacked Luke.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: It could be a speeder, one of ours.
speaker_heading: SENIOR CONTROLLER
dialog: No. Wait - there's something very
text: weak coming through.
text: Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the
dialog: strange signal.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, I am fluent in six million
dialog: forms of communication. This signal
dialog: is not used by the Alliance. It
dialog: could be an Imperial code.
text: The transmission ends in static.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: It isn't friendly, whatever it is.
dialog: Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN
dialog: Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to
dialog: station three-eight.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY
text: The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-
text: eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base. It raises a large
text: antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing
dialog: signal.
text: The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has
text: popped his head over a snow bank. Instantly, the probe robot swings
text: around, its deadly ray ready to fire. But before it can get a shot
text: off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million
dialog: pieces.
text: Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the
text: smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER
text: Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (over comlink)
text: Afraid there's not much left.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (over comlink)
dialog: Droid of some kind. I didn't hit
dialog: it that hard. It must have had a
text: self-destruct.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (into comlink)
text: An Imperial probe droid.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (over comlink)
dialog: It's a good bet the Empire knows
dialog: we're here.
speaker_heading: RIEEKAN

speaker_heading: PIETT

speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: What is it, General?
speaker_heading: VEERS
dialog: My lord, the fleet has moves out

speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Thank you, Lord Vader.

text: Imperial troops have entered the
dialog: base.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Come on... that's it.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (to head controller)
dialog: Give the evacuation code signal.
dialog: And get to your transports!
text: Leia looks exhausted. Han grabs her and starts to lead her out.
text: As Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center, the code
text: signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls.
speaker_heading: HEAD CONTROLLER
text: K-one-zero... all troops disengage.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO

scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - SNOW TRENCH
text: Rebel troops retreat under the awesome Imperial onslaught.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Begin retreat!
speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER
dialog: Fall back!
text: Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD
text: Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel
dialog: headquarters.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - SNOW TRENCH
text: Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever
dialog: nearer.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD - ICE PLAIN
text: On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over
text: him. He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing
dialog: overhead.
text: Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at
text: the walker's underside. A thin cable follows the projectile from the
text: gun. The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.
text: Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his
text: belt buckle. Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling
text: underneath the walker.
text: The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen
text: snow. Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to
text: the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch. Hanging precariously, Luke
text: cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.
text: He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the
text: Imperial machine. Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto
text: the icy ground far below. He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg
text: passes by - and just misses him.
text: The giant walker stops in mid-step. A muffled explosion comes from
text: within - and then the walker's mechanical insides are spewed out every
text: conceivable opening. The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like
text: a locomotive on stilts.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD
text: Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base. The
text: smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right
text: of Veers's path.
scene_heading: INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT
text: Inside his walker, General Veers prepares to fire on the Rebel power
dialog: generators.
speaker_heading: VEERS
dialog: Distance to power generators?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: One-seven, decimal two-eight.
text: Veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main
dialog: generator.
speaker_heading: VEERS
dialog: Target. Maximum fire power.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD
text: The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the
text: relentless Imperial assault.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDORS
text: With Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the crumbling
text: ice corridors. Suddenly, there is an explosion. Han turns, grabs the
text: princess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks
dialog: their path.
text: He takes the comlink from his pocket.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: Transport, this is Solo. Better
dialog: take off - I can't get to you.
dialog: I'll get the princess out on the
dialog: Falcon.
text: Han and Leia turn and race down the corridor.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: But... but... but... where are
dialog: you going? Uh... come back!!
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER
text: Imperial troops have reached the base. As they push through the
text: blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR
text: Han and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the
text: Millennium Falcon is docked. Threepio still lags behind.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
text: The door to the hangar closes in his face.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: How typical.
text: Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Come on.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR
text: Chewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear.
text: The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a
text: few reassuring words. As he searches worriedly for his captain,
text: something at last catches his eye.
text: Chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward
text: the ship. The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl,
text: then runs up the ship's ramp. Han and Leia run up the ramp after him,
text: closely followed by Threepio.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're
dialog: going to be a permanent resident!
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Wait! Wait!
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR
text: Imperial troops run through the base corridors. Vader surveys the
text: place. A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but he calmly,
text: purposefully, continues around it.
scene_heading: INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGER - MILLENNIUM FALCON
text: A distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck. Ice cakes come
text: crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD
text: Han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as
text: Chewie watches a troublesome gauge. A worried Leia observes their
dialog: efforts.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (to Chewie)
dialog: How's this?
text: The Wookiee barks a negative reply.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Would it helped if I got out and
dialog: pushed?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: It might.
text: Threepio clanks into the hold.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,
dialog: might I suggest that you...
text: Han gives the gold robot a devastating look.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: It can wait.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: They move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches. Leia
text: watches him, impatient, disbelieving.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: This bucket of bolts is never going
dialog: to get us past that blockade.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: This baby's got a few surprises
text: left in her, sweetheart.
text: Han and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of
text: stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.
text: Quickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia into the
text: navigator's chair.
scene_heading: INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR
text: Stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon. Behind them
text: the giant hangar doors open slowly.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON
text: A laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the
dialog: Imperial troops.
text: The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by
text: the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Chewie rushes into the cockpit.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Come on! Come on! Switch over.
dialog: Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
text: A laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair.
text: Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and
text: the first stage of engine fire can be heard. Han flashes a big grin at
dialog: Leia.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Someday you're going to be wrong,
dialog: and I hope I'm there to see it.
text: Han looks at Chewie.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Punch it!
text: The roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice-
text: cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.
scene_heading: INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR
text: More stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader.
text: Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's engines, Vader looks
text: toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and
text: disappear outside the cave.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTH - ICE SLOPE - DAY
text: Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above
text: them, flying very close to the ground.
text: The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing
text: fighters, each going to his own ship. Luke waves farewell, then heads
text: toward his own fighter.
text: Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke
text: climbs aboard the spacecraft.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.
text: From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for
dialog: takeoff.
speaker_heading: WEDGE
dialog: Good luck, Luke. See you at
text: the rendezvous.
text: Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of
text: his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Don't worry, Artoo. We're going,
dialog: we're going.
text: The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - LUKE'S X-WING
text: Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet.
text: Soon it disappears into the stars.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT
text: Luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision. He flips several
text: switches. The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn.
text: The X-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction.
text: The monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a question from
dialog: the concerned Artoo.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
dialog: I'm just setting a new course.
text: Artoo beeps once again.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: We're not going to regroup with
dialog: the others.
text: Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "What?!"
text: Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: We're going to the Dagobah system.
text: Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments. He rides along
text: with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence.
text: Finally, Artoo chirps up.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: Yes, Artoo?
text: Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink, chuckling)
dialog: That's all right. I'd like to
dialog: keep it on manual control for a
dialog: while.
text: The little droid lets out a defeated whimper. Luke smiles, and
text: continues on his course.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON
text: The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one
text: huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.
text: As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized
dialog: objects.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Inside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl. Han checks as the
text: ship is buffeted by exploding flak. He appears to be doing six things
dialog: at once.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (harried)
dialog: I saw them! I saw them!
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Saw what?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Star Destroyers, two of them,
dialog: coming right at us.
text: Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (to Leia)
dialog: Shut him up or shut him down!
dialog: (to Chewie)
dialog: Check the deflector shield!
text: Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Oh, great. Well, we can still
dialog: outmaneuver them.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS
text: The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star
text: Destroyers. Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight
text: down, closely followed by four TIE fighters. The underside of the Star
text: Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star
text: Destroyers. Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
text: Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen
text: veering to the left.
speaker_heading: IMPERIAL OFFICER
dialog: Take evasive action!
text: Alarms sound all over the huge ship. The two other Star Destroyers get
text: closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes
text: brushing contact with it.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS
text: The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers,
text: still followed by four TIE fighters. Laser bolts spark the pitch-black
dialog: skies.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet. Chewie
text: barks at Han. Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive.
text: The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Prepare to make the jump to light-
dialog: speed.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: But, sir!
text: The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: They're getting closer!
speaker_heading: HAN
text: (with a gleam in his
dialog: eye)
dialog: Oh yeah? Watch this.
text: Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into
text: hyperspace, but just sit there.
text: Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of
dialog: concern.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Watch what?
text: Han tries again. Still nothing.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I think we're in trouble.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: If I may say so, sir, I noticed
dialog: earlier that the hyperdrive
dialog: motivator has been damaged. It's
dialog: impossible to go to light-speed!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: We're in trouble!
text: The explosions become heavier.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYER
text: The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four
text: Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Stars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD
text: Han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders
dialog: to Chewie.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Horizontal boosters...!
dialog: (Chewie barks)
dialog: Alluvial dampers...! Well that's
dialog: not it.
dialog: (Chewie barks)
dialog: Bring me the hydrospanners!
text: Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I don't know how we're going to
dialog: get out of this one.
text: Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch
text: radically. Chewie barks. The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Oww! Chewie!
text: More turbulence rocks the ship.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: That was no laser blast! Something
dialog: hit us.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (over comlink)
dialog: Han, get up here!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Come on, Chewie!
text: Han climbs out of the hold like a shot. Both he and Chewie run out of
text: the hold and toward the cockpit.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Asteroids!
text: Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie
text: gets into his chair. Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses
text: in front of the ship.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: What are you doing? You're not
dialog: actually going into an asteroid
dialog: field?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: They'd be crazy to follow us,
dialog: wouldn't they?
text: Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: You don't have to do this to
dialog: impress me.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, the possibility of successfully
text: navigating an asteroid field is
dialog: approximately three thousand, seven
dialog: hundred and twenty to one.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Never tell me the odds!
scene_heading: EXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCON
text: The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its
text: turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.
text: A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed.
text: Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small
text: explosions on its surface. Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in
text: every direction, some colliding and exploding. The tiny Millennium
text: Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain
text: of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the
dialog: asteroids.
text: One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and
text: explodes. The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of
text: smaller explosions.
text: Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly
text: banks around both of them. The three TIE fighters follow in hot
text: pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out
text: of control into deep space.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELT
text: The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the
text: Falcon. Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELT
text: The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid.
text: Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft
text: through the dangerous field.
text: Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid
text: drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.
text: Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially
text: close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch.
text: Threepio's hands cover his eyes. He manages a short peek at the
text: cockpit window. Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action.
text: Han gives her a quick look.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: You said you wanted to be around
dialog: when I made a mistake; well, this
dialog: could be it, sweetheart.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I take it back. We're going to
dialog: get pulverized if we stay out here
dialog: much longer.
text: The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I'm not going to argue with that.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Pulverized?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I'm going in closer to one of
dialog: those big ones.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Closer?
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Closer?!
text: Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT
text: The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized
text: asteroids. There is a continued display of explosions against the
text: starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.
text: The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.
text: The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while,
text: small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.
text: The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles
text: directly into their path. As the asteroid continues on its way, it
text: leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep
dialog: space.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in
text: hysterics.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, this is suicide!
text: Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful
text: Wookiee, pointing.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: There. That looks pretty good.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: What looks pretty good?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yeah. That'll do nicely.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: (to Leia)
dialog: Excuse me, ma'am, but where are
dialog: we going?
text: Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of
text: the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER
text: The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I hope you know what you're doing.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yeah, me too.
scene_heading: INT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER
text: The Falcon races down into the crater. The walls are barely visible as
text: the ship speed through the tunnellike opening. A small cave appears on
text: one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - LUKE'S X-WING
text: The tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah. Artoo,
text: riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with
dialog: some anxiety.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT
text: Luke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the
dialog: computer scope.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: Yes, that's it. Dagobah.
text: Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: No, I'm not going to change my
dialog: mind about this.
dialog: (getting a little nervous)
dialog: I'm not picking up any cities or
text: technology. Massive life-form
dialog: readings, though. There's something
dialog: alive down there...
text: Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe
dialog: for droids.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH - LUKE'S X-WING
text: The X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud-
dialog: covered planet.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT
text: Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet.
text: He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has
text: completely obscured his vision. An alarm buzzes in the background,
text: Artoo beeps and whistles frantically.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: I know, I know! All the scopes are
dialog: dead. I can't see a thing! Just
dialog: hang on, I'm going to start the
dialog: landing cycle...
text: The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's
text: electronic squeals. Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs
text: were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the
text: spacecraft stops. Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.
scene_heading: EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK
text: The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.
text: Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out
text: of his cubbyhole on the back. The young warrior surveys the fog, which
text: is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights. About all he can make
text: out are some giant, twisted trees nearby. Artoo whistles anxiously.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll
dialog: have a look around.
text: Artoo lets out a short beep. As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses
text: his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Artoo?
text: Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water
text: is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Artoo! Where are you?
text: A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is
text: heard. The periscope starts to move to shore. Relieved, Luke starts
text: running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Artoo! You be more careful.
text: The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.
text: Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and
text: turns to look for Artoo. The periscope still steadily moves toward
dialog: shore.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Artoo - that way!
text: Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving
text: toward the little droid. The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the
text: swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull. The
text: droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.
text: Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into
text: the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Artoo!
text: The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin
text: to appear. Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the
text: water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of
text: soft gray moss.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, no! Are you all right? Come
dialog: on. You're lucky you don't taste
dialog: very good. Anything broken?
text: Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from
text: his round metal body. Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: If you're saying coming here was
dialog: a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree
dialog: with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we
dialog: doing here? It's like... something
dialog: out of a dream, or, I don't know.
dialog: Maybe I'm just going crazy.
text: As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him,
text: Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.
scene_heading: EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER
text: Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.
text: After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising
text: sight before him.
text: Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far
text: side of the chamber. A black, insectlike droid attends him. Among the
text: various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts
text: from Vader's uncovered head. The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar
text: tissue covering it. The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet
text: onto Vader's head. When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face
dialog: Piett.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Yes, Admiral?
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Our ships have sighted the
dialog: Millennium Falcon, lord. But...
dialog: it has entered an asteroid field
dialog: and we cannot risk...
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Asteroids do not concern me,
dialog: Admiral. I want that ship and
dialog: not excuses.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Yes, lord.
scene_heading: EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON
text: The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave. It is so
text: dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems.
text: Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I'm going to shut down everything
dialog: but the emergency power systems.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
dialog: but... does that include shutting
dialog: me down, too?
text: Chewie barks "yes". But Han thinks otherwise.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: No, I need you to talk to the
dialog: Falcon, find out what's wrong with
text: the hyperdrive.
text: Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit
text: to go flying. Chewie howls.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, it's quite possible this
dialog: asteroid is not entirely stable.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're
dialog: here to tell us these things. Chewie,
text: take the professor in the back and
text: plug him into the hyperdrive.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh! Sometimes I just don't
dialog: understand human behavior. After
dialog: all, I'm only trying to do my job
dialog: in the most...
text: The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he
text: move back to the hold. Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia
text: across the cabin into Han's arms. Then, abruptly, the motion stops as
text: suddenly as it started. With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they
text: are in each other's arms.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Let go.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Sshh!
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Let go, please.
text: Leia flushes, averting her eyes. She's not exactly fighting to get
dialog: free. But, of course, Han blows it...
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Don't get excited.
text: The anger rises in Leia.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Captain, being held by you isn't
dialog: quite enough to get me excited.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't
dialog: got time for anything else.
text: Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the
text: door. Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.
scene_heading: EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK
text: The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking
dialog: swamp.
text: Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing. He ignites
text: a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it. Taking a power
text: cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Ready for some power? Okay.
dialog: Let's see now. Put that in
dialog: there. There you go.
text: The droid whistles his appreciation. Luke then opens a container of
text: processed food and sits before the thermal heater.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Now all I have to do is find this
dialog: Yoda... if he even exists.
text: Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Still... there's something familiar
dialog: about this place. I feel like...
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: STRANGE VOICE
dialog: Feel like what?
text: Luke jumps out of his skin. Artoo screeches in terror. The young
text: warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the
text: speaker. Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange,
text: bluish creature, not more than two feet tall. The wizened little thing
text: is dressed in rags. It motions toward Luke's sword.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (looking at the
dialog: creature)
dialog: Like we're being watched!
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Away with your weapon! I mean
dialog: you no harm.
text: After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really
text: doesn't understand why. Artoo watches with interest.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: I am wondering, why are you here?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm looking for someone.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Looking? Found someone, you have,
dialog: I would say, hmmm?
text: The little creature laughs.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (Trying to keep from
dialog: smiling)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don't think so. I'm looking
dialog: for a great warrior.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Ahhh! A great warrior.
dialog: (laughs and shakes
dialog: his head)
dialog: Wars not make one great.
text: With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of
text: the cases of supplies. He begins to rummage around.
text: Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the
text: creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his
dialog: disapproval.
text: Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from
text: and takes a bite.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Put that down. Hey! That's my
dialog: dinner!
text: The creature spits out the bite he has taken. He makes a face.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: How you get so big, eating food
dialog: of this kind?
text: He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of
text: Luke's supply cases.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Listen, friend, we didn't mean to
dialog: land in that puddle, and if we
dialog: could get our ship out, we would,
dialog: but we can't, so why don't you just...
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Aww, cannot get your ship out?
text: The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case. Luke loses
text: patience and grabs the case away. The creature retains his prize - a
text: tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey, you could have broken this.
dialog: Don't do that. Ohhh... you're
dialog: making a mess. Hey, give me that!
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: (retreating with
dialog: the lamp)
dialog: Mine! Or I will help you not.
text: Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing
text: closer to Artoo. As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little
text: arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by
dialog: the creature.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don't want your help. I want
dialog: my lamp back. I'll need it to
dialog: get out of this slimy mudhole.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
text: Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately
text: engaged in a tug-of-war over it.
text: Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Ah, ah, ah!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, Artoo, let him have it!
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Mine! Mine!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Artoo!
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Mine!
text: The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one
text: finger. Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Mine!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (fed up)
dialog: Now will you move along, little
dialog: fella? We're got a lot of work
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: No! No, no! Stay and help you,
dialog: I will.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Find your friend, hmm?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm not looking for a friend.
dialog: I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You
dialog: seek Yoda.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Mmm. Take you to him, I will.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yes, yes. But now, we must eat.
dialog: Come. Good food. Come.
text: With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.
text: Luke stares after him. All he sees is the faint light from the small
text: power lamp moving through the fog. Luke makes his decision and starts
text: after the creature.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: (in the distance)
dialog: Come, come.
text: Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Stay here and watch after the
dialog: camp, Artoo.
text: Artoo beeps even more frantically. But as Luke disappears from view,
text: the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic
dialog: sigh.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA
text: Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in
text: front of him. The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, where is Artoo when I need
dialog: him?
text: Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, I don't know where your ship
dialog: learned to communicate, but it
dialog: has the most peculiar dialect. I
dialog: believe, sir, it says that the
dialog: power coupling on the negative
dialog: axis has been polarized. I'm
dialog: afraid you'll have to replace it.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Well, of course I'll have to replace
dialog: it.
text: He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Here! And Chewie...
text: Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and
text: whines. Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so
text: only he can hear.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... I think we'd better replace
dialog: the negative power coupling.
text: Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts
text: to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve. It
text: doesn't budge. Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her. She
text: rebuffs him.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Hey, Your Worship, I'm only
text: trying to help.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (still struggling)
dialog: Would you please stop calling me
dialog: that?
text: Han hears a new tone in her voice. He watches her pull on the lever.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Sure, Leia.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Oh, you make it so difficult
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I do, I really do. You could be
dialog: a little nicer, though.
dialog: (he watches her
dialog: reaction)
dialog: Come on, admit it. Sometimes you
dialog: think I'm all right.
text: She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Occasionally...
dialog: (a little smile,
dialog: haltingly)
dialog: ... when you aren't acting like
dialog: a scoundrel.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like
dialog: the sound of that.
text: With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Stop that.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Stop what?
text: Leia is flushes, confused.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Stop that! My hands are dirty.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: My hands are dirty, too. What
dialog: are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (looking right
dialog: into his eyes)
dialog: Afraid?
text: Han looks at her with a piercing look. He's never looked more
text: handsome, more dashing, more confident. He reaches out slowly and
text: takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console. He
text: draws it toward him.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: You're trembling.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I'm not trembling.
text: Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and
text: emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him...
text: very slowly.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
dialog: There aren't enough scoundrels in
dialog: your life.
text: Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an
text: excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I happen to like nice men.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I'm a nice man.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: No, you're not. You're...
text: He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips. He takes his time, as though
text: he had forever, bending her body backward. She has never been kissed
text: like this before, and it almost makes her faint. When he stops, she
text: regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it
dialog: hard to talk.
text: Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, sir! I've isolated the
dialog: reverse power flux coupling.
text: Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Thank you. Thank you very much.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.
text: The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD
text: The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently
text: seeking its prey.
scene_heading: INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
text: Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge
text: window. Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control
text: deck. Then slowly turns toward the bridge. Before him are the
text: hologram images of twenty battleship commanders. One of these images,
text: the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly.
text: Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is
text: faded and continually disrupted by static. It is the image of Captain
text: Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the
text: Millennium Falcon. Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark
dialog: Lord.
speaker_heading: NEEDA
dialog: (in hologram)
dialog: ... and that, Lord Vader, was the
dialog: last time they appeared in any of
dialog: our scopes. Considering the amount
dialog: of damage we've sustained, they
dialog: must have been destroyed.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: No, Captain, they're alive. I
dialog: want every ship available to
dialog: sweep the asteroid field until
text: they are found.
text: The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to
dialog: Admiral Piett.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Lord Vader.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Yes, Admiral, what is it?
text: The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: The Emperor commands you make
text: contact with him.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Move the ship out of the asteroid
dialog: field so that we can send a clear
dialog: transmission.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Yes, my lord.
scene_heading: EXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER
text: Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars
text: away from the rest of the fleet.
scene_heading: INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER
text: The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber. A strange sound
text: enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure.
text: He looks up and bows quickly.
text: A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before
text: Vader. The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the
text: cloak worn by Ben Kenobi. His voice is even deeper and more
text: frightening than Vader's.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: What is thy bidding, my master?
speaker_heading: EMPEROR
dialog: There is a great disturbance in
dialog: the Force.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: I have felt it.
speaker_heading: EMPEROR
dialog: We have a new enemy - Luke
dialog: Skywalker.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Yes, my master.
speaker_heading: EMPEROR
dialog: He could destroy us.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no
dialog: longer help him.
speaker_heading: EMPEROR
text: The Force is strong with him. The
dialog: son of Skywalker must not become a
dialog: Jedi.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: If he could be turned, he would
text: become a powerful ally.
speaker_heading: EMPEROR
dialog: Yes. Yes. He would be a great
dialog: asset. Can it be done?
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: He will join us or die, my
dialog: master.
text: Vader kneels. The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord
text: of the Sith and fades away.
scene_heading: EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees. A strange
text: baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small
text: lagoon. The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its
text: thick glass windows. As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head,
text: the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of
text: the glowing portals.
scene_heading: INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE
text: Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very
text: plain, but cozy dwelling. Everything is in the same small scale as the
text: creature. The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke,
text: whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower. He sits
text: cross-legged on the floor of the living room.
text: The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up
text: an incredible meal. The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and
text: pans. The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding
text: that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices. He rushes
text: back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who
text: watches the creature impatiently.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Look, I'm sure it's delicious.
dialog: I just don't understand why we
dialog: can't see Yoda now.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Patience! For the Jedi it is
dialog: time to eat as well. Eat, eat.
dialog: Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?
text: Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down
text: near the fire and serves himself from the pot. Tasting the unfamiliar
text: concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: How far away is Yoda? Will it
dialog: take us long to get there?
speaker_heading: CREATURE
text: Not far. Yoda not far. Patience.
dialog: Soon you will be with him.
dialog: (tasting food from
dialog: the pot)
dialog: Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you
dialog: become Jedi? Hm?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Mostly because of my father, I
dialog: guess.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi
dialog: was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (a little angry)
dialog: Oh, come on. How could you know
dialog: my father? You don't even know
dialog: who I am.
dialog: (fed up)
dialog: Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
dialog: here. We're wasting our time.
text: The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.
speaker_heading: CREATURE
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: I cannot teach him. The boy has
dialog: no patience.
text: Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces. But there is no
text: one there. The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that
text: the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking
dialog: with Ben.
speaker_heading: BEN'S VOICE
dialog: He will learn patience.
speaker_heading: YODA
text: Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.
speaker_heading: BEN'S VOICE
dialog: Was I any different when you
dialog: taught me?
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Hah. He is not ready.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yoda! I am ready. I... Ben! I
dialog: can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm
dialog: ready.
text: Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Ready, are you? What know you
dialog: of ready? For eight hundred years
dialog: have I trained Jedi. My own counsel
dialog: will I keep on who is to be trained!
dialog: A Jedi must have the deepest
dialog: commitment, the most serious mind.
dialog: (to the invisible
dialog: Ben, indicating Luke)
dialog: This one a long time have I watched.
dialog: All his life has he looked away...
text: to the future, to the horizon.
dialog: Never his mind on where he was.
dialog: Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph.
dialog: Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh!
dialog: A Jedi craves not these things.
dialog: (turning to Luke)
dialog: You are reckless!
text: Luke looks down. He knows it is true.
speaker_heading: BEN'S VOICE
dialog: So was I, if you'll remember.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: He is too old. Yes, too old to
dialog: begin the training.
text: Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But I've learned so much.
text: Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge
text: eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned. After a
text: long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Will he finished what he begins?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.
speaker_heading: YODA
text: (turns slowly toward
dialog: him)
dialog: Oh, you will be. You will be.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELD
text: The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid
text: storm. Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing
text: ships. One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid
text: and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.
scene_heading: INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the
text: control panel. Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.
text: She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the
text: confusion he has created within her. Suddenly, something outside the
text: cockpit window catches her eye. The reflection of the panel lights
text: obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the
dialog: windscreen. Leia
text: moves closer to see what it might be. Large, yellow eyes flash open
text: and stare back at her. Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her
text: heart pounding. There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in
text: an instant the eyes are gone. The young princess catches her breath,
text: jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.
scene_heading: INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA
text: The lights go bright for a second then out again. Threepio and
text: Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I'm not really interested in your
dialog: opinion, Threepio.
text: Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: There's something out there.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LEIA
text: Outside, in the cave.
text: As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull. Chewie looks
text: up and barks anxiously.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: There it is. Listen! Listen!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I'm going out there.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Are you crazy?!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I just got this bucket back
dialog: together. I'm not going to let
text: something tear it apart.
text: He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out. Leia
text: follows.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Then I'm going with you.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: I think it might be better if I
dialog: stay here and guard the ship.
dialog: (hears another
dialog: mysterious noise)
dialog: Oh, no.
scene_heading: EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON
text: It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is
text: attacking the ship.
text: Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: This ground sure feels strange.
text: It doesn't feel like rock at all.
text: Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline
dialog: of the cave.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: There's an awful lot of moisture
dialog: in here.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I don't know. I have a bad feeling
dialog: about this.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yeah.
text: Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's
text: cockpit. A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of
text: the Falcon. The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it
text: with a laser bolt.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (to Leia)
dialog: Watch out!
text: The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front
text: of the princess. Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yeah, that's what I thought.
dialog: Mynock. Chewie, check the rest
dialog: of the ship, make sure there
dialog: aren't any more attached. They're
text: chewing on the power cables.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Mynocks?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Go on inside. We'll clean them
dialog: off if there are any more.
text: Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air. Leia
text: puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the
text: ship. Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster. Several of
text: the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit
text: window of the Falcon. Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly
dialog: little thing. Shoo! Shoo!
text: Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Wait a minute...
text: He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.
text: The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.
text: Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.
text: The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their
text: faces and run up the platform.
scene_heading: INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA
text: As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch.
text: The ship continues to shake and heave.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: All right, Chewie, let's get
dialog: out of here!
text: The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes
text: to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel. Leia
text: hurries after.
speaker_heading: LEIA
text: The Empire is still out there.
dialog: I don't think it's wise to...
text: Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No time to discuss this in
dialog: committee.
text: And with that he is gone. The main engines of the Falcon begin to
text: whine. Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (angry)
dialog: I am not a committee!
scene_heading: INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle. The
text: cave-quake has greatly diminished.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: You can't make the jump to light-
dialog: speed in this asteroid field...
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Sit down, sweetheart. We're
dialog: taking off!
text: As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks. He notices something
text: out the window ahead. Threepio sees it too.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Look!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I see it, I see it.
text: Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen
text: surrounding the entrance. And as the Falcon moves forward, the
text: entrance to the cave grows ever smaller. Han pulls hard on the
text: throttle, sending his ship surging forward.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: We're doomed!
speaker_heading: LEIA
text: The cave is collapsing.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: This is no cave.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: What?
text: Leia's mouth drops open . She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance

text: ship. Chewie howls.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE SLUG MOUTH
text: The Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on
text: its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth
text: before the huge jaws slams closed.
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROID
text: The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon
text: flies out of its mouth. The monster tilts its head, watching the
text: starship fly away.
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID
text: The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of
dialog: the asteroid storm.
scene_heading: EXT. DAGOBAH - DAY
text: With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick
text: vines that grow in the swamp. Panting heavily, he continues his course
text: - climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in
text: and out of the heavy ground fog.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength
dialog: flows from the Force. But beware
dialog: of the dark side. Anger... fear...
text: aggression. The dark side of
dialog: the Force are they.
text: Easily they flow, quick to join
dialog: you in a fight. If once you
dialog: start down the dark path, forever
dialog: will it dominate your destiny,
dialog: consume you it will, as it did
text: Obi-Wan's apprentice.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: No... no... no. Quicker, easier,
dialog: more seductive.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But how am I to know the good side
dialog: from the bad?
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: You will know. When you are calm,
text: at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses
dialog: the Force for knowledge and
dialog: defense, never for attack.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But tell me why I can't...
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No, no, there is no why. Nothing
dialog: more will I teach you today.
dialog: Clear your mind of questions.
text: Mmm. Mmmmmmmm.
text: Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.
text: Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and
text: pulls it on.
text: He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few
text: feet of water. Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on
text: one side. Luke stares at the tree, trembling.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: There's something not right here.
text: Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I feel cold, death.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: That place... is strong with the
dialog: dark side of the Force. A domain
dialog: of evil it is. In you must go.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What's in there?
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Only what you take with you.
text: Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda. He starts to strap on his
dialog: weapon belt.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Your weapons... you will not
dialog: need them.
text: Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no." Yoda
text: shrugs. Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters
dialog: the tree.
scene_heading: INT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVE
text: Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave.
text: The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage. Holding his lit
text: saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and
text: a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree. Luke draws a deep
text: breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.
text: The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it.
text: His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness. It is
dialog: very quiet here.
text: Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness,
text: illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword. Immediately, he
text: charges Luke, saber held high. He is upon the youth in seconds, but
text: Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.
text: Vader is decapitated. His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders
text: as his body disappears into the darkness. The metallic banging of the
text: helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the
text: floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it
text: cracks vertically. The black helmet and breath mask fall away to
text: reveal... Luke's head.
text: Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in
dialog: terror.
text: The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.
scene_heading: EXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSK
text: Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER
text: Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its
text: convoy of TIE fighters.
scene_heading: INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECK
text: Vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a
text: motley group of men and creatures. Admiral Piett and two controllers
text: stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Bounty hunters. We don't need
dialog: that scum.
speaker_heading: FIRST CONTROLLER
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Those Rebels won't escape us.
text: A second controller interrupts.
speaker_heading: SECOND CONTROLLER
dialog: Sir, we have a priority signal
text: from the Star Destroyer Avenger.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Right.
text: The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune
text: hunters There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge,
text: bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-
text: scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war
text: droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: ... there will be a substantial
dialog: reward for the one who finds the
dialog: Millennium Falcon. You are free
dialog: to use any methods necessary, but
dialog: I want them alive. No disintegrations.
speaker_heading: BOBA FETT
dialog: As you wish.
text: At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Lord Vader! My lord, we have
dialog: them.
scene_heading: EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT
text: The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a
text: firing Imperial Star Destroyer. A large asteroid about the same size
text: as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship. The tiny Falcon
text: banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface.
text: Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly
text: on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window. Threepio
text: checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches
text: tensely out the window.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, thank goodness we're coming
text: out of the asteroid field.
text: Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside. A
text: bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side
text: of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.
scene_heading: EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD
text: The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which
text: creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship. The
text: Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Han corrects the angle of his ship.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Let's get out of here. Ready for
dialog: light-speed? One... two... three!
text: Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens. Flak
text: bursts continue to rock the ship.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: It's not fair!
text: Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and
text: captain. Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.
speaker_heading: HAN
text: The transfer circuits are working.
dialog: It's not my fault!
text: Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (almost expecting
dialog: it)
dialog: No light-speed?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: It's not my fault.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, we just lost the main rear
dialog: deflector shield. One more direct
dialog: hit on the back quarter and we're
dialog: done for.
text: Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Turn her around.
text: Chewie barks in puzzlement.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I said turn her around! I'm
dialog: going to put all power in the
text: front shield.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: You're going to attack them?!
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Sir, the odds of surviving a
text: direct assault on an Imperial
dialog: Star Destroyer...
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Shut up!
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD
text: The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn. In the next moment it
text: is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the
text: massive surface of the Imperial ship. As it moves across the surface
text: of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous
text: flak bursts.
scene_heading: INT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE
text: The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge. The Imperials
text: stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low
text: across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge
text: area. Alarms go off everywhere. The Destroyer's commander, Captain
text: Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.
speaker_heading: NEEDA
dialog: They're moving to attack
dialog: position! Shields up!
text: Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window. At the
text: last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight. All is quiet.
speaker_heading: NEEDA
dialog: Track them. They may come
text: around for another pass.
speaker_heading: TRACKING OFFICER
dialog: Captain Needa, the ship no longer
text: appears on our scopes.
speaker_heading: NEEDA
dialog: They can't have disappeared. No
text: ship that small has a cloaking
dialog: device.
speaker_heading: TRACKING OFFICER
dialog: Well, there's no trace of them,
dialog: sir.
scene_heading: COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
text: Captain, Lord Vader demands an
dialog: update on the pursuit.
speaker_heading: NEEDA
dialog: (drawing a breath)
dialog: Get a shuttle ready. I shall
dialog: assume full responsibility for
dialog: losing them, and apologize to Lord
text: Vader. Meanwhile, continue to
dialog: scan the area.
scene_heading: COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
dialog: Yes, Captain Needa.
scene_heading: EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAY
text: Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain. He stands on
text: his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet. Opposite Luke and Yoda are
text: two rocks the size of bowling balls. Luke stares at the rocks and
text: concentrates. One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to
dialog: rest on the other.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Use the Force. Yes...
text: Yoda taps Luke's leg. Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground.
text: His body wavers, but he maintains his balance. Artoo, standing nearby,
text: is whistling and beeping frantically.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Now... the stone. Feel it.
text: Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock. It rises a few feet,
text: shaking under the strain. But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping,
text: Luke loses his balance and finally collapses. Yoda jumps clear.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Concentrate!
text: Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking
text: urgently back and forth in front of him.
text: Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the
text: edge of the swamp. Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge. The
text: X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the
text: lake's surface.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, no. We'll never get it out
dialog: now.
text: Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: So certain are you. Always with
dialog: you it cannot be done. Hear you
dialog: nothing that I say?
text: Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: Master, moving stones around is
dialog: one thing. This is totally
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: No! No different! Only different
dialog: in your mind. You must unlearn
dialog: what you have learned.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (focusing, quietly)
dialog: All right, I'll give it a try.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: No! Try not. Do. Or do not.
dialog: There is no try.
text: Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.
text: Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water. It hovers
text: for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (panting heavily)
dialog: I can't. It's too big.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Size matters not. Look at me.
dialog: Judge me by my size, do you?
dialog: Hm? Mmmm.
text: Luke shakes his head.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: And well you should not. For my
dialog: ally in the Force. And a powerful
dialog: ally it is. Life creates it, makes
dialog: it grow. Its energy surrounds us
dialog: and binds us. Luminous beings
dialog: are we...
dialog: (Yoda pinches
dialog: Luke's shoulder)
dialog: ... not this crude matter.
dialog: (a sweeping gesture)
dialog: You must feel the Force around you.
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Here, between you... me... the
dialog: tree... the rock... everywhere!
dialog: Yes, even between this land and
dialog: that ship!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (discouraged)
dialog: You want the impossible.
text: Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter. With his eyes closed and
text: his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.
text: Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo
text: beeps in terror and scoots away.
text: The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore. Yoda
text: stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the
dialog: beach.
text: Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore.
text: He walks toward Yoda.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don't... I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: That is why you fail.
text: Luke shakes his head, bewildered.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET
text: The fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star
dialog: Destroyer, the Avenger.
scene_heading: INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Apology accepted, Captain Needa.
text: Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then
text: falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader. Two stormtroopers
text: pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett
text: and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Lord Vader, our ships have
dialog: completed their scan of the area
dialog: and found nothing. If the
dialog: Millennium Falcon went into light-
dialog: speed, it'll be on the other side
dialog: of the galaxy by now.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Alert all commands. Calculate
dialog: every possible destination along
dialog: their last know trajectory.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Yes, my lord. We'll find them.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Don't fail me again, Admiral.
text: Vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than
dialog: when he arrived.
speaker_heading: PIETT
dialog: Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET
text: Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships. the
text: Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction. No one on
text: that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the
text: Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Captain Solo, this time you have
dialog: gone too far.
dialog: (Chewie growls)
dialog: No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
dialog: Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (to Chewie)
text: The fleet is beginning to break
dialog: up. Go back and stand by the
text: manual release for the landing claw.
text: Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: I really don't see how that is
dialog: going to help. Surrender is a
dialog: perfectly acceptable alternative
dialog: in extreme circumstances. The
dialog: Empire may be gracious enough...
text: Leia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: What did you have in mind for
dialog: your next move?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Well, if they follow standard
dialog: Imperial procedure, they'll dump
dialog: their garbage before they go to
dialog: light-speed, then we just float
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: LEIA
text: With the rest of the garbage.
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Then we've got to find a safe
dialog: port somewhere around here. Got
dialog: any ideas?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: No. Where are we?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: The Anoat system.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Anoat system. There's not much
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: No. Well, wait. This is
dialog: interesting. Lando.
text: He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel. Leia slips out
text: of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot. Small light points
text: representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Lando system?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Lando's not a system, he's a man.
dialog: Lando Calrissian. He's a card
dialog: player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd
dialog: like him.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Bespin. It's pretty far, but I
dialog: think we can make it.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (reading from the
dialog: computer)
dialog: A mining colony?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando
dialog: conned somebody out of it. We
dialog: go back a long way, Lando and me.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Can you trust him?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: No. But he has no love for the
dialog: Empire, I can tell you that.
text: Chewie barks over the intercom. Han quickly changes his readouts and
text: stretches to look out the cockpit window.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (into intercom)
dialog: Here we go, Chewie. Stand by.
dialog: Detach!
text: Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile. She
text: thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and
text: she gives him a quick kiss.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: You do have your moments. Not
dialog: many, but you have them.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER
text: As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its
text: underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it. Hidden among the
text: refuse, the Falcon tumbles away. In the next moment, the Avenger roars
text: off into hyperspace. The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races
text: off into the distance. Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's
text: ship appears and moves after the Falcon.
scene_heading: EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY
text: In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but
text: his face shows less strain and more concentration than before. Yoda
text: sits on the ground below the young warrior. On the other side of the
text: clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air. Nearby Artoo
text: watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air.
text: His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically,
dialog: looking for help.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Concentrate... feel the Force
dialog: flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes.
dialog: Through the Force, things you
dialog: will see. Other places. The
dialog: future... the past. Old friends
dialog: long gone.
text: Luke suddenly becomes distressed.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Han! Leia!
text: The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then
text: Luke himself tumbles over.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Hmm. Control, control. You must
dialog: learn control.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I saw... I saw a city in the
dialog: clouds.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Mmm. Friends you have there.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: They were in pain.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: It is the future you see.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Future? Will they die?
text: Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Difficult to see. Always in
dialog: motion is the future.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I've got to go to them.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Decide you must how to serve
dialog: them best. If you leave now,
dialog: help them you could. But you
dialog: would destroy all for which they
dialog: have fought and suffered.
text: Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words. Gloom shrouds him as he nods his
text: head sadly.
scene_heading: EXT. BESPIN SYSTEM - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAWN
text: The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward
text: the soft pink planet of Bespin.
scene_heading: EXT. BESPIN SURFACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON
text: It is down on the gaseous planet. Huge billowing clouds form a canyon
text: as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's Cloud City.
text: Suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon.
text: The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: One of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak rocking the
text: ship. Chewie barks his concern.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (into transmitter)
dialog: No, I don't have a landing
dialog: permit. I'm trying to reach

dialog: Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me
dialog: explain.
speaker_heading: INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: You will not deviate from your

speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Rather touchy, aren't they?
speaker_heading: LEIA

speaker_heading: INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: Permission granted to land on

speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (into transmitter)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Angry, Han snaps off the intercom. Chewie looks at him and grunts.
text: Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: There's nothing to worry about.
dialog: We go way back, Lando and me.
text: Leia doesn't look convinced.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Who's worried?
scene_heading: EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CARS

scene_heading: EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON
text: Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed. Behind them, Chewie, also

speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I don't like this.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Well, what would you like?
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Well, they did let us land.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Look, don't worry. Everything's

scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Lando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a
text: group of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing

scene_heading: EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: See? My friend.

dialog: Keep your eyes open, okay?
text: Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp. Lando and his men head
text: across the bridge to meet the space pirate.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM
text: Lando stops ten feet from Han. The two men eye each other carefully.
text: Lando shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
dialog: no-good swindler! You've got a
dialog: lot of guts coming here, after
dialog: what you pulled.
text: Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me?"
text: Lando moves threateningly toward Han. Suddenly, he throws his arms
text: around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: How you doing, you old pirate?
dialog: So good to see you! I never thought
dialog: I'd catch up with you again. Where

speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (gestures toward

dialog: Ahh... repairs. I thought you

speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: (in mock panic)
dialog: What have you done to my ship?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Your ship? Hey, remember, you

speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Hello. What have we here?
dialog: Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.
dialog: I'm the administrator of this

speaker_heading: LEIA

speaker_heading: LANDO

speaker_heading: HAN

speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio,

dialog: quite a few times. She's the
text: fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
text: The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city. They
text: walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and
text: passing many small plazas as they go. Threepio lags a bit behind.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: How's the gas mine? Is it
dialog: paying off for you?
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Oh, not as well as I'd like.
dialog: We're a small outpost and not
dialog: very self-sufficient. And I've
dialog: had supply problems of every kind.
dialog: I've had labor difficulties...
dialog: (catches Han
dialog: grinning at him)
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: You. Listen to you - you sound
text: like a businessman, a responsible
dialog: leader. Who'd have thought that,
dialog: huh?
text: Lando is reflective. He looks at Han a moment.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: You know, seeing you sure
text: brings back a few things.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Yeah. I'm responsible these days.
dialog: It's the price you pay for being
dialog: successful.
text: Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the
dialog: corridor.
text: The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming
text: out of a door.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
speaker_heading: SECOND THREEPIO
dialog: (mumbles)
dialog: E chu ta!
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: How rude!
text: Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away. Then he hears the
text: muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM
text: Curious, Threepio enters the room.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: That sounds like an R2 unit in
dialog: there. I wonder if...
text: Threepio walks through the doorway to the main room. He looks in.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: (from within)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I... I
dialog: didn't mean to intrude. No, no,
dialog: please don't get up. No!
text: A laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions.
text: Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door
text: whooshes closed behind him.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
text: Lando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio's
text: dreadful accident. Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but
text: shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.
scene_heading: EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DUSK
text: In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the
text: belly of the ship. Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into
text: his cubbyhole. Yoda stands nearby on a log.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Luke! You must complete the
dialog: training.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I can't keep the vision out of my
dialog: head. They're my friends. I've
dialog: got to help them.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: You must not go!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But Han and Leia will die if I
dialog: don't.
speaker_heading: BEN'S VOICE
dialog: You don't know that.
text: Luke looks toward the voice in amazement. Ben has materialized as a
text: real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda. The power of his presence
text: stops Luke.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But I can help them! I feel
dialog: the Force!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But you cannot control it. This
dialog: is a dangerous time for you,
dialog: when you will be tempted by the
text: dark side of the Force.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen.
dialog: The cave. Remember your failure
dialog: at the cave!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But I've learned so much since
dialog: then. Master Yoda, I promise to
dialog: return and finish what I've begun.
dialog: You have my word.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It is you and your abilities the
dialog: Emperor wants. that is why your
text: friends are made to suffer.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And that is why I have to go.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Luke, I don't want to lose you to
dialog: the Emperor the way I lost Vader.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You won't.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Stopped they must be. On this
dialog: all depends. Only a fully trained
dialog: Jedi Knight with the Force as his
dialog: ally will conquer Vader and his
dialog: Emperor. If you end your training
dialog: now, if you choose the quick and
dialog: easy path, as Vader did, you will
dialog: become an agent of evil.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Patience.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And sacrifice Han and Leia?
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: If you honor what they fight for
dialog: ... yes!
text: Luke is in great anguish. He struggles with the dilemma, a battle
text: raging in his mind.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: If you choose to face Vader, you
dialog: will do it alone. I cannot
dialog: interfere.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I understand.
dialog: (he moves to his
dialog: X-wing)
text: Artoo, fire up the converters.
text: Artoo whistles a happy reply.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Luke, don't give in to hate -
text: that leads to the dark side.
text: Luke nods and climbs into his ship.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: Strong is Vader. Mind what you
dialog: have learned. Save you it can.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I will. And I'll return. I promise.
text: Artoo closes the cockpit. Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of
text: the engines and the wind engulf them.
speaker_heading: YODA
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Told you, I did. Reckless is
dialog: he. Now matters are worse.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That boy is our last hope.
speaker_heading: YODA

scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY
text: Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in
text: agitation. She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a
text: lovely dress. Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons. She moves
text: from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: HAN
text: The ship is almost finished.
dialog: Two or Three more things and
dialog: we're in great shape.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: The sooner the better. Something's
dialog: wrong here. No one has seen or
dialog: knows anything about Threepio.
dialog: He's been gone too long to have
dialog: gotten lost.
text: Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Relax. I'll talk to Lando and
dialog: see what I can find out.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I don't trust Lando.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Well, I don't trust him, either.
dialog: But he is my friend. Besides,
dialog: we'll soon be gone.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: And then you're as good as gone,
dialog: aren't you?
text: Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM
text: The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts. Four
text: Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some
text: pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten
text: metal. Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt. Chewie
text: enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting
text: Threepio's head. The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught,
text: then reaches to grab the head. But the Ugnaught tosses it away from
text: him to another Ugnaught. This game of keep-away goes on until
text: Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the
dialog: ground.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY
text: The door zaps open. Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of
text: Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: What happened?
text: Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Where? Found him in a junk pile?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you
dialog: think you can repair him?
text: The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts. He looks at the
text: princess and shrugs sadly.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Lando's got people who can fix
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: No, thanks.
text: There is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: I'm sorry. Am I interrupting
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: You look absolutely beautiful.
dialog: You truly belong here with us
text: among the clouds.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Will you join me for a little
dialog: refreshment?
text: Han looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of
text: food and licks his lips.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Everyone's invited, of course.
text: Leia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go. Lando
text: spots Threepio's remains.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Having trouble with you droid?
text: Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: No. No problem. Why?
text: Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and
text: Chewie. The door slides closed behind them.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance
text: behind. Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall,
text: pure-white columns.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: So you see, since we're a small
dialog: operation, we don't fall into
dialog: the... uh... jurisdiction of the
dialog: Empire.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: So you're part of the mining
dialog: guild then?
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: No, not actually. Our operation
dialog: is small enough not to be noticed...
dialog: which is advantageous for everybody
dialog: since our customers are anxious
dialog: to avoid attracting attention to
dialog: themselves.
text: The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at
dialog: the far end.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Aren't you afraid the Empire's
dialog: going to find out about this
dialog: little operation and shut you down?
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: That's always been a danger looming
dialog: like a shadow over everything we've
dialog: built here. But things have
dialog: developed that will insure security.
dialog: I've just made a deal that will
dialog: keep the Empire out of here forever.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM
text: The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the
text: dining room. At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.
text: Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty
dialog: hunter.
text: Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a
text: couple of shots directly at Vader. The Dark Lord quickly raises his
text: hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they
text: explode harmlessly. Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's
text: hand. The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: We would be honored if you would
dialog: join us.
text: Han gives Lando a mean look.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: I had no choice. They arrived
dialog: right before you did. I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I'm sorry, too.
scene_heading: EXT. LUKE'S X-WING - BESPIN SYSTEM
text: Luke's X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT
text: Luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin's shining
text: city. Artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: No, Threepio's with them.
text: Artoo whistles another worried inquiry.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (into comlink)
dialog: Just hang on. We're almost there.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL
text: Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell. The stark room is flooded
text: with hot light. To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle
text: screeches loudly. Chewie is going mad. He hits the wall with giant
text: fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor. The upper
text: lights go off abruptly. The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a
text: wall, where he listens for a moment. Then, moaning to himself, he
text: moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie. He
text: picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment,
text: barking a few philosophical remarks. Chewie sticks the robot's head on
text: its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.
text: Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches
text: two connectors together. Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his
text: voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take
dialog: this off! I, uh, don't mean to
dialog: intrude here. I, don't, no, no,
dialog: no... Please don't get up. No!
text: Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry
text: head. He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio
text: immediately begins speaking normally.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Stormtroopers? Here? We're in
dialog: danger. I must tell the others.
dialog: Oh, no! I've been shot!
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA
text: Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an
text: elaborate torture mechanism. Han is strapped to a rack which tilts
text: forward onto the torture device. Vader activates the mechanism,
text: creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.
text: The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a
text: sharp, piercing cry of agony. Darth Vader moves to the holding
text: chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBER
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Lord Vader.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: (to Fett)
dialog: You may take Captain Solo to
dialog: Jabba the Hut after I have
dialog: Skywalker.
text: Han's screams filter through the torture room door.
speaker_heading: BOBA FETT
dialog: He's no good to me dead.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: He will not be permanently damaged.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Lord Vader, what about Leia and
dialog: the Wookiee?
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: They must never again leave this
dialog: city.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: That was never a condition of our
dialog: agreement, nor was giving Han to
dialog: this bounty hunter!
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Perhaps you think you're being
dialog: treated unfairly.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Good. It would be unfortunate if
dialog: I had to leave a garrison here.
text: Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett. Lando walks
text: swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: This deal's getting worse all
dialog: the time.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL
text: Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together. One arm is
text: connected, but the legs are yet to be attached. There is one small
text: problem, however. It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's
text: head on backwards.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, yes, that's very good. I like
dialog: that. Oh! Something's not right
dialog: because now I can't see. Wait.
dialog: Wait! Oh, my! what have you done?
dialog: I'm backwards, you stupid furball.
dialog: Only an overgrown mophead like you
dialog: would be stupid enough...
text: Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a
text: circuit and the droid shuts down. The Wookiee smells something and
text: sits up. The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is
text: shoved into the room by two stormtroopers. Barking his concern, the
text: huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug. Han is very pale, with dark circles
text: under his eyes.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I feel terrible.
text: Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open
text: revealing Leia. She, too, looks a little worse for wear. The troopers
text: push her into the cell, and the door slides closed. She moves to Han,
text: who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking
text: his head.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Why are they doing this?
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: They never even asked me any
dialog: questions.
text: The cell door slides open. Lando and two of his guards enter.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Lando.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Get out of here, Lando!
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Shut up and listen! Vader has
dialog: agreed to turn Leia and Chewie
dialog: over to me.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Over to you?
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: They'll have to stay here, but at
dialog: least they'll be safe.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: What about Han?
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Vader's giving him to the bounty
dialog: hunter.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Vader wants us all dead.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: He doesn't want you at all. He's
dialog: after somebody called Skywalker.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Luke?
speaker_heading: LANDO
text: Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
text: Leia's mind is racing.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: And we're the bait.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Well, he's on his way.
text: Han's rage peaks.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Perfect. You fixed us all pretty
dialog: good, didn't you?
dialog: (spits it out)
dialog: My friend!
text: Han hauls off and punches Lando. The two friends are instantly engaged
text: in a frantic close-quarters fight. The guards hit Han with their rifle
text: butts and he flies across the room. Chewie growls and starts for the
text: guards. They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando
dialog: stops them.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Stop! I've done all I can. I'm
dialog: sorry I couldn't do better, but
dialog: I have my own problems.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Yeah, you're a real hero.
text: Lando and the guards leave. Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia
text: and Chewie help him up.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: (dabs at his wound)
dialog: You certainly have a way with
dialog: people.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
text: Four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large
text: chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks. In the middle
text: of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform. Darth Vader
text: and Lando stand near the platform.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: This facility is crude, but it
dialog: should be adequate to freeze
dialog: Skywalker for his journey to the
dialog: Emperor.
text: An Imperial soldier appears.
speaker_heading: IMPERIAL SOLDIER
text: Lord Vader, ship approaching.
dialog: X-wing class.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow
dialog: him to land.
text: The soldier bows and leaves the chamber.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Lord Vader, we only use this
dialog: facility for carbon freezing. If
dialog: you put him in there, it might
dialog: kill him.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: I do not want the Emperor's prize
dialog: damaged. We will test it... on
dialog: Captain Solo.
text: Lando's face registers dismay.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM - LUKE'S X-WING
text: Luke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT
text: Encountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
text: There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform. Six
text: Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use. A special
text: coffinlike container is put in place. With Boba Fett in the lead, a
text: squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie. Strapped to
text: Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is
text: Threepio. Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's
text: and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see
text: what is happening. His one attached arm is animate and expressive,
text: intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes. The
text: remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back
text: so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: If only you had attached my legs,
dialog: I wouldn't be in this ridiculous
dialog: position. Now, remember, Chewbacca,
dialog: you have a responsibility to me,
dialog: so don't do anything foolish.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: (to Lando)
dialog: What's going on... buddy?
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: You're being put into carbon freeze.
text: Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.
speaker_heading: BOBA FETT
dialog: What if he doesn't survive? He's
dialog: worth a lot to me.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: The Empire will compensate you
dialog: if he dies. Put him in!
text: Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and
text: attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han. Within seconds, other
text: Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee
text: with their laser weapons.
text: From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in
text: panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop,
dialog: Chewbacca, stop...!
text: The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear
dialog: me? Stop!
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready
dialog: to die.
text: Han breaks away from his captors. Vader nods to the guards to let him
text: go and the pirate breaks up the fight.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Chewie! Chewie, this won't help
dialog: me. Hey!
text: Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: Save your strength. There'll be
dialog: another time. The princess - you
dialog: have to take care of her. You
dialog: hear me?
text: Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.
text: In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too
text: distraught to protest. Han turns to Princess Leia. They look
text: sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a
text: final, passionate kiss.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I love you!
speaker_heading: HAN
dialog: I know.
text: Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to
text: the hydraulic platform. Han looks one final time at his friends - and
text: then, suddenly, the platform drops. Chewie howls. Leia turns away in
dialog: agony.
text: Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.
text: Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and
text: fluid as great as any steel furnace. Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns
text: away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: What... what's going on? Turn
dialog: round, Chewbacca, I can't see.
dialog: Oh... they've encased him in
dialog: carbonite. He should be quite
dialog: well-protected - if he survives
dialog: the freezing process, that is.
text: Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an
text: angry glance and bark.
text: A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate
text: out of the vat and stands him on the platform. Some Ugnaughts rush
text: over and push the block over onto the platform. They slide the
text: coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it
text: inside. They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step
text: away. Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat. He
text: shakes his head in relief.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Yes, he's alive. And in perfect
text: hibernation.
text: Vader turns to Boba Fett.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: He's all yours bounty hunter.
text: Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
speaker_heading: IMPERIAL OFFICER
dialog: Skywalker has just landed, my
dialog: lord.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Good. See to it that he finds
dialog: his way here. Calrissian, take
dialog: the princess and the Wookiee to
dialog: my ship.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: You said they'd be left in the
dialog: city under my supervision.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: I am altering the deal. Pray I
dialog: don't alter it any further.
text: Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia,
dialog: Chewie, and Threepio.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a
text: group of people coming down a side hallway. Artoo lets out an excited
text: series of beeps and whistles. Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops
text: in his tracks with a feeble squeak.
text: Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the
text: floating, encased body of Han Solo. Two stormtroopers, who follow,
text: immediately spot Luke and open fire on him. The youth draws his weapon
text: and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot. The
text: two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and
text: fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a
text: huge chunk of wall.
text: Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett,
text: Han, and the guards are gone. A think metal door blocks the passage.
text: Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a
text: second hallway by several other stormtroopers. Leia turns just in time
dialog: to see Luke.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Luke! Luke, don't - it's a
dialog: trap! It's a trap!
text: Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears
text: from sight. Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing
dialog: behind.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM
text: Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings. Leia and the
text: others are nowhere to be seen. Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the
text: corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes
text: slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit. Several more doors clang shut,
text: echoing through the chamber.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM
text: Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door. He

dialog: other direction.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM
text: Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam. Seeing an
text: opening above him, he stops to look up. As he does, the platform he
text: stands on begins to move.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
text: Luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform. The room is
text: deathly quiet. Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else
text: seems to be in the large room. Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.
text: Steam begins to build up in the chamber. Looking up through the steam,
text: Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him. Luke holsters
text: his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader. He feels confident,
text: eager to engage his enemy.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: The Force is with you, young
dialog: Skywalker. But you are not a
dialog: Jedi yet.
text: Luke ignites his sword in answer. In an instant, Vader's own sword is
text: lit. Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow. Again Luke attacks, and
text: the swords of the two combatants clash in battle.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
text: Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along,
text: guarded by six stormtroopers. The group reaches an intersection where
text: Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.
text: The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.
text: Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia
dialog: and one to Lando.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Well done. Hold them in the
dialog: security tower - and keep it
dialog: quiet. Move.
text: As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to
text: undo Chewie's binding.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: We're getting out of here.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: I knew all along it had to be a
dialog: mistake.
text: Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Do you think that after what you
dialog: did to Han we're going to trust
dialog: you?
text: Lando tries to free himself from Chewie.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: (choking)
dialog: I had no choice...
text: Chewie barks ferociously.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: (to Chewie)
dialog: What are you doing? Trust him,
dialog: trust him!
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Oh, so we understand, don't we,
dialog: Chewie? He had no choice.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: I'm just trying to help...
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: We don't need any of your help.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: (choking)
dialog: H-a-a-a...
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: It sounds like Han.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: There's still a chance to save
dialog: Han... I mean, at the East
dialog: Platform...
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Chewie.
text: Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: (to Lando)
dialog: I'm terribly sorry about all this.
dialog: After all, he's only a Wookiee.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP
text: The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of
text: the bounty hunter's ship. Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to
text: the cargo hold.
speaker_heading: BOBA FETT
dialog: Put Captain Solo in the cargo
dialog: hold.
text: And with that, the door slams shut.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
text: Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly
text: they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Artoo! Artoo! Where have you
dialog: been?
text: Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be
text: spun out of sight of his friend.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Turn around, you wooly...!
dialog: (to Artoo)
dialog: Hurry, hurry! We're trying to
dialog: save Han from the bounty hunter!
text: Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing
dialog: group.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Well, at least your still in
dialog: one piece! Look what happened to
dialog: me!
scene_heading: EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY
text: An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a
text: large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.
text: Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset
dialog: sky.
text: In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind
dialog: you!
text: A laser bolt explodes near the princess. Everyone turns to see what
text: Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad
text: of stormtroopers running toward them. Artoo peeks out from the
dialog: elevator.
text: Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break
text: for the elevator. Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess
text: and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge. Lando sticks his head out
text: of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely
text: notice. They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of
text: captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.
text: But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser
text: fire toward the elevator. Once they are inside, the door slams shut
text: and the stormtroopers race forward.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER
text: Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the
text: chamber. Their swords clash, the platform sways. Luke aggressively
text: drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: You have learned much, young one.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You'll find I'm full of surprises.
text: Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and
text: sending it flying. Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the
text: youth to jump back to protect himself. Losing his balance, Luke rolls
text: down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform. There he
text: sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken. Just in time he looks up
text: to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him. Luke rolls
text: away as Vader lands. Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his
dialog: enemy.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Your destiny lies with me,
dialog: Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to
dialog: be true.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No!
text: Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly. All
text: the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.
text: Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and
text: falls back into the opening. There is a rumble, and in an instant
text: freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision. Vader turns aside and
text: deactivates his sword.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: All to easy. Perhaps you are not
dialog: as strong as the Emperor thought.
text: Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward. Liquid metal
text: begins to pour into the pit.
text: Vader turns around - and then looks up. He sees Luke, who has leaped
text: fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the
dialog: carbonite outlet.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Impressive... most impressive.
text: Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the
text: steaming carbonite pit. He raises his hand. His sword, which had
text: fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his
text: outstretched hand and is instantly ignited. Vader immediately lights
dialog: his sword as well.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Obi-Wan has taught you well. You
dialog: have controlled your fear... now
dialog: release your anger.
text: Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger. He begins to retreat as
text: Vader goads him on. As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he
text: has been foolhardy. A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.
text: Another exchange and Vader retreats. Luke presses forward.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Only your hatred can destroy me.
text: Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.
text: He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to
text: fill up with steam.
text: Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword. Vader blocks the sword,
text: but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes. The
text: energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of
text: collapse. Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of
text: Vader. He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers
text: himself into the pit.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM
text: Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the
text: reactor room. He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward
text: a large window as Vader enters.
text: Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.
text: Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall
text: and comes smashing forward toward his back. Luke turns and cuts it in
text: half just as another machine comes hurtling at him. Using the Force,
text: Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an
text: invisible shield.
text: A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke. He deflects it.
text: Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.
text: Small tools and equipment come flying at him. Bombardment from all
text: sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is
text: bloodied and bruised. Finally, one machine glances off his and goes
text: flying out the large window. A fierce wind blows into the room,
text: unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.
text: A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.
scene_heading: INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT
text: Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his
text: deactivated sword in hand. He puts the sword on his belt and begins to
text: scramble up.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM
text: Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the
text: door to the landing platform. They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a
text: moment before the door slams shut. The group ducks into an alcove as
text: stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor. The troopers send a
text: rain of laser bolts at the group. Chewie returns their fire as Lando
text: punches desperately at the door's control panel.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: The security codes has been changed!
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Artoo, you can tell the computer
dialog: to override the security system.
text: Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel. Artoo beeps
text: and scoots toward it. Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's
text: intercom.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Attention! This is Lando
dialog: Calrissian. The Empire has takes
dialog: control of the city. I advise
dialog: everyone to leave before more
text: Imperial troops arrive.
text: Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the
text: socket. Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream. Artoo's
text: circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out
text: underneath him. Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: This way.
text: Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor. As he scoots
text: along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter.
dialog: I'm not supposed to know a power
text: socket from a computer terminal.
scene_heading: INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR
text: In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city.
text: Some carry boxes, others packages. They run, then change direction.
text: Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.
text: Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back
text: at them. Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while
text: Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: What are you talking about? We're
dialog: not interested in the hyperdrive
dialog: on the Millennium Falcon. It's
dialog: fixed! Just open the door, you
dialog: stupid lump.
text: Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor. A triumphant beep
text: from Artoo - and the door snaps open.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: (to Artoo)
dialog: I never doubted you for a second.
dialog: Wonderful!
text: Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes
dialog: outside.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK
text: They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers
text: reaches the main door. Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the
text: droids get on board with Chewie. As Chewie bounds to the ship the
text: Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt. Bend
dialog: down, you thoughtless... Ow!
text: Chewie starts up the ship. The giant engines begin to whine as Lando
text: and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Leia! Go!
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR
text: Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the
dialog: Falcon.
speaker_heading: THREEPIO
dialog: I thought that hairy beast would
dialog: be the end of me. Of course, I've
dialog: looked better.
text: Artoo beeps understandingly.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches
text: over their shoulders. As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship
text: begins to move.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK
text: The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars
text: away from the city. Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in
dialog: pursuit.
scene_heading: INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT
text: Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room.
text: Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet
text: Vader's. Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke
text: backward toward the gantry.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: You are beaten. It is useless
dialog: to resist. Don't let yourself
dialog: be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
text: Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so
text: viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder. The black armor sparks
text: and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.
text: Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at
text: him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword. Luke makes a quick
text: move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.
text: Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins
text: to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.
text: Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away. At that instant,
text: Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his
text: hand and sending his sword flying. In great pain, Luke squeezes his
text: forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its
dialog: extreme end. Vader
text: follows. The wind subsides. Luke holds on. There is nowhere else to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: There is no escape. Don't make
dialog: me destroy you. You do not yet
dialog: realize your importance. You
dialog: have only begun to discover your
dialog: power. Join me and I will complete
dialog: your training. With our combined
dialog: strength, we can end this destructive
dialog: conflict and bring order to the
dialog: galaxy.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'll never join you!
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: If you only knew the power of the
dialog: dark side. Obi-Wan never told
dialog: you what happened to your father.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: He told me enough! It was you
dialog: who killed him.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: No. I am your father.
text: Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No. No. That's not true!
dialog: That's impossible!
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Search your feelings. You know
dialog: it to be true.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No! No! No!
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Luke. You can destroy the Emperor.
dialog: He has foreseen this. It is your
dialog: destiny. Join me, and together
dialog: we can rule the galaxy as father
dialog: and son. Come with me. It is the
dialog: only way.
text: Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.
text: A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision. In the next instant
text: he steps off the gantry platform into space. The Dark Lord looks over
text: the platform and sees Luke falling far below. The wind begins to blow
text: at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the
text: edge. The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast,
text: unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.
scene_heading: INT. REACTOR SHAFT
text: Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.
text: When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.
scene_heading: INT. EXHAUST PIPE
text: Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.
text: He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet
text: hit a circular grill and knock it open. Luke claws at the surface of
text: the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK
text: Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the
text: undermost part of Cloud City. Reaching out desperately, he manages to
text: grab onto on electronic weather vane.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Ben... Ben, please!
text: Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.
text: He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments. All the
text: while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust
dialog: pipe.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Ben. Leia!
text: There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
text: weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hear me! Leia!
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled. Chewie is
text: busy operating the ship. Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a
text: readout on the control panel.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Luke... We've got to go back.
text: Chewie growls in surprise.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I know where Luke is.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: But what about those fighter?
text: Chewie barks in agreement with Lando.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Chewie, just do it.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: But what about Vader?
text: Chewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: All right, all right, all right.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK
text: The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.
scene_heading: EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM
text: Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the
text: Falcon disappears. The wind blows at his cape.
text: He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing
dialog: platform.
speaker_heading: VADER
dialog: Bring my shuttle.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE
text: Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his

dialog: Look, someone's up there.
speaker_heading: LEIA
text: It's Luke. Chewie, slow down.
dialog: Slow down and we'll get under him.
text: Lando, open the top hatch.
text: Lando rushes out of the cockpit.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE
text: Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane. He slips
text: from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks
text: toward him. The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up
text: through the opening of the hatch. Luke begins to slide and finally
text: falls from the vane into space.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Out the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the
text: city. The ship gains on him.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Okay. Easy, Chewie.
text: The Falcon closes in on Luke.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY
text: Three TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH
text: The hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure. Lando reaches out to help

scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: (over intercom)
dialog: Okay, let's go.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY
text: The Falcon races away. It is closely followed by three TIE fighters,
text: all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: Explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly.
text: Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.
text: Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the
text: cockpit supported by Lando. Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie
text: barks in joyous relief.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, Leia.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: All right, Chewie. Let's go.

speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: I'll be back.
text: She kisses him, then leaves the quarters.
scene_heading: INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
text: All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound. Lando anxiously watches
text: the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some

dialog: shape.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: Star Destroyer.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: All right, Chewie. Ready for
dialog: light-speed.
speaker_heading: LEIA
dialog: If your people fixed the

speaker_heading: LEIA
text: All the coordinates are set.
dialog: It's now or never.
text: Chewie barks in agreement.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: Punch it!
text: The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle. The
text: sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up. Faces are tense,
text: expectant. But nothing happens, and the engine goes off. Chewie lets
text: out a frustrated howl. The flak still violently rocks the ship.
speaker_heading: LANDO
dialog: They told me they fixed it. I
dialog: trusted them to fix it. It's not
dialog: my fault!
text: Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit. He gives
