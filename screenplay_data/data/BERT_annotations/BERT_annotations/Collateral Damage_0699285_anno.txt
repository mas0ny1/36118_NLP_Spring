text: NYFD Lt. GORDY PITT strains as he works the handle of an

dialog: nutshell, that's Gordy.
text: Firefighter JUNIOR MONTINE, black Panamanian descent,
text: watches Gordy crank away.
speaker_heading: JUNIOR

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Screw the twenty-first century.

scene_heading: 3 INT. FIREHOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS 3
text: Everyone scrambles. The choreography's practiced,
dialog: automatic. It's achieved without conversation.
text: The channel surfer slides down the fire pole. He's
text: followed by the man who was upstairs snoring.
text: Junior rips a sheet from the teleprinter. He hands the
text: printout to the snorer, the company's "chauffeur."
text: Feet jam into boots. Yellow trousers are hauled up and
text: hitched with suspenders.
text: Yellow jackets are whipped on.
text: The chauffeur TURNS OVER the PUMPER'S huge MOTOR.
text: Firefighters take their stations on the truck. Headsets

scene_heading: 5 EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - TENEMENT - NIGHT 5
text: FLAMES ROAR from the upper stories of this slumlord's
text: shitbox. An engine and ladder company are on-scene
text: attacking the fire with hoses. Neighbors gawk. Gordy's
text: engine company arrives. Gordy hits the ground, moves to
text: a battalion chief. The chief's terse orders are drowned
text: out by the NOISE of the EQUIPMENT, fire and men. Gordy
text: moves back to his company, who have already hooked the
dialog: engine up to water.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Top story's fully involved. We're
text: supporting inside. Two lines up
dialog: the stairs.
text: He points to Junior and then to the channel surfer, MIKE

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Junior and Mike --

text: The chauffeur, ART WESTPHAL, German-Irish, stays with the
text: engine as Gordy grabs a fire axe and leads his two two-
dialog: man hose teams into...
scene_heading: 6 INT. TENEMENT 6
text: Gordy and his men charge the stairs dragging the heavy
text: hoses. Rats head past in the opposite direction,
text: deserting the burning building.
speaker_heading: 7 THIRD FLOOR 7
text: They meet fire on the third floor. On goes the water.
text: Gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants,
text: using the axe to open locked doors, then taps Junior and
text: Mike, indicates "up." Begins leading the hose team up
text: the stairwell. Sees something and yells a warning --
speaker_heading: GORDY
text: Stairs're screwed. Hug the wall.
scene_heading: 8 FOURTH FLOOR 8
text: They reach the fourth floor. There's fire everywhere.
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: 8 CONTINUED: 8
text: They see a FIREFIGHTER from the other company. He has
text: fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway
text: above. He's pinned under a large section of heavy
text: debris, coughing and screaming for help as fire rages
dialog: around him. To Junior and Mike --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Knock it back!
text: They turn the hose on the flames as Gordy moves to the
text: trapped firefighter. Gordy tries lifting the debris,
text: can't budge it. He starts chopping at it with the axe.
text: Chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again.
text: Gordy hacks off a large piece of debris. He levers his
text: axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter.
text: Mike moves to help. Gordy heaves up on the axe. The
text: debris lifts. He heaves harder. It lifts more,
dialog: until...
text: Mike slides the firefighter out. Gordy yanks his axe
text: free. The debris collapses. Gordy moves to the
dialog: firefighter.
speaker_heading: FIREFIGHTER #1
dialog: Two floors up. I heard
dialog: screaming... Couldn't get there.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: FIREFIGHTER #1
text: End of the hall.
speaker_heading: 9 GORDY 9
text: takes off. Charges the next flight of stairs. Reaches
text: the fifth floor. Tries to reach six, but there's too
text: much fire. He's beaten back... but not before he hears
text: the FAINT sound of SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: 10 NEW ANGLE 10
text: Gordy looks down the fifth floor hallway to an apartment
text: door at the end. Between him and the door is the gaping
text: hole in the floor. It's too big to jump. He starts
dialog: running. He's gonna jump it.
text: Gordy reaches the edge of the hole. Leaps with all he's
text: got. At the same time, he swings the axe, point-first.
text: Slams it into a spot high on the wall, and...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: 10 CONTINUED: 10
text: Gordy swings over the hole on the axe handle.
text: He hits the other side running. Drives a shoulder into
text: the door at the end of the hall.
scene_heading: 11 INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT 11
text: Gordy bursts in. It's an inferno. He looks up. Knocks
text: his axe on the ceiling. Hears desperate POUNDING back.
text: Gordy climbs a table. Starts whacking upward with the
text: axe, attacking the peeling, crumbled plaster overhead.
text: Gordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above, but
text: he's not doing it fast enough. He won't beat the fire.
scene_heading: 12 INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY 12
text: Gordy calls down to his men.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Give me the hose!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This place is gone! It could
dialog: flashover any second!
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Give me the goddamn hose!
text: Beat. Mike and Junior pass the hose up.
scene_heading: 13 INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT 13
text: Gordy aims the nozzle at the hole he started in the
text: ceiling. Turns it on full jet.
text: Gordy's barely able to hold the hose as the high-pressure
text: stream bites into old, decayed plaster.
text: Bit by bit the ceiling falls away. Gordy's almost
dialog: through to the room above, when...
text: Falling debris severs the hose. Gordy's lost pressure.
text: He hasn't broken through. The building's coming down.
dialog: He's gotta get outta there.
text: Gordy's not going anywhere. Picks up the axe. Attacks
text: the hole again furiously, until finally...
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: 14 GORDY 14
text: breaks through! A small hole, which he quickly widens,
text: to reveal... a terrified Latino family gaping down at
text: him, their room ablaze around them. Gordy reaches up.
dialog: Speaks to them in Spanglish --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: It's okay... Esta bien, esta
dialog: bien... Come with me... Con mio...
scene_heading: 15 INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY 15
text: Gordy lowers the family through the floor hole.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. TENEMENT 16
text: Gordy carries the family's small child outside. He

text: and shaking his head in disbelief and admiration.
scene_heading: 17 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING 17
text: ANNE PITT, thirties, reaches out and KILLS the ALARM.
text: She rolls over. The other half of the bed's empty. We
text: hear a CHILD'S VOICE from another room.
scene_heading: 18 INT. MATT'S BEDROOM 18
text: Anne opens the door to find an exhausted Gordy sitting on
text: the floor with their four-year-old son, MATT. They're
text: building a K'nex spaceship.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Look what we made!
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Nice rocket... That took a while.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: He was awake when I got home. His

speaker_heading: ANNE

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: You're right.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: And this time, no opening fire

text: She leans down and kisses him. There's passion in it.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: How was your shift?
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: The usual.
text: She yawns. Starts heading out.
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Dreamed I did a triple axel in an
dialog: ice skating championship.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: (beat; calls after
dialog: her)
dialog: Come back and let me see those
text: legs again.
scene_heading: 19 INT. BATHROOM - DAY 19
text: Gordy holds Matt in his arms as water pours over them.
text: It's the second child he's held in the last few hours.
text: This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid:
dialog: what a father wants for his child. We see the deep
text: affection Gordy has for his son. He holds Matt tightly,
text: skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head...
text: Anne opens the shower door. She's on the phone.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: 19 CONTINUED: 19
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at

speaker_heading: ANNE

text: Five-of in front of Dr. Bob's.
dialog: Don't be late.
dialog: (to Matt)
dialog: Let's get you out, sweetie. Your
dialog: father just can't keep you dry.
text: She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy
text: sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds...
text: Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against
text: the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing --
scene_heading: 20 EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 20
text: It appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the
text: chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering
text: as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League
text: plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League.
text: Gordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his
dialog: lungs.
text: The rivalry's intense. The game close. The noise
text: deafening. Bets are going down.
text: NYFD goes up by one in the final minute.
text: Gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team.
text: LUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented
text: fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an
text: unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And
text: misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts
text: toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting,
text: devastated at missing the easy "two." Gordy yells at him
dialog: to defend.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Luis, get back! Pick up your man!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: 20 CONTINUED: 20
text: Luis shakes it off. Hustles back on "D" as his man gets
text: the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And
text: Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The
text: BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins.
scene_heading: 21 SAME SCENE - GORDY AND LUIS - MOMENTS LATER 21
text: In the game's immediate aftermath. NYFD celebrating
text: around them. Gordy's proud of Luis.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: We lose, win, whatever. But one
dialog: thing we never do. We never, ever
dialog: give up. Right?
text: OFF Gordy, smiling at Luis...
scene_heading: 22 SAME SCENE - LATER 22
text: The crowds are gone. Gordy checks his watch and starts
text: off, when a SOUND draws his attention.
speaker_heading: 23 GORDY'S POV 23
text: Luis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence
text: around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew
text: match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the
text: fence, clearly trying to intimidate him.
dialog: 24 BACK TO SCENE 24
text: Gordy stalks walking toward them. Calls --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Luis...
text: Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off.
dialog: Reaching Luis --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em
dialog: anymore.
text: But Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the
text: gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to
dialog: go.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: 25 EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BODEGA - DAY 25
text: THROUGH the window, we see Gordy delivering Luis to a
text: Latin man, clearly Luis's father and the bodega's owner.
text: We don't hear the words, but we can tell Gordy's
text: complimenting the boy to his dad.
text: Gordy emerges. Checks his watch. Whistles up a taxi.
scene_heading: 26 INT. TAXI - DAY 26
text: Traffic jam on Park Avenue South. Gordy's anxious.
text: Checks his watch. He's late. To the cabbie --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Try Fifth.
scene_heading: 27 EXT. 68TH AND MADISON - DAY 27
text: Anne waits on the corner with Matt, playing with his

scene_heading: 28 INT. TAXI - DAY 28
text: Fifth Avenue's also a parking lot.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Shit.
text: He jams money in the pay dish.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: I'm getting outta here.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. FIFTH AVENUE 29
text: Gordy exits the cab and takes off running.
speaker_heading: 30 ANNE 30
text: checks her watch again. She's pissed now.
text: In b.g., a cop leaves his police cart to write a ticket.
text: A caravan of Lincoln Navigators passes Anne and turns
dialog: east on 68th.
speaker_heading: 31 GORDY 31
text: turns onto 68th. As he runs, he jumps, trying to see
text: Anne and Matt over other pedestrians.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: 32 ANNE 32
text: In b.g., the Navigators pull up at a building flying the
text: Colombian flag. Latin and American men in suits get out
dialog: of the Navigators.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. 68TH - BETWEEN FIFTH AND MADISON 33
text: Gordy dodges pedestrians. Still trying to get a glimpse
dialog: of Anne and Matt.
dialog: The cop we saw writing tickets earlier is walking the
text: other way. Gordy nearly collides with him. At the last
text: moment, the traffic cop shuffles Gordy aside.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Sorry.
text: Gordy reaches the corner. Sees Anne and Matt. Whistles.
text: In b.g., behind Gordy, we see the cop get into a brown
dialog: Ford.
scene_heading: 34 ANNE AND MATT 34
text: hear the WHISTLE. Matt sees Gordy.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: There he is.
text: Matt waves.
speaker_heading: 35 GORDY 35

speaker_heading: 39 WINDOWS 39

scene_heading: 40 GREAT CHUNK OF METAL 40

speaker_heading: 41 ANNE 41
text: instinctively pulls her child to her...
speaker_heading: 42 GORDY 42

dialog: wife and son.
text: His scream is lost in the thunderous ROAR all around.
scene_heading: 43 GORDY'S POV - IN SLOW MOTION 43
text: The engine block is about to hit Anne and Matt, when...
text: A FedEx TRUCK, WINDOWS SHATTERED, SKIDS past, wiping out
text: Gordy's line of sight. When the truck clears...
text: Anne and Matt are gone. The corner's empty. Just Matt's
text: spaceship, slowly falling to the ground...
scene_heading: 44 BACK TO SCENE 44
text: There's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to
text: avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air,
text: tumbling, then smacks to the ground.
text: Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris.
text: Then struggles to his hands and knees.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Anne!
text: He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a
text: large shard of glass embedded in his leg.
text: People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about
text: finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but
dialog: can't see them, when...
text: His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.

scene_heading: 84 INT. GORDY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 84

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Tell him not to bother.
text: He slams down the phone. Rips up Brandt's business card.

speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION OFFICER

speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR

speaker_heading: IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR

scene_heading: 88 EXT. PAN AMERICAN HIGHWAY (PANAMA) - DAY 88
text: The highway terminates here, far short of Colombia. The
dialog: idea is to inhibit the northbound migration of people and
text: drugs. From this point south lies the Darien Gap, a
text: thick rain forest traversed only by rough trail.
text: A cab with a Panama City logo pulls up at road's end.
text: Gordy gets out with the Panamanian CAB DRIVER. The Cab

speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER
dialog: Que la vaya bien.
text: He drives off. Gordy looks to Ever. Ever smiles,

scene_heading: 89 EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 89
text: Gordy and Ever pass through pristine tropical rain
dialog: forest.
speaker_heading: 90 NEAR STREAM 90
text: rushing fiercely through the jungle, Ever uses his

text: Gordy and indicates how they'll ford the stream. Gordy
text: nods, then follows Ever's lead into the perilous, belly-
text: deep water. They struggle to maintain their balance,

text: Ever signs okay to Gordy and smiles.
scene_heading: 91 HELICOPTER CARCASS 91
text: They pass the carcass of a crashed and burned-out
dialog: helicopter, when...
text: Two dangerous-looking men armed with assault rifles step
text: out of nowhere onto the path ahead of Gordy and Ever.
text: Gordy and Ever stop. Gordy glances at Ever. Ever's
text: focused on the men and clearly doesn't like what he sees.
text: Gordy looks back. The armed men advance toward them
text: carefully, rifles in the ready position. Gordy watches
text: them approach, wondering who they are and what they're
text: going to do. Ever, frightened, takes a half-step back,
text: then swings the length of bamboo fast and hard, and...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: 91 CONTINUED: 91
text: He smashes it into the base of Gordy's head, knocking
dialog: Gordy out.
text: The men run up. One man covers Gordy, while Ever and the

text: his passport, wallet, and an NYFD T-shirt. And then
dialog: they're gone.
scene_heading: 92 CLOSE ON HUMMINGBIRD 92
text: Hovering over Gordy as he comes to. As it flies off...
speaker_heading: 92A GORDY 92A
text: sits up. Feels the bloody lump on his head. It hurts,
text: but it's not serious. He searches his pockets and
text: backpack, realizes the passport and wallet are missing.
text: Gordy stands. Looks around. He's alone. He's in the
text: jungle... He keeps heading south.
scene_heading: 93 EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 93
text: Gordy trudges on. The thick jungle's hot and humid,
text: full of STRANGE SOUNDS and shadowy animal movements.
text: Gordy's going uphill, when he rounds a bend in the trail,
dialog: and...
text: He meets a man coming the other way. Alarm gives way to
text: the realization that the man is followed by a number of
text: people, including women and children. As they pass
dialog: Gordy, it's apparent they're refugees from their haunted
text: expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions...
text: Gordy addresses the passing people. Indicates where he's
dialog: standing.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Aqui? Colombia?...
text: No one replies. Then a small COLOMBIAN GIRL comes up and
text: gets his attention. She runs back up the trail a short

text: She smiles. At the sound of a sharp WHISTLE, however,
text: she runs back quickly, passing Gordy and rejoining her
text: family. Her father hands her a machete and a Zippo
text: lighter, says something to her. Whereupon the little
text: girl returns to Gordy and holds the items out to him.
text: Beat. Gordy takes them.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Gracias.
text: The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the
text: refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back
text: uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in
text: the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he
dialog: walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people
dialog: to flee for their lives, and...
text: Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement
text: past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he
text: now steps over the line and advances into Colombia.
scene_heading: 94 EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS (COLOMBIA) - DAY/NIGHT 94
text: Where the rain forest of Darien continues in Colombia.
text: Darkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill. At
text: night, the JUNGLE'S EVEN NOISIER. When...
text: EVERYTHING GOES QUIET. Gordy slows. And suddenly,
text: AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere. Not close, but
text: not far, either. A FEW BURSTS, some SINGLE SHOTS -- the
text: call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE. And
text: then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return.
text: As Gordy walks on...
scene_heading: 95 EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS - MORNING 95
text: The sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a
text: break in the trees, sees a small town ahead.
dialog: 41.
scene_heading: 96 NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER 96
text: Gordy has left the trail. He lowers his pants just
text: enough to expose his injured thigh. A bandage covers the
text: wound made by the glass shard. Gordy unwraps the
text: bandage, revealing...
text: A wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of
text: Anne and Matt. A long, livid scar marks the wound.
text: Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then

scene_heading: 98 EXT./INT. CHIVA - NIGHT 98
text: One of the colorful, wretchedly overcrowded buses that

scene_heading: 99 EXT. FINCA (COLOMBIA) - DAY 99

scene_heading: MAN IN YANKEES CAP
dialog: Some have the wrong papers. Some

text: The chiva's DIESEL GROWLS loudly. When suddenly...
speaker_heading: 107 FIGURES 107
text: We see figures moving in the forest between the group and
dialog: the checkpoint. And then...
text: The forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of AUTOMATIC

scene_heading: MAN IN YANKEES CAP

scene_heading: MAN IN YANKEES CAP
dialog: Guerrilleros.
text: The attack rages furiously for twenty seconds, then wanes

dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: 109 FOREST 109
text: We hear the sound of PEOPLE CRASHING through the forest.
text: They're running toward Gordy and the group. The CRASHING
text: GETS CLOSER. And now Gordy begins to hear the BREATHLESS

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: 109 CONTINUED: 109
text: One of the running guerrillas trips over Gordy and goes
text: sprawling. The guerrilla, wearing the motley uniform of
text: an irregular soldier, whips a look back, and...
text: Gordy finds himself staring into the battle-hardened eyes
text: of a fierce young woman. In a heartbeat...
text: The woman jumps back to her feet, and joins her comrades
text: laying down a suppressing FIRE at the soldiers. Spent
text: cartridges rain down around Gordy, as the AK-47 ON FULL
text: AUTO chops loudly over his head. And then...
speaker_heading: 110 NEW ANGLE 110
text: The guerrillas are gone.
text: The Man in the Yankees hat hauls Gordy up, yells --
scene_heading: MAN IN YANKEES CAP
dialog: Vaya!
text: The group is in the greatest danger now -- caught between
text: the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers, who are giving
text: chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them.

text: Soldiers do notice them and begin to FIRE.
speaker_heading: 111 FOLIAGE 111
text: BULLETS SHRED the foliage around Gordy, whipping past his

text: a BULLET BITES into his leg. Gordy slows, but the Man in
text: Yankees Cap won't let him stop to help. Slams him hard
text: on his back. Keeps pushing Gordy forward. A few moments
text: later, we hear M-16's on FULL AUTO back where they left

speaker_heading: 113 EXPLOSION 113

scene_heading: 114 GORDY AND OTHERS 114

speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: Mina.
text: Gordy realizes the old man's saying "land mine." To the
dialog: young woman --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: No!
text: Gordy moves to catch her. Just manages to stop her as
text: she reaches the far bank. Gordy points to where the land
dialog: mine detonated.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Mina... Mina...
text: Beat. Slowly, the terrified young woman responds to the
text: strong, calm tone of command in Gordy's voice and the
text: unpanicked, reassuring look on his face.
text: Gordy brings her back to the group, which fights to stand
text: in the rushing river. He indicates for them to hold
text: hands for stability. Motions for them to stay.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Alto.
speaker_heading: 115 GORDY 115
text: leaves the group in the middle of the river. The GUNFIRE
text: is now FAR-OFF AND SPORADIC. He crosses to the water's
text: edge on the far bank. Pulls the Zippo from his pack and
text: leans over. Uses the flame to illuminate the mud and
text: rock immediately in front of him. Scratches lightly at
text: the ground with the machete, searching for mines. Finds nothing
text: in that spot. And steps onto it.
text: Searching the ground and scratching at it with the
text: machete before each step, Gordy inches toward the Man in
text: the Yankees Cap. Three steps from the river...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: 115 CONTINUED: 115
text: He finds a small, round anti-personnel mine the size of a

text: And another. To the writhing Man in the Yankees Cap --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Don't move... Don't move...
speaker_heading: 116 NEW ANGLE 116
text: Finally, Gordy reaches him. One of the man's legs is
text: missing below the knee. He's bleeding from various other
text: wounds as well. Gordy uses the Zippo to inspect the area
text: for more mines. Then kneels in a footprint.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: You'll be okay... You'll be okay.
text: He takes a bandanna from the man and ties a tourniquet
text: around his thigh. By way of distracting him --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Guerrilla bastards.
scene_heading: MAN IN YANKEES CAP
dialog: No... Military... To stop
dialog: guerrillas.
text: Beat. Gordy finishes the tourniquet, when he sees...
speaker_heading: 117 YOUNG MAN 117
text: has left the group and emerged from the river in a
dialog: different place to avoid the mines.
text: Gordy's eyes go to something glistening in front of the
text: young man -- a taut nylon line ten inches off the ground.
text: The kid's about to hit it. Gordy shouts --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: No! Alto!
text: The young man hears the alarm in Gordy's voice and
text: stops... But not before he plants his next step, and...
text: The trip wire bows against his shin, and...
text: Gordy ducks, covers the Man in the Yankees Cap, and...
text: Nothing happens. The young man just stands there, frozen
text: in position, his leg still bowing the line.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: 117 CONTINUED: 117
text: Using the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to
text: the young man. He follows the trip wire to where a Coca-
text: Cola can hangs from a nearby tree. On closer inspection,
text: Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade.
text: There's no pin in the grenade. The can keeps the
text: grenade's arming spoon in place. The trip wire's
text: designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to
text: explode at chest level... And the can's almost off.
text: Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire. Then
text: carefully slides the Coke can back over the grenade.
scene_heading: 118 MAN IN YANKEES CAP - MOMENTS LATER 118

scene_heading: 119 EXT./INT. ANOTHER CHIVA - DAY 119

scene_heading: 120 INSERT - MAP 120

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: If you don't have one of these,
dialog: you don't want to be up there,
dialog: Gordy.
text: Beat. Gordy's contemplating the warning, when his eyes
text: go to a small, sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped
text: deck, leaning against his father. Gordy reaches over and
text: taps the boy. The boy looks over. Shrinks away at the
text: sight of the large gringo. The father notices and looks
text: at Gordy, who stands, indicates his seat.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Por favor.
text: The father's also apprehensive, doesn't move.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Con mucho gusto.
text: Finally, the father accepts, sits down with the sleepy
text: boy on his lap. Nods his thanks at Gordy, who then gazes
text: down at the son. A kid about Matt's age. Armstrong
text: recognizes the look of a caring dad.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Got kids, eh?
text: OFF Armstrong, as Gordy walks away...
scene_heading: 124 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 124
text: Two Colombian armed man wearing guerrilla uniforms
text: bearing a distinctive ELC patch are walking a trail, when
text: the man in front notices something odd. He stops. Leads
text: the other man back a few steps. Looks into the foliage
text: along the trail. Something doesn't seem right. He
text: extends his AK-47. Prods a hump of greenery with the
text: rifle butt, and in a flash...
text: The greenery suddenly transforms into two men wearing
text: face-paint and full-body military camouflage gear and
text: pointing twin cocked-and-locked CAR-15 assault rifles at
text: the heads of the startled guerrillas.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: 125 EXT. CIA HACIENDA - DAY 125

scene_heading: 126 EXT. FERRY - DAY 126

text: Armstrong joins him.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: That little kid and I had a nice,
dialog: long snooze... We're almost to
dialog: Mompos.
dialog: (gazing out)
dialog: Beautiful country.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: It better be. A lotta people're

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: (looks overboard)
dialog: Y'know, I haven't noticed one
dialog: darn body floating downstream
dialog: this whole trip, have you?
text: Gordy doesn't respond. Beat.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: I was thinking... Maybe we could
dialog: travel together into Caguan. You
dialog: could show me around.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Pass is only good for one person,
dialog: if that's your idea, which I think
dialog: it is... Besides, I can't risk
dialog: traveling around up there in the
text: company of a big gringo with a
dialog: dumb-ass cover story about coffee

speaker_heading: GORDY

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG

dialog: (winks)
dialog: Life can be what you make it here
text: on the frontier.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: No, thanks.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Gotta get off the boat anyway.
dialog: Mompos is the last stop. From
dialog: here into the guerrilla zone you
dialog: can only travel by panga... If you
dialog: change your mind, I'll be at the
dialog: Tropicale later. It's a gringo
dialog: bar. Just follow the cockroaches.
speaker_heading: 127 NEW ANGLE 127
text: They see the beginnings of Mompos. Two 4x4 trucks are

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Sicarios. Death squads. Avoid
dialog: those dudes at all costs.

scene_heading: 128 SAME SCENE - FEW MOMENTS LATER 128
text: The ferry pulls up to the dock. The dock street is a
text: culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders,
text: of big-wheel SUVs and mule carts. There's a definite air
text: of menace.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Federales are looking for someone.
text: Gordy follows Armstrong's look to two plain-clothes

text: watching the boat pull up.
text: When Gordy glances back, Armstrong is gone.
scene_heading: 129 EXT. MOMPOS FERRY DOCK - DAY 129
text: Gordy disembarks amid the throng of passengers, when the

speaker_heading: FAT FEDERALE
dialog: Senor Pitt?
text: Gordy looks up in surprise at him and the thin federale
text: backing him up.
speaker_heading: FAT FEDERALE
dialog: You'll have to come with us.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FAT FEDERALE
dialog: Come with us, please.
text: He clamps a hand on Gordy's arm. Gordy shakes it off and
text: starts running. Almost immediately, he's tackled to the
text: ground by the thin federale. Two more federales join in.
dialog: Gordy's not gonna go down easy, though.
dialog: Even as only one against four, Gordy's a formidable
text: challenge. He's strong, and he's committed all the way.
dialog: He's not getting kicked out of this country again. It's
dialog: not a clean or artful fight. There's no karate. It's
text: four men trying to tackle a bull, and...
text: The bull gets away.
scene_heading: 130 EXT./INT. MOMPOS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 130

scene_heading: 132 ANOTHER ANGLE 132

speaker_heading: 133 FEDERALES 133
text: blast through the bar.
speaker_heading: 134 GORDY 134
text: runs, jumps, launches off a beer keg, and...
speaker_heading: 135 TOP OF WALL 135
text: He reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up.
text: He's looking out across a block-long run of corrugated
text: tin roofs. Takes off across the roofs, each step
text: thundering, as...
speaker_heading: 136 FEDERALES 136
text: burst into the courtyard. Two men hastily build a stack
text: of boxes, etc., against the wall.
speaker_heading: 137 GORDY 137
text: runs as fast as he can across the rooftops, when...
text: A section of roof gives way beneath his feet, just as...
speaker_heading: 138 NEW ANGLE 138
text: One of the federales finally mounts the wall, looks
text: across the rooftops... and Gordy's gone.
speaker_heading: 139 GORDY 139
text: lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice, beans
text: and coffee. The building is dark and dusty. He lies
text: still and listens. FOOTSTEPS approach across the tin
text: roof overhead. Gordy burrows into the bags of rice,
text: pulls them over him.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: 140 FEDERALE 140
text: on the roof peers down through the hole. Scans the
text: warehouse room below with a mini-Mag-Lite.
speaker_heading: 141 GORDY 141
text: sees the flashlight beam move past. He holds his breath.
text: Beat. Then the FOOTSTEPS pass on, RECEDE down the roof.
dialog: And Gordy can breathe again.
scene_heading: 142 EXT. MOMPOS STREET - NIGHT 142
text: Gordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier
text: town. A noisy, neon-lit strip of bars and brothels.
text: Everyone's packing a gun. A new Dodge City, where death
text: squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's BLARING SALSA.
scene_heading: 143 INT. TROPICALE - NIGHT 143
text: In here, the MUSIC'S LOUD ROCK 'N' ROLL. Gringo music
text: for a gringo bar. The place is busy, with plenty of
text: local "hostesses" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing
text: half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad
text: women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one
text: of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the
dialog: other.
text: Gordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the
text: crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when...
text: The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly,
text: revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but
text: now Gordy can see the "Deerborn" logo clearly.
text: Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap.
text: It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts
dialog: toward the girl, when...
text: Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The
text: thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving
text: in on him.
text: Gordy moves faster toward the girl. And...
text: The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the
text: cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab,
text: and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics.
text: The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy.
text: Gordy's almost to the hat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: 143 CONTINUED: 143
text: Armstrong's still having trouble with the second girl's
dialog: spoon.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: I never met a nose I couldn't hang
text: a spoon on.
text: Gordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. Glances back, sees
text: the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back,
dialog: when...
text: A strong hand stops him. The hand belongs to the Fat
dialog: Federale. And now the thin federale's there, too,
text: wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it. People in
text: the bar fall silent. Everyone but Armstrong, who's
text: finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Yahtzee!
text: And now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and
text: sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat
dialog: Federale addresses Gordy --
speaker_heading: FAT FEDERALE
dialog: Come along, Mr. Pitt.
text: Whereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy --
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Police catch you trying to steal
dialog: my hat, you asshole?!
text: He staggers toward Gordy. Grabs the hat.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Fucking hat thief!
text: Armstrong takes a drunken swing at Gordy, but...
text: Instead of hitting Gordy, Armstrong accidentally-on-
text: purpose clocks the fat detective. Then hisses into
dialog: Gordy's ear, clearly not that drunk --
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Get outta here --
dialog: But then Armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale
text: jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts
dialog: surprise the Armstrong neural network.
text: Gordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when...
text: The Fat Federale ZAPS him with another STUN GUN, just
text: behind the ear... And Gordy gets to know the floor, too.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: 144 EXT. MOMPOS JAIL - NIGHT 144
text: The building's ancient, constructed of wood and adobe.
scene_heading: 145 INT. MOMPOS JAIL - CELL - NIGHT 145
text: The jail might be old, but the cells are secure enough.
dialog: They're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant.
text: Gordy and Armstrong are led in by the federales. The Fat
text: Federale has Armstrong's hat. He looks it over,
text: wondering why Gordy wanted it. Then decides he could
text: give a fuck and tosses it to Armstrong. Clangs the cell
text: door shut and locks it. Leaves shaking his head.
speaker_heading: FAT FEDERALE
dialog: Gringos...
text: Armstrong's still unsteady on his feet and sits down on
text: the metal bunk.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: That stun gun wasn't cool.
text: Armstrong looks down at himself.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Haven't peed my pants in a real

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You shouldn't have helped me.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Yeah, well, I guess all these
dialog: assholes down here are just
dialog: starting on my nerves.
text: Gordy's silent. It's over. He's come up short. He's
dialog: going home.
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: So what the hell did you do to
dialog: land us in here? And don't jerk
dialog: me around, eh?

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Did you even have a plan?
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Yeah. Go to Caguan, find The Wolf
dialog: and kill him.
text: Armstrong just shakes his head. Beat.
scene_heading: 146 DOOR TO CELL AREA 146
text: BANGS open. Federales lead in two men -- the two
text: guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy-camouflaged
text: infiltrators. The federales are armed with batons and
text: stun guns, taking no chances. It's clear the rebels
dialog: weren't brought here without a struggle, either -- both
text: are cut and bruised. The tougher-looking of the two has
text: taken a real beating. This beaten man is jammed face-
text: first against the bars of Gordy's cell. He makes eye
text: contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and
text: put into a cell. Then the beaten man is shoved into the
text: cell. A solid, brick wall separates them from Gordy and
dialog: Armstrong. Armstrong's seen the patches on their
dialog: uniforms. To Gordy, sotto --
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: E.L.C.
text: Beat. Armstrong sees the look on Gordy's face. By way
dialog: of a warning --
speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: If you can't kill them, don't even

speaker_heading: BRANDT

dialog: hair, when...
text: Gordy's eyes meet Brandt's. The two men hold the look

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG

text: They reach the Land Cruiser.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: But now we have to see the E.L.C.
dialog: Supervisor for Caguan.
text: It's a prospect that seems to concern Felix almost as
text: much as Gordy. Off which, as they get into the Toyota...
scene_heading: 177 INT. ELC SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE - DAY 177
text: The ELC SUPERVISOR for Caguan may be a Marxist, but the
text: clean, well-ordered office is nicely appointed, with a
text: big-screen Sony and leather furniture. The TV's TUNED TO
text: CNN. A photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man
text: wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an ELC patch and
text: holding an AK-47. A brass nameplate reading "Supervisor"
text: rests on a neat desk, behind which stands the man himself
text: -- a hardened, former guerrilla fighter proud of his
text: position. He's not in cammies now -- his uniform now
text: consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat
dialog: Rolex.
text: Felix is a subordinate here. He and Gordy stand across
text: the desk as the Supervisor examines Gordy's travel pass.
text: Gordy's nervous about what could appear on the TV in the
text: b.g., but tries not to show it.
speaker_heading: ELC SUPERVISOR
dialog: Your passport was stolen.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: In Mompos.
speaker_heading: ELC SUPERVISOR
dialog: ... Mompos is a shithole. Not
dialog: like Caguan... Why didn't
dialog: Armstrong come?
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: He was arrested in Ecuador. He
dialog: got drunk and fooled around with a
text: police officer's wife.
text: The Supervisor just looks at him, assessing Gordy's face
text: for signs he's lying. Gordy's expression stays the same.
text: Felix respectfully interjects. It's almost a plea.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: We need to fix the equipment. We
dialog: have delivery deadlines to meet.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: 177 CONTINUED: 177
text: A long beat. The ELC Supervisor hands the travel pass
text: back to Gordy. In a hard tone to Felix --
speaker_heading: ELC SUPERVISOR
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: He's your responsibility. Don't
dialog: let him out of your sight.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Si. Gracias.
text: As Felix leads Gordy away...
scene_heading: 178 INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - DAY 178
text: Gordy and Felix pull away from the Supervisor's H.Q.
text: Felix resumes his former tone of command.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: The Supervisor made you my
dialog: responsibility... You don't go
dialog: anywhere without me, you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: No problemo.
text: Gordy peers out the window intently as they drive,
text: looking for a lucky break, looking for The Wolf,
text: searching the face of every man. He doesn't see The
text: Wolf, but what he does see surprises him. The ELC
dialog: Supervisor was right: Caguan's no Mompos. It's a third-
text: world town, armed troops are visible, and there's a lot
dialog: of bad shit behind Colombia's revolutionaries, but here
text: the streets are calm and orderly. It's quiet, almost
text: eerie, as people go about their business. OFF Gordy,
dialog: seeing another side of the guerrillas...
scene_heading: 179 INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 179
text: Felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the
text: plantation. The entrance is guarded by a 4X4 "Rat
text: Patrol" assault truck and four heavily armed ELC
dialog: guerrillas.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: The E.L.C. guards your coffee
dialog: beans?
text: Felix thinks he's joking. Until he looks over and sees
text: Gordy's actually being sincere.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: 180 INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER - PLANTATION - DAY 180
text: They approach a hacienda and outbuildings. The
text: accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors,
text: sheds, cats, etc. -- but clearly, this is no family farm.
text: There are lots of serious-looking men around. More ELC
text: guerrillas stand guard.
speaker_heading: 181 FELIX 181
text: stops the car. He and Gordy get out. Felix begins
text: leading Gordy toward two rows of long, open-walled sheds.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: The problem's with the diesel
dialog: generators. The sons-of-bitches
dialog: keep breaking down.
speaker_heading: 182 NEW ANGLE 182
text: They pass four very large pits, where green leaves steep
text: in a thick, foul-smelling liquid.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: We're using portables to keep
dialog: production going, but they don't
dialog: supply enough power to the heat
dialog: lamps, and we have to dry a lot
dialog: of... 'coffee beans.'
scene_heading: 183 ANOTHER ANGLE 183
text: They're now walking between the two rows of sheds, where
text: portable gas GENERATORS THRUM, and...
text: Gordy can see long, wide platforms inside. Above the
text: platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps.
text: Spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two
dialog: of converted cocaine.
scene_heading: 184 IN ANOTHER SHED 184
text: workers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for
dialog: shipment.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: 185 GORDY AND FELIX 185
text: approach the two giant diesel generators.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: We can fix anything, but these
dialog: keep dying on us... You'll start
dialog: now. I'll have tools brought to
dialog: you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Armstrong's a magician with them.
dialog: Let's hope you have his skill.
text: Felix walks over to a guerrilla with an AK-47 and speaks
text: to him. Then goes. Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to
text: Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him.
scene_heading: 186 SAME SCENE - LATER 186
text: Gordy has the diesels partially dismantled. The
text: guerrilla sentry is still right there. Felix returns.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Well?
text: Gordy has to think of something fast. Beat. He throws a
text: machine part against a wall angrily.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: I can't work with these pieces of
dialog: junk.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Junk? These generators cost a
dialog: fortune.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Then treat them that way.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: Armstrong always fixes them.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Armstrong wants your money. He
dialog: makes them work, but he doesn't
dialog: fix them... To do this right, we
dialog: gotta order parts from Europe.
dialog: In the meantime, I can make
dialog: something temporary. There must
dialog: be a machine shop in town.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: ... Yes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: 186 CONTINUED: 186

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Let's go.
text: OFF Felix, forced to acquiesce...
scene_heading: 187 INT./EXT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 187
text: Felix is driving. Again, Gordy uses the opportunity to
text: look for The Wolf. It's a long-shot, and he knows it.
dialog: But it's all he can do.
scene_heading: 188 EMPTY STOREFRONT 188
text: They pass an empty storefront. A sign on the large,
text: front plate glass window says "Cine" and "Sabado."
speaker_heading: 189 BAR 189
text: They pass a bar. Felix watches it go by with something
text: like a look of desire. Gordy registers the look and the
text: connection to the bar.
scene_heading: 190 INT. MACHINE SHOP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 190
text: Gordy selects spare parts.
text: A clerk wraps the parts in an old newspaper, and...
text: Gordy realizes his picture is on the paper. He smears
text: grease from his hands over it.
scene_heading: 191 EXT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY 191
text: Gordy finishes loading the parts into the Land Cruiser.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Let's get moving.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: I'm thirsty. How about you? Want
dialog: to get something to drink?
text: Felix pauses. We see the look of desire again. Gordy's
text: definitely struck a chord. But Felix quickly stifles it.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: We have to get back.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: 191 CONTINUED: 191
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: I've been working all day out in
dialog: the sun. I need a drink... nice
dialog: cold beer? How about it? I saw a
dialog: bar in town.
text: Felix really wants to, but still hesitates.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: With the spare parts, I'll have
dialog: the generators running in two
dialog: hours... We have time for a
dialog: couple beers.
dialog: Beat. Finally --
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Okay. Just a beer. Maybe two.
scene_heading: 192 INT. BAR - NIGHT 192
dialog: They've had a lot more than two beers. Felix has,
text: anyway. He's drunk. He's also in love with a waitress
text: on his lap, a cute gordita named BERTA. He pats her.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: This is mine. This is the reason
dialog: I come here... right, Berta? Me
dialog: amas?
speaker_heading: BERTA
dialog: (playing along)
dialog: Si, amor.
text: Somebody whistles for a drink, and Berta goes.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: ... She's hot, isn't she?
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Long beat. Gordy makes the play he's been contemplating.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Armstrong said to watch my butt

speaker_heading: FELIX

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Ever see him?
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Once.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: (beat; eyes Gordy)
dialog: If you know too much around here,
dialog: it can get you killed.
text: Gordy's gotten all he'll get from Felix. He feigns
text: nonchalance, smiles.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Tell me what doesn't get you
dialog: killed around here.
text: Gordy takes a swig of beer. When...
text: Gordy sees the Beaten Man from the jail in Mompos. The
text: man has just walked in with another guerrilla.
text: Gordy barely avoids being seen as the guerrillas cross
text: the room. At the bar, the bartender puts out two crates
text: of beer. The guerrillas take the beer and head out. No
dialog: money's changed hands. When they're gone, to Felix --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: We'd better get back, huh?
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: ... Shit. It's late.
scene_heading: 193 EXT. BAR - NIGHT 193

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: You're too drunk. I'll drive.
scene_heading: 194 EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER 194

speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: One day, I'm going to screw Berta.

scene_heading: 195 EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - NIGHT 195
text: Gordy follows the Suburban as Felix rambles --
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: ... I'll take her to a small
dialog: restaurant... We'll have lobster
dialog: and drink lots of wine... I'll get
dialog: her drunk... We'll drive home...
dialog: I'll carry her inside... I'll kiss
dialog: her... And then, I'll screw her in
dialog: my bed...
text: The Suburban pulls up next to a house. There are armed
text: guerrilla guards outside.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: ... And when I am done screwing
dialog: her, she'll never want to look at
dialog: another man again...
text: Gordy drives past the house as the Beaten Man and the
text: guerrilla with him get out of the Suburban and start
text: carrying the beer inside. And a moment later...
text: Felix comes around with a start.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?!
text: He unholsters the 9mm and points it at Gordy.
speaker_heading: GORDY

speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Turn around!
text: Gordy turns the car around. Felix keeps the gun on him.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: You drive where I say... Or the
dialog: Supervisor will have us both shot.
text: Gordy drives back. They approach the Suburban and the
text: house once more. This time it's on Felix' side. Felix
text: gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and...
text: Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the
text: other way: a large propane tank next to the house.
scene_heading: 196 EXT. PLANTATION - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT 196
text: The work in the sheds continues. Heat lamps dry down the
text: long tables of coke.
scene_heading: 197 GUERRILLA GUARDS 197
text: are more vigilant at night, patrolling the grounds with
dialog: posted teams.
scene_heading: 198 WORK LIGHTS 198

scene_heading: 199 EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - DAY 199

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: 199 CONTINUED: 199
text: A man is injured, and his teammates call for one of
text: Gordy's guards to substitute. The man in the combat vest
text: responds. The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining
text: the skins. Puts down his AK, strips off his combat vest
text: and shirt, and runs in.
text: Gordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades.
text: With the other guard still watching him closely, however,
dialog: there's nothing Gordy can do.
scene_heading: 200 SAME SCENE - LATER 200
text: The soccer game rages back and forth. Suddenly, an open
text: man gets the ball. Breaks toward the goal.
text: Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the
text: goalie. He cheers the action loudly, whereupon...
text: Gordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and...
text: Gordy grabs a grenade. Almost gets it into a tool box,
dialog: when...
text: The player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and...
text: Gordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping
text: into the tool box by picking up a large wrench... But the
text: grenade's still visible as now...
text: Felix comes around the corner. He's sleepy and hungover.
text: And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress.
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: It's afternoon. Yesterday, you
dialog: said it would only take two more
dialog: hours.
text: Gordy wipes his hands on a rag, throws it on the grenade.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: I have this one ready to go.
text: Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the
text: GENERATOR. It SPUTTERS, but won't catch. Felix just
text: looks at him. Gordy makes an adjustment, and...
text: This time, the ENGINE TURNS OVER. PURRS like new. The
text: heat lamps brighten in a row of sheds. Felix winces as
text: the DIESEL ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head
dialog: pound even harder.
speaker_heading: FELIX

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Why're you bringing the tool box?
speaker_heading: GORDY

scene_heading: 201 EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 201

speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: There's beer at the plantation.
speaker_heading: GORDY

speaker_heading: FELIX

speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: ... I had a dream... I fed her

dialog: rejected me for another man.
dialog: (off Gordy's look)
dialog: Dreams tell the future.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: ... That wasn't a dream, that was

scene_heading: 209 EXT./INT. LAND CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER 209
text: Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box. He slides it
text: just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked
text: over the waistband. He finds some wire. Then searches
text: for something else. Finds a piece of string and checks
dialog: its length. From Gordy's reaction, we understand it's
dialog: too short.
text: Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets. Nothing. He
text: checks the glove box. No long string there, either. But
text: he does find two rubber bands. Gordy studies them a
text: moment, thinking. Tests their elasticity. Then pulls
text: out the Zippo and thumbs it. The lighter still works.
text: As Gordy pockets everything and walks off...
scene_heading: 210 EXT. CAGUAN - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT 210
text: Gordy steals through town, hiding when he sees someone

dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: 211 "CINE" 211

speaker_heading: 212 GORDY 212

speaker_heading: GUERRILLA
dialog: Alto!
text: Gordy stops. The two standing men walk toward him. The
text: other two men get out of the truck to provide backup.
text: One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands
text: off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up. Gordy
text: carefully produces the travel pass. The guerrilla looks
dialog: it over. In butchered Spanish --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Yo trabajo con Felix. Felix --
dialog: (indicates)
dialog: -- la cantina. Con Berta.
dialog: The attractive woman we saw earlier playing with the

scene_heading: 214 INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT 214

speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: This where Armstrong stays?
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: This is where you stay... A boat

text: moves to the door and tries it. It's definitely locked.
text: Through a small window, he can see the lights in the
text: sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime ELC sentries
text: patrolling the grounds. The DIESELS ROAR in the b.g.
text: Gordy turns back. Readjusts the grenade digging into his
text: belly, then hooks it back inside his pants. He turns off
text: the light. Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door.
text: THROUGH another small window, he can see it's dark in
dialog: this direction.
text: Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room.
text: We see some rubber tubing. We see some rope. Gordy
text: finally finds a piece of sharp metal. He moves to the

text: are getting out, including the Beaten Man. Felix meets
text: them. The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix. Felix
text: indicates Gordy's room. As the Beaten Man continues to
dialog: question Felix...
text: Gordy realizes he's fucked. He can't get through the
text: wall fast enough. His eyes go to water dripping from a
text: pipe leading to the washtub sink. He moves to it. Finds
text: the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. Cranks
text: shut the master valve on the pipe. Wraps his hands
text: around the pipe and pulls. Nothing. Jams his feet
text: against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... And
text: this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. He
text: finds the rubber hose. Fits an end over the pipe.

text: Gordy sneaks a peek out the window. The Beaten Man's
text: still questioning Felix. The sound of the hose water is
text: being covered by the DIESELS.
text: Gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole
text: he's made in the wall. He aims the stream at the hole.
text: Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even
text: harder... And watches the jet begin eating away at the
text: old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling
text: plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement.

scene_heading: 220 INT. STOREROOM 220
text: Gordy's made progress, but hasn't broken through yet.
dialog: And he won't, not in enough time. Under his breath --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Come on, baby... come on, baby...
dialog: And just then...
scene_heading: 221 EXT. PLANTATION 221
text: WHAM-WHAM-WHAM, one of the DIESELS Gordy repaired suffers
text: a spectacularly loud internal breakdown. The heat lights
text: dim in a row of sheds. Felix and the guerrillas stop to
text: see what's happening. At which point, the generator now
text: BURSTS into FLAMES.
dialog: 222 BACK TO GORDY 222
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Just in time...
dialog: And we realize that he'd planned on the diversion, as...
text: The water jet breaks through. The hole's still small.
text: Gordy begins to widen it.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: 223 EXT. PLANTATION 223
text: Felix, the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume
text: their march toward the storeroom.
text: They reach the storeroom. Water's pouring out under the
text: door. Felix unlocks the door and opens it to find...
scene_heading: 224 INT. STOREROOM 224
text: Gordy's gone. The Beaten Man signals two men to go out
dialog: the hole. To the other man --
speaker_heading: BEATEN MAN
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Organize the others. Find him.
text: The man goes. Outside, we hear him SHOUT orders to the
text: guerrillas guarding the plantation. The Beaten Man turns
text: to Felix. Felix is terrified. In a pleading tone --
speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: He can't be far. You'll catch --
text: BANG! The Beaten Man SHOOTS Felix in the head. Then
text: exits. OFF Felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water
text: still streaming across the floor...
scene_heading: 225 EXT. PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER 225
text: The guerrillas report to the Beaten Man. They can't find
dialog: Gordy. To the men guarding the plantation --
speaker_heading: BEATEN MAN
dialog: (in Spanish)
dialog: Keep looking.
text: He signals his men to come with him. They get into the
dialog: Suburban. Whereupon we FIND...
speaker_heading: 226 UNDER SUBURBAN 226
text: Gordy's hanging onto the chassis. With the large tires
text: and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to
text: get his legs over the rear axle. He's just finishing
text: rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the
text: rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other,
text: to support Gordy's back. He hears the ENGINE START,
text: grabs the transfer case, and...
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: 227 SUBURBAN 227
text: ROARS off with Gordy suspended below.
text: The rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly, inches from Gordy's
text: face. And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy-
text: duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of
text: the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's
text: legs. ROCKS are PINGING everywhere. The dirt and the
text: dust are choking. Even for a short distance, it's going
dialog: to be a long, dangerous ride.
scene_heading: 228 EXT. SUBURBAN (CAGUAN) - NIGHT 228
text: As the TRUCK BLASTS down back roads and through the
dialog: darkened town...
speaker_heading: 229 GORDY 229
text: continues to suffer underneath. Even with the rope
text: supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands.
text: A vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. It starts to
text: slip free. Gordy can't stop it without letting go. The
dialog: grenade falls, and...
text: Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. Barely. The spoon
text: just hanging on the end of his fingertips. Gordy can't
text: use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold
text: onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to
dialog: lose it. And just as it falls...
text: Gordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger
text: through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags
text: the grenade before it drops to the road. And then...
text: Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar
text: the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and
text: screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer
text: case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach,
text: where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back.
text: Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to
text: relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm.
scene_heading: 230 ABOVE GORDY'S WORLD 230
text: the Suburban passes the "Cine." The movie's over, just
text: letting out.
scene_heading: 231 EXT. GUERRILLA HOUSE - NIGHT 231
text: The Suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house Gordy saw
text: the night before. The men get out and go inside, leaving
text: the SUBURBAN RUNNING, clearly planning to leave again
dialog: right away.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: 232 GORDY 232
text: carefully lowers himself to the ground. Slides out on
text: the side away from the house. Hides behind a large
text: wheel. The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut
text: trees. Gordy watches the guards. When the guards aren't
text: looking, he runs to the nearest tree. The sounds of the
text: SUBURBAN'S ENGINE covers his footsteps.
speaker_heading: 233 TREES 233
text: Gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't
text: looking, when he reaches one tree, and...
speaker_heading: 234 NEW ANGLE 234
text: THUNK! A coconut hits the ground next to him, and...
text: One of the guards comes to investigate.
text: The guard gets closer. Gordy inches around the tree. He
text: can't get away without being seen. He nudges the coconut
text: with his toe. Nudges it harder, causing it slowly to
dialog: roll away, and...
text: The guard picks it up. Never sees Gordy in the shadow of
text: the tree, pressed against the trunk. The guard shows the
text: coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back.
speaker_heading: 235 GORDY 235
text: sneaks to another tree. Then reaches the house. He
text: moves to a window. Peers into a room. No one's there.
text: But we hear the sound of VOICES. Gordy creeps along the
text: wall. Looks into another room, and...
speaker_heading: 236 INSIDE 236
text: is a group of ELC guerrillas, including the Beaten Man,
text: packing suitcases, etc. Leaving in a hurry.
speaker_heading: 237 GORDY 237
text: scans the faces. Except for the Beaten Man, no face is
text: familiar. A man with his BACK TO us stands, and there's
dialog: nothing familiar about him, either. When...
speaker_heading: 238 ANOTHER ANGLE 238
text: Directly in front of us, another man emerges from a room.
text: He's also in ELC guerrilla camo.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: 238 CONTINUED: 238

scene_heading: 239 FLASHBACK - SURVEILLANCE TAPE 239
text: The face of the cop outside the consulate.
speaker_heading: 240 MAN (PRESENT) 240
text: in the room. His face looms larger as he ADVANCES
dialog: TOWARDS us.
scene_heading: 241 FLASHBACK - COP'S FACE 241
text: when he bumped into Gordy on E. 64th Street.
speaker_heading: 242 CLOSE ON MAN (PRESENT) 242
text: in the room. It's the same face.
dialog: 243 BACK TO GORDY 243
dialog: He's found The Wolf, when...
text: Suddenly, a guard appears, and...
text: Gordy freezes. Eases into the shadows. His dirty face
text: and clothes blend in just enough. The guard moves past.
scene_heading: 244 ANOTHER ANGLE 244
text: When the coast is clear, Gordy moves to the large propane
text: tank. He takes out the grenade. Puts the rubber bands
text: around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand,
text: holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then...
text: Slowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing
text: the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring-
dialog: loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now,
text: Gordy's going up in the blast.
text: Gordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands
dialog: stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're
text: barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it.
text: Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane
text: tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and
text: removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the
text: cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his
dialog: fingers. And...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: 244 CONTINUED: 244
text: Lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands. Gordy
text: squeezes out as much as he can onto them.
text: Then Gordy gets the hell out of there. He finds cover.
text: Ducks down. And waits.
scene_heading: 245 CLOSEUP - GRENADE 245
text: The lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands.
dialog: 246 BACK TO SCENE 246
text: Gordy suddenly hears a woman's gentle SINGING. He looks
text: in the direction of the sound, and...
text: Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching
text: on the road. She's singing a gentle song in Spanish.
text: Gordy's eyes flash with alarm. He glances at the house.
scene_heading: 247 CLOSEUP - GRENADE 247
text: The lighter fluid continues dissolving the rubber bands,
text: which are now beginning to lose their elasticity and
text: stretch from the pressure of the spoon.
text: 248 BACK TO SCENE 248

dialog: Get back!
scene_heading: 253 INSERT - GRENADE 253

speaker_heading: 257 GUARDS 257
text: STOP FIRING. Gordy's too close to the Woman and Boy now.
speaker_heading: 258 GORDY 258
text: reaches the Woman and Boy now. Pulls them down. Covers
text: them protectively with his body, when...
speaker_heading: 259 NEW ANGLE 259
text: KA-BOOM! A gigantic EXPLOSION lights up the night and
text: utterly destroys the house.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: 260 DEBRIS 260
text: rains down for what seems like forever. Dust fills the
dialog: air.
speaker_heading: 261 GORDY 261
text: opens his eyes. Gets to his hands and knees. Sees the
dialog: Woman and Boy are safe, when...
text: A vicious kick in the ribs lifts Gordy off the ground,
text: rolling him away from the Woman and child.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: You bastard!
text: The Wolf's alive and unhurt. Angrily punts Gordy again.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: You think you can kill The Wolf?!
text: A boot in the face this time.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: You think you can kill The Wolf?!
text: A piece of paper has fallen from one of Gordy's pockets
text: and fluttered to the ground nearby. The woman picks it
dialog: up, and we see...
text: It's the photo of Anne and Matt.
text: The woman stares at the photo a moment, as...
text: Gordy absorbs another blow. He tries to stand.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: You killed my wife and son --
text: Whack! The Wolf slams the butt of an AK-47 against
text: Gordy's skull. Gordy drops hard. The Wolf reverses the
text: AK. Points it at Gordy's head, about to pull the
dialog: trigger, when...
text: The Woman lays a hand on The Wolf's arm.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Claudio.
text: The Wolf doesn't take his eyes off Gordy. The Woman

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Claudio.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: 261 CONTINUED: 261
text: The Wolf glances over. Meets her eyes a moment. Sees
text: the photo in her hand. Glances up into her eyes again.
text: They hold the look. A whole conversation exchanged
text: without words. Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy, lying
text: in a pile on the ground. Beat. To Gordy --
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: You were just saved by your
dialog: guardian angel.
scene_heading: 262 INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY 262
text: Dark and dank. Excavated clay walls and floor. Heavy
text: door. A bare overhead bulb provides some light.
text: Gordy lies on a metal bed frame. One of his legs is
text: chained to the bed. He's in pain from being kicked --
dialog: but the physical aches are nothing compared to the
text: anguish he feels for having failed.
text: The door's unlocked and opens. Daylight streams in from
text: above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards.
text: He moves to the middle of the room. Looks at Gordy.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
text: One of the men in the jail with
dialog: you in Mompos is dying. He was
dialog: burned in your explosion.
text: Gordy just looks at him.
text: The Wolf signals a bodyguard, who crosses to Gordy and
text: frees his leg from the chain.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: You want to kill me? Come and
dialog: kill me.
text: The bodyguards are smiling. Gordy hesitates, then
dialog: springs for The Wolf, and...
text: The Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking
dialog: karate combination. The Wolf's no Jet Li -- his style's
text: a throwback, even ugly, but it's well-practiced and
text: brutally effective. Even still, Gordy springs back right
text: away... and The Wolf drops him again.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: You Americans think you have all
dialog: the answers. And really, you're
dialog: so naive...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: 262 CONTINUED: 262
text: Gordy comes up swinging. Gordy's a barroom fighter. If
dialog: he can touch you, you're in trouble. He never gets
text: close. A vicious front kick folds him, and a fist drives
text: him to the floor. The Wolf stands over him.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: ... You see one peasant with a
dialog: gun, and you never ask why he has
dialog: to have it. You just run to give
dialog: your billions to the nearest
dialog: soldiers, no matter how merciless
dialog: or corrupt they are.
text: The last kick really hurt Gordy. He's slow rising.
speaker_heading: THE WOLF
dialog: That's why I'm teaching America a
dialog: lesson... that's why there'll be
dialog: more bombs... and more families
dialog: like yours will pay the price.
text: The Wolf wants to pique him, but this is pouring gasoline
text: onto fire. Gordy explodes off the ground. The
text: suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard.
text: Gordy drives him backward. Slams him against a wall.
text: Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and
text: drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen.
text: All his weight behind the punches. Trying to break ribs
text: and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when...
text: A bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordy's kidneys.
text: Gordy takes the blow standing. The guard delivers a
text: second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in
text: agony. Beat. The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to
text: his midsection. And then...
text: He makes Gordy pay for the punches. Lands blow after
text: blow on Gordy's face. Beats the living shit out of
text: him... and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor.
speaker_heading: 263 BLACK 263
text: we hear a gentle CLACKING sound. It's unidentifiable.
speaker_heading: 264 GORDY'S POV 264
text: The black becomes a BLUR. The BLUR becomes a hazy
text: glimpse of Selena. She's sitting on the metal bed frame
text: nursing Gordy's wounds. The CLACKING sound CONTINUES --

speaker_heading: 267 GORDY'S POV 267
text: This time, when Gordy opens his eyes, there's no

speaker_heading: SELENA

speaker_heading: GORDY

speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Claudio used to be a teacher. I

scene_heading: 318 EXT. RIVER - DAWN 318

speaker_heading: BRANDT

speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: He takes his time. Like he told

scene_heading: 367 EXT. STREET 367
text: Claudio GUNS the BIKE down the second street, parallel to
text: Gordy's alley. He and Selena reach an intersection with

text: Gordy veers into a walkway between buildings.
scene_heading: 369 EXT. STREET 369
text: A parked car suddenly pulls out in front of the speeding

scene_heading: 370 EXT. TOWN HOUSE - BACK YARD 370

scene_heading: 372 INT. TOWN HOUSE GARAGE 372
text: Gordy blows into the second story of the garage, a

scene_heading: 373 EXT. STREET 373
text: The Ducati tears around traffic, when...
text: Gordy leaps out of the hayloft, launches himself off a

text: He just manages to grab Selena and yank her off the bike.
text: Selena's arms are wrapped around Claudio -- when Gordy
text: rips her out of the saddle, Claudio goes, too. The three
text: of them tumble to the ground as the speeding Ducati
text: spins, flips and disintegrates.
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: 374 CLAUDIO 374
text: in leathers and a helmet. He takes the fall better than

text: him. They grapple. Gordy pounds Claudio hard. Once.
dialog: Twice. When...
speaker_heading: 375 SELENA 375
text: side-kicks Gordy. He sags. She front-kicks a heel into
text: his spine and between his shoulder blades. Gordy lets go

dialog: repeatedly as...
speaker_heading: 376 CLAUDIO 376

dialog: Gordy's head, and BANG!
speaker_heading: 377 DRAY 377

scene_heading: 383 EXT. WALKWAY 383

text: through a gate into...
scene_heading: 384 EXT. ANOTHER TOWN HOUSE - BACK YARD 384
text: A shovel lies in the grass. Selena scoops it up and in
text: one motion, spins back toward the gate, launches it
text: blade-first with all her strength, timing it perfectly,
text: as Gordy runs through the gate, and...
speaker_heading: 385 GORDY 385
text: just barely evades the sharp shovel edge headed for his

text: breaks toward an open door of the house.
scene_heading: 386 INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS 386
text: Selena blasts into the bottom floor, runs through a
text: playroom. Gordy's right behind her.
speaker_heading: 387 SELENA 387
text: mounts a stairwell. A girl's descending. Selena grabs a
text: pigtail and flings her down the stairs, and...
speaker_heading: 388 GORDY 388
text: gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from
text: falling all the way to the bottom. He sits the uninjured
text: girl down and continues on.
speaker_heading: 389 SELENA 389
text: runs toward the living room, which is undergoing a
text: renovation. Without stopping, she tears through the
text: plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the
text: rest of the house. She topples what she can into
text: Gordy's way. Throws nails down behind her. Grabs a
text: circular saw and hurls it back at Gordy, just missing him
text: and shattering a large wall mirror.
dialog: Selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever
text: weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield --
text: this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as
text: she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway.
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: 390 ARCHWAY 390

dialog: second and falls.
speaker_heading: 391 SELENA 391
text: blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming
text: into a Hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all

scene_heading: 396 INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS 396

speaker_heading: 397 WOMAN 397

speaker_heading: 401 OMITTED 401
scene_heading: 402 EXT. TOWN HOUSE - ROOF/ADJOINING ROOFTOPS 402

text: to the next town house roof.
text: Gordy hits the roof behind her.
speaker_heading: 403 SELENA 403
text: As Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of
text: town houses, we see her warrior determination and
dialog: discipline. She's thinking ahead and she never
text: hesitates. Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally
text: well-trained and determined firefighter. And
text: he's not far back. One tumble, and he'll catch her.
text: Selena strains harder.
speaker_heading: 404 SELENA 404
text: vaults a gap. Moments later, Gordy vaults it.
speaker_heading: 405 SELENA 405
text: finally runs out of roof. She looks down. A fire escape
text: ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard
text: of a small foreign embassy. Still holding the crowbar,
text: Selena takes the ladder down.
dialog: 128.
scene_heading: 405A MOMENTS LATER 405A
text: Gordy reaches the ladder. Selena's ahead of him by a
text: floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. Gordy doesn't
text: fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the
text: roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands,
text: squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets
text: gravity take over.
scene_heading: 406 EXT. EMBASSY - COURTYARD 406
text: The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony
text: running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin
text: staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where,
text: across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate
text: opens onto the street.
text: Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena. He
text: grabs her. Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm.
text: Gordy has to let go. Selena heads for the stairs leading
text: to the ground.
speaker_heading: 407 GORDY'S 407
dialog: got one chance to intercept Selena. The balcony's too
text: high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with
text: trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either.
text: Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife
text: and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a
dialog: living.
text: Gordy runs down the balcony. Gains speed. Jumps.
text: Launches off the balcony railing. And hurtles himself at
text: the trunk of a medium-sized tree. He hits the trunk.
text: Hangs on. And slides to the ground. And now...
scene_heading: 408 ANOTHER ANGLE 408
text: He's between Selena and the only way out. And there's no
text: way she's getting past him.
text: But that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with
text: the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of
text: the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can.
text: It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling
text: garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the
text: crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over,
text: the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard.
text: Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit.
text: It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg.
text: It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his
text: feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: 408 CONTINUED: 408
dialog: Gordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all
text: dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and
text: then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy
text: stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate.
text: Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can
text: across the slate pavers, and...
text: The can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She
text: falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to
dialog: run, when...
text: Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a
text: brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm
text: around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks
text: backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing
dialog: whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's
dialog: not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have
dialog: to kill him before he'd let go.
text: Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around
text: Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller
text: woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till
text: she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of
text: the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do
text: is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the
text: courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped
text: with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses
dialog: in her ear --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: You killed them.
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: (beat; with
dialog: contempt)
dialog: One woman, one boy -- they mean
dialog: nothing next to the thousands
dialog: who've been slain.
text: Gordy hears it. It only drives him to a deeper fury.
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: They were my family.
text: Gordy's blind with rage. Chokes her neck hard.
text: Summoning all the power in him, first to shut off her air
text: and blood, and then to continue squeezing, relishing her
text: every dying moment, until he's snuffed out the life of
dialog: the person who took Anne and Matt from him. And...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: 408 CONTINUED: (2) 408
dialog: He can't... it's all he's wanted since he saw Anne and

text: her world, into Brandt's world, into the brutal nightmare
dialog: destroying Colombia and all the places like it, and becomes
dialog: part of that sadness and death... And...
text: Gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe.
text: Selena gasps for air. The impulse to murder has left
dialog: Gordy. There's a new resolve...
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: The killing ends here.
dialog: Beat. Selena pants.
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: It will never end.
speaker_heading: 409 NEW ANGLE 409
text: Under which an EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD emerges from the
text: building. He sees Gordy and Selena -- a large man
text: holding a smaller woman in a chokehold. Draws his gun.
scene_heading: EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Let her go!
text: Gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun.
text: Selena screams.
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: Please help me!
scene_heading: EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Let her go!
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: No. You don't understand.
speaker_heading: SELENA
dialog: He's trying to kill me!
scene_heading: EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Let her go, or you're dead!
text: He's going to shoot. Gordy has no choice. As he lets
dialog: Selena go and stands --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: Hold us both till the police get
dialog: here.
dialog: 131.
scene_heading: 410 ANOTHER ANGLE 410
text: It's too late. Selena stomps a heel into the Guard's
text: knee, crushing it, then twists the gun from his hands.
text: She points it at him and pulls the trigger, and...
text: In his agitation, the guard never took the safety off.
text: Selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety.
scene_heading: 411 ANOTHER ANGLE 41
text: In the same moment, Gordy grabs the crowbar from the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: 412 SELENA 412
text: flicks off the safety and points the gun again.
speaker_heading: 413 GORDY 413
text: hurls the crowbar with all his might, and...
speaker_heading: 414 NEW ANGLE 414
text: The GUN FIRES, just as the crowbar hits Selena, spoiling
text: her aim. The bullet creases the guard's arm. Selena
text: recovers. And the next BULLET...
scene_heading: 415 ANOTHER ANGLE 415
dialog: Isn't hers. It's from Phipps' GUN. It takes Selena in
text: the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way
text: through her body. She's dead on her feet. Her body
text: crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large
text: pool that quickly spreads over the slate.
scene_heading: 416 OTHER AGENTS 416
text: move in to help the guard as Phipps holsters his pistol.
text: He walks to Gordy. The two men share a long, silent
text: look. It's over. Gordy looks again at Selena's body in
text: its pool of blood. Then turns and goes.
speaker_heading: 417 BRANDT'S 417
text: entering the courtyard as Gordy walks out. Brandt's seen
text: Selena. He's smiling.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: 417 CONTINUED: 417
speaker_heading: BRANDT
dialog: We got the bitch.
text: Gordy hits him. One of the jackhammer blows he slammed
text: into Claudio in the bunker. A hard fist deep in the gut
text: that drives all the wind from Brandt and drops him to his
text: knees. Beat. Gordy's voice is cold and hard --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: You're no better than she is.
dialog: And Gordy goes.
scene_heading: 418 INT. FIREHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 418
text: Gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker. He's

text: dollop into a bowl.
scene_heading: 419 INT. FIREHOUSE - TRUCK BAY 419
text: Gordy hands the bowl to Mauro, who's playing in the front
text: seat of the pumper. Mauro tastes it. Thumbs up. Gordy
dialog: smiles.
text: Mike and the other men on Gordy's old shift are watching.
dialog: To Gordy --
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It'll be good to get you back.
text: Gordy turns to them. Looks into the faces of these men,
dialog: the people closest to him in the world. Beat. Then --
speaker_heading: GORDY
dialog: It's good to be home.
text: Gordy's still in pain, still missing the wife and son
dialog: he'll never see again. But Gordy's gonna be alright.
dialog: Mauro's gonna be with him. There'll be fires to put out
dialog: and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude
dialog: of miseries and joys the firefighters in Spanish Harlem
dialog: see each and every day.
text: As we PULL BACK, OUT and AWAY from the old brick edifice
text: from which the big red truck will come, bringing help...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
