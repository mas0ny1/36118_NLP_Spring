speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Mrs. Harding-
speaker_heading: LAVONA
dialog: Lavona. It’s Lavona-
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Sorry. There’s no smoking on the ice.
speaker_heading: LAVONA
dialog: Oh... I’11 smoke it quietly then. This

speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Mrs. Harding. I told you on-
speaker_heading: LAVONA
dialog: I know what you told me. And it’s
dialog: Lavona. Only you never seen her skate.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: I don’t train beginners.
speaker_heading: LAVONA
text: All she does is talk about skating.
dialog: All day, all night. I can’t make
dialog: her shut up about it. So it’s
dialog: easier puttin’ her on ice if you
dialog: know what I mean. We figure with
dialog: the right training she can make the
dialog: most of her gift. Like Ice Capades
dialog: maybe one day or something.
text: Diane looks down at the little girl.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: How old are you, honey?
speaker_heading: LAVONA
dialog: She’s a soft 4.

speaker_heading: LAVONA (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you even trying. Cause there's

dialog: Concentrate. Is that what you call a
dialog: clean skate, for Christ sake?
speaker_heading: SKATER MOM
dialog: Could you not swear in front of the

dialog: stay on the ice and skate.
text: The other girl heads off. Tonya looks toward the bathroom.
speaker_heading: LAVONA (CONT’D)
dialog: Get over here.
text: Tonya recognizes the look on her mother’s face. She skates
text: backward, away from Lavona.
speaker_heading: LAVONA (CONT’D)
dialog: You’1l have to come off the ice
dialog: sometime. Ya hear me? I’1l be right
dialog: here waiting.
text: Tonya knows this is true. She puts all her attention on the ice.
text: Then she twirls IMPOSSIBLY HIGH, landing perfectly.
text: Tonya stops suddenly. She drops her head. Urine runs down
text: Tonya’s leg.
text: Tonya looks to Lavona who crosses her arms & watches coldly.
speaker_heading: LAVONA (CONT’D)
dialog: Skate wet.
scene_heading: INT. HARDING HOME - DAY - CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY LAVONA 15

scene_heading: INT. HARDING HOME - DAY - CLOSE ON: MODERN DAY LAVONA 20
speaker_heading: LAVONA
dialog: The thing about Tonya was, she skated
dialog: better when she was enraged. If there
dialog: was no “You can’t do it” type of
dialog: thing, she wouldn’t do it.
text: The bird poops on Lavona’s shoulder. Lavona keeps on talking.
speaker_heading: LAVONA (CONT’D)
dialog: On the ice, I was there to inspire

speaker_heading: TONYA
dialog: When I get older I’m gonna work in an

speaker_heading: AL
dialog: I thought you wanted to do Ice

speaker_heading: TONYA
dialog: I can do both. Yesterday mom made me
dialog: wear my skating costume to school. The
text: red one with the tassels. Everyone
dialog: made fun of me.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Why’d she do that?
speaker_heading: TONYA
dialog: Cause they were taking school pictures
dialog: and she said we could use the samples
dialog: for competitions. I told mom that

text: Lavona ignores her.
speaker_heading: LAVONA
dialog: What does she need a fucking fur coat
dialog: for? I don’t have a fucking fur coat.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Because it’s not just skating. The
dialog: judges want figure skaters to be-
speaker_heading: LAVONA
dialog: Rich, prissy, a-holes-
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Well rounded. It’s a question of
dialog: fitting in.
speaker_heading: LAVONA
dialog: She's 12 and she lands fucking

dialog: stands out.
speaker_heading: DIANE
text: She stands out because she looks like

dialog: money away so she can fit in with
dialog: these little shits. You can dress up a
dialog: pig however you want, ya know what I’m
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: It’s not about fitting in. It’s about
text: how she’s growing up.
speaker_heading: LAVONA

speaker_heading: TONYA

speaker_heading: AL
dialog: I’m gonna be working 12 hour night

speaker_heading: TONYA
dialog: You could if you want to.

speaker_heading: AL

speaker_heading: AL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TONYA
dialog: You’re not gonna leave me here...
text: He stares ahead.
speaker_heading: TONYA (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad. .?
text: He drives off. She watches his truck till it’s out of sight.
speaker_heading: TONYA (CONT'D)
dialog: Take me with you!!
text: Lavona watches silently. Then goes inside and shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. PRACTICE RINK - OREGON - DAY 29
text: CLOSE ON: The razor sharp edge of Tonya’s skate racing at

text: Tonya, 15, (now played by the same actress who plays modern day
text: Tonya) with short curly hair and braces, prepares for a tricky
text: jump but another skater crosses nearby. Tonya STOPS, skates over

speaker_heading: TONYA
dialog: You're. In. My. Way.
text: Cowed, the other skater moves aside. Then Tonya JUMPS.

speaker_heading: JEFF (V.O.)
dialog: I was young. And I had no game
dialog: whatsoever.
text: Jeff, nervous, all thumbs, tries to appear super cool:
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: So... do you like food?
text: Tonya hesitates, then nods. In the background, Lavona stops
text: pouring a drink and watches.
scene_heading: INT. HARDING HOME - BATHROOM - DAY 32
text: Tonya uses a curling iron while applying blue eye shadow. Her
text: stepbrother CHRIS, late 20’s, watches, hand on his crotch.
speaker_heading: TONYA (V.O.)
dialog: Back then my step-brother Creepy Chris
dialog: was living with us. I remember Jeff
dialog: and my’s first date cause I had Creepy
dialog: Chris arrested earlier that day.
text: Creepy Chris moves closer, his hands slowly cupping her breasts.

dialog: with it.
scene_heading: INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - DAY 33
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Jeff did consult me regarding
dialog: Tonya. He asked me what I thought
dialog: and I said, ‘Go for it man.’ Not to
