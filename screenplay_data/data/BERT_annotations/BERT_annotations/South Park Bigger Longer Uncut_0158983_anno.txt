dialog: January 21, 1999
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Very happy, Disneyesque MUSIC swirls in.
text: PAN DOWN from a pretty blue sky, to a small quaint town
text: nestled in the hills. A wooden sign tells us this is South
dialog: Park.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
text: Birds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as
text: they walk by.
text: It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off
text: from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'.
text: A little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He
text: is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes
text: and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'm going to the movies
dialog: To see the brighter side of life!
dialog: I'm going to the movie
dialog: Everything's gonna be alright!
dialog: Forget all my troubles
dialog: Put my own life on hold
dialog: Let a studio tell me
dialog: how I should view the world
dialog: Where everything works out
dialog: I love it that way
dialog: I'm going to the movies
dialog: The movies today!
text: Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes
dialog: off. BRRRRRTTT!!!
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER
dialog: Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty
dialog: a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses
dialog: and water the cows!!
text: From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his
text: bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet.
text: We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his
text: closet and pulls out an orange coat.
text: The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the
text: hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.
speaker_heading: MOTHER (O.S.)
text: KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!!
text: This boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have
text: no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and
text: hazel eyes.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mph rmph rm!
scene_heading: INT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
text: Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the
text: kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are
text: sitting at the humble table.
scene_heading: KENNY'S MOTHER
dialog: Sit down, you can share some of your
text: brother's waffle.
text: The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Kenny opens the door to find Stan.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is
dialog: out! You wanna come?!
text: Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new
text: Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes
dialog: light up.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mph rmph rm, rmph!
text: Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.
scene_heading: KENNY'S MOTHER
dialog: Kenny! Where're you going?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mph mprh mprh rm!
scene_heading: KENNY'S MOTHER
dialog: What do you mean you don't want to go to
dialog: church?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph.
text: Kenny and Stan walk down the street.
scene_heading: KENNY'S MOTHER
dialog: Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And
dialog: then when you die and go to hell you can
dialog: ANSWER TO SATAN!!
text: Dramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And
text: then walks off with Stan anyway.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
text: Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the
text: happy beat.
text: TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his
text: Rhinoplasty office.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Say, where are you boys going?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We're going to the movies!
dialog: To see the brighter side of life!

scene_heading: EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Kenny and Stan knock at the door.
text: A handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go
dialog: to church, Kenny?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Kyle, check it out.
text: Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: OH MY GOD, DUDE!!!
text: Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then,
text: Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian
text: boy bounces up next to him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No, Ike! You can't come with me!
text: Kyle's MOTHER, a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Kyle, you take your little brother out to
dialog: play with you!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Aw, ma!!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Do as I say, Kyle!
text: Kyle's mother closes the door.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Damn it!!
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY
text: Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the
text: street and sing in unison.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: We're going to the movies
dialog: To see the better side of life
dialog: Where something interesting happens
dialog: Every day and night!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: In movies we can pretend
dialog: That love is real
dialog: and good always wins-
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We can even make believe marriages
dialog: last!
text: A HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY
dialog: Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar?
text: Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy
text: suddenly jumps up.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY
dialog: I'm going to the movies!
dialog: To see the brighter side of life!
dialog: I'm going to the movies
dialog: Everything's gonna be alright!

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Let's go get fat ass!
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY
dialog: This house looks just like all the others.
scene_heading: INT. THAT SAME HOUSE
text: CLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches
text: into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises
dialog: them --
text: BOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN
text: who chows down on the chips.
text: Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch,
text: eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television.
text: The doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
text: MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!
text: CARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque
text: (except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns
text: with Stan, Kyle and Kenny.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Look, Eric it's your little friends.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: What the hell are you guys doing here?
speaker_heading: IKE
dialog: Baba turtre bad!
text: Kyle holds up the newspaper ad.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Ooh!
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE
text: Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and
dialog: singing.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: We're going to the movies
dialog: To see the better side of life!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Maybe there'll be pirates!
dialog: Or a whole city burnin'!
dialog: Maybe we'll see a monster
dialog: Or, better yet, Uma Thurman!
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: We're going to the movies!
dialog: Everything's gonna be okay!
text: The boys skip out of frame.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
text: The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South
dialog: Park buildings.
text: The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Going to the movies!
dialog: The movies today!!!!!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Can I get five tickets to Terrance and
dialog: Phillip Asses of Fire, please?
speaker_heading: TICKET GUY
dialog: No.
text: Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film
text: comes to an ABRUPT HALT.
text: The boys look confused.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What'dya mean, no?
speaker_heading: TICKET GUY
dialog: Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is
dialog: rated 'R'. You kids can't get in.
text: The boys look shocked. They just stand there, in silence.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: The hell we can't! My money is just as
dialog: good as any white person's!
speaker_heading: TICKET GUY
dialog: You have to be accompanied by a parent or
dialog: guardian.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: But why?
speaker_heading: TICKET GUY
dialog: Because this movie has naughty language,
dialog: and it might make you kids start using
dialog: bad words.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't
dialog: let us in to see this movie I'm gonna
dialog: kick you square in the nuts.
speaker_heading: TICKET GUY
dialog: Sorry, Charlie.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Damn it!
speaker_heading: TICKET GUY
dialog: Next, please?
text: A few TEENAGERS walk up to get their tickets. The boys step
dialog: aside.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: This is terrible! This can't be
dialog: happening!!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that
dialog: good anyway.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Cartman! What the hell are you talking
dialog: about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it
dialog: probably can't sustain itself over ninety
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: IKE
dialog: Poo baba!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Wait! I've got an idea!
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - A LITTLE LATER
text: The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the
text: Ticket Guy with the boys.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY
dialog: Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance
dialog: and Phillip Asses of Fire.
speaker_heading: TICKET GUY
dialog: You realize this movie is rated R? It may
dialog: not be appropriate for your little ones.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (Turning to boys)
dialog: Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to
dialog: buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten
dialog: bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of
dialog: Vodka and not forget about how miserable
dialog: your life is and not stop the voices in
dialog: your head then go right ahead.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS GUY
dialog: Five tickets please.
text: The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
text: The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge
text: tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink.
speaker_heading: IKE

scene_heading: ANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN
text: A TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire'
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: HOORAY!!!
text: On the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome
text: Canadian star with a great body.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest
dialog: say to the Uranian gynecologist?
text: PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally
text: handsome in a more rugged way.
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: I don't know, Phillip, what?
text: Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - BOYS
text: Laughing their asses off.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That was sweet!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Where do they come up with this stuff?!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN

speaker_heading: ANGLE - BOYS
speaker_heading: KYLE

dialog: said?
speaker_heading: ANGLE - SCREEN
text: Terrance pulls out a white envelope.
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I
dialog: just got a letter!
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: A letter from who, you shit sucking cock
dialog: master?
text: TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from
text: the film enters their innocent ears.
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: It's from your mother.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever
dialog: tell my son that I licked your hairy
dialog: balls.'
text: Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Oh, you fucking ball whore!
text: The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy
dialog: taking it all in.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Wow... Ball whore...

text: The song ends and the boys erupt into applause.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

dialog: Unclefucka!!
scene_heading: EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY
text: All the children of South Park are gathered at the pond for
dialog: ice skating.
text: The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the
dialog: Charlie Brown Christmas special.
text: Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and
text: joyous music plays.
text: The boys walk up to the pond.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: Hey, where have you guys been all day?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Oh, nowhere... We just went out to go see
text: the TERRANCE AND PHILLIP MOVIE!
text: All the kids gasp! Dramatic MUSIC STING.
speaker_heading: BEBE
dialog: You saw it?!
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: How'd you get in?!
text: Suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys. They're
dialog: like celebrities.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Hey! Stop crowding us you shitfaced
dialog: cockmasters!
text: All the kids stop, wide eyed. As if they've just hear the
dialog: voice of God.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Wowwww...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming
dialog: unclefuckers.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Ooooohhh!!!
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: (To another kid)
dialog: We HAVE to see this movie, dude.
text: The other kids nod.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance
dialog: called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal
dialog: wart! Stan? Stan?
text: But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating
text: gracefully, is little eight year old WENDY TESTABURGER.
text: The heavens part, a CHOIR OF ANGELS sing, as Wendy skates
text: around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple
dialog: Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's.
text: All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all
dialog: stop to admire her.
text: Stan's smile grows wider and wider. Kyle turns to see what
text: he's looking at.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Thank my lucky stars
dialog: Here before me now
dialog: Is everything I'd ever hoped for
dialog: Knew it in a word
dialog: Saw it in a glance
dialog: The only thing I think I'd die
dialog: for...
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that
dialog: fucking song again.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - WENDY
text: Spinning and soaring in slo-mo. Effortlessly covering every
text: inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers.
text: Stan is slack-jawed.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I can't stop now
dialog: My heart's awake
dialog: I pray her arms
dialog: my arms to take
dialog: So this is why I'm ali-
text: Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel
text: landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face
text: and abruptly ending his song.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hi, Stan!
text: Stan vomits profusely all over himself.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Ew! Gross!
text: Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's
text: face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight
text: year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He
text: speaks with a rich English accent.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly
dialog: brush.
text: Stan looks at Gregory.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Who are you, kid?
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's
dialog: counter-cousin for some time.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Want to skate with us?
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: We've been skating all morning. And
text: laughing and talking of memories past.
text: Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to
dialog: get Wendy's attention.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: That's nice, Stan.
text: Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new
dialog: guy?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: She's not my girlfriend, dude!
text: Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around
dialog: Cartman.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip
dialog: movie. Who wants to touch me? I said,
dialog: "Who wants to touch me?!"
text: A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: SMALL BOY
dialog: Oooooh...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING
text: Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which
text: consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background.
dialog: It's a brand new day.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY
text: The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two
dialog: mountain peaks.
scene_heading: INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY
text: The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: Shut your fucking face,
dialog: Unclefucka!!
dialog: You're a shitsucking, cocksucking
dialog: Unclefucka!!
text: The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down.
text: CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to
dialog: be speaking.
speaker_heading: MR. HAT
dialog: Okay, children, let's take our seats.
text: As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the
text: puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year
text: old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
dialog: We have a lot to learn and precious
dialog: little time.
text: Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single
text: one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt,
dialog: except, of course, for Wendy.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of
dialog: Sigfried and Roy?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison,
dialog: it's Terrance and Phillip.
speaker_heading: KIDS
text: TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!
text: Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan
text: sulks.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Well, anyway... Today children, our
dialog: friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all
dialog: about the environment.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
dialog: That's right, Mr. Garrison. The
dialog: environment is what surrounds us. It is
dialog: what we live and breathe.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: I hate the environment.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Dude, how can you hate the environment?
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: 'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and
dialog: fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
dialog: The kids all GASP!
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Fragile?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You
dialog: can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Kyle!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Why the fuck not?
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Eric!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Dude, you just said fuck again.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Stanly!
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mph.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Kenny!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip
dialog: can say something, I should be able to
dialog: say it too!
speaker_heading: BEBE
dialog: Wow, Cartman's cool!
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: He's like Terrance and Phillip!
text: Cartman gloats proudly.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Fuckin' a right.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: How would you like to go to the
dialog: principal's office?
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
text: Mr. Garrison is in shock.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: I said -
text: Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it
text: to his mouth. It feeds back horribly.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: (Through megaphone)
text: HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GARGLE RAT JIZ?!
text: Garrison is floored.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Oh, dude we are fucked now.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw
dialog: the Terrance and Phillip movie!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
text: Just then, the Principal walks in. She is PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,
text: a frizzy haired woman of about forty.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: I am VERY disappointed in you boys!
dialog: You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've
dialog: already called in your parents, but first
dialog: I want you to THINK about what you've
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?
speaker_heading: PRINCPAL VICTORIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: What's the big fucking deal?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: AGH!! I want to know where you heard
dialog: these horrific obscenities!
text: The boys look at each other.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Nowhere.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few
dialog: times before...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison
dialog: ever said-
dialog: (Reading)
dialog: 'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass
dialog: spelunker' in school!
text: The boys all laugh.
text: But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's
text: mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Oh, oh...
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: Thank you all for coming on such short
dialog: notice. As you can see, your boys are all
dialog: being disciplined.
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: This just isn't like you, Stanley!
text: Stan looks down at the floor.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: What did my son say, Principal Victoria?
dialog: Did he say the S word?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: No, it was worse than that...
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: (Gasping)
dialog: The F word?!
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: No, worse. Here's a short list of the
dialog: things they've been saying.
text: The mothers look over the sheet of paper. Immediately, their
text: eyes bulge.
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Oh dear God...
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: What is 'fisting'?
speaker_heading: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
text: That's when the fist is inserted into the
dialog: anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.
text: The two moms stare at Ms. Cartman.

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: CARTMAN

speaker_heading: STAN

speaker_heading: CARTMAN

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt!
dialog: Not again!
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: What is Terrance and Phillip?
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Terrance and Phillip are two VERY
text: untalented, unfunny actors from Canada.
text: Their TV show is filled with toilet humor
dialog: and bad language and is just complete
dialog: garbage. Now it appears they have a
dialog: movie and I'm positive it's not suitable
dialog: for children!
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: Well, it looks like I'll have to send a
dialog: warning letter out to parents. I have to
dialog: put a stop to this before MORE children
dialog: see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Everybody's already fucking seen it.
speaker_heading: MS. CARTMAN
dialog: Eric!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie
dialog: has warped my fragile little mind.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and
dialog: let us adults speak.
text: The boys get up and walk out. Kyle's mother slams the door
text: behind them.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: We must take action on this immediately.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give
dialog: detention to those boys.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Forgive me for saying so, Principal
dialog: Victoria, but your methods are too...
dialog: Shall we say... soft? As head of the
dialog: PTA, I am exercising my right under
dialog: article 42 of the PTA code.
text: A look of shock comes over the principal's face.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: Article 42! You don't mean-?!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is
dialog: impeaching you.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
dialog: But I-
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: You are officially relieved of your

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER

speaker_heading: KIDS

scene_heading: Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI
dialog: And the devastating impact of the
dialog: Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and
dialog: Phillip's new hit song, "Shut Your
dialog: Fucking Face, Unclefucka" which has
dialog: climbed the charts with a bullet --
text: We see a clip from the video, "Unclefucka."
text: The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and
text: Puffy in that video they did in Vegas. They wear shiny

scene_heading: TERRANCE &amp; PHILLIP

dialog: Shut your fucking face!
dialog: Unclefucka!!
scene_heading: INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
text: The news anchor shakes his head in disgust.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: Thanks, midget. Shocking report. The
dialog: controversy surrounding the Terrance and
text: Phillip movie began in the small mountain
dialog: town of South Park, Colorado where the
dialog: local PTA banned the movie. With us
dialog: tonight is the head of the South Park
dialog: PTA, Sheila Brofloski-
text: A screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed. The
text: TITLE below her reads 'Outraged Mother'.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing
dialog: this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or
dialog: is it Canada?
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Canada!
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the
dialog: Canadian Minister of Movies.
text: A split screen appears, Kyle's mother on one side, and a
text: goofy looking Canadian slides into the other.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: Thank you, Minister, for joining us.
scene_heading: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
dialog: Thanks for having me, buddy.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: Minister, parents all over America are
dialog: concerned about your country's
dialog: entertainment. Your thoughts?
scene_heading: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
dialog: Well, the film is R rated, and it's not
dialog: intended for children-
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Oh but OF COURSE children are going to
dialog: see it!!
scene_heading: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
dialog: Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The
dialog: fact is that we Canadians are quite
dialog: surprised by your outrage-
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
scene_heading: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
dialog: Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The
text: United States has graphic images of
dialog: violence on television all the time, what
dialog: is that one show? COPS? And car crashes
dialog: caught on tape? We can't believe that a
dialog: movie with some foul language and fart
dialog: jokes would piss you off so much.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
scene_heading: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
dialog: Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ...
dialog: ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: But minister, it isn't like this film is
dialog: the first troublesome thing to come out
dialog: of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams
dialog: a few decades ago.
dialog: The Minister thinks.
scene_heading: CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: The Canadians are just mad that we
dialog: mothers here in South Park have the
dialog: chutzpah to stand up to them! Like it or
dialog: not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children
dialog: are now safe from your Canadian smut!
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
text: The boys are in the front row, this time with Wendy, watching

speaker_heading: TERRANCE

speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a
dialog: boner biting dick fart fuck face!
text: The boys laugh merrily. Wendy just looks bored.
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: Say Phillip, want to see the Northern
dialog: Lights?
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: You bet, Terrance!
text: Terrance pulls out a match, lights it, then farts.
text: The flame burns Terrance to a blackened mass.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by
dialog: lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: (Just a skull)

speaker_heading: STAN

dialog: can't do that.
speaker_heading: KENNY
speaker_heading: Mph rmpmh rm.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Stan... I think you and I need some time
dialog: apart.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: WHAT?!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Oh shit.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: It's just... It's obvious that we don't
dialog: have a whole lot in common anymore. I
dialog: need somebody who's... a little deeper.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: But Wendy, I can go-
text: Wendy places her little gloved hand over Stan's mouth.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No. Don't speak. You'll only make things
dialog: more annoying. Goodbye, Stan.
text: And just like that, Wendy is gone. Stan looks almost ready to
dialog: cry.
text: Kyle walks up behind Stan.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance
dialog: and Phillip is funny can fuck off
dialog: anyways.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (Insincere)
dialog: Yeah...
text: The boys walk off.
speaker_heading: KENNY

speaker_heading: CARTMAN

speaker_heading: KENNY

text: Kenny pulls out a book of matches.
text: He strikes a match and holds it under his ass.
text: After a few seconds Kenny farts, and there is a little flame.
text: Suddenly, the flames catch and Kenny starts burning alive.
speaker_heading: KENNY
text: MMMPMMPH!!! MGMFEODFO!!!

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

speaker_heading: DOCTOR GAUCHE
text: Try to untangle his trachea and
dialog: esophagus!
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Right!
text: While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso,
text: the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his
text: windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside
text: out in the process.
text: Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor
text: and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GAUCHE
dialog: No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!!
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Watch his liver!!!
text: Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the

speaker_heading: DOCTOR GAUCHE
dialog: We have precious little time left people!
dialog: We're going to lose him soon!!

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Doctor, his heart's stopped!
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GAUCHE
dialog: Crack him. Let's get it out of there!!!
text: Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GAUCHE
dialog: We need to zap this, quick!
text: And runs it to the microwave. He opens the door.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GAUCHE
dialog: Who's making a potato?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2

speaker_heading: DOCTOR GAUCHE

scene_heading: KENNY'S MOTHER

text: ZOOM IN on Kenny's dead face. We pass into his thoughs...
dialog: FLASH!!
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE -
text: Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL
text: SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens.
text: *note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body,
text: this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI.
text: Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears
text: warm and inviting.
text: Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down
text: in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them.
text: Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and
text: bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost
text: close enough to the light to touch it.
text: Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'.
text: Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to
text: a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to
text: become darker and more twisted.
text: Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled
text: with flames and heat.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mph rmph rm!
text: Burning souls SCREAM and CRY all around Kenny, as his body
text: plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell.
text: Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and

text: He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of
text: whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

speaker_heading: CANADIAN AMBASSADOR

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER

speaker_heading: CANADIAN AMBASSADOR

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD

speaker_heading: CARTMAN

scene_heading: INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The boys walk into Cartman's house. Cartman slams the door

speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This

speaker_heading: KYLE

dialog: Poofs, tubby-
text: But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the

text: them, silently.
text: Everyone just sits there for a second. The lighting on Kyle's

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Boys, we have to have a difficult
dialog: discussion.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: We already know what you did. We saw it

speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and
dialog: Phillip?
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Stanly, you're too young to understand
dialog: what's good for you. That's why we

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: But they fucking didn't do anything

speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Yeah! And what rim job expert went and

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: I know what it is!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: (To his mother)
dialog: Lick someone's ass?!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: The Terrance and Phillip movie has
dialog: obviously done irreparable damage to
dialog: their brains. We have to put them in
text: rehab right away.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: You boys need help. There are rehab
dialog: centers that specialize in treating
dialog: people with chronic addictions to bad
dialog: language.
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: There are?
text: Kyle's mother thinks for a second.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER

speaker_heading: CARTMAN

speaker_heading: KENNY

speaker_heading: MR. MACKEY

text: The parents are fascinated.
speaker_heading: STAN'S FATHER
dialog: Now wait a minute, are you telling us
dialog: that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid

speaker_heading: CARTMAN

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

dialog: Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance...
dialog: It's probably Canadian spies!!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Well find out where that signal is coming

speaker_heading: PRESIDENT

speaker_heading: CARTMAN'S MOTHER

dialog: Yes, hon?
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: If you went down on a horse... You'd tell

speaker_heading: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Sure, hon. Goodnight.

dialog: thinks.
text: He hears a SCRAPING noise, and looks a little scared, but
text: then tries to close his eyes to sleep.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Go away, scary noise.
text: Again the SCRAPING. Cartman pops open hs eyes to see -
text: KENNY! He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed.
text: Cartman is horrified. Too much so to even scream.
text: Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he
text: makes no sound.
text: Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry.
text: Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
text: Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing. Finally, she

speaker_heading: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Oh you poor dear. You've been through so

speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire

text: Suddenly, Saddam walks in carrying some bags.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Hey Satan! I got some great new home
dialog: furnishings today!
text: Satan rolls his eyes and sighs. His attempt to be evil to
text: Kenny is squashed again.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get
dialog: something to match with that bathroom
dialog: tile!
text: Saddam looks at Kenny.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of
dialog: purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise!

text: A beat. Satan folds his arms and looks at the floor, pissed.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Do you wanna know what I did today?
text: Saddam lets out a sigh.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: What did you do today Satan?
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: You don't care.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Hey fella! Relax! This whole armageddon
dialog: thing has got you all stressed out. Let's
dialog: make love.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Do you remember when you first got here?
dialog: We used to talk all night long. Until the
dialog: sun came up... We would just lie in bed
text: and TALK.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: That's because I wanted to fuck you,
dialog: dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those

speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Don't call me dumb!
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
text: As this conversation happens, Kenny's eyes dart back and
text: forth as if watching a tennis match.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: How come you always want to make love to
dialog: me from behind? Is it because you want to
dialog: pretend I'm somebody else?
text: Saddam sighs.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who
dialog: am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Come on, kid. Help me with these shower
dialog: curtains.
text: Saddam and Kenny walk out. Leaving Satan all alone with sad
text: music playing.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: (Gently)
dialog: Sometimes I think
dialog: When I look up real high
dialog: That there's a whole world up there
dialog: And just maybe it could be mine
dialog: But then, I sink
dialog: because it's here I'm supposed to
dialog: stay
dialog: but I don't even know how or why
dialog: its supposed to be that way-
text: Satan walks to his veranda.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Up there, there is so much room
text: Where babies burp and flowers bloom
dialog: Everyone dreams I can dream too
dialog: Up there, Up where
text: The skies are ocean blue
dialog: I could be safe and live without a
dialog: care... Up there
text: Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: They say I don't belong
dialog: That my place is down below
dialog: Because of my beliefs I'm supposed
dialog: to stay where evil is sewn
dialog: But what is evil anyway?
dialog: Is there reason to the rhyme?
dialog: Without evil there could be no good
dialog: So it must be good to be evil
dialog: sometimes
dialog: Up there, there is so much room
text: Where babies burp and flowers bloom.
dialog: Everyone dreams I can dream too
dialog: Up there, Up where
text: The skies are ocean blue
dialog: I could be safe and life without a
dialog: care... Up there

speaker_heading: STAN

speaker_heading: CARTMAN

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I know Cartman, I know. I see Kenny

speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Viva la Resistance.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Oh no, it's that kid.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: This is the place--
text: Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes
dialog: grow wide.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Wendy?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Well, apparently you have a bigger heart
dialog: than we thought. Let us get this meeting
text: underway, there are others coming.
text: Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes.
scene_heading: INT. LA RESISTANCE - LATER
text: Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking
text: RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of
dialog: twelve.
text: The room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA

text: Stan and Kyle look nervous.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Everyone be seated, please.
text: The kids all sit down.
speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, so what do we say?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I thought you had something planned.
speaker_heading: STAN

speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (Nervous)
dialog: Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are
dialog: supposed to be killed, and we think that
dialog: sucks ass!!
text: The kids don't respond. Stan shoots a nervous look at Wendy,
text: who is sitting next to Gregory.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Uhh... So we think we should prank call a
dialog: bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas
dialog: sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA
dialog: LA RESISTANCE!!!
text: Again no response. Gregory rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Uhh...
text: Gregory stands up.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: May I?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What?
text: Gregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Terrance and Phillip are currently being
text: held at a Canadian Internment camp two
text: kilometers outside of town.
dialog: They are to be executed tomorrow during a
text: star-studded USO show for the troops.
text: Gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out. Stan
text: and Kyle can't believe it.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: We must sneak into the camp through this
dialog: duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip
text: inside... The war is escalating, and the
text: American forces are preparing for a large
dialog: scale attack on Canada. That means the
dialog: time is now...
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.
text: Stan shoots Kyle a dirty look.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go
dialog: myself.
text: Wendy smiles at Gregory.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No!
text: Everyone looks at Stan.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to
dialog: save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: This will be very dangerous... Are you
dialog: quite sure?
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Fuck that!
speaker_heading: (BZZT)
dialog: AGAGH!!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We're going... Let's run through the

scene_heading: INT. SOUTH PARK - AMERICAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS

text: We see our regulars: Mr. Garrison with a uniformed Mr. Hat,
text: Mr. Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather,
dialog: Jesus, Officer Barbrady....
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I

speaker_heading: NED

speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Boy, I can't wait for our first shore-
dialog: leave so I can go get me some poontang.
text: Chef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back.
text: GENERAL PLYMKIN, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps
text: up to a podium and addresses the troops.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: PAY ATTENTION!
text: The crowd settles down.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: It's no secret that the Evil Canadian
dialog: Federation has scored major victories all
dialog: over the United State. We have brought
dialog: you here because you ar America's best,
dialog: and last hope.
text: Another general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Oh... Apparently you're not the best,
dialog: you're simply the last. Anyway, let's
dialog: strategize... Map!
text: A large, holographic 3-D map of South Park springs up in
text: front of him. He walks around it pointing out things with a
text: laser-pointer.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Our sources have told us that the
dialog: Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's
dialog: USO show and stop us from executing
dialog: Terrance and Phillip.
text: He points to a spot on the 3-D map.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Now each battalion has a specific code-
dialog: name and mission. Battalion 5, raise
dialog: your hands-
text: Chef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand.
text: Then he looks around and notices to his surprise that
text: everybody else in his section is also African American.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: You will be the all-important first
dialog: defense wave, which we will call
dialog: 'Operation Human Shield'.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Hey, wait a minute...
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human
dialog: Shield' will suffer heavy losses. But
dialog: don't lose your spirit men! Stay until
dialog: the bitter end. Battalion 14?
text: A bunch of white guys raise their hands.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The
dialog: Darkies'. You will follow Battalion 5
dialog: here-
text: He points to a spot on the 3-D map.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: -and try not to get killed for God's
dialog: Sake. Are there any questions men?
text: Chef raises his hand.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Yes soldier?
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Have you ever heard of the Emancipation
dialog: Proclamation?
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: I don't listen to hip-hop.
text: Chef scowls.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: If you somehow live, we will regroup on
dialog: this hill outside--
text: Suddenly, the 3-D hologram starts to flicker and fizzle.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Now what's wrong with this thing?
text: General Plymkin messes with the controls.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Fucking windows 98!
text: General Plymkin has pulled the plug. He stands there with
text: the cord in his hands.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: GET GATES IN HERE!!!
text: BILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
text: YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER
text: AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO
dialog: THE INTERNET!!!
speaker_heading: BILL GATES
dialog: It is faster, over five million--
text: Plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head. Gates
text: falls to the floor, dead.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Alright men, get lots of rest, and
dialog: prepare thyselves for battle!
scene_heading: INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT
text: In the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Gotcha.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: You are indeed brave, but you will need
dialog: someone who's done this sort of thing
dialog: before. MOLE!
text: Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving
text: a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out)
text: The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops
text: THE MOLE. He is a very bitter little nine year old French
text: kid with a THICK French accent.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Oui?
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Thank you for coming, Mole.
speaker_heading: THE MOLE
dialog: So... We must free more Canadian

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah, I guess.
speaker_heading: THE MOLE
dialog: America... She iz a beetch that sheets on
dialog: her own children.
text: Stan and Kyle look at each other confused.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: This is the Mole. He will accompany you
dialog: to the prison where Terrance and Phillip
dialog: are. He is an expert in covert
dialog: operations and a lifelong fighter for
dialog: freedom.
speaker_heading: THE MOLE
dialog: Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured
dialog: down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want
dialog: this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.
text: Everyone stares at The Mole.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy

text: Stan gets pissed.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me
dialog: death!!!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: YEA!!!
text: Now, Gregory breaks into song. His voice is absolutely
text: gorgeous and deep. He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: God has smiled upon you this day
dialog: The fate of a nation in your
dialog: hands...
text: Stan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good
text: this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: As brothers and sisters we unite
dialog: And behind you we shall fight!
dialog: Until only the most righteous
dialog: belief stands!
text: The music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: Do you see the distant flames?
text: they bellow in the night
dialog: Fight in all our names
dialog: For what we know is right
dialog: And if you all get shot and cannot
dialog: carry on
dialog: Though you die, La Resistance
dialog: lives on!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What? Shot?
text: Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join
text: in the song.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: You might get stabbed in the head
dialog: by a dagger or a sword
dialog: You might be burned to death
dialog: or skinned alive or worse!

speaker_heading: THE MOLE
dialog: It's so very cold...
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: We can't leave without you!
speaker_heading: THE MOLE
dialog: It's okay, I am done for.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU -

text: The Mole coughs up more blood.
speaker_heading: THE MOLE

text: The Mole dies.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: SHIT!
speaker_heading: VOICE

text: The boys look up to see three large MARINES pointing guns at
dialog: them.
text: Stan makes a run for it. He dashes off at full speed.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Run, Stan!!
text: One of the soldiers fires at him. PWANG! PWANG! But Stan
text: disappears into the night.
speaker_heading: PENTAGON GUY
dialog: Forget him! The night will swallow him
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: MARINE
dialog: You are under arrest! Cuff 'em!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PENTAGON
dialog: So THIS must be the resistance the

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOM
dialog: It is my pleasure to present to you, THE

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOM

text: The scary giant Executioner grabs Terrance and Phillip and
text: puts them into electric chairs.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOM
dialog: Today is a great day for democracy!
text: The crowd cheers.
text: The Executioner steps up to the throw switch.
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: Phillip, this is worse than that trip to

dialog: disco.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: I know, Terrance. I know.
scene_heading: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT
text: LONG SHOT of a desolate, dark area.
text: It has started to rain. Stan trudges through the wilderness
text: looking tired and scared.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hello? Where the hell am I? Is anybody
dialog: here?
text: A few wolf HOWLS sound in the distance. Stan walks on.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: MARCO!!!
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: MARCO!!!
text: No answer. Stan stumbles a bit.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy...
text: Stan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and
text: his head smacks against a rock.
text: Stan is out cold.
text: Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating
text: WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his
text: flashlight around.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What is that?
text: The sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on
text: something that is huge and throbbing.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: OH MY GOD!!!
scene_heading: EXT. STAGE - NIGHT
text: Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOM

speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Last words? Let's see... How aboot "GET

text: Kyle's mom nods to the Executioner.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: WAIT!!
text: General Plymkin walks out next to Kyle's mother.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: We have just captured some Canadian
dialog: Sympathizers!
text: The crowd cheers. Kyle's mother smiles.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: We will execute them along with Terrance
dialog: and Phillip for your viewing pleasure!
text: Another cheer. The mothers are all very pleased. That is,

text: gunpoint.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Kyle?!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Eric?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hi, ma.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: We also have a Canadian SPY who was

text: Now Ike is brought out at gunpoint.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Ike?!
text: Kyle's mother rushes over to General Plymkin.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: General... These are OUR CHILDREN!
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: They are Canadian sympathizers and they
dialog: must be dealt with accordingly!
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: But they're CHILDREN!
text: Cartman walks over to where Terrance and Phillip are strapped
text: into their chairs.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Dude! Terrance and Phillip! Wow! Can I
dialog: get your autographs?!
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: Sure, tubby, just as soon as we're
dialog: killed.
scene_heading: KENNY'S MOTHER
dialog: We can't kill these kids!
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Listen mothers, YOU'RE the ones that
dialog: started all this. Don't get all emotional
dialog: NOW!
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: But we're doing all this to help our
dialog: children's futures!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Yes, I think shooting our children would
dialog: adversely affect their futures.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: No... The General is right.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: MOM!!!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Boobie... This is the only way you're
dialog: ever going to learn. I have an
dialog: opportunity here to teach you about
dialog: consequences.
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Sheila, you're going to far! Those are

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
text: YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO

speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER

scene_heading: EXT. IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT
text: Stan is still lying in mud, but now he lies before a HUGE,
text: pulsating, organic looking thing that belongs in the X-Files.
text: It's the size of a small building.
text: The massive thing starts to glow. Stan looks weak and afraid.
speaker_heading: BIG THING
dialog: Be not afraid...
text: Stan trembles.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (Weakly)
dialog: What...
speaker_heading: BIG THING
dialog: Behold my glory.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What... are you?
speaker_heading: BIG THING
dialog: I am the clitoris.
text: Stan's eyes grow wide. MUSIC starts to swell up.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE
speaker_heading: CLITORIS!!
speaker_heading: BIG THING
dialog: Stan, your friends need you. They are in
dialog: trouble and you must help them.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to

speaker_heading: STAN

dialog: GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
speaker_heading: BIG THING
dialog: Dude, she's eight years old, just get her
dialog: some ice cream or something.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
speaker_heading: BIG THING
dialog: Now go, your friends are in danger... The
dialog: USO show is a mile east of here, just
text: over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
text: The clitoris fades, and just as it does, all the kids of La
text: Resistance come running into frame. Wendy and Gregory are
dialog: with them as well.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Stan! Stan are you okay?!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Wendy?
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: I see you failed in your mission.
text: Terrance and Phillip must be dead by now.
text: Wendy bends down to pick up Stan.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Come on Stan, we have to hurry. The
dialog: Canadian forces are about to attack!!
text: Wendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around
dialog: her.
scene_heading: EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT
text: A drummer plays as the execution begins.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: We begin with Terrance and Phillip!!!
dialog: Throw the switch!!!
text: The executioner throws the switch and Terrance and Phillip
text: start to fry. Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look
text: horrified.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Goodbye, bastards!
text: Near death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart. Terrance and
text: Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily.
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: Take that, bitch.
text: As Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out:
speaker_heading: PHILLIP/TERRANCE
text: FREEEEEEDOMMMMM!!!
text: Suddenly, FWWOOOMMM!!! A Bomb lands in the middle of the
text: army. BLAM!! It explodes with incredible force, sending dead
text: bodies in all directions.
text: Canadian military planes zoom overhead! It's a full scale
dialog: attack!!
text: From a HIGH ANGLE we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs
text: in every direction.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
text: THE CANADIANS ARE ATTACKING!! RUN FOR
dialog: YOUR LIVES!!
text: FWWOOMM!!! BLAMM!! Another explosion! Everybody just starts
text: screaming and shooting in every direction. Total and
dialog: complete mayhem.
text: One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and
dialog: Phillip stop drying.
text: The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and
text: right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly.
speaker_heading: KYLE
speaker_heading: CARTMAN!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: (Frying)
text: WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What's going on Terrance?
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: Canada is saving us!!
text: Finally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle
text: picks him up and starts to run along with Ike.
scene_heading: INT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM
text: Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his
text: cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Have you finished?
text: Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He
text: holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last
text: drops underneath the bed.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mph mph.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Then move out of the way.
text: Kenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of
dialog: matches.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: I must be strong... I must be strong...
text: Satan tries to light the match. It won't light.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Damn it...
text: Finally, the match lights. Satan holds it up-
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Goodbye, Saddam...
text: -and throws it onto the bed.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Come on!
text: Saddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out.
scene_heading: EXT. USO SHOW - DAY
text: People run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack
text: has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: Ned! Behind you!
text: Ned whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one
text: Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through
text: Ned's neck.
text: Blood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
text: NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!
text: FWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst
dialog: the explosions.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: HOLY SHIT!
dialog: (Zap)
dialog: AGHAGHGAH!!
text: Now when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the
text: blue current swirl around his body.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
text: HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!!
text: General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where
text: explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie
text: talkie as his men die all around him.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
text: ALRIGHT MEN!!! FALL INTO FORMATION!
scene_heading: "HUMAN SHIELD" UP FRONT THEN "OPERATION
text: GET BEHIND THE DARKIES"!!!
text: They all fall in. A phalanx of black men, Chef included in
text: them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
scene_heading: REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD! PROTECT OUR
text: TANKS AND PLANES, TOO!
text: Just then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian
text: tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep. Behind them is
text: a line of missile launchers. General Plymkin's jaw drops.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: Holy Mother of Johosephat...
text: The black guys all look at each other nervously.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD
text: The boys run through the chaos. Body parts and scrapnel fly
dialog: here and there.
text: A bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the
text: boys holding a massive head wound.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!!
text: Garrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get
dialog: him out of here...
text: Garrison takes Mr. Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman.
text: Just then, Garrison goes limp.
text: Cartman looks at the Mr. Hat in his hand and scowls. The boys
text: run from the battle.
text: They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are
text: standing in a human shield around the white guys.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Alright, squad... JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU...
dialog: ONE!!
text: The Canadian tanks take aim.
speaker_heading: CHEF
speaker_heading: TWO!
text: The Canadian tanks fire.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: THREE!!
text: All the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the
text: whites completely exposed.
speaker_heading: GENERAL PLYMKIN
dialog: What the-
text: The tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers
text: to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo.
speaker_heading: BLACK SOLDIER
speaker_heading: GREAT PLAN, CHEF!
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Operation Human Shield my ASS!
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY
text: From an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both
text: sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be
text: heard in the distance.
text: We see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer. He
text: shoots like a maniac into the Canadians. He wounds one and
text: then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.
speaker_heading: MR. MACKEY
dialog: Die Canadian, mmkay?!
text: And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest.
text: But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of
text: nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest.
speaker_heading: MR. MACKEY
dialog: Mkay-
text: Mackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs
text: through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around
text: gunfire.
speaker_heading: BIG GAY AL
dialog: Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going
dialog: FAST!!!
text: Another bullet zings by his head.
speaker_heading: BIG GAY AL
dialog: Jumping Jesus, this is insane!!
text: THUMP! A bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head. More
text: bullets follow, tearing him to shreds.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE ON - ENTIRE BATTLE
text: This shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private
text: Ryan'. Just complete overkill. Explosions, helicopters,
text: gunfire and death.
text: Kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a
text: ridge overlooking the horrific massacre.
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: My God... This is terrible...
text: Kyle's mother holds out her M-16. She is now completely
dialog: insane.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: This is what we wanted! We wanted our
dialog: children to be brought up in a smut-free
dialog: environment!!!
scene_heading: KENNY'S MOTHER
dialog: But we didn't want THIS. I just followed
dialog: you 'cause I made a shitload of money
dialog: selling Kenny t-shirts!
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Oh Lord, what have we done...?
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Wake up, people! We all have to do
dialog: things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's
dialog: the not pretty things that make life
dialog: worth fighting the not pretty things for!
dialog: Why do you think children have to be born
dialog: in hospitals?
text: The other mothers look very confused.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Why does it matter?! My plan is a perfect
dialog: plan!! Perfect! Perfect! Perfect!!!!!
text: The other mothers walk away.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the
dialog: not pretty things from letting our
dialog: children be born in hospitals!
speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: We're going to find our boys! For God's
dialog: sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
text: Kyle's mother turns back to the battle. More killing and
dialog: explosions.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Killed. They should only be so lucky.
dialog: Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital!
text: She charges the field.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS
text: Terrance and Phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud
dialog: explosions.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
dialog: You did? Just now?
text: They laugh merrily.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Come on, we can take shelter in one of
dialog: those buildings!
text: But just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun!!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
text: AAAGHGAHGHGH!!! YOU DESTROYED MY
dialog: FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!
text: Phillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother
text: plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen.
speaker_heading: TERRANCE
speaker_heading: AGH!
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Terrance! NO!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: DIE!!!!!!
scene_heading: SLOW MOTION SHOT -
text: Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach.
text: Everything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down,
dialog: down...
text: Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!!
text: CLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes.
text: CLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground...
text: BACK TO REAL TIME
text: Suddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames
text: and ash take over the sky.
text: Satan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops
text: fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle.
speaker_heading: SATAN
text: RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!!
text: Demons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on
text: both sides can't believe what they're seeing.
text: Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off
text: and looks around.
scene_heading: EXT. TRENCH - NIGHT
text: As more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike
text: huddle close to each other in a trench.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Kyle... All those times I said you were a
dialog: big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're
dialog: not a Jew.
dialog: Kyle thinks.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yes I am!
speaker_heading: IKE
dialog: Baba mama!
text: Another explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the
dialog: boys' heads.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
speaker_heading: AGH!
dialog: (Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand)
dialog: What the hell am I still holding this
dialog: for?!
text: Cartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS
text: and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: Mr. Hat! Noooooo!
text: Suddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Stan!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can
dialog: get Wendy to like me now!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Sweet.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: (Sarcastic)
dialog: Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's
dialog: well that ends well, huh? We can go home
dialog: now. There's just one little thing left
dialog: to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!!
text: More explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys.
text: Suddenly, Kenny appears before the boys.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN/KYLE
dialog: AGAGAH!!!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to
dialog: take us to the netherworld!
speaker_heading: KENNY

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mph rmph rm rmph rm!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Okay! We can get you some proofs of
dialog: purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny! Just
dialog: mellow the heck out!
scene_heading: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT
text: More battle. People are dying left and right.
text: The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A
text: Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows
text: the Canadian's head clean off.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GAUCHE
dialog: Hey, pal, don't lose your head.
text: Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead,
text: and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled
dialog: shotgun.
speaker_heading: CANADIAN SOLDIER
dialog: I'm glad you got that off your chest.
text: Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian
text: through the head with his bayonet.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I guess he got the point.
text: A Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes.
speaker_heading: CANADIAN SOLDIER 2
dialog: Plastics are a cheap and efficient
dialog: insulator for electrical applications.
text: Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another!
text: The soldiers all look scared and puzzled.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: You're all part of Satan's army now!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: What the hell is going on?!
text: Satan gets in Kyle's mother's face.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: I am the dark master!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I

text: Kyle's mother backs down, ashamed.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Oh, good job, Mrs. Broflofski, thanks a
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: I... I was just trying to make the world
dialog: a better place for children...
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Yes... And in doing so, you brought
dialog: enough anger and intolerance to the world
dialog: to allow my coming.
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: And I thought my mother was the master of
dialog: guilt. Geez Louise.
speaker_heading: SATAN
text: SILENCE!!! NOW!!! EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO
dialog: ME!!!
speaker_heading: KYLE'S MOTHER
dialog: Oh God... What have I done...
text: One by one, the soldiers start to kneel.
text: Satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible,
text: deep laugh that fills the world.
text: But just then, the ground shakes again. Satan looks over to
text: the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another
dialog: figure.
text: He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam. He holds a martini
text: glass in his hand.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Hey, I'm missing the party!
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: No! It can't be!
text: Saddam, burnt to a crisp, walks over to Satan and grabs his
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Did you miss me, buttercup?
dialog: (Yelling out)
dialog: All right, gang! I am your new ruler now!
dialog: Everyone bow down to ME!!
text: Satan puts his head down.
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: HOLD EVERYTHING!!!
text: Kyle walks up with Cartman, Stan and Kenny.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You made a deal with Kenny that if he got
dialog: ten proofs of purchases from Snacky
dialog: Smores you'd grant him any wish.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: And?
text: Kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC
dialog: plays.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking
dialog: with him!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: The deal's off, go away, guy.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't
dialog: just renege on a deal. That's lying.
speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Relax bitch! You're better seen, not

text: Saddam smacks Satan in the face. Now Satan looks mad, but he

speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN
dialog: Now, let's start torturing people, shall

speaker_heading: CARTMAN

speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Holy shit Cartman! What was that?!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: How the fuck should I know!!
text: ZAP!!! Another huge CHARGE emits from the v-chip inside

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Look at that!
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: It's that v-chip thing that's inside you,

speaker_heading: TERRANCE

speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: BUTTFUCKING SHIT!
text: BZZZZZZZZT! A huge charge busts the chains that hold

speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Help you? You've destroyed my life and

speaker_heading: SADDAM HUSSEIN

dialog: words!
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Well, I learned it all from you guys.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Of course you did, cock fuck!
text: They all laugh merrily.
text: Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam
dialog: fell.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: He spent so much time convincing me I was
dialog: weak and stupid that I believed it
dialog: myself.
text: The boys look at each other, confused.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Saddam didn't respect me. All he wanted
dialog: was sex. But it took me so long to
dialog: figure that out.
text: He starts to cry. Chef hands him a hanky.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Here you go Satan-
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Thank you. Give me the proofs of
dialog: purchases.
text: Kenny hands them to Satan.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any
dialog: wish you want is yours.

dialog: speaks.
speaker_heading: KENNY
speaker_heading: Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.
dialog: Everyone GASPS!!
speaker_heading: KYLE
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Are you sure, Kenny?
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: He said that his wish is for everyone who
dialog: died in the war to come back.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Kenny, you realize this wish is the only
dialog: chance for YOU not to be dead...
speaker_heading: KENNY
scene_heading: M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm.
dialog: Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm.
text: Triumphant music plays, as if Kenny is giving a grand,
dialog: important speech.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Very well, then. I will put an end to the
dialog: war as your wish and make everything as
dialog: it was before the war started. But you
text: Kenny, must remain dead.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Mph rm.
text: Satan turns to the open abyss.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's
dialog: too fucking cold up here.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Aren't there cold parts of hell?
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's
dialog: the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm
dialog: destined to live in hell... alone...
text: Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell. But
text: something catches his eye.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Hello... What's this?
text: Satan bends down and picks up Mr. Hat. He looks at it, and
text: then places it gently on his hand.
speaker_heading: SATAN
dialog: Hi there, little guy... Would you like to
dialog: go to hell with me?
speaker_heading: SATAN (AS MR. HAT)
dialog: Sure. I bet we can be best friends!
text: Satan smiles. And walks down to hell with Mr. Hat.
text: The boys walks over to Kenny.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Thank you, Kenny.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for
dialog: us. You're a real pal.
text: A bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are
text: dragged back down into hell. Kenny is taken along with them.
text: At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others
text: who died, suddenly and magically appear. They look at
text: themselves, wondering what just happened.
text: Everyone just stands around in a daze. Canadians and
text: Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.
speaker_heading: MR. GARRISON
dialog: I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?
speaker_heading: BIG GAY AL
dialog: Wow... We were all killed and now we're
dialog: fine. That's super!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, but you know, I learned something
dialog: today. I learned that getting all worked
dialog: up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is
dialog: just stupid... You all focused so hard on
dialog: erasing profanity that you forgot the
dialog: most important thing... To love each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN
dialog: Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a
dialog: bitches!
text: The boys' parents walk up.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going
dialog: to have fun with profanity just like you

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: STAN'S MOTHER
dialog: -Or monkey fucker-
text: They all laugh merrily at their naughtiness.
text: Wendy walks up to Stan.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I'm sorry Stan, I guess you really DO get
dialog: it after all!
text: Stan smiles. MUSIC swells.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Wendy... How would you like to go get
dialog: some ice cream?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice
dialog: cream?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: My friend the clitoris told me.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Wow, I have a clitoris too.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Really? Where the hell do you keep it?
dialog: It's huge.
text: Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him. Stan vomits
text: into Wendy's mouth.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: But Wendy... What about Gregory?
text: Gregory stands off to one side, scowling.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You didn't?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Cool!
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (Singing)
dialog: Thank my lucky stars
dialog: Here before me now
dialog: Is everything I'd ever hoped for-
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Knew it in a word
dialog: Saw it in a glance
dialog: The only thing I think I'd die for
speaker_heading: STAN AND WENDY
dialog: I can't stop now... My heart's
dialog: awake!
dialog: I pray your arms my arms to take!
dialog: So this is why I'm alive!
text: Now everyone joins hands and starts singing-
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLEFUCKA!
text: YOU'RE A COCK SUCKING ASS RAPING
dialog: UNCLEFUCKA!
dialog: YOU'RE AN UNCLEFUCKA, YES IT'S
speaker_heading: TRUE!

dialog: UNCLEFUCKAAA!!!
text: Kenny's mom and dad come up.
speaker_heading: KENNY'S DAD
dialog: This is all so wonderful. I just wish
dialog: our little Kenny could see all of this
dialog: joy.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Oh he can, dude. Look!
text: Kyle points to the sky. Everyone looks up just in time to
text: see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky.
text: We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it.
text: As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting
text: towards the heavens.
dialog: 
text: As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and
text: up through the clouds. (NOTE: This will also be done in 3-D
speaker_heading: CGI)
text: Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into
text: the warmth of the baby blueness.
text: Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings. They smile
text: gently. He feels calm. He feels good.
text: Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally...
dialog: into Heaven.
speaker_heading: END.
