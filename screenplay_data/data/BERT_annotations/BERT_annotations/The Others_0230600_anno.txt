speaker_heading: TUTILE
dialog: Oh, I imagine he’s dead, like all the rest.
speaker_heading: BERTHA

dialog: Ah, those were the days...
text: They stop in front of the door. BERTHA, who appears to be the best dressed of the
text: three, rings the doorbell and then looks her two companions up and down, as if she

speaker_heading: BERTHA
dialog: Mg. Tuttle, when are you going to learn to comb your hair
dialog: properly?

speaker_heading: TUTTLE

speaker_heading: BERTHA
dialog: Why on earth did they do that?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: There are days when this house isn't the best place to live,

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: The kitchen. I have breakfast at eight and the children ¢ at

speaker_heading: BERTHA

dialog: Let’s see, you can take charge of cleaning the bedrooms

dialog: the kitchen, and the bathrooms...do you understend?
text: LYDIA nods vehemently.
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: The rooms are all very large, but contain very litle

dialog: noise, Let’s continue...
speaker_heading: BERTHA
dialog: Ma’am, there’s no need for you to show us round the
dialog: whole house, we already...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: On the contrary. Because, half the time, you never know
dialog: where you are in this house. You're quite likely to bump
dialog: into a table, a sideboard, a door, or one of my children
dialog: playing Hide-And-Seek.

text: Very vaguely, mingled with the noise of the leaves in the garden, we detect an amalgam
text: of confused whispers. It is almost impossible to distinguish what they are saying.
