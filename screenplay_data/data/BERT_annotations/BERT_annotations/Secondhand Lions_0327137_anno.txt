text: The clothes, the car, the road signs, the RADIO MUSIC...
dialog: all say the time is now the early 1960's.

speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: Walter! Good news! You're spending
dialog: the summer with your two uncles....
text: Walter CHOKES, lunges for the window and hangs out it
text: THROWING-UP. Mae scowls, fires up a long cigarette.
speaker_heading: MAE (Cont'd)
dialog: It'll only be a few weeks, a month
dialog: or two, tops. I'll definitely
dialog: come get you before school starts.
text: Walter turns from the window and sits, pale.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's what you said at that summer

speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: Walter! Look! I promise this

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: "The Fort Worth College of Court

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Can't I come with you?
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: No! I'm gonna be working my little

text: He nods, retreats back into his silence.
speaker_heading: MAE (Cont'd)
dialog: Now look. They say these two old

speaker_heading: MAE (Cont'd)
dialog: This is it! Oh, look at your face.
text: She TSK-TSKS, SPITS in a Kleenex, rubs it over his face,

speaker_heading: MAE (Cont'd)

scene_heading: EXT. THE UNCLES' HOME/COMPOUND - DAY 10
text: A ramshackle home: a tower leans crookedly. Beyond, a

text: loiter around an old barn. An old truck rusts silently.
text: Dogs HOWL: a pack of ugly stray dogs races up and SLAMS
text: into the car, HOWLING, WAILING, teeth SNAPPING.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: Show them you're friendly. Let
dialog: them smell your hand.

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: MAE (Cont'd)
dialog: You're gonna have to work on that
dialog: smile while I'm gone. OK?
text: Walter nods solemnly. Mae blows a kiss and motors off.
text: Morose, Walter watches the dogs chase the Cadillac away.
text: Walter picks up his bag, turns, looks up at the brothers:
dialog: OK, now what? Finally:
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Well. Supper time.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE - DAY 14
text: Walter watches the uncles wolf down fish, steak, sausage.
text: The dogs and the pig crowd to look in a porch window.
text: Walter stares down at huge portions of shot-up fish, steak
text: and sausage. He tries the fish, bites something hard,
text: SPITS a shotgun pellet out onto his plate: PLINK. SIGH.
text: He hacks off a chunk of steak, chews with all his strength.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This steak is... weird.
speaker_heading: HUB
dialog: Venison! Not steak!
text: Walter frowns, decides to try the sausage: not bad.
speaker_heading: HUB (Cont'd)
dialog: Pork!

speaker_heading: GARTH

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATE DAY 15
text: The uncles sit, sipping huge glasses of what may be iced
text: tea; beside them, two shotguns stand ready, close at hand.
text: Sitting on the porch steps, Walter wonders: they seem to
text: be waiting for something... Finally, he SIGHS.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: If my mom calls, can we hear the

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No television? What do you do?
text: Dizzy, Walter wonders if he's fallen off the edge of the

text: SMILING SALESMAN alights from his car.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN

text: and chase the car away.
text: Walter shivers, stunned; he stares as the brothers calmly
text: sit back down, drink, and reload.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: There's plenty of entertainment on
dialog: TV. Educational stuff too! It's
dialog: a good thing to do in the evenings!
text: GRAVEL CRUNCHES again. The brothers raise their shotguns.
text: A GRINNING SALESMAN appears:
speaker_heading: GRINNING SALESMAN
dialog: Rumor has it you two got millions
dialog: stashed away! Why not put that
dialog: money to work for you with the
dialog: high return only investing in gold
dialog: and silver can bring....

text: The brothers sip reflectively, and reload.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Everybody loves TV! You oughta

scene_heading: WALTER'S IMAGINATION - THE KITCHEN 17
text: In his p.j.s, Walter comes in for breakfast, YAWNS, calmly

scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S TOWER ROOM - NIGHT 19
text: Walter staggers in, looks around... the tower room is
text: heaped with debris, trunks, chests, suitcases, junk.
text: He opens his bag, takes out a toothbrush, sees a small
text: door by the stairs: a bathroom? He opens the door
text: something tumbles over him: an old Santa Claus costume.
text: He tries on the beard, admires his reflection in a murky
text: mirror. Then, he hears: downstairs, two snoring-world-
text: champions WARBLE and hit every SNORING-note Man can hear.
text: He SIGHS, BRUSHES his teeth, further explores the room:
text: One trunk is covered with exotic travel stickers. He

text: Walter stares at the knob in his hand: a key falls out.
text: Walter looks at the key, then at the locked trunk. He
text: tries the key in the lock. CLICK: it fits. Slowly, he
text: opens the lid: CREAK... empty. No money, no jewels, only:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sand...?
dialog: 
text: Puzzled, he runs his fingers through sand that covers the
text: trunk bottom. Enchanted, he SNIFFS a handful: it smells
text: exotic. MUSIC ECHOES, evocative, Arabic perhaps.
text: Beneath the sand he sees something, picks it up: it's a
text: faded photo of the most beautiful woman he's ever seen;
text: dark hair, olive skin, piercing eyes. Walter wonders.
text: BANG! A door SLAMS. Walter leaps to the window, looks

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Aaaagh!

speaker_heading: WALTER (Cont'd)
dialog: He's sleep-walking!
text: The dogs lay down, eyes fixed on Hub. Watching. Waiting.
text: Hub smiles, a cold smile. Then, with a CRY, he swings
text: his plunger like a sword and begins to fight: parry,

text: Walter panics, tries to look innocent, as Garth enters.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Thought you'd run away.
text: Walter shakes his head "no". Garth hurriedly gathers up

dialog: 
text: Walter sits, confused. Finally, he just has to ask:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Y-y-you send mail to all those

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: GARTH (0.S.)
dialog: The Assassin was given bags and
dialog: bags full of gold, more than most

speaker_heading: GARTH (Cont'd)
dialog: Terrified, the Sheik knew his life
dialog: was over, that Hub would certainly
dialog: kill him. Hub smiled... then
text: lowered his blade. He threw the

text: his lifelong enemy a fair fight.
dialog: "Defend yourself!" Hub cried.
text: The evil Sheik grins. The fight begins: CLANG-CLANG!
text: And almost instantly, faster than the eye can follow, Hub
text: sends the Sheik's sword flying and pins the Sheik once
text: again, against a pillar, his blade to the Sheik's throat.
speaker_heading: GARTH (Cont'd)
text: It was over in a second: Hub had
dialog: humbled him. The Sheik knew he

speaker_heading: STAN

scene_heading: EXT. BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND BARN - PRE-DAWN 129
text: In the eerie, shimmering mists of pre-dawn, Stan shines

text: walk toward the barn: Stan uses the flashlight and Walter's
text: reactions as a divining rod.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Now Walter. Your mother and I
dialog: found this nice house, just like
dialog: you always wanted. But we don't
dialog: have enough for a down payment.
dialog: We could turn your uncles in for
dialog: the reward, but they'd go to jail...

speaker_heading: STAN (Cont'd)
dialog: I know you wouldn't like that. So

speaker_heading: STAN

speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: We finally have our chance to be
dialog: happy, honey. Just tell us.
text: They're in front of the barn. Walter shakes, terrified,

text: Suddenly, Walter's struggles cease; his trembling stops
text: He's made up his mind. He smiles.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hub and Garth didn't rob any banks.

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: STAN (Cont'd)

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Best I can figure, they were trying
dialog: to fly through the barn upside
dialog: down.
text: Walt shakes his head, a LAUGH bursts out, is cut off.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I always knew that airplane would
dialog: get them.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: We had a bunch of reporters out
dialog: here earlier. Even CNN. I guess
text: anytime a biplane from the first
text: World War crashes, doing acrobatics,
text: flown by two ninety year-old men
dialog: with no pilots' licenses, well....
text: Both try to keep straight faces, finally both grin.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (Cont'd)
dialog: Here. I found their will.
text: A single piece of paper. Walt reads the scrawls:
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: "The kid gets it all. Just plant
dialog: us in the damn garden with the
dialog: stupid lion."
text: Walt's eyes become wet. He looks out at the garden, and
text: the lake beyond. Wind rustles stalks of corn.
speaker_heading: WALT (Cont'd)
dialog: These last few months, my Uncle
dialog: Hub's been sick with pneumonia.
text: From sleepwalking. More and more
dialog: lately, we'd find him out there in
text: the middle of the night, staring
text: out over the water....
text: The Sheriff looks at the plane with new understanding.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Well. They had a good long run
dialog: both of them. And they went out
text: with their boots on.
dialog: Walt nods: they sure did that.

text: The day of the funeral, in the garden: it's a real garden
text: now, with a variety of huge, beautiful vegetables.
text: MOURNERS, mostly curious locals, gingerly make their way
text: through rows of beautiful vegetables to the grave site,
text: between the tomatoes and the watermelons.
speaker_heading: THE CARS 157
text: WALT'S WIFE arrives. TWO BOYS bounce out of the car,
text: dueling with curved plastic Arab swords.
speaker_heading: WALT'S WIFE
text: Put the swords back in the car
text: The boys turn: one wears an eye-patch and has a crayon-
text: drawn face scar.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Oh, mom...!
speaker_heading: WALT'S WIFE
dialog: Go stand with your father
scene_heading: EXT. THE GARDEN/GRAVE SITE 158
text: The boys run up to Walt.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: Dad! Dad!
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Hub, you're standing on the squash.
dialog: Garth, lose the eyepatch.
text: Walt sees four prosperous-looking MEN in their fifties
text: arrive with their wives; the four eye him, grinning.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Walter? Little Walter...?
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't remember....

speaker_heading: WALT (Cont'd)
dialog: Oh. Well.... In her life, my
dialog: mother made a lot of mistakes.
dialog: But once, by sheer accident, she
dialog: did do something right: she dumped
dialog: me off one summer with two crazy
dialog: old men. And there, in the most
dialog: unlikely of places, I found a home.
dialog: My home.
text: The wind blows softly, rustles the corn stalks.
speaker_heading: WALT (Cont'd)
dialog: They had no idea of how to deal
dialog: with a troubled little kid. So,
dialog: they told me stories. Amazing,
dialog: unbelievable stories. Stories
dialog: about harems, sheiks and princesses,
text: valiant men and evil villains.
dialog: About courage. Honor. They knew
dialog: those stories were exactly what a
text: terrified young boy needed to hear.
text: Walt smiles wryly, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WALT (Cont'd)
dialog: Even though we cynical adults know
dialog: such tall tales can't possibly be
dialog: true, I believed them. In a way,
dialog: I still believe them. Because, as
dialog: my Uncle Hub taught me, just because
dialog: something isn't true, that's no
dialog: reason you shouldn't believe in
dialog: it. That's what fathers do for
dialog: sons: teach them the things that,
dialog: despite everything, are worth
dialog: believing in.
dialog: Some folks don't understand. But others do.
speaker_heading: WALT (Cont'd)
dialog: It was the proudest day of my life
dialog: when I turned eighteen and Hub
dialog: gave me his full, unabridged, "What
dialog: Every Boy Needs to Know About Being
dialog: a Man" speech.
text: TITTERS, smiles. Frankie and the hoods nod knowingly.
speaker_heading: WALT (Cont'd)
dialog: And one of these days, I'll give
dialog: that same speech to my sons.

text: He wipes his eyes, looks up.
speaker_heading: WALT (Cont'd)
dialog: Please, as you leave, help yourself
dialog: to all the vegetables you can carry.
text: LAUGHS. And it's over. All start to leave. But then:
text: WHOOSH! Airbrakes: two huge livestock trucks pull in.
text: Everyone looks puzzled. Big doors SLAM DOWN: SOLDIERS on
text: horseback leap out, riding beautiful Arabian stallions.
text: Foreign soldiers wearing kepis and kerchiefs, desert
text: uniforms. Foreign Legion uniforms.
speaker_heading: WALT'S BOYS
dialog: It's The Legion!
text: The Legion forms up into a mounted Honor Guard. walt
text: can't believe his eyes. Nor can anyone.
text: Then, they see another vehicle drive up: a long, long
text: limo pulls up and parks; its doors open: a dozen ARAB
text: WOMEN wearing veils emerge in a dense pack, surrounding
text: someone of obvious importance. The pack approaches.
text: Walt's boys' eyes shine. They watch the Legion on
text: horseback, stallions prancing in glorious precision.
text: And then, at the garden's edge, the pack of women parts:
text: revealing an old, old man in a wheelchair, an ancient
text: SHEIK who wears an eyepatch and has a long scar running
text: down one side of his once-handsome but cruel face.
speaker_heading: WALT'S BOYS (Cont'd)
dialog: Yikes!
text: Walt is startled; his sons jump behind him, and peer out:
text: The old sheik glares at the coffins with incredible fury.
text: The women start WAILING mournfully; the old sheik glares
text: at them, then shakes his fist at the two coffins.
dialog: Old enemies die hard.
