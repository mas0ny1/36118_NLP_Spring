scene_heading: EXT. HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - DAY
dialog: CAPTION: Belfast, the Fifties
text: A beautiful ordered garden. The colours are fairy-tale
text: bright. Bird song.
text: On a window an election poster has been taped: VOTE HOOLEY
scene_heading: FOR A GENUINE ALTERNATIVE
text: On the grass sits a portable record player. Beside it a
text: small pile of records. CHILD TERRI’S hands pick up ‘I Saw
text: the Light’ - Hank Williams in his trademark rhinestone suit
text: - and places it on the turntable
text: A needle is set down on the vinyl. CHILD TERRI smiles,
text: enraptured.
text: A tomato bursts against the window, obliterating the
dialog: poster.
text: CHILD TERRI dives for cover behind a large shrub.
text: An egg follows the tomato; stones land in the garden along
text: with arrows from a kid’s bow. The TWO BOYS doing the
text: throwing and shooting are under ten. BOY 1 wears a tatty
text: sheriff's hat, BOY 2 has ‘war paint’ on his face.
speaker_heading: BOY 1
dialog: Fenian Lovers.
text: An arrow flies overhead. In the shrub CHILD TERRI crouches,
text: holding on to his head: he knows he has to keep it down.
text: BOY 2 prepares to unleash a final arrow.
speaker_heading: BOY 1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Commie bastards.
text: The shrub seems to vibrate with rage. CHILD TERRI pops up.
speaker_heading: CHILD TERRI
dialog: My da’s not a communist, he’s a
dialog: socialist.
text: His eye widens as the arrow speeds towards it.
dialog: Impact.
scene_heading: INT. TERRI’S WORLD - NIGHT AND DAY JUMBLED TOGETHER
text: The music is distorted, becoming the soundtrack as the
text: arrow takes us on an accelerated journey into Terri’s
dialog: world, and through the future, private and public.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (0.S.)
dialog: Do you think is he going to lose
dialog: it?
text: There are looming faces - DOCTOR, Terri’s parents MAVIS and
text: GEORGE - a disorienting rush of lights - suggestive of eye
text: tests, but merging with other lights - city lights,
text: searchlights. There are eye charts, which merge with 60s
dialog: protest placards - US out of Vietnam - Ban the Bomb - with
dialog: magazine covers: Ego, OZ
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Is he going to lose it?
text: The charts, placards, magazines merge with newspaper
text: headlines charting the start of the Northern Irish
text: Troubles, a barrage of surreal images from the 50s to the
text: 70s darker as the headlines change: from agricultural shows
text: to sheep fleeing a bomb blast, from schoolkids dancing at a
text: fete to a line of monks being frisked by British soldiers.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: (growing frantic)
dialog: Is he going to be blinded?
text: Image and sound reach a crescendo.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (0.S.)
dialog: (consoling)
dialog: He’s just going to see things a
dialog: little bit differently.
scene_heading: INT. HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - NIGHT
text: An explosion fills the TV screen.
text: TERRI, now in his 20s, rubs his eye. There is, throughout,
text: an open, almost child-like quality to his expression
text: totally at odds with some of what he does, and says.
text: Beside him sit MAVIS and GEORGE, a man whose bearing, as
text: much as his waistcoat and collarless shirt, marks him as
dialog: out of his time.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What a fucking nightmare.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Mind you your language.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: And they call this a revolution?
text: A poster is on the wall VOTE HOOLEY STILL A GENUINE
speaker_heading: ALTERNATIVE
scene_heading: INT. DARKROOM - DAY 4
text: TERRI wears a Kodak overall. Sitting on a work bench, knees
text: up, smoking a joint is his mate ERIC - more sixth Stone
text: than fifth Beatle, more Sticky Finger than Satisfaction.
text: There are photos pegged up to dry. There are also flyers
text: (clearly home-made): Terri Hooley, Tonight at 8...
text: Max Romeo’s ‘War ina Babylon’ plays on a portable
text: turntable. TERRI sings along as he pegs up another flyer.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: ‘War ina Babylon, tribal war ina
dialog: Babylon, let me tell you, it
dialog: sipple out there...’
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Sssh.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Do you hear something?
text: The ‘something’ is an alarm going off, but it barely
text: registers before TERRI starts singing again.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: ‘,.. tribal was ina Babylon...’
dialog: (breaking off)
dialog: What baffles me, Jamaica and
dialog: Belfast have so much in common.
dialog: Cops and soldiers giving you
text: grief day in day out, armed gangs
dialog: running round murdering people
dialog: for fuck all. But at least in
dialog: Jamaica they have decent music.
text: A muffled thump. TERRI and ERIC look at the door. ERIC
text: nicks the joint; waves smoke away. TERRI opens door and is
text: face to face with a BOMB DISPOSAL MAN, or bomb disposal
text: blimp as he appears.
speaker_heading: BOMB DISPOSAL MAN
dialog: (indistinctly)
dialog: Get the fuck out!
text: ERIC jumps down from the bench. TERRI carefully takes the
text: record off before leaving. A second later he returns, grabs
text: a handful of flyers.
scene_heading: EXT. KODAK - DAY
text: SOLDIERS herd OTHER WORKERS behind a cordon where news
text: cameras lurk. TERRI and ERIC saunter out
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: So are you coming down tonight?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You know me, I’ll go anywhere
dialog: where there are people, ergo....
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Jesus, everyone's a defeatist.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Here, just to cheer you up.
text: He passes TERRI a bag of grass.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Tell you the truth, I’m a bit
text: skint at the minute.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (brushing it off)
dialog: Mates rates.
text: TERRI spies TWO WOMEN IN KODAK OVERALLS; ERIC spies a YOUNG
text: BRITISH SOLDIER standing a little apart from the others
speaker_heading: TERRI AND ERIC
dialog: Catch you later.
text: They go off in opposite directions, TERRI to the women.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: The future Mrs Hooley.
speaker_heading: KODAK WOMAN 1
dialog: Which one of us?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Either of you, both
text: He hands them a flyer.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Come down to this tonight.
speaker_heading: KODAK WOMAN 1
dialog: In town? Have you a death wish?
text: She and her friend walk off giggling.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (after them, arms spread)
dialog: I have a life wish.
text: He turns. MARTY heavy beard, heavy coat, heavy politics,
text: approaches, red-headed NED skulking in his wake.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Marty. Ned.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I’d watch where I shouted that
dialog: life-wish stuff. Some people
dialog: might take it as a challenge.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (nods to Kodak building)
dialog: Some people look like they have
dialog: enough to keep them busy.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: That’s not one of ours. If it had
dialog: been one of ours there wouldn’t
dialog: have been a warning.
text: He flicks the CND badge on TERRI’s coat.
speaker_heading: MARTY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’d forgotten about those.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No kidding.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Does it not get lonely being the
dialog: last man standing?
text: MARTY glances up, sees ERIC passing something to YOUNG
text: BRITISH SOLDIER, who slips him a banknote in exchange.
text: TERRI sees MARTY seeing it. He flourishes a flyer an inch
text: from MARTY’s face.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Do your feet a favour, take them
dialog: out dancing, like you used to.
text: MARTY balls up the flyer, shoves it back in TERRI’s face.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: See you around.
text: He and NED move off. TERRI has contrived to stick flyers to
dialog: their back.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: I fucking hope not.
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - NIGHT
text: Deserted, but for TERRI, walking. He stops at length before
text: a metal cage protecting the front of a bar: the Harp.
dialog: 6.
text: A security camera tracks his approach. TERRI takes out his
text: glass eye and thrusts it up to the lens.
text: A buzzer sounds.
scene_heading: INT. HARP BAR - NIGHT
text: The hand that held up the eye now rifles through a box of
dialog: records: Shangri-las, 13th Floor Elevators, Gladiators. A
text: poster on the wall reads TERRI HOOLEY BELFAST’S NO.1 DJ.
text: Next to it a WAR IS OVER poster (‘Love John and Yoko’),
dialog: another for the Rolling Stones gig at the Ulster Hall, 1966
text: an outlaws gallery: Hank Williams, Bob Marley, Johnny Cash.
text: TERRI downs a brandy, lights a cigarette lit, takes a
text: record from its sleeve: ‘Soul Rebel’ by The Wailers.
text: He places it on the turntable, closes his eyes and starts
dialog: to sing along.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I'm a rebel, soul rebel
text: He opens his eyes. He is brought back to earth. The room is
text: empty save for PAT, the Harp’s Manager (he has one of those
dialog: Belfast expressions of permanent doubt: Two plus two? Is
text: four?) and an OLD BOY at the bar doing Spot the Ball.
text: PAT shakes his head slowly, approaches TERRI.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: (handing TERRI £5)
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I thought we said ten?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Ten for the whole night. That’s
dialog: you finished, I’m pulling the
dialog: plug. In fact you needn’t bother
text: coming back.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Why? Look around you. It’s
dialog: finished. No one wants to come
dialog: out any more.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: She does.
text: A young woman has appeared out of nowhere and is dancing
text: hypnotically alone in the centre of the floor.
text: This is RUTH. There is something handmade about her; a
text: style so individual it borders on the eccentric.
text: PAT hands TERRI another £5.
scene_heading: INT. HARP BAR - NIGHT
text: RUTH orders a drink. A loud scratch as, mid-song, TERRI
text: changes tack. Dion, ‘Born to be with you’. The OLD BOY
text: looks round, confused. TERRI skips down from the stage.
text: RUTH is putting change in her purse.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Are you here on your own?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I was out for a walk and heard
dialog: the music. Thought I’d come in
dialog: and see if it was as lively as it
dialog: sounded.
text: The OLD BOY sneezes. TERRI and RUTH look at him, then at
text: each other, then laugh.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It wasn’t always like this, there
dialog: were nights here when you had to
dialog: queue just to get on the guest
dialog: list.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t mean to be cheeky, but
dialog: you don’t look like a man with
dialog: that many friends.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Do you want to know the truth of
dialog: it? I used to have lots of
dialog: friends.
scene_heading: INT. HARP BAR 1968 - NIGHT
text: TERRI and RUTH are surrounded by the very FRIENDS Terri is
text: invoking: swaying to music, laughing, animated. In the
text: middle of the floor three men clink shorts glasses: MARTY,
text: less heavy (and wearing a CND badge); NED, and ANDY, with a
text: Zapata moustache.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Lots of anarchist friends, and
dialog: Marxist friends, and socialist
dialog: friends, and pacifist friends,
dialog: and feminist friends, and friends
dialog: who were fuck all.
dialog: 10
text: MARTY, NED and ANDY down their drinks. NED’s comes back up
text: his nose. The others laugh, pat his back. NED is furious.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
text: Then the first shot was fired
text: The three shorts glasses smash.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: And the first bomb exploded and
dialog: suddenly I didn’t have any more
dialog: Marxist, or feminist, or
dialog: anarchist friends.
text: The room darkens. The FRIENDS are now on opposing sides of
text: the room, MARTY and NED on one side side, ANDY on the
text: other. There is finger-pointing, rancour.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: I just had Catholic friends and
dialog: Protestant friends. And I don’t
dialog: consider myself either. So...
scene_heading: INT. HARP BAR - NIGHT
dialog: 10
text: Back to the 70s. The room is empty again save for TERRI and
text: RUTH, the PAT and the OLD BOY.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: So now nobody likes you?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Now I’m just a bit more choosy
dialog: about my friends. Anyway, you’re
dialog: one to talk, where’s your gang?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: They don’t like dancing as much
dialog: as I do.
text: TERRI reaches over behind the bar for a note pad.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Have you a pen?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m an English student, it’s
dialog: compulsory.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Here, stick your name at the top.
text: RUTH hesitates, shrugs, writes.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: (squinting at the page)
dialog: Are you Martian?
dialog: 11
dialog: 12
dialog: 13
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: RUTH
scene_heading: Stop it. It’s Ruth. R-U-T-H
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Well, R-U-T-H, congratulations,
dialog: you're the first name on my new
dialog: guest list.
scene_heading: EXT. HARP BAR - NIGHT 11
text: RUTH pushes TERRI up against the wire grille over a shop
text: window bearing the sign CLOSING DOWN: EVERYTHING MUST GO.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (up for air)
dialog: Do you want to go back to my mum
dialog: and dad’s?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No. Do you want to go back to my
dialog: mum and dad’s?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No.
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - NIGHT 12
text: RUTH is practically trailing TERRI by the hand.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE AND MARILYN’S HOUSE - NIGHT 13
text: An ancient species of Mimeograph machine sits on a table.
text: MARILYN HYNDMAN - a few years older than Ruth - leans
text: against the wall, smoking, while DAVE HYNDMAN circles it,
text: wrench in his hand, trying to decide which bit to hit.
text: RUTH drags TERRI through, tossing out perfunctory
dialog: introductions
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Dave, Marilyn: Terri. Terri:
dialog: Dave, Marilyn.
scene_heading: EXT. YARD - NIGHT 14
text: The yard has room only for a bin, a bicycle, TERRI and
speaker_heading: RUTH.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I was at a party here one night,
dialog: it was all getting a bit much, so
dialog: I came out here and hid.
dialog: 15
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Where?
text: He follows the line of RUTH’s gaze: the bin.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re not serious.
text: He walks over, lifts the lid, looks inside, then turns to
speaker_heading: RUTH.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Shall we?
text: Hand in hand they each put one leg over then the other,
text: disappearing as though in a variety show magic act. One
text: hand reappears and replaces the bin lid.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: TERRI (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve got a glass eye.
speaker_heading: RUTH (0.S.)
dialog: So shut it.
speaker_heading: TERRI (0.S.)
dialog: Remind me to tell you my John
dialog: Lennon story some time.
speaker_heading: RUTH (0.S.)
dialog: Shut it.
speaker_heading: A CAMERA FLASH
scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - DAY 15
text: A wedding picture on the hall wall: Terri and Ruth.
text: Bags and boxes the length of the hallway. TERRI and RUTH
text: are moving in. DAVE comes in through the front door
text: carrying a large carton. TERRI, behind him, carries an
text: ashtray, into which every so often as he rants he flicks
dialog: ash.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I tell you another thing I hate,
dialog: that word communities. Whenever
dialog: anybody in Northern Ireland says
dialog: community what they’re really
dialog: saying is side
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (from behind the box)
dialog: You're dead right, it’s false
dialog: consciousness.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Whereas collective....
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: «+. people of all religions and
dialog: none working to a common end...
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Mind your feet there, Dave.
text: TERRI bends to set his ashtray on the floor. When he stands
text: ERIC has appeared in the front doorway, looking self-
text: conscious, as well he might under a white cowboy hat. TERRI
text: does an exaggerated double take.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't tell me, it’s Hank
dialog: Williams's birthday? Roy Rogers’?
dialog: Desperate Dan’s?
text: ERIC is unable to get a word in before RUTH passes.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Nice hat, Eric.
text: ERIC gives up. MARILYN comes into the hallway. She stops by
text: a pile of boxes and reads what’s written on the side.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Terri, Terri, Terri, Terri...
dialog: (bends to see last one)
dialog: Terri.
text: She looks around, sees TERRI.
speaker_heading: MARILYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are these all your clothes?
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: (points to a black bag
dialog: on the floor)
dialog: These are my clothes.
dialog: (points to the boxes)
dialog: These are my records.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (lifts a box)
dialog: Where do you want them?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Back bedroom for now.
text: TERRI stands on the doorstep and lights another cigarette.
text: ERIC joins him.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - CONTINUOUS 16
text: A For Sale sign is now marked Sold.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Listen, I came to tell you, I’m
dialog: clearing off to London for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Don’t take it so hard, you’re
dialog: still special.
text: Eric tries to raise a smile without success. He looks over
text: his shoulder.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I got lifted the other night.
text: The scene behind ERIC darkens. He isn’t standing on the
text: doorstep any more, but on a stool, naked and shivering, his
text: hands covering his groin. HOODED MEN stand around him.
text: ERIC, however, continues to talk as though to TERRI.
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: A couple of our old anti-war pals
dialog: were there.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: That fucker Marty?
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: The other crowd.
text: ANDY whips off his mask with one hand, to reveal a leaner,
text: infinitely meaner-looking version of his 60s self; with the
text: other hand he brandishes a pair of sheep shears.
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Except of course they’re all a
dialog: bit more pro-war these days.
text: The other HOODED MEN hold shears too now. They advance on
speaker_heading: ERIC.
text: TERRI winces as the shears flash and snap.
text: One by one the HOODED MEN step back; ANDY is last to go.
text: ERIC is on the doorstep once more.
text: His hand shakes as he takes off the hat. His hair has been
text: savaged.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Fuck me.
dialog: 17
dialog: 18
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Told me I was lucky it wasn't a
dialog: bullet.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: For what, dealing a bit of blow?
text: ERIC leans in and takes hold of TERRI’S wrist.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It’s not the drugs. It’s me, it’s
dialog: you - they try to pass themselves
dialog: off as the school rebels, we show
text: them up as the prefects.
text: He puts the hat back on so that RUTH coming downstairs
text: doesn’t see his hair. He smiles at her, then at TERRI.
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: (in an undertone)
dialog: They want us off the streets.
text: TERRI watches him go.
scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - LATER 17
text: TERRI sits on the sofa, with an Exchange and Mart open at
text: the ‘Records’ page, a couple of ads circled. RUTH lies
text: across his lap. TERRI sets down paper.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You are everything to me.
text: RUTH laughs, taken aback by the suddenness of it all.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I'll settle for being the most
dialog: important.
text: MARILYN comes into the room carrying a box.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Don’t mind me working here.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (into RUTH’s hair)
dialog: Everything.
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - NIGHT 18
text: TERRI walks away from Sorting Office opening a package:
text: records. He walks on past boarded-up shops.
text: A car appears on the far side of the street, traveling in
text: the opposite direction.
dialog: 19
dialog: 20
dialog: 14.
text: TERRI pulls his chin down into his collar as it passes him.
text: The sound of the car fades into the distance, leaving only
text: TERRI’s footsteps.
text: Another car appears, moving slower, faces at the windows.
text: TERRI retreats further into his collar. When the car has
text: travelled a few yards beyond him it does a U-turn and
text: before TERRI has time to run pulls up at the kerbside.
text: A THUG jumps out. He pulls TERRI’s coat over his head and
text: drags him towards the car. TERRI resists.
text: At one stage his head is inside the car. He and the driver,
text: redheaded NED, are eye to eye.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Ned?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: (lifting a wheel brace)
dialog: Here, hit him a whack with this.
text: TERRI in his panic flails, catching NED’s cheek with the
text: record bag. He manages to break free, leaving his coat,
text: sweater, and shirt in the hands of the THUG. Somehow he’s
text: managed to hold on to the bag. He runs. THUG gets out and
text: starts to give chase.
text: Headlights appear further up the street.
speaker_heading: NED (CONT'D)
dialog: Quick, get in.
text: (holding a hand to his
dialog: face)
dialog: You’re a dead man, Hooley!
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 19
text: TERRI, topless, stands back pressed against the wall,
text: breathing heavily.
scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHT 20
text: TERRI, RUTH’s dressing gown over his bare torso, is
text: throwing brandy into him, pacing the floor. Terror has
text: given way to anger. RUTH is trying to get him to sit down.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Wait, wait, you say you knew this
dialog: fella?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: From the Sixties. He was a prick
dialog: then and he’s a prick now, only
text: now he’s a prick with a gun.
dialog: 21
dialog: 22
dialog: 23
dialog: 15.
text: He sits finally, lights a cigarette and closes his eyes.
text: RUTH sits on the arm of the chair beside him. Her gaze
text: roams over his face.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Do you think maybe it’s time we
dialog: got out of here?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No, that’s what they expect -
dialog: that’s what they want.
text: He jumps up, knocking over the bag of records. They spill
text: across the floor. He and RUTH start to pick them up.
text: TERRI stops, straightens. RUTH looks at him.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Terri?
scene_heading: INT. BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY 21
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Say that again.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I want to open a record shop.

speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: ‘Bomb Alley’?
scene_heading: EXT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - DAY 22
text: A down-at-heel three-storey building in a late-Victorian

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You’1l have to use a bit of
dialog: imagination.
dialog: They go in.
scene_heading: INT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - DAY 23
text: It’s a wreck. There’s a dead pigeon on the floor.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (climbing the stairs)
dialog: So, whole-food shop down here.

speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)

dialog: He thinks.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t suppose you have any

scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHT 26
text: TERRI and RUTH face one another across the table. He is

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I got a job.
text: TERRI picks the card up and reads it.

text: The only thing that has changed is the BANK MANAGER’s tie.
text: TERRI is counting out the banknotes RUTH counted out for
text: him: ten, twenty, thirty, and one note more.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: (picks up the notes)
dialog: Forty pounds?
text: He is tempted. He is also a bank manager. A moment.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: You haven't anything a bit
dialog: more... substantial?

scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOX - DAY 28
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (draws on his cigarette)
dialog: No, it was all pretty
dialog: straightforward. The forty quid
dialog: swung it.
text: (runs a finger round the
dialog: phone’s change drawer)
dialog: But, here, I might be home a bit
dialog: late, I just have to go and do
dialog: something about the, ah, sewers.
text: TERRI pulls scraps of paper from his pocket; dials the
text: number written on one particularly dog-eared scrap.
text: A pause. A deep drag.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Marty? Terri Hooley.
scene_heading: INT. JUMBLE SALE - DAY 29
text: TERRI walks up to a stall on which, among the other crap,
text: are two big boxes of records ‘Pick of the Pops’ to the fore
text: of one. He signals to STALL-HOLDER
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I‘ll give you a fiver for the
dialog: whole lot.
scene_heading: INT. HARP BAR - AFTERNOON 30
text: TERRI enters, the very incarnation of Johnny Guitar
text: Watson’s ‘Gangster of Love’, a box under each arm.
text: MARTY is there with a group of REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARIES
text: (the FRIENDS from the 1968 Harp Bar), among them NED,
text: bruising still around his eye.
text: They watch TERRI stop before their table. He looks over his
text: shoulder. ANDY enters with other LOYALIST PARAMILITARIES
scene_heading: (more of the FRIENDS). The REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARIES
text: instinctively rise from their seats hands going towards
dialog: their jackets.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Why doesn’t everybody sit down?
text: Both groups do, a wary distance apart. TERRI occupies the
text: space between them.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: You know the old saying about the
dialog: devil and the long spoon?
dialog: 31
dialog: 32
dialog: 19.
text: Everyone is looking at him, wondering where this is going.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought for a bunch of cunts
dialog: like you a few LPs would probably
dialog: do the trick.
text: He fashions a smile, empties a box on one table, a box on
text: the other and spreads the records out: jumble sale crap.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t all dive at once.
text: A moment. They all dive at once.
scene_heading: INT. HARP BAR - AFTERNOON 31
scene_heading: The tables are closer together. REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARIES
text: and LOYALIST PARAMILITARIES are looking at their albums.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Wait, I already have Desperado.
text: TERRI takes it back, gives him Leo Sayer’s Endless Flight,
text: passes Desperado to the Loyalist side.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Right, everybody happy?
text: Nods, murmurs: they’re happy.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: OK, now, can I ask you something
dialog: in return? See when this shop
dialog: opens, there’s to be no coming
dialog: round looking a “donation” for
dialog: the Republican Prisoners...
dialog: (looks left)
dialog: «+. or the Loyal Orange Widows...
dialog: (looks right)
dialog: And one other thing, there’s to
dialog: be no trying to kill me. Anybody.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Now what about one for the road?
scene_heading: EXT. HARP BAR - LATER 32
text: TERRI stands at the door, smoking. ANDY comes to stand
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That was some performance you put
dialog: on there.
dialog: 33
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I try my best.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: See those ones in there, though?
dialog: They’re not the ones you have to
dialog: worry about. Even the crazies
dialog: remember the times before this
dialog: all started. It’s the ones coming
dialog: up behind them you’re going to
dialog: have to watch out for.
text: He nods across the street to where a couple of young
text: skinheads wait: MUTT and HATCHET (who has a distinctive
text: spiderweb tattoo on his neck).
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’ll take more than a few LPs to
dialog: buy them off.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You underestimate my record
dialog: collection.
text: ANDY pats TERRI’s cheek, without affection. He crosses the
text: street. MUTT and HATCHET fall in behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - DAY 33
text: A life-sized hardboard Elvis comes out the door. TERRI is
text: behind, carrying it. He sets it on the footpath. The words
text: Good Vibrations are painted in red below Elvis’s knees. His
text: left index finger points the way back up the stairs.
text: There is a lame pop. Cheers.
text: The BOD from the Wholefood shop dispenses Elderflower
text: Champagne to DAVE, MARILYN, RUTH, and TERRI. (TERRI slips a
text: flask from his pocket and tops up his own ‘champagne’ with
text: brandy.) A little sea of celebration in the middle of Bomb
text: Alley’s wrecked shop fronts and steel shutters
text: A guy with wild hair and greying beard comes down the
text: street: PUGWASH. He stops and looks.
speaker_heading: PUGWASH
dialog: You actually open?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah, we’re open.
text: PUGWASH raises his arms as though to be searched. TERRI
text: hugs him.
dialog: 34
dialog: 35
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: EXT. GREAT VICTORIA STREET - EVENING 34
text: Night is falling. The street is deserted, the buildings in
text: darkness. There is only one figure in the street: Elvis.
text: There is only one light on: Good Vibrations’s.
scene_heading: INT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - DAY 35
text: A hand (TERRI’s) flicks a light switch; presses a button to
text: open a cash register; pours coins into the drawers; flips
text: open a receipt book. Finally the hand removes a record from
text: a sleeve: the Wailers’ Catch a Fire. Sets it on the
text: turntable; lowers the needle.
text: The music swells; TERRI is at the counter, the Outlaws
text: gallery from the Harp on the wall behind him; he looks up.
text: There are all of two customers, PUGWASH and A.N.OTHER
text: A.N.OTHER lifts an album.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: Great choice, Too Many Saviours
dialog: on my Cross!
text: A.N.OTHER sets it down and leaves.
speaker_heading: PUGWASH
dialog: It'd be wasted on him.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You're probably right.
text: TWO RUC MEN enter.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: FIRST RUC MAN
dialog: See business is going well.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Early days.
speaker_heading: FIRST RUC MAN
dialog: (picks up Wailers
dialog: sleeve: Marley toking)
dialog: Your old chum Eric has left a bit
dialog: of a gap in the market and we
dialog: have our suspicions about who's
dialog: filled it.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What the fuck are you talking
dialog: about? It’s a record shop!
dialog: 36
dialog: 37
dialog: 38
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: FIRST RUC MAN
dialog: So you say. But see if we so much
dialog: as find two cigarette papers in
dialog: the same room, it’1ll be an ex-
dialog: record shop.
text: He sets down the sleeve on his way out. SECOND RUC MAN
text: follows; FIRST RUC MAN turns at the door.
speaker_heading: FIRST RUC MAN (CONT’D)
dialog: By the way, is your man out the
dialog: front anything to do with you?
text: TERRI walks to the window getting there just as the track
text: ends. GEORGE is out on Great Victoria Street, pointing the
dialog: same way as Elvis.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don’t let the name fool you. Good
dialog: Vibrations? Naked capitalism is
dialog: what it is!
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Fuck sake, dad.
scene_heading: EXT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - NIGHT 36
text: It’s the end of the day. Elvis is entering the building,
text: TERRI, as previously, behind.
scene_heading: INT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - NIGHT 37
text: TERRI counts the takings. He lifts the cash drawer to see
text: if he’s missed any. He hasn't.
text: He looks around the empty shop.
scene_heading: EXT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - NIGHT 38
text: TERRI locks up. He lights a cigarette. He hears youthful
text: laughter. His head turns, looks up an alley, at the same
text: moment as RUTH appears behind him
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Boo.
text: TERRI drops the cigarette down his jumper.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought I’d walk you home.
text: TERRI has one hand down his jumper the other hand up. The
text: up hand retrieves the cigarette, the down hand beats his
dialog: chest.
dialog: 23.
text: A TV CREW has set up on the footpath. An earnest journalist
text: - DES - delivers a piece to camera.
speaker_heading: DES
dialog: For the people of Belfast the
text: nightmare continues.
text: TERRI and RUTH walk through his shot without interrupting
dialog: their conversation.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: How was it today?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Another few customers wouldn’t
dialog: hurt. One or two under thirty
dialog: wouldn’t hurt either. What about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I haven’t spoken to anyone over
dialog: the age of twelve.
scene_heading: 39 INT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - DAY 39
text: Another day in the shop. TERRI looks glum.
text: PUGWASH steps up to the counter with a Shangri-las album.
speaker_heading: PUGWASH
dialog: Just the one today, Terri.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Ah, Pugwash, beehives and teenage
dialog: suicide... we obviously share the
dialog: same taste in women. Three pound.
text: PUGWASH goes. Behind him stands an odd-looking urchin. This
text: is FANGS, a Belfast punk, missing a few front teeth.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: Have you ‘Orgasm Addict’?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I think you’re in the wrong shop.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: Buzzcocks?
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: Definitely in the wrong shop.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: Fuck Off?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: If you don’t want to fuck me fuck
dialog: off, the Electric Chairs?
text: TERRI shakes his head. FANGS looks around.
speaker_heading: FANGS (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought this was supposed to be
text: a record shop.
text: They stare at one another. TERRI recognises something in
text: the kid’s attitude. He gets a pen, a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’1l order them.
text: DAVE enters carrying posters, which he gives to FANGS
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Here you go, hot off the press.
text: FANGS instantly hands one to TERRI.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: (not asking, telling)
dialog: Stick that up for us.
scene_heading: TERRI unrolls it: JANUARY 12TH - RUDI AND THE OUTCASTS -
scene_heading: THE POUND, TOWNHALL STREET.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: A gig? Who’s putting that on?
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: Us.
text: TERRI looks at the poster again. When he looks up FANGS is
text: already heading for the door.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Here, where are you hearing all
dialog: that stuff you were asking me
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: Peel.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: John Peel? Last time I heard he
dialog: was playing Pink Floyd.
text: He turns to the wall, looking for a space. When he can’t
text: see one he takes down the Rolling Stones Ulster Hall bill.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, boys.
dialog: 40
dialog: 4l
dialog: 42
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - NIGHT 40
text: TERRI and DAVE and their echoing footsteps are walking away
text: from the city centre. Sound of an army helicopter overhead.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: If I’d known you were going to
dialog: drag me down here I’d never have
dialog: printed that thing.
text: He glances anxiously over his shoulder then has to quick-
dialog: step to catch up with TERRI
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know they used the Pound as a
text: morgue on Bloody Friday.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Fuck sake, Dave.
text: They pass in front of the Albert Clock, round a corner,
text: round another, and there is the Pound, a once-fine bar now
text: barely standing.
scene_heading: EXT. POUND - NIGHT 41
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: There'll be nobody here.
scene_heading: INT. POUND - NIGHT 42
dialog: There are people all right. Young people. PUNKS. It’s
text: another city, another world entirely.
text: The journey from the door to the bar is a crash course in
text: teen vice, 1978 vintage: gropings, playful headbuttings,
text: surreptitious glue-sniffing.
text: TERRI and DAVE squeeze in at the bar. DAVE takes out a
text: pound note, conspicuous amid the PUNKS counting out their
text: coins so of course the BARMAN makes straight for him.
text: The PUNKS glare. TERRI turns to look into the room.
text: On a stage lit by a single fluorescent bulb, four crop-
text: haired teenagers are wrenching out a song (basic even for
text: punk) from their instruments. These are the OUTCASTS.
text: Lead singer GREG COWAN exercises his snarl. Guitarist
text: GETTY, shirt off, concentrates so hard on his guitar, he
text: doesn’t notice the girls concentrating on him.
text: Suddenly a number of RUC MEN come in and start nabbing
dialog: anyone who looks underage (and plenty do), taking names,
dialog: asking for pockets to be turned out.
dialog: 26.
text: TERRI pushes his way through the crowd and buttonholes an
text: RUC MAN, writing down the name of a pink-haired PUNK GIRL.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Excuse me, officer, I’d like to
dialog: report a civil war outside.
text: RUC MAN turns. It’s the man who warned TERRI in the shop.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Not you again.
speaker_heading: FIRST RUC MAN
dialog: Step back, Hooley.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No, really, take your time. The
dialog: bombing, shooting, intimidation,
dialog: that can all wait while you smell
dialog: her breath to see if she’s been
dialog: drinking.
speaker_heading: FIRST RUC MAN
speaker_heading: (to PUNK GIRL)
dialog: Stay you there.
speaker_heading: (to TERRI)
dialog: And, you, I’ve warned you once:
dialog: step back.
text: TERRI steps forward. FIRST RUC MAN’s hand moves towards the
text: gun at his hip. Suddenly a single guitar chord sounds.
text: Another band has taken the stage. What they lack in snarls
text: they make up for in cheek. This is RUDI.
text: Down on the floor TERRI and RUC MAN are still squaring up.
text: RUDI’s singer RONNIE MATTHEWS leans into the mike.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: (more spoken than sung)
dialog: We hate the cops.
text: TERRI and RUC MAN finally look at the stage where RUDI are
text: ripping into ‘Cops’. The audience have forgotten about the
text: actual RUC MEN among them and are singing along.
speaker_heading: PUNKS
dialog: We hate the cops, we hate the
dialog: cops.
text: TERRI joins in, right in NEAREST COP’s face. The atmosphere
text: has changed, the RUC have lost control.
text: By the door of the bar an RUC SERGEANT gives the signal to
text: withdraw. RUC MAN reluctantly backs off TERRI who is giving
dialog: it all he has got.
dialog: 43
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: RUDI/PUNKS/TERRI
dialog: SS RUC, SS RUC.
text: When the last cop has gone there is pandemonium. TERRI is
text: in the thick of it, hugging PUNKS, getting head-butted
text: (accidentally? Maybe not, though he appears not to mind).
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: OK, now that we’ve cleared the
dialog: air a bit... this is ‘Big Time’.
text: At guitarist BRIAN YOUNG’s opening riff the crowd surges
text: forward. Suddenly the fluorescent stage-light falls from
text: the ceiling. RUDI play on regardless in the gloom. FANGS
text: grabs the light, still lit, and swings it above his head.
text: TERRI looks around him - at the kids, at the band, at the
text: waving light - and it is all too much. He starts to cry.
text: Then he jumps up and down with everyone else.
scene_heading: INT. POUND - LATER 43
text: TERRI leans at the bar his head in his hands. DAVE
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (raises his head)
dialog: All right? I’ve lost a tooth,
dialog: been drenched in spit, called a
text: wanker about five hundred times.
dialog: (with a nod to barman)
dialog: And I hate to tell you, but this
dialog: beer tastes like piss... It’s the
dialog: best night I’ve had in Belfast in
dialog: years.
text: He turns. His eye is missing. DAVE hands him the pint glass
text: at his elbow. There is the eye, floating in the beer.
text: TERRI plunges his hand in, shakes the eye dry and pops it
text: back in just as BRIAN and RONNIE of RUDI approach.
text: TERRI pushes DAVE aside.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Boys, where have you been all my
dialog: life?
text: He hugs each one in turn, unaware quite how little the boys
dialog: want to be hugged.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Do we know you?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Terri Hooley. I run a record shop
dialog: and that ‘Big Time’ song...
dialog: (he sings the riff)
dialog: I want that in my shop.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: You can want all you like.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Are you telling me you haven’t
dialog: recorded it?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Recorded it? Who’s going to come
dialog: to Belfast to sign us.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: That’s just the way it is. We
dialog: don’t care.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Fuck sake, raise your
dialog: expectations.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: I‘1l do it. I’11 put it out.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're pissed.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: So what?
text: DAVE arrives at TERRI’s shoulder just in time to hear...
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1ll put that record out.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: (to DAVE)
dialog: How hard can it be?
text: RUDI look at one another and laugh.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Whatever you think, mate.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I'll be in touch during the week.
dialog: You're making a record, fellas.
text: TERRI and DAVE head for the exit.
dialog: 44
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You just can’t go charging into
dialog: something like that... Anyway,
dialog: we're meant to be a collective.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: We are, you can print the
dialog: sleeves.
text: Two OUTCASTS approach, singer GREG, a bottle of cider in
text: his hand, and GETTY, Pink-haired PUNK GIRL hanging on to
text: his... until her BOYFRIEND grabs her back.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Here, will you record us too?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’m not that fucking pissed.
scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHT 44
text: The bedroom door opens with a bang. TERRI framed by the
text: hall light.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You’1l never believe what I’ve
dialog: just seen.
text: RUTH sits up in bed, struggling to open her eyes. TERRI
text: pulls back the covers, gets into bed.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: These kids... they don’t give a

speaker_heading: RUTH

scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHT 45

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: That’s all I need, another two
dialog: Davys in my life.
dialog: (aloud)
dialog: I phoned earlier... Terri Hooley?
text: BRIAN is looking around in wonder. The DAVYS are looking at
text: BRIAN like he’s another life form.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: So when can you fit us in?
text: DAVY SMYTH opens a desk diary.
speaker_heading: DAVY SMYTH
dialog: I don’t know, we’re pretty full.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You're joking me?
speaker_heading: DAVY SMYTH
dialog: We've a couple of flute bands in
dialog: next week, and we've a jingle for
text: cheese and onion crisps.
text: BRIAN has gone for a wander: a kid in a toy shop.
text: TERRI sidles up and drapes an arm over DAVY SMYTH’s
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Come on, is that what you had in
dialog: mind when you set this place up?
speaker_heading: (MORE )

dialog: Flute bands and crisp

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: And what about your rock’n’‘roll

speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: One night a week. They need a
dialog: place of their own.
text: RUTH stares straight ahead at the STRIPPER
text: TERRI approaches the stage; bends down for a closer look at
text: it. Above him the stripper carries on, oblivious.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Better stage than the Pound and
dialog: all.
text: Turns to RUTH.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Those are amazing shoes.
text: STRIPPER smiles.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (to PAT)
dialog: How many does this place hold on
dialog: a good night?
dialog: 55
dialog: 56
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: A good night? I can’t remember
dialog: the last time we had one of them.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I can. It holds three hundred.
dialog: Some of these kids are only wee.
dialog: I'd say three-fifty once the word
dialog: spreads.
text: PAT’s swaying.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Three or four nights a week.

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Bomb scare.

scene_heading: INT. HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - LATER 56
text: TERRI, RUTH, MAVIS and GEORGE are having dinner.
text: Throughout, MAVIS attempts to keep up a hostess’s (and
dialog: mother-in-law’s) politeness.
text: A VOTE HOOLEY poster is clearly visible in the background.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Pass me the salt there.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: The potatoes are lovely.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: They’re George’s own. You should
dialog: get him to take you round the
text: garden after dinner.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You wouldn’t think it, all the
dialog: size of it, but he could feed
text: half the street out of it. And
dialog: many’s the time he has. Haven't
dialog: you, George?
text: GEORGE grunts in reply. He has been biding his time.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
speaker_heading: (to TERRI)
dialog: So you’re a shop owner and a
dialog: record company boss now too, are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
speaker_heading: (to RUTH)
dialog: And how’s your job going?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It would break your heart, some
dialog: of those estates. There’s kids in
dialog: their teens have already given
dialog: up. They think the only way to
dialog: get themselves noticed is to wrap
text: themselves in a flag and pick up
text: a gun.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
speaker_heading: (to TERRI)
dialog: This is the same lad used to

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Catch yourself on, dad.
text: CHILD TERRI disappears.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s not like you think. All I’ve
dialog: promised these bands is to get
dialog: them heard. I’ve sent the record
dialog: out to every record company in
dialog: London.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
speaker_heading: (to TERRI)
dialog: And?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’m still waiting on them getting
dialog: back to me.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Of course you are. It’s the most
dialog: rotten industry there is: bribes,
dialog: payola, cartels. Get involved in
dialog: that you’ll either end up a crook
dialog: or you’ll go broke.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’ll never be a crook.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
speaker_heading: (to RUTH)
dialog: It’s the parents need the talking
dialog: to, not the kids. Kids will only
dialog: do what they’re let get away
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: TERRI
speaker_heading: (to GEORGE)
dialog: Actually, I’m taking a couple of
text: the groups out on the road next

speaker_heading: GEORGE, MAVIS, RUTH
dialog: (as one)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Just a few dates, just to let

speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: Are you sure it’s wise, driving
dialog: around this country in a van at
dialog: night? Those poor fellas who were
dialog: murdered...
text: GEORGE buts in.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Aw, don’t talk to him. He’s an
dialog: impresario. The Lew Grade of
dialog: Great Victoria Street.
dialog: TERRI’s had enough.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: How many elections is it you’ve
dialog: lost? Ten. Did it ever occur to
dialog: you there might be more than one
dialog: alternative?
text: GEORGE is about to come back, but MAVIS has had enough too.
text: She thrusts a gravy boat between them.

speaker_heading: MAVIS

scene_heading: 57 EXT. HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - EVENING 57
text: RUTH and TERRI wave to GEORGE and MAVIS.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (through a fixed smile)
dialog: I’d have to speak to them at work
dialog: about taking time off if you want
dialog: me to cover at the shop.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It’s OK, I’1ll get Pugwash to do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Pugwash? Can you afford him?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’m not going to pay him. He

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: FANGS

speaker_heading: TERRI

text: BRIAN puts his guitar case in the minibus.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Uncle Terri, come on!

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Wait, does anybody know how to
dialog: drive this thing?
speaker_heading: GREG

dialog: Hello, Damascus, we’re RUDI.
text: RUDI play ‘I-Spy’. The rest of the GOOD VIBES CREW huddle

text: The walls are lined with LOCAL LADS looking daggers and
text: LOCAL GIRLS looking torn.
text: TERRI, watching from beside the band, beckons to someone
text: down the hall. A RURAL PUNK kid comes forward, baited by
text: the LOCAL LADS; when he reaches the front he closes his
text: eyes and pogos like his life depends on it.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 63
text: More cows, more sheep, more watchtowers. Posters appear:

scene_heading: EXT. RURAL ROADSIDE - NIGHT 68
text: The van is parked, doors open. The GOOD VIBES CREW are

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: People keep handing me these

text: RONNIE pissing nearest the bus pipes up.
speaker_heading: RONNIE

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SOLDIER 1
dialog: Everybody down on the fucking
dialog: ground! Out! Out! Out!
text: He trails TERRI out of minibus.
text: SOLDIERS everywhere, faces blackened, guns poised. TERRI is

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Whoa! Whoa!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER 1

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: SOLDIER 1

scene_heading: INT. DILAPIDATED VAN - NIGHT 70
text: The van drives through the streets of Belfast. The mood has

scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - MORNING 71
text: TERRI wakes as RUTH gets out of bed. The clothes we saw him
text: in in the last scene are strewn around the room.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Any calls while I was away?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Nothing.

scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - MORNING 72
text: RUTH stands in the living room doorway taking in the scene.

speaker_heading: GETTY

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Well, I’1l see you later.
speaker_heading: GETTY
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - MOMENTS LATER 74

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Should you not be at school?
speaker_heading: FANGS

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: MUTT
dialog: You can’t bar us, we’ve never

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Well, for giving me lip you're
dialog: definitely barred now.
speaker_heading: MUTT
dialog: (in TERRI’s face)
dialog: I know people. I could have you
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I know the same people you know.
dialog: I could have you sent to bed
dialog: without your supper.
text: MUTT glares a moment longer then knocks TERRI’s arm out of
text: the way. Good Vibes CUSTOMERS are massed on the stairs.
text: FANGS, PUGWASH... Even a few of the WHOLEFOOD BODS. MUTT
text: contemplates the odds, thinks better of it, though he can’t

speaker_heading: MUTT
dialog: See from now on? You better make

scene_heading: EXT. HARP BAR - NIGHT 81

speaker_heading: RUTH

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Dear Mr Hooley go fuck

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No, it’s London. Might as well be

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: FEARGAL

speaker_heading: FEARGAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Great. We trek all the way down

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It wasn’t bad.
speaker_heading: FEARGAL
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Wasn't bad...?
speaker_heading: FEARGAL

speaker_heading: TERRI

scene_heading: 84 EXT. GREAT VICTORIA STREET - DAY 84
text: TERRI strides along; FEARGAL keeps up the pace, and chat.
speaker_heading: FEARGAL
dialog: I still think you’re bluffing.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: The thing is - what did you say
dialog: your name was?
speaker_heading: FEARGAL
dialog: Feargal. Feargal Sharkey.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Feargal. The thing is, Good
dialog: Vibrations isn’t really a proper

speaker_heading: FEARGAL
dialog: If we don’t get a record out soon
dialog: it’ll be too late. We’re breaking

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Aw, now don’t lay that on me.

speaker_heading: FEARGAL
dialog: But you put out Rudi.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I know but that was because...
speaker_heading: FEARGAL
dialog: And the Outcasts.

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Tell you what. I’m going over
dialog: there to buy some fags. When I
dialog: get back I'll give you an answer.
dialog: OK?
speaker_heading: FEARGAL
dialog: OK.
text: TERRI crosses over and goes into the shop. He emerges a few

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: DAVY SMYTH
dialog: Never been in a proper studio two

speaker_heading: DAVY SHANNON

scene_heading: INT. WIZARD STUDIO - DAY 86

scene_heading: INT. WIZARD STUDIO - DAY 87

text: TERRI turns his back to put it on, loud as instructed. It’s
dialog: ‘The Internationale’: ‘Stand up you victims of oppression,
dialog: for the tyrants fear your might’ etc.
text: GEORGE meanwhile is taking in the scene, the camaraderie.
text: For a moment it looks as though he might be about to smile.
text: TERRI turns back, catches his eye. GEORGE sets his jaw
text: again, reverting to type. TERRI goes back to turntable,
text: turns the record even louder.
scene_heading: INT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - MUCH LATER 89
text: Only TERRI, RUTH and PUGWASH remain. Piles of Teenage Kicks

speaker_heading: TERRI

scene_heading: INT. ERIC’S PAD - DAY 91

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Have you had a lot of dealings

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: That's like asking a vet if he’s

text: He has produced a bag of white powder.
speaker_heading: ERIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Something to help you on your

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Better not. I can’t afford to

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You'll fuck up if you’re too

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Good point.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET. DAY 92

text: thumbs up. Terri replies in kind.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST RECORD EXEC’S OFFICE. DAY 93
text: An EXECUTIVE, swivels in his seat. He has a fashionable New

speaker_heading: NEW WAVE EXECUTIVE
dialog: Where are the guns?
text: TERRI drops like a lead weight into a chair at the opposite

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: NEW WAVE EXECUTIVE

text: He lifts a copy of the single.
speaker_heading: NEW WAVE EXECUTIVE (CONT’D)
dialog: But then I get... this. Nihilism?
dialog: If anything it sounds like

text: TERRI jumps to his feet, grabs his records and storms out.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND RECORD EXECUTIVE OFFICE. DAY 94
text: This guy looks like a schoolboy.
scene_heading: SCHOOLBOY EXECUTIVE
dialog: They're no oil-paintings are
dialog: they? Have they any good looking
dialog: friends? And we love it when

scene_heading: ROARING DICKHEAD EXECUTIVE

dialog: Cathy, get security up here now.

text: He grabs another.
speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: And this is really shit.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY. DAY 96
text: FOUR PUNKS stand with a soberly-dressed MANAGER, laughing

text: horror as TERRI is frog-marched out by two SECURITY MEN.
scene_heading: EXT. RECORD COMPANY HQ. DAY 97
text: TERRI is thrown on to the street. His bag of records
text: follows behind.
text: He gets up, lifts a bunch of Teenage Kicks, shakes them at
text: the SECURITY MEN - at the whole building.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What is wrong with you people?
text: He turns round, glares at the passers-by - tries with

speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there not one person in this

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: It’s just that all packages have
dialog: to be signed in. Security.
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: It’s a piece of vinyl.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: New regulations.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Can you sign for it?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I’m afraid not.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’ve come all the way from

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
speaker_heading: (to TERRI)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: DES
dialog: Terri?
text: The moaning stops.

speaker_heading: DES (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DES (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t believe it.
text: TERRI clearly hasn’t the first idea who DES is.
speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (to DES)
dialog: Is this man a friend of yours?
speaker_heading: DES
dialog: I was doing a story in Belfast at

dialog: Elevators album...
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Easter Everywhere, International
dialog: Artists deleted it the year after

speaker_heading: (to TERRI)

scene_heading: INT. 12 JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHT 100

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I can’t listen to this.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s only been four nights.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It’s my fault. I should have run

speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. RADIO STUDIO - NIGHT 103

text: The phone rings. RUTH answers.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Hello, Dave. I know, I know,
dialog: isn’t it amazing? Twice in a row!
text: The doorbell rings. TERRI goes to the door. FANGS and two

text: round his wrist. He holds it up like a holy relic.
dialog: 105
dialog: 106
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: John fucking Peel!
text: TERRI stands aside, the PUNKS wander in. TERRI goes out on
text: to the street. All the while the record plays
scene_heading: EXT. JERUSALEM STREET - NIGHT 105
text: TERRI stands in the street, face tilted towards the sky.
text: There’s an army helicopter up there.
text: A spotlight roves backwards and forward. TERRI’s face is by

speaker_heading: FEARGAL (V.O.)
dialog: Get teenage kicks right through
dialog: the night, all right.
speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Terri there’s a fella on the
dialog: phone says he’s from Sire Records
dialog: in London.
text: TERRI continues to look skywards, his eyes slowly closing:
dialog: another prayer answered.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Terri? The fella’s hanging on
dialog: here.
text: He opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Tell him if he wants to talk to

dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT CARPARK - DAY 106
text: In background a plane lands.
text: The ‘fella from Sire’ PAUL McNALLY makes his way, across

text: TERRI leans on the dilapidated van from the Good Vibes
text: tour, holding up a placard on which are written two words:
dialog: ‘The Man’.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Terri Hooley by any chance?
text: TERRI tosses away the ‘Man’ placard.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Have you any fags? I’m right out.
text: He opens the passenger door. GETTY is in the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Getty, he’s driving us to
dialog: Derry.
text: GETTY salutes. PAUL goes to get in the front.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on, you’re in the back.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (about to get out)

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Seymour Stein was knocked out by
dialog: ‘Kicks’.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: ‘Kicks’?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: He turned to me straight away and
dialog: said, ‘I want that band’. That’s
dialog: the way he was with the Ramones:
dialog: ‘I want that band.’
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Wait’1l I tell you, Paul, you
dialog: don’t have to sell Seymour Stein
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You know that all came to
dialog: nothing?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Still, they phoned him. The

scene_heading: INT. FEARGAL SHARKEY’S HOUSE - DAY 109
text: The UNDERTONES, TERRI, MRS SHARKEY are in the sitting room,

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Seymour? I have the band here.

speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: How are you, Mr Stein? Yes, Paul
dialog: has told us the offer...
dialog: (listens a moment)
dialog: Well, tell you the truth we’d be
dialog: hoping for a bit more...
text: (turns to look at the
dialog: others who nod in
dialog: encouragement )
dialog: A lot more: the same as the Rich
dialog: Kids got from EMI...
text: He pulls his head back to avoid the torrent this unleashes
text: from the other end of the line.
text: TERRI lets himself out of the sitting room.
scene_heading: INT. FEARGAL SHARKEY’S HALLWAY - DAY 110
text: TERRI shares the hallway with a Jack Russell, which worries
text: at his trouserleg. The sitting room door opens again. There
text: are raised voices. MRS SHARKEY comes out with a tea tray
text: followed by FEARGAL.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: FEARGAL
dialog: Should you not be in there
dialog: advising us?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You boys should be advising me.
text: The Jack Russell growls.
speaker_heading: FEARGAL
dialog: Is that dog annoying you?
dialog: (before TERRI can say
dialog: anything)
dialog: Sparky, stand up to be searched!
text: Sparky adopts the position, paws spread against the wall.
text: FEARGAL goes back into the sitting room.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Down boy.
text: SPARKY’s tail trembles, but he keeps his paws on the wall.
text: TERRI follows FEARGAL back to the sitting room and the
dialog: raised voices.
scene_heading: INT. DILAPIDATED VAN - DAY 111
text: Moorland. Rain. Only one windscreen wiper is working.
text: Through the cleared part of the window a road sign: Airport
text: 45. BA scratchy version of Adam and the Ants, ‘Young
text: Parisians’ plays. TERRI is in the back again.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I thought for a moment back there
dialog: the whole thing was off. Never
dialog: heard him quite so angry.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Well, you got your band, didn’t
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And what about you, Terri?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, you recorded ‘Kicks’. It’s
dialog: on your label.
text: The tape deck cuts out. GETTY thumps the dashboard to get
text: it going. The sun visor falls off.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You've got the wrong idea about
dialog: me. People who wouldn’t piss on
dialog: me when I was hauling the record
dialog: around London have been on the
dialog: phone offering me twenty thousand
dialog: pounds for it. I told them all to
dialog: fuck off.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Twenty thousand?
dialog: (with a glance at GETTY)
dialog: Well, we can talk about it later.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: We can talk about it now. Getty’s
dialog: as much a part of Good Vibrations
dialog: as I am. They all are.
text: There is a silence, ended by GETTY noisily changing gear.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: How much did you say that van was
dialog: you were looking at, Getty?
speaker_heading: GETTY
dialog: (in the mirror)
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: The van you were looking at over
text: the road from the shop.
speaker_heading: GETTY
dialog: That one? Five hundred and fifty,
dialog: but I’1l get him down to five
dialog: hundred.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: All right then, Paul. Five
dialog: hundred quid.
text: PAUL turns in his seat to face TERRI, trying to decide if
text: he is being serious. GETTY in the mirror is clearly
dialog: wondering the same thing.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Are you sure you don’t want to
dialog: talk about this later?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (rising to the occasion)
dialog: Five hundred quid and a signed
dialog: photo of the Shangri-las.
text: PAUL starts to laugh. TERRI starts to laugh. GETTY
text: continues to watch in the mirror.
dialog: 114
dialog: 63.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT CARPARK — DAY 112
text: PAUL hugs TERRI.
scene_heading: INT. DILAPIDATED VAN - DAY 113
text: TERRI closes the door. GETTY starts the engine.
speaker_heading: GETTY
dialog: I thought at least you’d’ve held
dialog: out for the five magic beans.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Getty, it’s very simple. If they
dialog: can’t buy you they can’t own you.
speaker_heading: GETTY
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It means you and Rudi are going
dialog: to be even bigger than the
dialog: Undertones anyway, aren’t you?
speaker_heading: GETTY
dialog: (emboldened)
dialog: Fucking right.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Fucking right.
text: He looks out the window as PAUL practically skips away.
text: TERRI’s expression could almost be taken for doubt, but
text: only for a second. He takes a bottle of brandy from the
text: glove compartment. Looks out the window again.
scene_heading: INT. HARP BAR - EVENING 114
dialog: A few months later.
text: DAVE, RUTH, MARILYN, TERRI sit in a line at the bar
text: watching a tiny black and white TV on which the UNDERTONES
text: play ‘Get Over You’, wearing their usual skinner jeans.
text: RUTH in particular seems subdued.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Does that make you think a wee
dialog: bit of the Beach Boys?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Makes me think more of a new
dialog: cistern, roof repairs, happier
dialog: bank manager...
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You're starting to sound like an
dialog: accountant.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You're turning me into one.
text: BRIAN walks behind them. Pauses.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Look at the state of those
dialog: trousers. How come they’re on the
dialog: TV and we’re not?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You write some new songs, I’‘1l
dialog: get you on.
text: BRIAN walks off. RUTH looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I'd better be getting on here.
speaker_heading: MARILYN
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Hold on.
text: He swallows as much of his pint as he can, but still
text: abandons half.
text: He stands, ready to leave with RUTH. At that moment a
text: GERMAN JOURNALIST approaches with his PHOTOGRAPHER - the
text: two of them dressed like war correspondents.
speaker_heading: GERMAN JOURNALIST
dialog: Terri Hooley?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: GERMAN JOURNALIST
dialog: The Godfather of Belfast Punk?
text: MARILYN laughs. TERRI himself looks abashed. The
text: PHOTOGRAPHER starts taking photographs: flash, flash, flash
speaker_heading: GERMAN JOURNALIST (CONT'D)
dialog: We would like to make an
dialog: interview with you.
text: TERRI glances towards RUTH. She holds up her hands,
text: resignedly, watching from the door as TERRI sits again.
speaker_heading: GERMAN JOURNALIST (CONT'D)
dialog: So it started for you in 1977,
dialog: 76?
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No, no, no, no - way before that.
dialog: Here
dialog: (retrieves his pint)
dialog: Wait till I tell you, see in the
dialog: 60s...
text: The camera continues to flash. RUTH leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. HARP BAR - MORNING 115
text: The door opens. A night’s worth of cigarette smoke drifts
text: out. GERMAN JOURNALIST and PHOTOGRAPHER emerge, blinking.
text: TERRI brings up the rear. They walk off in opposite
dialog: directions.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - DAY 116
text: TERRI looks out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINY HOUSING ESTATE - DAY 117
text: TERRI gets off bus. The flags as before: all red, white and
text: blue. He turns up the collar of his coat and looks about
text: him then lights a fag and strikes out to the right.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINY HOUSING ESTATE - LATER 118
text: TERRI is still walking and smoking, still holding the brown
text: paper bag. After a few more moments he stops.
text: RUTH is walking along the street towards him. They meet.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (holding out paper bag)
dialog: I brought you your lunch.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS SHELTER - DAY 119
text: RUTH and TERRI look out over the city, eating sausage rolls
text: from the brown paper bag. Or at least TERRI is eating.
text: RUTH bites a small corner off her sausage roll. TERRI
text: watches her slowly chew.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Sorry about last night. You know
dialog: me once I get started.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Why do you think I never let you
dialog: get started?
dialog: 66.
text: She lets him put his arm around her. They sit in silence.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: I’m pregnant.
text: TERRI’s mouth opens; nothing comes out.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’m going to be a daddy.
dialog: It’s unbelievable.
text: RUTH is still looking at him. She was hoping for more.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s brilliant.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You remember the day we moved
dialog: into the house? You told me I was
dialog: everything...
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: And you didn’t want to be.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That’s not what I said. I said...
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You'd settle for being the most
dialog: important thing.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Well from now on we’ll both have
dialog: to settle for being the second
dialog: most important.
text: They sit.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Shit, I told those German fellas
dialog: I'd take them to see the Pound.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I'd better be getting back to

text: She brushes pastry flakes from her lap.

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: We'll be absolutely fine. I’11l

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (as the bus doors close)
dialog: Just be there.
text: The bus with TERRI on it pulls away.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER 120
text: TERRI is searching in his pocket. He pulls out his hand:
text: there are half a dozen coppers. He stares at them a moment.
text: Shoves them back in. Searches in the other pocket, pulls
text: out his matches. He tries to light a cigarette, but his
text: hand shakes so much it takes him two matches.
text: The flags on the lampposts when he looks up have changed
text: from red, white and blue to green, white and orange. TERRI
text: sits forward in his seat. Something has caught his eye.
text: Reflected on the windows a street protest fronted by WOMEN
text: wearing only blankets, carrying pictures of young IRA men
text: above the words ‘Political Prisoner’. OTHERS have posters
text: saying ‘Smash H Block’. The whole thing is eerily silent.
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET — DAY 121
text: A wall with a single poster for a Smash H Block rally, 3rd
text: March 1979. TERRI slaps a Harp poster over it and walks
dialog: away.

text: They are squeezed tightly together: nose to nose. Not much
text: more room than they would have in a bin.
text: They start their descent.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: For god's sake, Terri. Why didn’t
dialog: you tell me? I believed in you. I
dialog: was there every step of the way.
dialog: What made you think I wouldn’t
dialog: have gone along with that too?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It was one moment. I just did it.
dialog: I wasn’t thinking. I never
dialog: thought. The same as with Big
dialog: Time - I just did it. Same as
dialog: with the tour - I just did it.
dialog: The Harp, Teenage Kicks - I just
dialog: did it. It’s how I operate. It’s
dialog: who I am. And you know what - I
dialog: haven’t done too badly.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Open your eye, Terri.
text: The lift shudders to a halt: ground floor
text: RUTH pulls open the door and walks out. TERRI is left
text: contemplating the full-length mirror she was standing in
dialog: front of: he’s an absolute mess.
text: The lift starts going down. No floors below ‘ground’, but
text: still it goes down, and down, darker and darker. TERRI
text: stares at his reflection. Grotesque.
scene_heading: INT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - NIGHT 168
text: TERRI sits alone staring at the picture of him from the
text: magazine, or it stares at him. Sonny Bono, ‘Laugh At Me’ on
text: the record player. He is shitfaced.
text: A noise. He looks up. MUTT and HATCHET stand there.
speaker_heading: MUTT
dialog: We saw your light on.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I thought I told you were barred.
dialog: 85.
text: MUTT ignores him. HATCHET is picking up records, looking at
text: them, and tossing them over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Go, on, fuck off, find a couple
dialog: of old ladies to frighten.
speaker_heading: MUTT
dialog: You're very funny. Isn’t he,
dialog: Hatchet? Isn’t he very funny?
text: HATCHET grunts.
speaker_heading: MUTT (CONT'D)
dialog: Actually, this is a business
dialog: call. Me and Hatchet’s in a band
dialog: now. Aren’t we Hatchet?
text: HATCHET grunts again.
speaker_heading: MUTT (CONT'D)
dialog: Tight wee unit.
text: HATCHET sniggers.
speaker_heading: MUTT (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck sake, Hatchet, behave.
speaker_heading: (to TERRI)
dialog: Thought you might be interested
dialog: in our demo tape. We were going
dialog: to call it ‘The Only Good Wog’s a
dialog: Dead Wog’, then we thought ‘The
dialog: Only Good Taig’, but then we
dialog: thought ‘The Only Good One’s a
dialog: Dead One’ covered pretty much
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’d sooner sell bog rolls than
dialog: Nazi shite like that.
text: For all his bravado, he is scared here. He is edging as he
text: speaks - and as well as someone so shitfaced can edge -
text: towards the door. HATCHET bars the way.
speaker_heading: MUTT
dialog: You’1l sell what I tell you to
dialog: sell. I’m used to getting my own
dialog: way. Ask the fellas you used to
dialog: say would put me to bed.
text: He sticks the head in TERRI. HATCHET weighs in. A flurry of
text: kicks and punches. When it is finished MUTT leans over
speaker_heading: TERRI.
speaker_heading: MUTT (CONT'D)
dialog: You made such a big deal about
dialog: not letting me in here.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 170
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: MUTT (CONT'D)
dialog: And look at it. It’s fuck all.
dialog: You're fuck all. You fucking
dialog: lost.
text: HATCHET pulls a record rack over on top of TERRI, who
dialog: hasn't moved since the beating ended.
text: MUTT leaves; HATCHET delivers a final kick to the head.
scene_heading: INT. TERRI’S WORLD - NIGHT AND DAY JUMBLED TOGETHER 169
text: The music is distorted becoming the soundtrack as HATCHET’s
text: kick to the head takes us - as in scene 2 - on an
dialog: accelerated journey into Terri’s world, not the future this
text: time, but the past, a collapsing together of many of the
text: moments that have made up the film, as far back as CHILD
text: TERRI, with his turntable, sticking his head above the
text: hedge, interspersed with lights and looming faces - DOCTOR,
text: GEORGE, MAVIS - and a single word, repeated:
speaker_heading: MAVIS (0.S.)
dialog: Open your eye.
scene_heading: INT. HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - DAY 170
dialog: Black.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (0.S.)
dialog: Open your eye.
text: Black, a moment more.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Very funny. The other one.
text: TERRI opens his seeing eye. MAVIS stands before him, a
text: bottle of surgical spirit and a wad of cotton wool in her
dialog: hand.
text: TERRI is seated at the table, on the mend, but still
text: battered-looking.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: That must have been some door?
dialog: What was it, a car ferry?
text: MAVIS ministers to a few more of his bruises and abrasions.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t suppose there’s any point
dialog: me mentioning the police.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: They’d want to buy the door a
dialog: drink.
dialog: 171
dialog: 87.
text: MAVIS has tilted his face up and is looking into it.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: I never knew a wee boy as bad at
dialog: keeping his head out of harm’s
dialog: way. People used to tell me I was
dialog: lucky, girls were the hard ones
dialog: to raise. You caused me more
dialog: anxiety growing up than a whole
dialog: hockey team.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Well I'd like to meet this hockey
dialog: team to discuss it...
text: MAVIS bats him, absentmindedly. TERRI winces.
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: You’re a married man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Supposed to be.
text: Suddenly irritated she goes to the window. She raps the
text: glass. Hard.
speaker_heading: MAVIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Where is that man? I told him ten
dialog: minutes ago his tea was ready.
dialog: It’ll be stone cold.
text: TERRI gets up takes the cup from the countertop.
scene_heading: EXT. HOOLEY FAMILY HOME - DAY 171
text: The back garden: small but ingeniously planted for maximum
text: yield and colour. GEORGE straightens from a flowerbed as
text: TERRI approaches.
text: They sit on a small bench.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Garden's looking well.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That’s what all the dirty work in
dialog: winter’s for.
text: TERRI looks down at the mug. He’s almost forgotten he was
text: holding it.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did your mother send you out with
dialog: that?
dialog: 172
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I thought I better offer before
text: she put the window in. She was
dialog: getting herself worked up about
dialog: me and Ruth.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: She has very strong views on
dialog: marriage. She wouldn’t have
dialog: stayed with me all these years
dialog: otherwise.
text: They sit on a small bench.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember that dig you had at me
dialog: about all those elections
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Da, I’m sorry...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It wasn’t ten, it was twelve. The
dialog: returning officer used to say if
dialog: I was a horse they’d have shot me
dialog: after the sixth. But do you know
dialog: what? I have friends and comrades
dialog: living all over his city. And do
dialog: you know what else? In every
dialog: election I increased my vote.
text: TERRI’s gaze is locked on his father’s face. He looks as
text: though he might hug GEORGE, but GEORGE, unaware of this (or
text: perhaps not so) chooses this moment to empty his tea leaves
text: on to the flowerbed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Victory doesn’t always look the
dialog: way other people imagine it.
scene_heading: INT. 102 GREAT VICTORIA STREET - EVENING 172
text: RUDI members slouch against the wall nearest the door. DAVE
text: stands only a few feet further in, arms folded tight.
text: TERRI at moments in this scene is picking things up off the
text: floor, the counter: a physical counterpart to his verbal
dialog: attempts to set things straight.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: All right. A few apologies are in
dialog: order.
text: RUDI and DAVE look like they agree.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Brian, you want to start?
dialog: 89.
text: Expectation turns to confusion on BRIAN’s face.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m only messing you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Dave?
text: DAVE opens his mouth to protest. TERRI doesn’t let him.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, I'll hold my hand up,
dialog: I’ve taken my eye off the ball,
dialog: but we haven’t time for arguing.
dialog: It’s time to focus. We’ve a gig
dialog: to organise.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: A gig?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: A Good Vibrations gig.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: A fundraiser?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Yeah, a fundraiser.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No harm to you, Terri, but unless
dialog: you're charging a hundred quid a
dialog: head I think it’s maybe gone
text: beyond a night at the Harp.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Who said anything about the Harp?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The Pound then...
dialog: (TERRI is smiling: not
dialog: the Pound either)
dialog: The Students’ Union?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Try ‘Ulster Hall’.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Ulster Hall?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Because the Ulster Hall holds two
dialog: thousand people.
dialog: 173
dialog: 174
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I know how many it holds, I've
dialog: been in it often enough.
text: DAVE takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: OK, OK, we call in favours - we
dialog: get Siouxsie back to headline.
dialog: Fuck it, we call the Clash, Stiff
dialog: Little Fingers...
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Fucking showbands. We don’t need
dialog: them. It’s a Good Vibrations gig,
dialog: it’1l be Good Vibrations bands.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Terri, we're talking two thousand
dialog: people. Be realistic.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: What, like you were realistic
dialog: when you brought me round this
dialog: place?
text: As he speaks, the record racks disappear. DAVE and TERRI
text: stand in the derelict building. They look at one another.
text: A beat. And they have returned to GOOD VIBRATIONS. TERRI -
text: still setting things straight - pulls the German magazine
text: cover from the wall.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How many posters do you think
dialog: you'll need?
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREETS — DAY 173
text: BRIAN is postering. GREG is postering; so too FANGS, GETTY,
text: RONNIE, LANKY PUNK, and TERRI of course.
text: He stands before a wall with NF and SHANKILL SKINS scrawled
text: on it. He slaps a poster over the top. ‘Outcasts. Moondogs,
dialog: Ruefrex, Rudi, Big Self,’ it reads, ‘24th April 1980,
dialog: Ulster Hall.’
scene_heading: EXT. BELFAST STREET - LATER 174
text: RUTH is pushing a buggy. She passes a wall with Good
text: Vibrations posters. She stops. Looks. The posters have been
text: pasted up in such a way that they spell out the word LIVE.
dialog: 175
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: INT. ULSTER HALL - EVENING 175
text: A hand flicks a light switch, then another, then another,
text: and another. One by one the lights come up on the Ulster
text: Hall. Which is empty.
text: TERRI stands on the edge of the stage. He looks worried.
text: DAVE walks out behind him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Where the fuck is everyone?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: It‘ll be all right. They’1l come.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: We've hardly sold a ticket.
text: RONNIE has wandered on stage. He sings into the microphone,
text: to the tune of ‘Pressure’s On’, and mostly tongue in cheek.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: (tongue in cheek,
dialog: mostly)
dialog: Well you fucked up that, and you
dialog: fucked up this, so fuck knows,
dialog: Terri, why we’re doing this...
text: A door opens at the far end of the hall. A balding, bearded
text: figure in a blazer comes walking towards them. TERRI and
text: DAVE peer at him, looks of recognition and disbelief.
text: RONNIE has spotted the figure now as well.
speaker_heading: RONNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s John fucking Peel.
text: TERRI and DAVE get down from the stage.
speaker_heading: JOHN PEEL
dialog: Always nice to get the full name.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I can’t believe you came.
speaker_heading: JOHN PEEL
dialog: You gave me the best two minutes
dialog: and twenty-eight seconds of my
dialog: life, how could I not come? I’m
dialog: just glad I got here in one
dialog: piece.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Rough journey?
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: JOHN PEEL
dialog: Oh, no, the flight was fine. I
dialog: mean getting through the doors of
dialog: this place.
speaker_heading: (seeing TERRI and DAVE’S
dialog: blank looks)
dialog: You mean you haven’t had a look
dialog: out the front?
scene_heading: 176 EXT. ULSTER HALL - EVENING 176
text: TERRI, DAVE, and JOHN PEEL at an upstairs window look down
text: on a street thronged with PUNKS and overstretched RUC MEN.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Didn't I tell you?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (finding the cloud in
dialog: the silver lining)
dialog: Fuck, I hope they’re going to let
dialog: this go ahead.
scene_heading: 177 INT. FOYER ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 177
text: A trickle of PUNKS is being let in. The combined might of
text: the DOOR STAFF and the RUC can barely hold back those still
text: outside. TERRI remonstrates with FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Can you not just throw the doors
dialog: open?
scene_heading: FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER
dialog: I'd be within my rights to shut
text: them altogether. Half of them are
text: full drunk and the other half are
text: trying to run in without paying.
text: FANGS forces his way to the fore of the crowd at the door.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: Terri!
text: An RUC MAN pushes him back with a hand in the face.
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: Hold on. He’s on the guest-list.
dialog: (to Fangs)
dialog: Come on, move your arse.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: What about my mates?
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Hurry up.
dialog: 178
dialog: 179
dialog: 93.
text: TERRI waves them through too: about a dozen in all. Hands
text: shoot up here there and everywhere at the doors.
speaker_heading: PUNKS
dialog: Terri! Terri! Am I on the list?
text: TERRI looks at the FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER; he looks at the
text: BOX OFFICE STAFF, waiting by their tills. He looks back at
text: the doors, the RUC MEN, the waving hands of PUNKS outside.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (shouts )
dialog: Don’t worry, you'll all get in.
text: The FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER walks away.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 178
text: Sounds of Ruefrex from the stage. RONNIE watches in the
text: wings. BRIAN practices licks on his unplugged guitar.
text: Nearby JOHN PEEL talks to GETTY, whose interest is torn
text: between PEEL and Pink-haired PUNK GIRL across the room.
speaker_heading: JOHN PEEL
dialog: What amazes me is that punk has
dialog: more or less died out everywhere
dialog: else...
speaker_heading: GETTY
dialog: You around after the show, John?
dialog: (heading for the girl)
dialog: I‘1l buy you a pint.
speaker_heading: JOHN PEEL
dialog: (to thin air.)
dialog: Yeah, buy me a pint.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 179
text: The logjam at the doors has been broken. A few PUNKS are
text: showing tickets at the box office. Many more are walking
text: straight in, past the RUC MEN, past TERRI.
scene_heading: INT. ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 180
text: RUDI leave the stage, elated. GREG waits to go on.
speaker_heading: GREG
text: Cheers for warming them up.
text: RONNIE scowls.
text: The hall is so full now there are PUNKS on stage. There are
text: RUC MEN too in the shadows at the very back.
dialog: 94,
text: To a huge ovation, JOHN PEEL appears and eventually speaks.
speaker_heading: JOHN PEEL
dialog: You're a good audience. People
dialog: always say Belfast is the best
dialog: audience. And now here’s your
dialog: best band - the Outcasts.
text: OUTCASTS come running on.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Right, this one’s for everybody's
dialog: favourite people in the world.
dialog: Rudi’s already give you a song
dialog: about them. This one’s called
dialog: ‘The Bastards are Coming’.
text: They launch into ‘The Cops are Coming’ and JOHN PEEL is
dialog: right, they do sound finally like the best band in Belfast.
text: PUNKS on stage bait the RUC who do nothing; nothing at all.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 181
text: ‘The Cops are Coming’ is thudding through the walls. DAVE
text: and FRONT OF HOUSE MANAGER are deep in conversation.
text: Neither looks happy.
scene_heading: INT. ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 182
text: The OUTCASTS are finishing ‘Self-Conscious Over You’.
text: GETTY’s shirt is off; GREG’s grin is broader than ever.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: And now I'd like to welcome on
dialog: stage the man who made all this
dialog: possible...
text: TERRI’s name is lost in the roar as he walks out from the
text: wings ‘OUTCASTS’ across the back of his leather jacket.
text: FANGS grabs the mike from GREG.
speaker_heading: FANGS
dialog: Terri is our leader, Terri is our
dialog: leader, na-na-na-na...
text: TERRI takes the mike from him. He is barely audible above
text: the stomping and whistling.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: No leaders! No godfathers!
text: A kind of quiet returns. TERRI breathes deeply, scanning
text: the faces.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you for coming. When I look
dialog: out at you all gathered here it
dialog: confirms something that I’ve
dialog: always felt: New York has the
dialog: haircuts, London has the
dialog: trousers, but Belfast has the
dialog: reason. Good Vibrations isn’t a
dialog: record shop, it isn’t a label,
dialog: it’s a way of life.
scene_heading: 183 INT. BACKSTAGE ULSTER HALL - MOMENTS LATER 183
text: Tumult out front. TERRI runs offstage triumphant. DAVE is
text: waiting for him, fuming.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Isn’t it incredible.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It’s fucking unbelievable.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (oblivious)
dialog: The best night ever.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Terri, we’ve made a loss. We’ve
text: packed out the Ulster Hall and
dialog: we've somehow made a fucking
dialog: loss. Your man at the front says
dialog: you had the longest guest list in
dialog: the hall’s entire history, longer
dialog: than all the other guest lists
dialog: put together. And all of it
dialog: apparently carried in your head.
text: He has been getting closer and closer to TERRI. His hands
text: suddenly shoot out and grab TERRI by the throat.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Terri, the whole point of tonight
dialog: was to raise money.
speaker_heading: TERRI
text: (trying to prise open
dialog: Dave's fingers)
dialog: No, Dave, it wasn’t. Not the
dialog: whole point. Money couldn't buy
dialog: what we’ve just done.
text: He finally succeeds in loosening Dave’s grip. Gasps.
speaker_heading: TERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: We've taken back Belfast tonight.
dialog: 184
dialog: 96.
text: The chanting is getting louder. Terri’s name. DAVE finally
text: hears it. With a flash of the OUTCASTS on his jacket, TERRI
text: goes to run back on stage and runs straight into RUTH.
dialog: She's heard everything.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You and your guest lists.
text: TERRI looks shamefaced.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: About what? The house? Sure it’s
dialog: only bricks.
text: The chanting from the crowd is louder still.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: You're wanted.
text: (jabs a finger into his
dialog: chest)
dialog: But you still owe me forty quid.
text: She walks away. TERRI goes to speak, but there is nothing
text: to say. He runs on.
scene_heading: INT. ULSTER HALL - NIGHT 184
text: RUDI and the other bands have joined the OUTCASTS on stage.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: We're all going to do an old
dialog: Sonny Bono number, because we
dialog: fucking can.
dialog: And they fucking play ‘Laugh at me’:
scene_heading: TERRI/OUTCASTS/RUDI
dialog: Why can’t I be like any guy, why
dialog: do they try to make me run, son
dialog: of a gun now, what do they care
dialog: about the clothes I wear, why get
dialog: their kicks from making fun...
text: TERRI’s eye lights on RUTH, dancing on her own.
speaker_heading: TERRI/OUTCASTS/RUDI (CONT'D)
dialog: This world’s got a lot of space
dialog: and if they don’t like my face it
dialog: ain’t me that’s going anywhere,
dialog: no. So I don’t care, then laugh
dialog: at me, if that’s the fare I have
dialog: to pay to be free...
dialog: 97.
text: GREG drapes an arm around TERRI. TERRI glances to his right
text: and instead of GREG it’s HANK WILLIAMS, his rhinestone suit
text: replaced by a studded jacket. TERRI carries on singing.
scene_heading: TERRI/OUTCASTS/RUDI... HANK
dialog: Then laugh at me, and I'll cry
dialog: for you and I'll pray for you and
dialog: I‘1l do all the things that the
dialog: man upstairs says to do, I’1l do
dialog: them I’1l1 do them all for you...
