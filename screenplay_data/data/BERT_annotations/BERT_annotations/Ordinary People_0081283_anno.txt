dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: You are beautiful. And you are
dialog: unpredictable. But you're so
dialog: cautious. You're determined, Beth.
dialog: But you know something? You're not
dialog: strong. And I don't know if you're
text: really giving. Beth is looking at
dialog: him not knowing what this is about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALVIN (cont'd)
dialog: Tell me something. Do you love me?
dialog: Do you really love me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: We would've been all right, if
dialog: there hadn't been any ...mess.
dialog: But you can't handle mess.
dialog: You need everything neat and
dialog: ...easy.
dialog: I don't know. Maybe you can't
dialog: love anybody. It was so much
dialog: Buck. And Buck died, it was as if
dialog: you buried all your love with
dialog: him, and I don't understand that.
dialog: I just don't know.
dialog: 
text: Calvin sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALVIN (cont'd)

speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: Yeah, yeah, Haul my ass a little,
dialog: you know. Get after me. The way you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: Oh, he needed it. You didn't. You

dialog: never had the heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONRAD
dialog: Oh, Dad. Don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALVIN
dialog: No, it's the truth. I... I never

speaker_heading: CONRAD (cont'd)
