scene_heading: EXT. SAL'S BAR & GRILL - NIGHT 1
text: A seedy neighborhood. LARRY "DOC" SHEPHERD, wearing a heavy
text: windbreaker, stands idly on the street. An AWOL bag is on the
text: sidewalk at his feet. A garment bag is slung over his
text: shoulder. He studies the little working-man's bar across the
text: street as the title "DECEMBER 13, 2003" comes up.
scene_heading: INT. SAL'S BAR & GRILL - NIGHT 2
text: Small and dark. A pool table, a few booths, not much decor.
text: SAL NEALON leans on his elbows on his side of the bar, doing
text: a crossword. He's in his late 50s and wears a cropped
text: mustache, going gray, like the sides of his short-cropped
text: hair. He wears a black T-shirt, revealing a USMC tattoo on
text: his arm. He smokes a cigar, chewing its end more than it
dialog: needs. An edgy dude - you wouldn't want to fuck with him. At
text: the other end of the bar, COPS is on a TV that hangs
text: suspended from the ceiling. On the show, a nervous couple try
text: to explain to a sarcastic cop what they are doing in the
text: projects if not buying drugs. Sal's only customer, O'TOOLE,
text: an old functioning alcoholic, is watching. At some point Doc
text: enters, pausing near the door. O'Toole gives him a cursory
text: glance. Doc hangs his garment bag on a hook on the stanchion
text: and takes a stool. He puts his AWOL bag on another stool and
text: settles down with a little uncertainty.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I ask you, you ever see these cops
dialog: catch a killer or a rapist on this
dialog: show? Ever see them put the cuffs
dialog: on some crooked CEO fuck?
text: Wanders over to Doc.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: What can I get you?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Beer.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Bottle or draft?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Draft.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
text: Sal walks back over and starts filling up a glass while he
text: continues his conversation with O'Toole.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Nah, they're always just drug users
dialog: and johns... just people hurtin',
dialog: trying to find a little pleasure in
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: O'TOOLE
dialog: What have you got against cops?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Nuttin'. What I got something
dialog: against is good ol' stupidity.
text: Sal wanders back to Doc and serves him the beer. Doc looks
text: into a manila envelope and withdraws a five dollar bill and
text: lays it on the bar.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: You comin' or goin'?
speaker_heading: DOC
text: Passing through, kind of.
dialog: (about money)
dialog: Keep it.
text: Sal takes Doc's money, puts it in the register, and goes back
text: to his crossword.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: Good beer.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yeah, it's from Pennsylvania.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: How long have you had this place?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Too long.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: It's real homey.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You think so? Where the hell do you
dialog: live?
text: Doc doesn't get Sal's wit.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: New Hampshire. Portsmouth.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
text: Sal is back on his puzzle.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
text: Home of the Navy prison.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I know the place.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: It's an okay town.
dialog: (drinks)
dialog: So you're Sal.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: That I am.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: So Sal, how do you suppose I knew
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: SAL
text: Name's on the sign outside.
text: Doc smiles, looks around, turns to O'Toole.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Not exactly a hot spot, huh?
speaker_heading: O'TOOLE
dialog: Not anymore.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I like it, though. It's homey.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yeah, you said that. That's why I
dialog: was worried about where you lived.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You don't remember me, do you?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I don't remember half the women I
dialog: fucked, and that's just the ones I
dialog: didn't have to pay. How am I
dialog: supposed to remember you?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Well, I remember you.
text: Sal looks at him more closely, squints. The cigar droops.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Can't be.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Could be.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Way.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Sweet Jesus... Doc?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (bemused )
dialog: Doc... Nobody's called me that ina
text: long, long time.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Fuck me. You made it, Doc.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: O'Toole, look at this. Old buddy
dialog: from 'Nam. I saved his life once.
speaker_heading: O'TOOLE
dialog: Then you must be some kind of
dialog: fuckin' hero.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: He never saved my life.
speaker_heading: O'TOOLE
dialog: Didn't think so.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: And now he's come to kick my ass.
speaker_heading: O'TOOLE
text: Long overdue and well deserved.
dialog: I'll hold his coat for him.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: No, I'm not here for that.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You gotta excuse me, Doc. I'm shit
dialog: for names.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Shepherd. Larry Shepherd.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Right. Shepherd. Nineteen year-old
dialog: kid. Navy corpsman.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Once.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yeah, well, we were all something
dialog: once. Now we're something else.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: So you do remember me?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: ‘Course I do, you saved my fuckin'
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: O'TOOLE
dialog: I thought it was the other way
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You heard, I got busted down to E-
dialog: One?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Most unfair. The green weenie -
dialog: they broke it off in you. What can
dialog: I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: How's Mueller?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Ol' Mueller the Mauler. Maybe he's
dialog: alive. How should I know? Have
dialog: another beer. On the house. Fuck,
dialog: I'll have one with you.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You're not in touch with him?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Saw him medevacked out, and that's
dialog: all she wrote.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Mueller got hit?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Oh, yeah, you weren't there by
dialog: then... it was not pretty.
text: Sal now comes over closer to Doc.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: I still think I rate credit for a
dialog: save.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Who? What?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You, you fuck. I saved your life.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I don't remember anything like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Captain said, Doc is coming
dialog: unhinged. He's gonna blow. Take him
dialog: for two days to Pleiku. Show him
text: around Disneyland.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I do remember Disneyland.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Hell yeah you do.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: But all I remember is gettin' laid
dialog: and drunk.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Well, yeah... that's why it was
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Mueller was with us.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I did that too. I said, Cap'n,
dialog: Doc's too fucked up for one person
dialog: to handle. Take Mueller, he said.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh, yeah, and things were much
dialog: better after that.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: C'mon, Doc, we had a good time,
dialog: didn't we? We had some fun.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Sure we did. Not sayin' we didn't.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: We did, the three of us.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yeah. I laugh sometimes when I
dialog: think about it.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Really? Do you?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yeah, kind of.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Why not? You got to laugh at every-
dialog: fuckin-thing. I laugh at my
dialog: prostate gland, little son of a
dialog: bitch, laugh every time the doctor
dialog: gives me a fingerwave, two times a
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: It's good you know how to do that.
dialog: Wish I could do that.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: So what was it, three years?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Ended up about two, with good
dialog: behavior.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: That's not so bad.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: It was pretty bad, but it was a
dialog: long time ago.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: BCD?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yeah, but at some point instead of
dialog: calling it a Bad Conduct Discharge,
dialog: I started calling it a better
dialog: career decision.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Fuckin-A. You're alive and upright.
dialog: So you got out, and then what? You
dialog: stayed there?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Didn't really have anywhere else to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Fuck all. Listen here, how did you
dialog: find my lonesome ass?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Easy. On the internet. You can find
dialog: anybody on the internet these days.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: That's fucked.
text: Doc kind of laughs as O'Toole gives them fresh beers.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: So whaddaya do in Portsmouth, for a
dialog: living?
speaker_heading: DOC
text: Stocking clerk, at the Navy
dialog: Exchange.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You're shitting me.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (old joke between them)
dialog: I wouldn't shit you, you're my
dialog: favorite turd.
text: LATER - O'Toole is asleep on the pool table. Doc is crawlirig
text: into a booth. Sal is also finding a spot to lay down.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: (stretching out)
dialog: Don't you go someplace when you
dialog: close?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Like where?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I don't know, home?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: It'll be there tomorrow.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - MORNING 4
text: A dreadful little space full of generational stains and
text: graffiti. Sal washes his face, pulls out some paper towels
text: and dries. He looks at his reflection in the mirror. This is
text: the face he has earned. This is the place he has landed.
scene_heading: INT. SAL'S BAR & GRILL - MORNING 5
text: Doc and O'Toole are still asleep. Sal draws a beer, starts
text: eating a cold piece of pizza.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Reveille, reveille, drop your cocks
dialog: and grab your socks. Reveille!
text: Sal has to stir Doc. Finally he wakes up and looks at Sal.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: You want a beer? This is the last
dialog: of the pizza.
text: Doc shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm still a little fucked up from
dialog: last night. I'm getting too old for
dialog: this shit, frankly.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: What's the deal with the grill part
dialog: of Sal's Bar & Grill?
speaker_heading: SAL
text: Gone to rust is the deal.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Too bad.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Used to put out a righteous burger.
dialog: Serious meat with a nice slice of
dialog: raw onion and nothin' else, except
dialog: for mustard and ketchup, of course.
dialog: No lettuce or pickles or any of
dialog: that crap. But people lost their
dialog: taste for honest hamburgers, so I
dialog: let the grill go. Why? You hungry?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Just curious.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: There's Mexicans here now, so we
dialog: can get some chorizo con huevos.
dialog: Hell, we qualify for menudo. You
dialog: got the balls for that?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: No, thanks. There's something I'd
dialog: like to show you, though, if you're
dialog: up for it.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I'm always up for it. Shoot.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You got a car?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I'm a fuckin businessman, of course
dialog: I got a car.
dialog: (stirs O'Toole)
dialog: Yo, O'Toole, open up for me today,
dialog: okay?
text: O'Toole nods his head, then goes back to sleep.
scene_heading: INT. SAL'S TAURUS - MORNING - MOVING 6
text: Not much of a car. A 20-year-old Taurus Wagon. Sal drives
text: through a light drizzle, on a rural road.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I just fuckin' love it, you know?
dialog: It's like priceless.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: The Navy. They put the cock to
dialog: you, then they let you work at the
dialog: Navy fuckin' Exchange.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I got five people under me.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You're a fuckin' inspiration.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You know what amazes me about you?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Could be anything. I'm a pretty
dialog: amazing guy.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You turn over your bar to a
dialog: customer, you get in your car, and
dialog: you drive me to hell and gone, and
dialog: you don't even know where we're
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I didn't think it would take so
dialog: fuckin' long.
text: Doc refers to a folded up MapQuest sheet of paper.
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL CHURCH - MORNING 7
text: A humble building that might have been a barn once. It lacks
text: a steeple and stained glass, but it makes up for it with the
text: spirit we will encounter inside. We see the Taurus Wagon in
text: the parking lot.
speaker_heading: SAL (0.S.)
dialog: You gotta be kiddin' me.
scene_heading: INT. SAL'S TAURUS - MORNING 8
text: Sal looks at the place, doubtfully.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: C'mon, you're gonna love this. I
dialog: promise.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I don't know, Doc, you seen one,
dialog: you seen them all.
text: Doc grins as they start to get out of the car.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - MORNING 9
text: A small black congregation, listening intently to a sermon.
text: Sal and Doc enter, drawing some notice, but then space is
text: made for them. A middle-aged preacher is at the pulpit with
text: the aid of a cane. It is MUELLER.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: ..--Now remember, Jesus and Judas,
dialog: they were friends...
text: As the sermon continues, Sal leans toward Doc, whispers:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Oh. My. Fucking. God. Is that who I
dialog: think it is?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I told you you'd like this.
text: Sal is wildly amused. He turns and looks around at the
text: others, wanting to share his excitement.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: But, oh, how a good man can be laid
dialog: low by a false friend, how havoc
dialog: can follow the lying smile...
speaker_heading: CONGREGATION
dialog: Amen!
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Amen, brother!
dialog: (whispers to Doc)
dialog: The dude was a world-class drinker,
text: gambler and cocksman.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Shhhh.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: And likely a speed freak. How the
dialog: hell did you find this place?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: The internet.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Oh, yes, in the spirit of
dialog: friendship, have a drink... have a
dialog: toke... have a snort... the devil
text: has a friendly face and a winning
text: way. But behind that smile, as
text: behind the kiss of Judas...
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I think he's makin' this shit up
dialog: just for us.
text: Reverend Mueller eventually finishes his sermon, looking
text: closely at his two visitors... a long judgemental look. An
text: echoing of Amens rolls wall to wall.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting out)
dialog: Oh, Amen, brother! Amen!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Thank you, brothers and sisters,
dialog: and praise the Lord for our
dialog: fellowship here today.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Praise the Lord!
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I see we have some visitors among
dialog: us today. Welcome to our Sunday
dialog: services. Would you like to stand
dialog: and introduce yourselves?
text: Sal needs no second invitation. He springs to his feet, snaps
text: off a salute and sounds off:
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Salvatore Nealon, Sergeant, U.S.
dialog: Marine Corps, retired.
text: Heads in the congregation turn. Whispers become a buzz that
text: fill the church. The Reverend totters a bit at the pulpit,
text: holding on. RUTH, Mueller's concerned wife, studies how her
text: husband is responding. Doc tugs at Sal's sleeve, but Sal
text: pulls him to his feet.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: And guess who this lad is.
scene_heading: INT. PARSONAGE - AFTERNOON 10
text: Mueller, Ruth and their two guests sit at a table laden with
text: a ham and heaping bowls of vegetables and greens. Mueller
text: sits rigidly, his eyes on Sal and Doc, wary.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Man, oh, man, southern ham, thank
dialog: you, ma'am. Listen here, Ruth, I
dialog: hope this old man appreciates you.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, I think he does.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: ‘Cause if ever he don't, just pack
text: a bag and come live with Sal.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You don't have a wife?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: No, ma'am, neither chick nor child.
dialog: I do have a lady friend, but she
dialog: don't cook worth a damn. She has
dialog: other talents, if you know what I
dialog: mean.
text: Embarrassed, she turns to Doc.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: And you, Mr. Shepherd? Are you
dialog: single or married?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I married a wonderful woman, Mrs.
dialog: Mueller.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Bet she don't cook like this.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I get it, Mr. Nealon, you haven't
dialog: been eating well.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Am now.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: The light of my life, my Mary. A
dialog: heart as big as... anything. A
dialog: real pretty girl, with a great big
dialog: smile...
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Nice...
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: She had a little... slowness...
dialog: because of a thing when she was
dialog: born.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: What's that mean, she's retarded?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: No, she could do anything anybody
dialog: else could, she was just kind of...
dialog: delayed. A great mom, a great
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: What does she do?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Oh, no... I'm sorry. I lost her
dialog: last January. Breast cancer.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I'm so sorry.
text: Sal stops with fork in mid path.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Sorry, Doc. You know me, I didn't
dialog: mean nothin’.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: We pay for the things we say,
dialog: Salvatore.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Well, then you can add it to my
dialog: tab.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: That's all right. You didn't know.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Your tab is long overdue, I
dialog: suspect.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Do you have any children, Doc?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Just one, a son. Larry Junior.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Richard and I have a boy and a
dialog: girl, and we have four
dialog: grandchildren.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Richard?
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Honey, don't you have some coffee
dialog: and pie for our visitors, before we
dialog: send them on their way?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (rising)
dialog: I have a peach cobbler for dessert.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Oh, man, peach cobbler... this is
dialog: livin'!
text: Ruth goes to the kitchen, looks over her shoulder at her
dialog: unusual guests.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: (to Doc)
dialog: I'm glad to see you prevailing over
dialog: your hardships.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Doin' my best.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: You, at least, seem to have turned
dialog: out to be a decent man.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Try to be.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I regret any role I played in all
dialog: that foolishness that happened back
dialog: in Vietnam.
text: Sal shakes his head, as if trying to defog his brain.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: What the hell did you do with
dialog: Mueller the Mauler, preacher? He
dialog: in the witness protection program
dialog: or something? Where're you keepin'
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I grew up, Sal, and I found a
text: purpose along the way.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You don't have to feel sorry.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I always figured you for a lifer,
dialog: Sal. Is that the way it worked out?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I re-upped, sure. I was expectin'
dialog: all the dominoes to start fallin',
dialog: like they said they would. I was
text: all ready to kill commies in San
dialog: Diego, but they never showed up -
dialog: they just all kind of disappeared.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you believe people are now
dialog: going to Vietnam on fuckin'
dialog: vacations? They get their pictures
dialog: taken where fifty-two thousand
dialog: young Americans took their last
dialog: dump. Fuck me.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: So you mustered out on principle.
speaker_heading: SAL
text: I mustered out with a plate in my
dialog: fuckin' head and one-hundred
dialog: percent disability. That was the
dialog: good news.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: How did that happen?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Fuck if I remember. Somebody hit me
dialog: on the head with something. I
dialog: believe drink was involved.
text: He laughs. The other two can't manage it.
text: LATER - They sit in the living room having cobbler and 11
text: coffee. Doc hasn't touched his, Sal digs into his, while
text: practically flirting with Ruth.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: ..+.I was on the shy side of
dialog: insubordination most of the time,
dialog: but I could get away with it
dialog: because of my dashing good looks
dialog: and my boyish charm.
text: Mueller snorts.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I guess we're all just lucky to be
dialog: alive, praise God.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I tell myself that.
text: Doc sits with his arms on his knees, head down, sinking down
text: into himself. One by one they notice him. Sensing their
text: attention, he raises his head.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: (nodding to the untouched
dialog: cobbler)
dialog: You gonna eat that?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: MUELLER

dialog: What's wrong?
text: Doc shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It's best to talk, whatever it is
dialog: that's bothering you.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: My son... because of my son, I came
dialog: here, found you guys... Maybe I
dialog: shouldn't have...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Your son?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Larry Junior. A year ago he joined
dialog: the corps.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Ooh-Rah.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: But two days ago they came and told
dialog: me he had been killed.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Aw, shit, Doc. Why didn't you say
dialog: anything earlier?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: He died in Baghdad. His convoy got
dialog: ambushed, and they said he had
text: unloaded his weapon on them and
text: died with his bayonet in his hand.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's coming home tonight. They're
dialog: gonna bury him at Arlington. Full
text: honors. A hero.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can you guys come with me?
dialog: 18.
text: 12 LATER - Sal smokes a cigar out on the porch. He listens to12
text: what is being said inside, Mueller all over Doc with sympathy
dialog: and God.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: .»+. and I can promise you this:
dialog: someday you will meet your wife and
dialog: your son again, in a better place,
dialog: and all of this will seem like a
text: momentary separation.
text: That does it. Sal tosses his cigar and goes inside.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Oh come on... what better place did
dialog: they go to? Las Vegas? Miami Beach?
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Doc knows the place I speak of.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Well, then show him. Doc's got a
dialog: map. Maybe he can find it on the
dialog: internet.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Only when you see it will you know
dialog: it, and in your case, Sergeant,
dialog: it's odds-on you'll never get to
dialog: see it.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Then I guess I won't miss it.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Oh, you will miss it dearly, every
dialog: moment of eternity. Do you know
dialog: how long eternity is?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: It ain't going to matter, but of

dialog: I don't know. That's why I'm
dialog: askin'.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Shouldn't we be making arrangements

dialog: we're here?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Were you there, when it happened?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: COLONEL WILLITS
dialog: No, I wasn't.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Where were you?
scene_heading: COLONEL WILLITS
dialog: With all due respect, that's none
dialog: of your business.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: With all due respect, Doc here
dialog: ought to get to talk to somebody
dialog: who was. You weren't.
dialog: (to Washington)
dialog: Were you?
text: Washington hesitates, glances at the Colonel staring at him,
text: but then reluctantly answers.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: I was there, sir.
text: The Colonel doesn't like how this is going at all, but it's
dialog: too late.
scene_heading: COLONEL WILLITS
dialog: Very well. Lance Corporal
dialog: Washington, tell him what happened.
text: Washington takes a deep breath.
text: LATER - Sal is at the coffee table. Mueller approaches fror?5
text: the hangar door. Doc is leaning back against the coffin,
text: considering what to do. The Colonel and Washington stand on
text: either side of him.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Where are we with this?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Where we was, pretty much. He'd
text: like his son's face back.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I called my wife. I'm going home.
dialog: I'll take the bus.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You quittin'?
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Quitting what?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: We'll know in a minute or two.
text: Sal sees the Colonel once again approaching Doc so he wanders
text: over to him.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Yo, Doc.
text: Doc looks up.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: What's it gonna be here?
text: Doc stands up straight, looks the Colonel in the eye.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I can't bury him in Arlington. Not
dialog: now.
scene_heading: COLONEL WILLITS
dialog: He qualifies and he deserves that
dialog: honor.
text: Doc digs out his wallet, rifles through it, and produces a
text: photo of his son. He holds it out, in front of the Colonel's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Here, this is what his face looked
dialog: like. He was a good-looking boy.
dialog: (shows the photo to the
dialog: others)
dialog: See? The high school girls were all
text: over him. He was a good-looking
dialog: boy. I'm taking Larry home.
scene_heading: COLONEL WILLITS
dialog: I assure you that is a bad decision
dialog: and you will come to regret it.
text: Doc tries to push the cart. Sal hands his cup to Mueller and
text: joins him. They push together.
speaker_heading: COLONEL WILLITS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on. The Marines will transport
dialog: the body, at no cost to you,
dialog: anywhere you choose.
text: They keep on pushing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: COLONEL WILLITS (CONT'D)
dialog: Gentlemen. I cannot release the
text: Lance Corporal's body, except to a
dialog: licensed mortician...
text: Mueller steps up.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Or to a clergyman, isn't that the
dialog: case?
text: The Colonel hesitates, as Mueller hands him Sal's cup and
text: begins to put on his clerical collar.
scene_heading: COLONEL WILLITS
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: So I guess that would be me.
text: Using his cane, Mueller walks behind Doc and Sal as they push
text: the coffin. Washington stands next to the Colonel, impressed.
scene_heading: EXT. HANGAR PARKING LOT —- MORNING 26
text: Sal and Doc push the cart, Mueller trailing behind. They come
text: to a stop, not before dinging the car.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Forget about it.
text: They stand silently, awkwardly for a moment. What now?
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Now how you gonna get him home?
dialog: Strap that coffin to the roof of
dialog: Sal's car?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: We could do that. We'd need help
dialog: liftin' it up. Maybe we...
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Don't be ridiculous.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Why not? Tell me a better way to
dialog: be. You wish you could be
text: ridiculous, but it's too late now.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Doc, let the government take care
dialog: of the transport - that's the kinda
dialog: thing they're good at.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I don't like the government right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: You don't have to.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I don't trust it any more.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Hell, we could rent a truck.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yeah, let's do that. We'll stay
dialog: here, and you can take the car and
dialog: go find a truck. Pay for it out of
dialog: this.
text: Doc gives him an envelope full of cash.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Consider it done. One truck,
dialog: comin' up.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: (to Doc)
dialog: I'll be going with Sal. He can
dialog: drop me at the bus station. I
dialog: think I'll be going back home now.
text: For a moment no one says anything.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I understand, Mueller. I'm sorry
dialog: for dragging you up here.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I thought I could be of some help.
dialog: I thought we were going to a
dialog: funeral.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: We ARE going to a funeral, it just
dialog: looks like it's going to take a
dialog: little longer to get there.
text: Doc doesn't want to make this any harder than it is.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 27
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: It's okay, Mueller. I'm just glad
dialog: I got to see you again.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I'm sorry, lad.
text: A handshake and a hug, awkwardly trapping his cane against
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MUELLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Glad I got to see you too. God
dialog: bless you, Doc.
scene_heading: INT. SAL'S TAURUS - DAY - MOVING 27
text: Sal drives, Mueller next to him. They maintain a silence,
dialog: then -
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: We should stop and ask somebody
text: where the bus station is.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: It's a small town, we'll run into
dialog: it. Give you a few more minutes to
dialog: enjoy my company.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Always a pleasure.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Before you bail on us.
text: Mueller stares straight ahead.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: So, what's on your agenda? Read the
text: bible all the way home, leftover
dialog: ham for supper, say a little
dialog: prayer...
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Oh, I'll say a little prayer long
dialog: before that. The bigger question
dialog: is, what's on your agenda?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I feel I owe him one. Nothin' more,
dialog: nothin' less.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Even though he says you don't owe
dialog: him a thing?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 28
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: All the more reason.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: What would have happened, way back
dialog: then, if we hadn't... you know?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Doc wouldn't have ended up doing
dialog: two years in the brig, that's for
dialog: sure. And we wouldn't have had to
dialog: see what we did.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You don't remember?
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I remember a lot of shit... what
dialog: are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: A certain platoon buddy, shot,
text: writhing around on the ground
text: dying, with nothing to help him
dialog: cause we'd taken all the morphine
dialog: for ourselves.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: He was going to die, anyway. He
dialog: had no chance. Minutes.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: There was nothing we could do at
dialog: that point.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yeah, and we did nothin'. Sometimes
dialog: you ought to do a little more.
text: Sal sees a Ryder agency and pulls to the curb.

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I have a van that would work for
dialog: you, but you might be happier with

dialog: lift.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Ohhh, a hydraulic lift. I like it.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What will you be hauling?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Your truck with the lift'll handle
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Will you be dropping it off back
dialog: here or at another location?
text: It catches Sal short. He hadn't thought about that.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Don'tcha know?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Guess I'm gonna return it here.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: And when will that be?
text: Again, Sal has to think about it. The agent's suspicions
text: start to grow. She grows more nervous. Terrorists?
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: You don't know how long you'll need
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Better give me a week.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Oh my, a week, he says.
text: Now she looks uneasily at Mueller as she taps her keyboard.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Now Mueller, it's outta your hands

text: At "Mueller," the agent's head jerks slightly, not sure what
dialog: she heard.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Just have a seat and take a
dialog: load off. I'll handle this.
text: Mueller makes his way to a chair and sits. The woman is
text: fretting inwardly.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I need to see your driver's
dialog: license.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: He empties one pocket of change and keys and a cigar cutter.
text: The woman looks at that with apprehension. Out of the other
text: pocket: cash, cards and hard candy. He finds the license.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Norfolk, Virginia?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Gotta live somewhere.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What brings you up here?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: With all due respect, that's none

text: Now she's really worried.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Just trying to be friendly.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Really? Okay. Well, I'm here
dialog: because of a death in the family.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: That's all right. It wasn't my
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Will you be the only driver?
text: Again, he has to think about it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I'll have some help.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Then I'll need to see the other
dialog: driver's license. Is it that
dialog: gentleman there?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: His holiness? His holiness can't
dialog: hardly walk, let alone handle a big
text: rig with a hydraulic lift.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Whoever, I'll need their license.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I'll drive it myself.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: So you are the only driver?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yes, ma'am. I be the wheelman.
text: Paranoia deepens.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Insurance on the vehicle?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Would you like to get some?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Not necessary.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: How will you be paying?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Cash.

speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I haven't forgotten that. But

speaker_heading: MUELLER

speaker_heading: MUELLER

speaker_heading: SAL

speaker_heading: SAL

speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: No, not really.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Well, it ought to, dignified old

speaker_heading: SAL

dialog: There lie heroes. The details of

dialog: death was heroic. He was in a

speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: SAL

speaker_heading: SAL

dialog: That's how we won two world wars.
dialog: Don't be surprised if somebody
dialog: figures out that it's cheaper to
dialog: ship a body to Mexico and back than
dialog: to do it up here. They'll ship it
dialog: to China or India once they figure
dialog: out it'll save 'em a buck. Don't
dialog: matter how good you are.
dialog: (new mumbly thought)
dialog: Just a matter of time till they
text: start outsourcing soldiering.
dialog: Hell, get a bunch of starving young
dialog: people from all over the world, put
dialog: ‘em in a uniform and tell ‘em to
dialog: try to stay alive. When their tour
dialog: is over we ship 'em back to where
dialog: they came from... no VA hospitals,
dialog: or pensions. You lost an arm? You

dialog: anything since last January.
scene_heading: INT. LARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 71
text: Sal is laying on a trundle bed, pulled out from under Larry's

speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You gonna want to stay on here,

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I don't know - haven't thought much

speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Portsmouth? The brig right there.
dialog: You might want to try another

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: But Larry would be here. Mary, too.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: You could always come visit. You
dialog: got close friends here?
speaker_heading: DOC
text: Not too many. Not too close.

speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Move to Norfolk. You could work in

speaker_heading: DOC

dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Your place don't seem all that
dialog: busy.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: That's my fault. I let it go. It
dialog: needs new blood. We could get the
dialog: grill part going again. I need a
dialog: partner.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: A partner?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yeah. The bar'd be half yours, and
dialog: when I bite it, it'll be all yours.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Sal... you don't owe me nothing.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: This ain't paying off no debt. I
dialog: really do need a partner, and I got
dialog: nobody to leave the place to. You
dialog: could stay with me for a while, but
dialog: then you'd have to find your own
dialog: place, 'cause I like to pursue the
dialog: ladies and, frankly, you'd cramp my
dialog: style.
speaker_heading: SAL (CONT'D)
dialog: You thinkin' about it?
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I am. I'm picturing it. It's kinda
dialog: funny.
speaker_heading: SAL

speaker_heading: SAL

speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
text: Looks a little small.
speaker_heading: DOC

speaker_heading: WASHINGTON

speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I guess I could go down to Penny's
dialog: and buy him something new.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: We still got his dress blues.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Remember how we used to call the
dialog: dress blues the tuxedo? By law you

speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I do remember that feeling.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: Yes, sir. I'm glad to know you
dialog: never forget it.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
text: Larry must have looked sharp.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: He did. He was proud as a peacock

speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: I know that for a fact.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Pride is the thing.
dialog: (to Mueller)
dialog: It's no sin.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: No, of course not. Not that kind.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I could bury him in his dress
dialog: uniform, even if.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Yeah. It means you did something.
dialog: You served. Fuck what the
dialog: politicians did, you served. You
dialog: didn't weasel out of it. You didn't
dialog: think it was somebody else's job.

speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Why're you looking at me like that?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I'm sizin' you up. I'm gonna buy

speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I'm gonna dress you up for the
dialog: occasion.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: Why, may I ask?
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Because I love you.
speaker_heading: MUELLER
dialog: I don't need a new suit of clothes.
dialog: It's you needs some grooming.

scene_heading: EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY 76
text: Mueller's cane leans against an empty folding chair. Doc sits

text: at the foot, in their dress uniforms. On the other side,
text: Washington stands at attention as the minister backs away.
text: They salute. Ceremonially, Sal and Mueller fold the flag into
text: twelve tight triangular folds. Mueller takes Washington's arm
text: and Sal carries the flag over to Doc. Sal then holds out the
text: flag to Doc, whose eyes are red, his lower lip is quivering.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Doc, I don't know how grateful the
dialog: nation is... or how much the
dialog: President might regret your loss
