scene_heading: MS. POMEROY
dialog: Joanie, if you had actually read the

text: The class gives an "Awwww." Joanie blushes.
speaker_heading: MS. POMEROY (CONT'D)
dialog: Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your
dialog: recent brush with mass destruction,
dialog: you can give us your opinion?
speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Well... they say it right when they
text: are ripping the place to shreds.
dialog: When they flood the house. That
dialog: like... destruction is a form of
dialog: creation. So the fact that they
dialog: burn the money is... ironic. They

speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Why?
text: She thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: GRETCHEN
dialog: Babies cry because they're afraid of

speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Why not just buy your baby a night

speaker_heading: GRETCHEN

speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Well, don't worry... I'm taking my

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: It's not that. I mean mouthing off

speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: I was just being honest.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

dialog: aggression ...He was recently
dialog: suspended from school for insulting
dialog: his gym teacher.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: She deserved it.
speaker_heading: DR. THURMAN
dialog: Rose... let me just lay out what I
dialog: believe is happening here. Donnie's
dialog: aggressive behaviour seems to stem
dialog: from his increased detachment from
dialog: reality. His inability to cope with
dialog: the forces in the world that he

text: Rose smiles nervously.
speaker_heading: DR. THURMAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JIM CUNNINGHAM
dialog: Now that's what I like to hear
dialog: (suddenly serious)
dialog: Because too many young men and women
text: today are paralysed by their fears.
dialog: They give in to their feelings of
dialog: self-doubt... they surrender their
dialog: bodies to the temptations of drugs,
dialog: alcohol and premarital sex. Empty
dialog: solutions. These are toxic chemicals
dialog: ...and disease-spreading behaviour.
text: A large screen lowers behind him.
speaker_heading: JIM CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I would like to tell you a story
dialog: today about a young man whose life

dialog: Shut up, Kim!
speaker_heading: DORKY GIRL
dialog: I'm just trying to help you!
speaker_heading: JIM CUNNINGHAM
dialog: There's no need to be embarrassed.
dialog: Many times we eat because we are
dialog: afraid to face the reality of our

dialog: look INTO the mirror. We should look
text: THROUGH the mirror.
speaker_heading: DORKY GIRL
dialog: Thanks.

speaker_heading: LARRY RIESMAN

speaker_heading: DR. THURMAN
dialog: Why did you do these things, Donnie?
dialog: Did Frank tell you to commit these

text: He does not respond.
speaker_heading: DONNIE

dialog: He's right there... He can read my

dialog: up... and then He will reveal himself
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: DR. THURMAN
dialog: If the sky were to suddenly open
dialog: up... there would be no law... there
dialog: would be no rule. There would only
dialog: be you and your memories... the
dialog: choices you've made and the people
dialog: you've touched. The life that has

speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DR. THURMAN
dialog: Donald, an atheist is someone who
dialog: denies altogether the existence of a
