speaker_heading: TITLE SEQUENCE:
scene_heading: 1	INT. BOSTON - OLD NORTH CHURCH - DAY
text: The setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images. Holy
text: images of STAINED GLASS and lead.
text: FOOTSTEPS ECHO across the marble floor.
scene_heading: REVEAL - JULIE JAMES
text: A little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But
text: she's all alone in the house of the Lord.
text: And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden
text: still rests upon her soul.
text: She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained
scene_heading: CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.
scene_heading: 2	INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY
text: Julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before
text: the CLOSED SCREEN. A beat -- and the SCREEN SLIDES OPEN.
speaker_heading: A PRIEST
text: enters the adjacent booth -- barely visible through the WICKER MESH.
text: Julie looks down, crosses herself, and begins.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: It's been a year since my last
dialog: confession...
text: Julie swallows hard. This is difficult for her.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: I've never told anyone this. Not my
dialog: mom, not the poice, not even my
dialog: friends -- except for the ones who
dialog: were there and they...well they're
dialog: not around anymore. You see I...I...
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I killed a man. Well, I thought I
dialog: had...then...
text: She balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows
text: of the other side.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: (emotional)
dialog: You've got to understand...It was
text: all an accident. A terrible accident.
dialog: It's been a whole year. I've tried to
dialog: get past this, but I just can't.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Go on...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I have these dreams...horrible
dialog: dreams. And this man is always there
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: I know...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You see, he was a killer. He
dialog: murdered Helen and Barry, and he
dialog: would have killed me too, if I
dialog: hadn't...gotten away with it.
dialog: (regathering)
dialog: I don't know, I guess I just need to
dialog: deal with the fear, the guilt...to
text: finally say his name. Ben Willis. His
dialog: name was Ben Willis...
text: The confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until,
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: I know...
text: Julie stops. Looks through the screen. A chill shoots through her
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You know? But how could you...
text: Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. Julie moves closer to
text: the screen, trying to get a better look.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (growls)
dialog: I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!
speaker_heading: A STEEL HOOK
text: smashes through the screen right in Julie's face! She SCREAMS!
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 3	INT. COLLEDGE LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: Still screaming -- Julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her
text: chair. She fights the unseen demon.
text: Sitting beside her, Julie's friend WILL BENSON reacts. He's a good-
text: looking kid in a shy, humble kind of way. And he tries to help her,
text: but she's too busy turning ten shades of red.
text: The PROFESSOR lowers his glasses, makes it even worse.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR
dialog: Nice to see you find Political
dialog: Science so stimulating --
text: The lecture hall erupts with laughter.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm sorry --
text: Julie grabs her stuff and bolts.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 4	EXT. CAMPUS - DAY
text: Julie explodes out of the building. Hurries down a sidewalk. Will
text: finally catches up.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Julie! Wait! You okay?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don't seem fine.
text: Julie realizes this is true.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I had another dream, Will.
dialog: Will takes this seriously.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The shower again?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It was in a church...it was so real.
dialog: I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (caring)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I thought I was over the dreams for
dialog: good. I really did. I hadn't had one
dialog: for months.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna
dialog: get better.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It can't get worse. I mean, it's not
dialog: like this was the first time I
dialog: freaked out in class. I hardly ever
dialog: get a full night's sleep, my grades
dialog: suck, I'm this close from being thrown
text: out of school.
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin. It's just
text: STUDENTS letting off FIRECRACKERS as they fly past on bicycles.
text: Will and Julie are now thinking the same thing.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: It was one year ago...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's...the anniversary. That's what's
dialog: going on...Take it easy on yourself.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (weary)
dialog: I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I
dialog: don't even know why I came up here in
dialog: the first place.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (cheering her up)
dialog: To get out of Southport?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (softens)
dialog: Right. Now I remember.
text: He smiles at her. She smiles back. They stop in front of her apartment
dialog: building.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Are you getting out of town on the
dialog: fourth?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Nah. I'll probably just be here
dialog: studying for finals. The joys of
dialog: summer school...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Are you sure?
text: She touches his face affectionately.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Thanks for the talk, Will. You're
dialog: good to me.
text: Will stands there akwardly --
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Um...Okay. Bye.
text: Will walks away. Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --
speaker_heading: RAY
text: steps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.
text: Recovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him. He's a bit cold.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I got in early. I was excited...
dialog: (re: the receding Will)
dialog: Who was that guy?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh, that's Will. He's a friend.
dialog: You'd like him.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ray, we're just friend.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Every guy in history who tried to
dialog: pick up a girl did the good-friend
dialog: thing first.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Why are you being like this?
text: It should be obvious Ray feels insecure in the college environs, but
dialog: they're miscommunicating.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are
dialog: you ready to go? I've got the old
dialog: truck. You know the drill...Crab
text: boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen
dialog: Pageant...It's only small-town fun,
dialog: but it's still nice. People really
dialog: miss you. I miss you.
text: She looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor. This is hard to say --
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (softly, but resolved)
dialog: Ray, I can't...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Can't what?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I just feel like some part of me
dialog: hasn't healed up enough to go back.
text: Like some critical piece is missing.
dialog: Please understand...
text: Ray is cold. This is what he's expected all along.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I understand something.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's not like that. It's not you.
dialog: It's me. My head. I want to go back.
dialog: I want to be with you. I want to be
dialog: fine. I want everything to be like
dialog: it used to be.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It just isn't.
text: Ray is hurt and confused.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Hey, why don't you stay up here?
text: They have fireworks over the river.
dialog: And...there's a million things to do.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I have to work, Julie. My boat's in
dialog: Southport, remember? But, I get it.
dialog: You need your space from Craokerland.
dialog: And maybe from me, too.
text: Ray starts walking away.
speaker_heading: RAY (cont'd)
dialog: You know where to find me.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ray? Ray? At least come up for a
dialog: while.
text: Ray keeps on walking.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: It's okay. I'm just gonna go.
text: Julie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block
dialog: her way.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: I'm just scared...that's all.
text: But Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns
text: quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the
text: walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from
dialog: the keychain.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 5	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Students throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck,
text: which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW.
text: He clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket
text: and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He
text: throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 6	INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY
text: Julie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She
text: stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a
text: cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen.
scene_heading: 6A	INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: The faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the
text: lock on each window. She stands for a moment.
text: She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge
text: and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and
text: a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf.
text: She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.
text: She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.
scene_heading: 6B	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: She hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely
text: furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the
text: windows, then climbs into bed with the food.
text: On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at
text: one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.
text: Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going
text: places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns
text: off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: DISSOVE TO:
scene_heading: 6C	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed.
text: There's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER.
text: Julie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the
text: front door being CLOSED.
text: Her arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb
speaker_heading: POPS.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Okay. Okay. Face your fears...
text: She gets off the bed and stands still.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: There's nothing...
text: There's another NOISE down the hall.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Quiet.
text: Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen.
scene_heading: 6D	INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: She gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the
text: living room. She steps through the kitchen door.
text: As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway
text: toward her bedroom.
scene_heading: 6E	INT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: There's NO ONE there.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Okay, calm down, imagination.
text: She relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light
text: from the hallway slanting through.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: I can't take this anymore. I can't.
text: Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's
text: a soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of
text: a drawer and starts down the hallway.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: (fatalistic)
dialog: Let's just do it.
text: She moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway.
text: It sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.
scene_heading: 6F	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: There's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.
text: She turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.
scene_heading: INT THE CLOSET
text: KARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a
text: box of shoes. She SCREAMS.
text: Julie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and
dialog: flashlight.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I thought you were out of town!
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What are you doing in my closet?
text: They hug, jumping up and down with relief.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I thought you were out of town!
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What are you doing in my closet?
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: i just wanted your black pants, but
dialog: I'm not ready to die for them!
text: Julie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her
text: hand and black pants draped over her arm.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That was heart attack time, Karla.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: No. When I put these skinny pants on
dialog: my body...Now, that's heart attack
dialog: time.
text: Karla looks down and sees the knife. She picks it up with two
dialog: fingers --
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: And we're going to put away the
dialog: utensils and you're coming with me.
text: Julie flops down on her bed.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat,
text: ugly, and depressed.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Yeah, right -- whatever.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I think I just really hurt Ray's
dialog: feelings.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (keeping it upbeat)
dialog: Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great
dialog: guy, nothing against old Ray, but
dialog: he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in
dialog: Southport. Will's a nice guy, too,
text: and he lives right down the street.
text: Karla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: There's nothing between Will and me.
speaker_heading: KARLA (V.O.)
dialog: Yet. Nothing yet.
text: She emerges with clothes for Julie. Holds up one outfit.
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: What we gotta do is keep moving. No
dialog: time to mope. I'm working at the
dialog: club tonight. And you, dancing queen,
dialog: are coming with me.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No I'm not.
text: Karla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Fine, then be fat, ugly, and
dialog: depressed.
text: Karla is dancing around. Julie laughs at her friend and takes the
text: dress when Karla hands it to her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 7	INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT
text: It's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud MUSIC, a dance floor, and
text: rivers of cheap booze.
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
text: Julie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order.
text: A handsome young man slides in front of them. This is TYRELL MARTIN,
text: 23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: You know what I want to do to you
dialog: ...right now, don't you? There's
dialog: gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (playful)
dialog: I don't think so. It's pretty
dialog: crowded.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Just for a minute, baby. I got
dialog: something I wanna tell you.
text: He's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: If you can say all you gotta say
dialog: in a minute then I don't wanna hear
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: I'll talk real slow.
text: He's kissing her ear. She starts to giggle.
text: The bartender sets down drinks on Karla's tray.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (re: Julie)
dialog: Ask her to dance.
text: Tyrell hesitates.
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: Go on.
text: Karla cuts away through the crowd, delivering drinks. Tyrell turns to
dialog: Julie.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: You're the most beautiful woman
dialog: in the bar tonight, Jules.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Tyrell, you are an unstoppable
dialog: force of nature.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: That's right. It's how the species
dialog: survives. You'll never convince me
dialog: otherwise.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wanna dance?
text: Karla passes by --
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Say yes.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: No means yes.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have
dialog: you seen my people dance? We make
dialog: the mouth face, we move the
dialog: fingers --
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (heading for the floor)
dialog: Worse comes to worse, you can stand
dialog: there and watch me.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Come on, I'll take a break and
dialog: we'll all dance.
scene_heading: 7A	INT. THE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
text: is packed and thumping. Karla is dancing her way through the crowd.
text: Tyrell and Julie follow behind her.
text: Karla sees Will. He's dressed up and nervous. She smiles.
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin'
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (suspicious, but
dialog: having fun)
dialog: Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Nope. I told him that you
dialog: absolutely, positively would not be
dialog: here at this bar between ten o'clock
dialog: and eleven o'clock tonight. And then
dialog: he came anyway.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (shy to a fault)
dialog: This was not my idea.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I said, this...Do you want a drink?
text: Will looks down at his feet. He and Julie stand there not quite
dialog: knowing what to do.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Where I come from, you want to
dialog: snatch the goodies, you got to at
dialog: least talk to them first.
text: Tyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie
text: alone. They look at each other. They look at everyone dancing.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How about a drink?
text: Will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be
text: relaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and
text: sees, in a strobe light's FLASH --
scene_heading: SOMEONE IN A SLICKER
text: watching her intently. She squints for a better look, but he's gone.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (yelling over the din)
dialog: You okay?
text: She's chalk white and crestfallen. Her whole affect is "Will I ever
text: have a normal time?" She drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Hey Julie?
text: Will catches Karla and Tyrell's eyes. They're worried.
scene_heading: 7B	INT. THE CLUB - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
text: Julie catches another glimps of THE SLICKER.
text: She pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs.
scene_heading: 7C	INT. THE CLUB - BALCONY - NIGHT
text: Julie looks all around -- finally spotting the MAN IN THE SLICKER from
text: behind, making his way to the other side.
text: He slices through a crowd of students, and Julie keeps following. He
text: turns down a service corridor.
text: Julie follows, frightened, but unable to resist.
text: She catches him at the end of the corridor. She reaches out and grabs
text: the stranger's arm.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ben...
text: The stranger turns around. It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl
text: raincoat and hat. She's shaken.
speaker_heading: SLICKER GUY
dialog: Hye, baby. You following me up
dialog: here?
dialog: (a come-on)
dialog: Well, all right.
text: Julie turns away and hurries down the hallway. Todd follows, but his
text: figure quickly fades.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 8	INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: With morning sun filtering through her blinds, Julie wakes up to the
text: strange sound of THUMPING. She gets out of bed and slowly exits the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: 8A	INT. JULIE'S HALLWAY TO KITCHEN - DAY
text: The noise gets louder as she heads down the hall.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON A CLOSET
text: The noise is at its loudest -- Julie reaches for a doorknob -- and
text: yanks open the door.
text: ANGLE ON A CLOTHES DRYER
text: rocking and banging inside the closet. Julie frowns.
text: Julie spins, once again startled by Karla, who crosses to the dryer,
text: flipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they
text: pop out on the fly.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (still sleepy)
dialog: That could break the machine.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Julie, people who end up making
dialog: rules like that end up beating
dialog: their kids with wire hangers. It's
dialog: a fact.
text: The phone RINGS. Karla looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: It's Tyrell.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: The number's unlisted...
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Would you relax? We've been dating
dialog: three months. He ain't stalking
dialog: your butt.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Okay, okay. You're right.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I know it, and it feels good.
dialog: (answering the phone)
dialog: Hi, Ty.
text: A DJ for a local radio station BOOMS from the phone.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: This is Mark in the Morning for
dialog: Magic 96.7 Radio Station! Who am I
dialog: speaking with?
text: Julie watches her friend get excited.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh
dialog: my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.
dialog: (to Julie)
dialog: Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Well, Karla, what're you doin' at
dialog: home over the long fourth weekend?
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Well, I'm in school and --
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7
dialog: Quicky Getaway?
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Yes!
text: Julie hits the SPEAKERPHONE BUTTON and Karla hangs up. The DJ's voice
text: echos through the appartment.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Good, then I hope you remember your
dialog: geography, Karla, because all you
dialog: have to do to win is tell me the
dialog: capital of Brazil.
text: Karla's smile abruptly fades.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Brazil? Um...
text: She looks to Julie, whose face is as blank as hers.
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: You don't know?! You have to know.
dialog: You know everything...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: C'mon, Karla, one easy question,
dialog: one great getaway!
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: ...South America...Carnival...
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Karla, we need an answer. No
dialog: looking it up.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Still here...thinking...
dialog: (stalling)
dialog: You mean Brazil, the country?
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, Karla, five seconds.
dialog: (counting down)
dialog: Five...Four...
text: Julie has an idea. She scramles for the kitchen. Grabs a BAG OF FRESH-
text: GROUND COFFEE from the FREEZER.
speaker_heading: MARK (cont'd, V.O.)
dialog: Three...Two...
text: Julie tosses the bag across the room to Karla. Karla reads the label:
scene_heading: RIO BLEND -- 100% BRAZILIAN COFFEE.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (blurting)
dialog: Rio de Janeiro!
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (wincing)
dialog: No. Yes?
text: BELLS and WHISTLES and triumphant MUSIC.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: You just won Magic 96.7's Quickie
dialog: Getaway...a trip for four to Tower
dialog: Bay Island in the fabulous Bahamas.
text: Karla and Julie jump up and down ecstatically.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: We'll call you back with all the
dialog: details...So what's your favorite
dialog: radio station?
speaker_heading: KARLA AND JULIE
dialog: Magic 96.7!
text: Julie hangs up and joins Karla dancing on the couch.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I won. I won...I won, I won, I won.
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Now, let's see...There's Tyrell,
dialog: that's one. And, there's my parents
dialog: ...And I got some cousins.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark
dialog: said four tickets. That means you

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 9	EXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY
text: A SMALL MOUND OF RED SNAPPER is DUMPED -- wiggling and suffocating its

dialog: the one --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No, I shouldn't have left so fast...
dialog: I was just...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's okay.
text: Dave holds up two wriggling snappers. He dances them toward each other
text: in a puppetlike mating ritual, making KISSING SOUNDS and narrating --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (as the fish)
dialog: Julie, I love you. I know I'm only a
dialog: humble fish, but if you really look
dialog: at it, you're a fish, too.
dialog: (girl voice)
dialog: Oh, Ray, you're right...Do me like a
dialog: snapper.
dialog: (mashing the fish together)
dialog: Hey, something smells like fish...
text: Ray waves him away, concentrating on his call.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas!
dialog: An island called Tower Bay. And she
dialog: wants us to come with her.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
text: Dave's interest is piqued.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: We'd have a long weekend just to sit
text: in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and
dialog: swim, and...
dialog: (sexy)
dialog: You know...
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: This weekend?
text: Dave is watching Ray closely. Ray's expression hardens.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: You'll go away with you're college
dialog: friends, but you won't go away with
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
text: Karla is watching Julie.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's not you, it's Southport. And
dialog: it's the Bahamas! And it's free!
text: Karla is watching Julie.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: You gotta sell his butt on the
dialog: Bahamas?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ray, come on. I want us to be
dialog: together.
text: Ray thinks. Dave looks at him like he's crazy.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (can't give in)
dialog: Julie, we're working a big run up
dialog: here. It's been crazy. We probably
dialog: have to go out again tonight. I
dialog: don't think I can do it.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Will you try...for me, please?
text: Dave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Okay, I'll try. But, listen...
dialog: (martyrlike)
dialog: If I don't make it up, then you go
dialog: ahead and have a great time.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ray...please try. I really miss you.
dialog: (beat)

scene_heading: 10	EXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY
text: Ray is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper. Dave is
text: staring at him in disbelief.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Man, what is your problem? We
dialog: haven't caught anything for days.
dialog: Pull the big ugly stick out of
dialog: your butt. She asked you to go to
dialog: the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go.
dialog: We'll both drive up. I got friends
dialog: I can see up there.
text: Ray realizes how right he is.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Stupid. Stupid.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Stupid. What were you thinkng?
text: Ray looks at Dave a contemplative beat, then walks over to his truck.
text: He leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box.
text: Dave walks over.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You wanna see what I've been
dialog: thinking?
text: He holds up the box and slowly opens it. Dave is stunned.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw
dialog: the bomb.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I should go up there. I should call
dialog: her back, tell her I'm coming.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be

text: Ray is excited by the plan and Dave's right there with him.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 11	EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: We stare out at a rain-soaked stretch of road.
text: A PICKUP ROARS past, cruising along with its RADIO loud and windows
dialog: rolled down.
scene_heading: 12	INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT
text: The music's even LOUDER in here. The mood is high...Two buddies going
text: to propose to a girl. Dave adjusts the radio to another AM station --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Man, I love AM radio. You got
dialog: right-wing conspiracy, tips for
dialog: pregnant womem, Single-A baseball
dialog: games, and real country music...
dialog: None of that new crap...
text: He adjusts the dial again, tuning in a country song, "MAMAS, DON'T LET
text: YOUR BABIES GROW UP TO BE COWBOYS," by Waylon Jennings and Willie
dialog: Nelson.
text: Dave starts singing along, extra LOUD and out of tune.
speaker_heading: DAVE (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "...Mamas, don't let your babies grow
dialog: up to be cowboys, don't let 'em pick
dialog: guitars and drive them old trucks. Let
dialog: 'em be doctors and lawyers and such."
text: Ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy
dialog: himself...
text: Then, Ray sees something in the road ahead. He turns down the radio.
dialog: They both stare --
scene_heading: RAY'S POV: A CAR TURNED SIDEWAYS
text: its HAZARDS blinking.
text: Ray slows and creeps past the car. The driver's door is open. It
text: appears EMPTY.
speaker_heading: A BODY
text: is sprawled out in the road away from the car. Ray pulls over to the
text: shoulder and stops.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: I don't know, man. Maybe we should
dialog: keep going, find a phone --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: The guy looks dead.
dialog: Ray has seen this before --
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Maybe not.

scene_heading: 12A	EXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Hey! Buddy, what's up?
text: The body doesn't move.
speaker_heading: BEHIND RAY
text: and behind Dave, in the other car, a FIGURE IN A SLICKER sits up in

text: Ray continues toward the body.
scene_heading: RAYS POV - BODY
scene_heading: FACE DOWN -- WEARING A BLACK RAIN SLICKER.

speaker_heading: BEHIND RAY
text: SLICKER FIGURE moves toward the unsuspecting Dave.
scene_heading: 12B	INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT
text: Dave watches Ray in the road. He leans across the seat and rolls up
text: Ray's window.
text: Behind him, the SLICKER FIGURE gets closer, moving to the passenger
text: side of the truck.
scene_heading: 12C	EXT. MEDIAN - NIGHT
text: Ray nears the body. He kneels down.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Hey, can you hear me?
text: Ray reaches toward the body...
scene_heading: 12D	INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT
text: Something FLASHES IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR.
scene_heading: 12E	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Ray turns over the body. Something isn't right. Ray jumps back --
scene_heading: CLOSE - SLICKER MANNEQUIN
text: Its eerie smile mocking Ray who turns for the truck.
speaker_heading: RAY
speaker_heading: DAVE!
scene_heading: 12F	EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
text: Dave hears something. He turns to late. SPLLAATTT!!! THE FISHERMAN
text: jams his hook through Dave's jaw and skull and YANKS DAVE OUT OF THE
scene_heading: CAR WINDOW.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: ...Dave?
text: There's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the
text: headlights. He moves slowly toward the truck.
text: The BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS.
text: The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray.
text: Then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray.
text: Ray runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked
dialog: car.
text: HIS TRUCK goes SCREAMING past.
text: Ray backs around the car --
scene_heading: AN EIGHTEEN-WHEELER
text: goes barreling by in the other direction. Ray dives out of the way.
speaker_heading: IN THE ROAD
text: Ray is exposed. He sees his truck closing fast. He's got nowhere to
text: go. Then, at the very last second,
speaker_heading: RAY
text: jumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT
text: WHERE RAY WAS STANDING. SPARKS FLY! METAL BUCKLES!
text: Ray falls through the air. Lands hard on his leg. Tumbles down the
text: hill, finally stopping with a crash. He lies motionless at the bottom
text: of a ravine.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: 13	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Karla exits the building. She watches Julie sitting on the curb.

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Julie, you left four messages...
dialog: Four.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: But, he said he'd try.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: He said he'd try. Try is like maybe.
dialog: Try is nothing!
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (appoligizing for him)
dialog: He does work hard.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Work hard, huh? He's breaking your
dialog: heart just because he can.
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: And I don't want to have to say I
dialog: told you so...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Then, don't.
text: A Jeep Cherokee stops, and an ebullient Tyrell steps out wearing
text: shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or
dialog: we gonna get tropical?
text: The passenger door opens and Will Benson steps hesitantly around the

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (re: Will)
dialog: Hey, sorry...
dialog: (quick, playing it off)
dialog: He's my friend, too. And that ticket

text: Will reads Julie's expression.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Julie, is everything cool? Karla
dialog: said...
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I said we start having fun. And that
dialog: means now.
text: Julie takes a last look up the street. She stands.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Is there a problem here?
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Where there's a Will, there's a
dialog: way. Come on.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (deciding)
dialog: You know what? This rocks. We're

text: Will is relieved.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 14	EXT. MIDAIR - DAY
text: A wide-body jet SCREAMS through the clouds.
scene_heading: 15	INT. PLANE - DAY
text: A nearly empty jet. Karla has her head on Tyrell's shoulder. Julie is
text: reading a book.
text: Will's knuckles are white from gripping the armrests in fear, and his
text: eyes are clenched shut. Julie looks on with concern.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Just take deep breaths and think of
text: something happy from childhood.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What if I don't have anything happy
dialog: from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax
dialog: going five hundred miles an hour, or
dialog: four thousand, four hundred feet a
dialog: minute...
dialog: (calculating)
dialog: Which is over seven hundred feet a
dialog: second. Imagine hitting something at
text: seven hundred feet a second.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Deep breaths --
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (no deep breaths)
text: Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
dialog: You can by surface-to-air missiles
text: over the internet. Planes use
text: O-rings...which freeze in tap water.
text: Planes fall from the sky for
dialog: practically no reason at all.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You've got a better chance of
text: getting hit by lightning.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Right. Planes get hit by lightning.
text: They get hit by meteors. They hit
dialog: other planes.
text: Tyrell shakes his head.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Something is gonna hit your butt if
dialog: you don't quit complaining.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (sypathetic)
dialog: Honey, some folks just can't fly.

scene_heading: 17	EXT. FERRY - DAY

dialog: the only passengers.
text: At the bow, Julie and Karla laugh and play "King of the World." Julie
text: in the prow, Karla behind her.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: I'm the King of the World.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: No, I'm the King of the World.
text: They switch places. They look at each other and crack up laughing.
text: Karla takes in the surroundings, the salt spray, the day --
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Remind me to study real hard so
dialog: someday this is normal and all that
dialog: back there is somethin' I do for a
dialog: weekend once every ten years.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (sharing the moment)
dialog: I will, and you remind me of the same

speaker_heading: AT THE STERN
text: Will talks to a very green Tyrell.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You just gotta breathe.
dialog: Tyrell is trying to keep from puking --
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Can't talk right now.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (slightly malicious)
dialog: See, it's not a macho thing. It's
dialog: about equilibrium in your inner ear.
dialog: You could've used a patch, but it's
dialog: too late now. Get used to it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Some folks just can't sail.
text: PAULSEN, the BOAT CAPTAIN, overhears as he passes --
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: That's too bad, too, because it's the
dialog: only way on or off the island.
dialog: (slightly ominous)
dialog: Unless you have an accident. And then
dialog: they call the Coast Guard.
text: Julie and Karla have rejoined the men.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's pretty remote here.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yep. That's what the tourists pay for
dialog: -- sun, sea, and solitude.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Are we there yet?
speaker_heading: PAULSEN

text: Tyrell stamps his feet on the dock.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: I feel like I'm still on that thing.
text: A dockhand, DERRICK, glides past him toward the ladies.
speaker_heading: DERRICK
dialog: That way for a complimentary Planter's
dialog: Punch to get you readjusted.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (mile-wide smile)
dialog: I can get used to this.
text: Derrick reaches for Julie's hand, clearly checking her out in the

speaker_heading: DERRICK
dialog: Welcome, Fair Princess, to Tower Bay.

dialog: I'm Derrick. At your service for the

speaker_heading: DERRICK

dialog: Season's over old man. So I gotta

scene_heading: 20	EXT. TOWER BAY HOTEL - DAY

speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Check it out.
scene_heading: TOW BIKINI GIRLS

speaker_heading: TYRELL

text: Karla THWACKS him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun.
text: The path widens. The trees part. It's even nicer up close. They walk
text: across a tiled plaza.
text: Behind them, THREE YOUNG GUYS carry their GIRLFRIENDS piggyback,
text: racing each other toward the departure dock.
text: Our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a FENCED
text: TENNIS COURT on the left. A GLASS-PANED ORCHID HOUSE straight ahead.
dialog: And, on the right,
text: A LUSH POOL with a built-in JACUZZI in the shallow end. An outdoor

text: A guy's unintelligible RASTA VOICE calls out --
speaker_heading: RASTA VOICE
dialog: Anybudorsomethin'?

speaker_heading: WILL

text: Julie smiles at the woman on their way through the lobby, but Olga
text: shyly looks away.
text: Arriving at the FRONT DESK, the four of them find it deserted. They

scene_heading: ANGLE ON A DESK BELL

speaker_heading: TYRELL (cont'd)

speaker_heading: TYRELL

speaker_heading: BROOKS

speaker_heading: TYRELL

speaker_heading: BROOKS

speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
speaker_heading: BROOKS

dialog: right off that dock --
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Okay, we get it...It's old.
speaker_heading: BROOKS

speaker_heading: KARLA

speaker_heading: BROOKS

speaker_heading: ESTES

dialog: Ahh, good for you, girl.
dialog: (waiting for a cue)
dialog: ...And, where would you like me to
dialog: put the bags?
text: A beat as Julie and Karla exchange a look. Then, Karla tosses one of
text: the keys to Julie.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (to Estes)
dialog: Their stuff in there...
dialog: (grabbing Tyrell)
dialog: ...and ours in here.
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (looking at Tyrell)
dialog: I also promised Tyrell.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Promised me what, baby?
dialog: (joking around)
dialog: I made all my promises to William.
text: Tyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at Will. Estes looks away.
speaker_heading: TYRELL (cont'd)
dialog: Sweetie, you brought your nightie,
dialog: didn't you?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Forward! A girl needs time to make up
dialog: his mind.
dialog: (to Julie, thoughtful)
dialog: Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep
dialog: on the couch and they can have their
dialog: own room to practice for that real
dialog: honeymoon.
text: But Tyrell grabs Karla and drags her into the room. We here GIGGLES.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'll take those.
speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: No, I've been doing this since before
dialog: you were a dream in your father's eye.
text: Estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room. Julie and Will are
text: left staring at each other.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You sure it's okay with you?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (noting his sweetness)
dialog: Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't

speaker_heading: WILL

scene_heading: 25	INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
text: BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. Ray is hooked up to a heart monitor. Although he's
text: asleep, we can tell he's bruised and generally beaten up.
text: WE RACK to a DOCTOR checking on him through the glass.
scene_heading: 25A	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: We see a COP next to the doctor.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: He's beaten up pretty bad --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yes, but he seemed certain his friend
text: was killed out on the highway by
dialog: somebody named Ben Willis.
dialog: (hisitant)
text: He said he has a hook on his hand. He
text: said he was driving a BMW.
text: As the cop stares at him deadpan, the doctor realizes how rediculous
dialog: this must sound.
scene_heading: 25B	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE UP: Ray's eyes pop open. He's listening.
scene_heading: 26	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The cop explains things to the doctor.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: There's no body. And there was no
dialog: other vehical involved.
dialog: (beat)
text: He fell asleep at the wheel...and ran
text: his old truck into a guardrail. He got

dialog: He's damn lucky.
text: They walk back down the ICU.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: He suffered a severe head trauma --
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Probably once he rests up, it'll all
text: come back to him.
text: The doctor and cop approach the nurse's station. The NURSE is reading
text: a magazine. She folds it away.
text: Suddenly, the monitoring equpment goes OFF with a series of LOUD
speaker_heading: WARNINGS.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (already moving)
dialog: That's your number twelve --
text: The doctor, nurse, and country cop hurry back toward Ray's room.
speaker_heading: NURSE (cont'd)

scene_heading: THEIR POV - THROUGHT THE DOOR

text: A resort bar on the beach. Ocean breezes and surf SOUNDS come through
dialog: the window.
text: It's tiki galore, complete with a bamboo bar and fishing gear hanging
text: from decorative nets from the ceiling. There's a KARAOKE STAGE in the
dialog: corner.
text: Will and Tyrell enter and head straight to the bar. A bored bar
text: tender, NANCY, looks just like Jennifer Esposito, doesn't look up from
dialog: her paperback.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: You guys lost?
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (re: the emptiness)
dialog: Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Wanna drink?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We didn't get all dressed up for
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or
dialog: how about a Mai-Tai?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: How about some ID?
dialog: They freeze.
speaker_heading: NANCY (cont'd)
dialog: Kidding.
text: They nod.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The guy at the desk said the place would

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Didn't anyone tell you this is --
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: The last day of the season. Yeah, we
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So why are you still here?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: That's none of your business.
text: Tyrell sizes her up quickly.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: What's the matter, boy trouble?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Not anymore.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: He leave you?
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: No. I shot him.
text: Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance.
speaker_heading: NANCY (cont'd)
dialog: What you want is a Dark and Stormy:
text: Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch
dialog: of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck
dialog: in the hurricane season, trust me.
speaker_heading: ACROSS THE BAR
text: Karla and Julie walk in talking quietly to one another.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Am I bad? I mean, he's really great,

speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: He's cute...And he's got a crush on
dialog: you...
dialog: (off Julie's look)
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (appologetic)
dialog: I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
text: Karla looks at her. She's sincere, but firm.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Ray made up his own mind...so, you're
dialog: free to make up yours.
text: Joining the men, but continuing her thought --
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: For the next foury-eight hours...
dialog: (joking)
dialog: Your smile is a frown...turned upside
dialog: down.
text: She illustrates with her own big smile.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Pretty cool bar.
speaker_heading: KARLA
text: They all start to look the same once
dialog: you've worked in one.
dialog: (to Nancy)
dialog: Am I right, sister?
text: Nancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their
dialog: fingers.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to Nancy)
dialog: I'm Julie. This is Karla.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Nancy.
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin'
dialog: hotspot.
text: Nancy continues making their cocktails.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD
text: WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER.
text: She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her.
text: Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Four Dark and Stormies...
text: They all pick up their drinks.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (toasting)
dialog: To a great weekend --
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the

speaker_heading: KARLA &amp; JULIE
dialog: I'll drink to that!
text: They drink and toast again.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (to Nancy)
dialog: So what do you do around here for fun?
text: Nancy looks straight at Will --
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Make fun of tourists mainly.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or let them make fun of themselves...
text: She flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Karaoke -- perfect.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Don't even think about it.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Okay, I won't.
text: She's already heading for the stage.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Go baby! Go!
speaker_heading: AT THE STAGE
text: CLOSE ON the karaoke machine. Karla flips through a binder full of
dialog: songs.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is
dialog: for somebody who really needs it.
dialog: (finds one)
dialog: Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese!
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (it's true)
dialog: Everyone thinks their a singer.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Not me...no way...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Come on, it'll be fun.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, please put your
dialog: hands together for my friend, my very
dialog: best friend, Julie James.
dialog: But there will be no mercy.
scene_heading: KARLA, TYRELL, &amp; WILL
dialog: (chanting in unison)
dialog: Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie!
text: Reluctantly she goes to the song book. She sees something
dialog: particularily awful.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You asked for it.
dialog: (to Tyrell)
text: Song number thirty-nine.
text: Tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy
text: strings begin to swell. She looks at the MONITOR, then
text: melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, BELT --
text: Gloria Gaynor's "I WILL SURVIVE."
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: First I was afraid...I was petrified...
dialog: (continues singing under)
text: Will stands, clapping. Tyrell pounds his chest. Karla flips up her
text: LIGHTER, swaying like a hard-core fan. And Julie continues, crooning
text: out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: I will survive...I will survive...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE KARAOKE MONITOR
text: The schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black. But
text: then...in the middle of the song...the color changes. RED CAPITAL\
text: LETTERS BEGIN TO FILL THE SCREEN.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: (singing --
dialog: then trailing off)
dialog: And I still know...what you did...
dialog: last summer...
text: Her voice trails. Her smile abruptly fades.
speaker_heading: MICROPHONE
text: falls to the floor. The room echoes with an electronic WHUMP. Everyone
text: stops dancing, confused.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - JULIE
text: trembling, shaking, a mess. Will jumps onstage.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Julie? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's...him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do you mean, Julie?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: He did something to the screen...it,
dialog: it, said...
text: Julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. She
text: suddenly feels their eyes upon her. They're looking at her like she's
text: having a nervous breakdown.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry...
text: Stung, she rushes off the stage.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Julie...
text: But it's to late. She's bolted from the bar.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 28	INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Julie steps into her room. Closes the door behind her. She falls back
text: against it, trying to calm herself down.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: There's no way...just stop it right
dialog: now...
text: She looks around the cozy room.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
text: Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic.
text: Julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally
text: catching up with her. She grabs something to sleep in. Tosses it on
text: the bed. And that's when she sees it,
speaker_heading: CLOSE - ENVELOPE
text: propped on the pillows. Her name written across. She is frozen
dialog: momentarily.
text: Almost against her will, she moves toward the envelope. She reaches
text: down and picks it up.
text: She hesitates, then opens the envelope. She pulls out a SINGLE WHITE
speaker_heading: CARD.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE CARD
text: In bold print it reads: SURPRISE!
speaker_heading: DARKFIGURE
text: appears over Julie's shoulder. Julie can feel the presence. She spins,
dialog: scaring --
speaker_heading: WILL
text: who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The
text: bottle bursts and covers them with spray.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I
dialog: didn't think...
text: She grabs a TOWEL off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up
dialog: the mess.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No, no, no. This was really sweet...
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I scared you -- I crossed the line --
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a
dialog: little on edge. I'm really sorry.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey, you don't have to appologize to me.
dialog: I'm the one. I understand.
dialog: (covering the awkwardness)
dialog: I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
text: He picks up a rose. Most of its petals on the floor.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I just really like you and I want you to
dialog: feel good about everything...You know? I
dialog: want you to be happy.
text: He hands the rose to her. There's a moment between them. He

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (soto)
dialog: Dork.
text: Passing Karla and Tyrell's room on his way down the hall, Will spots
text: the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN.
text: He hears an INCREDIBLE POUNDING from inside. He shakes his head and
text: mopes down the hall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 29	INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Karla bounces playfully on their big bed as Tyrell crosses toward the

speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Tha's it.
dialog: (bounce)
dialog: I've decided.
dialog: (bounce)
dialog: I'm changing my major to finance.
dialog: (bounce)
dialog: And going to Wall Street.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: 'Cause that's the only way I'm ever
dialog: gonna be able to afford a big bed like
dialog: this.
text: She falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a
text: long MIRROR HANGING RIGHT OVER THE BED. Tyrell loves this and quickly
text: moves beside her in the bed. She lets him get real close, then she
dialog: jumps up --
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: Jacuzzi.
text: Tyrell reaches for her, but she bounces off the bed.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Ah, baby, let's stay right here.
text: Karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and
text: flirtatiously for Tyrell.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if
dialog: it's just so you can pull it off.
text: Tyrell gets off the bed --
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: I like the sound of this.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 30	EXT. HOTEL DOCKS - NIGHT
text: Derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow
text: rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock.
text: Ominous shadows play all along the dock. Out on the water there's a
speaker_heading: big SPLASH.
text: The dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh.
speaker_heading: DERRICK
dialog: Damn. I should've brought my pole.
text: He turns away. As he does, we see
text: THE END OF THE DOCK
text: where a sinister SLICKER FIGURE stands perfectly still, silhouetted by
dialog: moonlight.
text: Derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other
text: tied-off staff and service boats.
text: He picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish
dialog: sailboat.
text: He turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an
text: EQUIPMENT SHACK. Suddenly, a HAND touches him on the back. He jumps
dialog: and turns to see --
speaker_heading: TITUS
text: standing there smoking a spliff.
speaker_heading: DERRICK
dialog: Get lost, you scared me.
speaker_heading: TITUS
dialog: Fish are all over the water...Come on,
dialog: let us take a boat out.
speaker_heading: DERRICK
dialog: Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up
dialog: in Spain.
speaker_heading: TITUS
dialog: That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
text: Derrick throws the hose in its place.
speaker_heading: DERRICK
dialog: There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats
dialog: are going out.
speaker_heading: TITUS
dialog: Storm is what makes it interesting.
dialog: Thass why all the fish are up. Less
dialog: hook us a couple big ones.
text: Derrick is now ignoring Titus.
speaker_heading: DERRICK
dialog: I got work to do. Take the bake
dialog: elsewhere.
speaker_heading: TITUS
dialog: Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
text: Titus glides away into the dark. Derrick watches him go. There's
text: another SPLASH in the water near the dock.
text: Derrick walks to where the splash was. He kneels down by the edge --
text: watching BUBBLES RISE from the dark water below.
speaker_heading: DERRICK
dialog: (to the fish)
dialog: Hello, little sea bass. You're lucky
dialog: I'm busy or I'd hook you myself.
text: WE PUSH IN AS HIS FACE GETS CLOSER TO THE WATER --
text: AND THEN -- RISING SLOWLY FROM THE DARK WATER DIRECTLY BEHIND THE
scene_heading: DOCKHAND -- A SINISTER SLICKER.
text: Derrick hears A SPLASH -- and just in time for...
text: SPLAT! THE OLD HOOK IN THE EYE. THE FISHERMAN PULLS HIM DOWN. HE
text: SCREAMS -- BEN YANKS ON THE HOOK -- AND DERRICK'S CRUMPLED BODY FALLS
text: INTO THE WATER.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE WATER

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 31	EXT. POOL/JACUZZI - NIGHT
text: Bubbles of a different kind. The JACUZZI sits in an enclosure at the
text: shallow end of the SWIMMING POOL.
text: And enjoying its warmth, Karla and Tyrell are liplocked in the
text: churning tub. MUSIC plays on the boombox beside them.
text: The tempurature rises and Ty's hands begin to wander. Still clad in
text: her cute bikini, Karla pulls away --
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: You sure you didn't pick up my hair
dialog: tie?
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (rubbing his bald head)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Okay, I just didn't wanna get my
dialog: hair wet.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Baby, I finally got you alone in this
dialog: Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin'
dialog: hair care.
text: She splashes him.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Don't you get feisty...
text: Tyrell moves in for the kill. He won't take no for an answer.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Too late for that. We're miles from
dialog: anywhere, baby. No one's gonna hear
dialog: you scream.
text: He goes in for a serious kiss. Things start to heat up --
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to
dialog: have to blow my whistle.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (playful)
dialog: I'd hate for you to have to blow...your
dialog: whistle.
text: Tyrell is done talking. He pulls her over to him and the moment
text: becomes more passionate.
text: Karla opens her eyes in time to see --
speaker_heading: TITUS
text: surface in the pool next to them.
text: Karla SCREAMS. And not just because it was a surprise. Titus looks
text: even uglier when he's wet.
text: Titus opens his mouth, reveals a smoking PHILLY BLUNT on the end of
dialog: his tounge.
speaker_heading: TITUS
dialog: No water sports after midnight. Hotel
dialog: policy.
text: Titus eyes Karla in the Jacuzzi. Tyrell moves protectively in front of
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: What's the policy on burnin' herb?
speaker_heading: TITUS
dialog: We got one for that, too. It's don't
dialog: try until you buy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You don't buy any, you don't get any.
text: Titus blows a cloud of smoke on them both, rolls the joint back into
text: his mouth, and swims off. Tyrell is angry, but Karla pulls him back.
text: A dejected Will appears in his bathing suit, a towel over his arm.
text: Tyrell sees him coming.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: There's ten people on this whole island
dialog: and they're all gonna end up in this
dialog: Jacuzzi with us.
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: TYRELL

speaker_heading: KARLA

speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (considerate)
dialog: How's Julie?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Alone. In the room.
dialog: (to Karla)
dialog: Got any advise?
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi.

text: A CLOUD OF STEAM billows from the open BATHROOM. THE SOUND OF A SHOWER
text: is heard. We MOVE TOWARD IT.
scene_heading: INT. SHOWER
text: Eyes closed, Julie stands with her face right under the showerhead,
text: trying to relax. Something softly goes THUMP.
text: Julie opens her eyes. Turns off the shower. Stands there, frozen,
dialog: listening.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Will...?
dialog: No reply.
text: AT THE BATHROOM DOORWAY
text: In a robe with a towel on her head, Julie peeks into her room. Nobody
text: there. She sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink.
text: AT THE SINK
text: Julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. She frowns.
text: Looks around. Some of her things are missing. She peers into the
text: fogged-up bathroom mirror.
text: She whips the TOWEL off her head and WIPES IT ACROSS THE MIRROR,
text: MAKING THE BEDROOM BEHIND HER VISIBLE.
text: Ready to spit, she looks down. AND IN THAT INSTANT -- WE SEE A SHADOWY
text: FIGURE PASS BEHIND HER IN THE BEDROOM. She looks back up...and HE'S
text: GONE. Julie turns on the water to rinse.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Is that you?
text: She unlocks and opens it. Nobody there.
text: Julie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just
text: begining to rise again as...
text: KLUNK-KLUNK. She hears it again. Then, the sound STOPS. But standing
text: at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. Her eyes
dialog: immediately go to...
speaker_heading: THE CLOSET
text: Damn. That's where it came from. She slowy pads across the room in her
text: slippers toward the door. Trembling...she reaches for the handle...AND
speaker_heading: TUGS IT OPEN!
text: There's NOTHING. She stares a beat. DRIP DRIP DRIP.
text: She sees something on the floor of the closet. She touches a finger to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: IT'S BLOOD.
text: She looks up.
speaker_heading: THE DOCKHAND
text: comes dropping down at her, dangling, enmeshed in barbed wire. He's

speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I don't find this at all funny.

speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Who? Who is here?

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: TYRELL

speaker_heading: NANCY

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: TYRELL

dialog: Fine. Show me the body.
text: Will wanders over to the closet and checks it out.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Think about this, Julie. What did you

speaker_heading: JULIE
text: The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck
dialog: from up there.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (case closed)
dialog: In the morning we'll talk to Derrick, the

dialog: to rest.

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Don't look at me --
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I want off this island.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: (tired)
dialog: Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry
dialog: left hours ago. And we got a storm
dialog: coming. There won't be another one for
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: There's a storm coming?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: 'Tis the season, like I told you. It's a
dialog: big one.
text: Julie goes for the phone.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Then I'll call the mainland for a

speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Phones went down a few minutes ago.

speaker_heading: JULIE

text: An exasperated Brooks heads for the door.
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Duh. The next couple of days is gonna
dialog: be rough, but we'll make it.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: What about a radio?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: Sorry. Emergencies only.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: What the hell would you call this?
speaker_heading: BROOKS
dialog: I'd call this four spoiled city kids who
dialog: wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up
text: their butts.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: All we can do now is batten down and ride
dialog: it out. If things get really bad, there's

text: And Brooks is gone. Outside the window, it starts to rain. There's a
text: CLAP of thunder.
speaker_heading: JULIE

scene_heading: 35	EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
text: And we PULL AWAY from Julie's face through the glass -- SLOWLY TILTING

speaker_heading: TINY WINDOW
text: in the bell tower. A candle burns, and lighning flashes illuminate the
text: haggard face of Estes, the porter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 36	INT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - NIGHT
text: It's a claustrophobic room. Estes turns away from the window,
text: shirtless in his uniform pants. A beaded cord hangs around his neck,
text: small fishhook dangling from it.
text: Beside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful
text: of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot. He sets them
text: on a divination tray.
text: He opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small
text: wooden bowl. He opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush. He dips the
text: brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo. He holds
text: the brush over the candle's flame. The old man watches it SIZZLE.
speaker_heading: ESTES picks up
speaker_heading: A STRAW FIGURE

speaker_heading: ROOM 228.
text: She stops, perplexed. There's nobody staying in this room. She picks
text: them up and stuff them in her cart. Then she knocks on the door.
speaker_heading: OLGA

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Housekeeping.
text: She knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the

dialog: blood.
text: She turns back to the linens. Something bloody is wrapped inside of
text: them. She paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery --
text: The door the Room 228 slowly cracks open. A STEEL HOOK reaches out and
text: slices into her apron. It tugs. She turns, and she starts to SCREAM,
text: she is yanked into the room.
text: A DO NOT DISTURB sign flips over the handle and the door SLAMS shut.
text: We hear her SCREAMS from inside.

speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Fine, buddy.
text: THE GUN AND THE RING
text: go down on the counter next to each other. Mac pulls out some forms.
speaker_heading: MAC (cont'd)
dialog: Fill these out. Leave the dates blank.
text: Ray starts writing. Mac is overcome by a moment of humanity.
speaker_heading: MAC (cont'd)
dialog: Buddy, are you sure this is the way

text: Ray gives him a steely stare --
speaker_heading: RAY

text: Julie is awake. She gets out of bed and moves toward the window.
text: It's raining outside. The wind is blowing. The storm has arrived.
text: Karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest. The hand belongs to Will.
text: She pinches the hand. Will starts.

speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: This ain't the romantic weekend I

speaker_heading: KARLA

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: I'm just saying what all of you are
dialog: thinking. It's bad enough gettin'

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don't have to be a jerk.
text: Karla pulls Julie close in a show of support for her friend whose mind

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's okay...He doesn't believe me.
dialog: That's his right. I'm starting to

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Nice move.
speaker_heading: KARLA

speaker_heading: The PIT BULL

speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: I'm gonna kill you, Bong Boy.

text: Tyrell sprints to the door -- it's LOCKED by a length of metal slipped
text: into the coupling.
text: He turns to see the dog bounding at him --
text: Tyrell leaps up the fence just as the pit bull lunges for him. The dog

text: The cluttered room is empty.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He's not here.
text: Tyrell and Will begin roughly searching through Estes's possessions.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: We're gonna find some weird crap
dialog: in here.
text: In the corner there is a curtain used as a partition. Julie pulls the
text: curtain back and discovers
text: A SMALL, HEAVY CABINET
text: sitting in the corner. It seems to glow from inside while casting an
text: evil pall over the room.
text: Julie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors.
text: Inside -- is a small voodoo shrine. A candle has burned low before it.
text: Hanging before the altar is
scene_heading: THE LITTLE STRAW MAN
text: impaled on a fishhook.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Voodoo.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: I told you.

speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (to Karla)
dialog: Missing a hair tie?

speaker_heading: TYRELL

dialog: that'll help.
text: Will and Tyrell eye the stairs leading down to the lobby.
speaker_heading: TYRELL

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: Yeah, wait right here, it's the
dialog: safest place.
text: Karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches
text: Julie's eye. She walks across the lobby.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Julie, where are you going?
text: Julie keeps walking. She sees historical pictures of the hotel: work
text: crews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing
text: next to sailfish and marlin.
text: Near the pictures, Julie sees the globe. It's spinning slowly.
text: Julie hesitates, then walks toward the globe. It stops spinning. She
text: looks down at it.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON - THE GLOBE
text: and Julie's hand finding Brazil. We see the capital is not Rio, but
dialog: Brazilia. This is dawning on Julie when we hear --
speaker_heading: ESTES (v.o.)
dialog: Brasilia.
text: She jumps out of her skin. Estes was standing right there in the
dialog: shadows.
speaker_heading: ESTES (cont'd)
dialog: That's the capital of Brazil, not
dialog: Rio.
text: Karla SCREAMS.
text: Tyrell comes flying across the lobby past Karla. He dives on Estes,

speaker_heading: WILL/ESTES/TYRELL

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: No --

speaker_heading: ESTES (cont'd)
dialog: I found the bodies this morning...I
dialog: tried to use the radio, but he
dialog: already destroyed it.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Let him go. I believe him.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: I haven't hurt anyone...I stole
dialog: those things to help you. To
dialog: protect you.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: He's telling the truth. He could've
dialog: easily killed me. He didn't.
dialog: (beat while
dialog: this sinks in)
dialog: Look, we didn't even answer the
dialog: radio question right...This whole
dialog: thing was a setup.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It
dialog: was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (starting to lose it)
dialog: You've got all these theories but
dialog: where is he? Where? Where's your
dialog: fisherman killer?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: TYRELL
dialog: (losing it)
dialog: You never do...The guy at the
dialog: nightclub, the body in your room last

dialog: something to you. How do we even know
dialog: you're not the one behind this --
dialog: Estes steps forward --
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to Tyrell)
dialog: How do we know you're not?
speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: (to Julie)
dialog: I know who you're talking about. He
dialog: used to work here at the hotel.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I've seen him around again. Out
text: in the woods by the orchard.
text: They look at Estes...Is he telling the truth?
speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: I can't remeber his name, but I

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How do we know you're not setting

speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: Where else you gonna go, son?
text: They look to the office, the gym...The sense of death surrounding
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: I know I don't want to stay in

scene_heading: 68	EXT. WOODS TRAIL - NIGHT
text: Estes, Will, Tyrell, Julie, and Karla walk along a trail through the

text: It's windy, dark, and spooky. The kind of place you'd take people if
dialog: you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. That is just what
dialog: Estes is doing.
speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: He worked here for many years. He
dialog: had a nice family. A pretty wife

dialog: (beat)
dialog: And the head they found much later.
text: A huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the

speaker_heading: ESTES (cont'd)
dialog: Careful --
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Did he do it?
speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: People say she was running around on

text: grabs for her arm.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Be careful, Julie.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I've got to see.

text: The first stone reads: SARAH WILLIS (birth/death)
text: The second stone reads: SUSIE WILLIS (birth/death)
dialog: Beyond them
scene_heading: A FRESHLY DUG GRAVE

text: Julie shouts into the darkness.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: KARLA

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: TYRELL

speaker_heading: KARLA

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: TYRELL (cont'd)

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Julie, come on.

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: All right --
text: The iron hatch is slowly opening. Julie gets the axe into possition --
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: We need a first-aid kit.

dialog: I'll come with you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You'll be okay. It's over.
text: Karla and Nancy rush from the bar. Julie looks tenderly at Will. He

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You've got blood everywhere, but I
text: can't find the wound.
text: Will takes her head in his hands, looks her in the eye.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's because it's not my blood.
text: The slow change in Julie as she realizes...
text: She starts to run. Will roughly grabs her.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: It's time you woke up, Julie.

speaker_heading: ESTES
dialog: Will...He's in on it. He's --
text: Suddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and
speaker_heading: A SPEAR TIP
text: appears in the front of his chest.
text: Nancy screams and looks over Estes's shoulder to see
speaker_heading: BEN WILLIS
text: standing there holding a spear gun.
text: Estes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying,
text: convulsing body. Nancy struggles to get loose.
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Help me.
text: Karla rushes to Nancy. She tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free.

text: Karla's head.
scene_heading: THE HOOK CATCHES
text: on a beam. Karla struggle with Nancy.
speaker_heading: KARLA
dialog: Come on, come on.
text: Ben tries to free his hook hand. Karla looks up at him. He calmly puts

dialog: driving
speaker_heading: THE SPEAR TIP
text: deep into Nancy who expires with a sigh.
speaker_heading: KARLA (cont'd)
dialog: Damn you.
text: Karla, blind with rage, attacks the fisherman. He kicks out with a
text: boot and sends Karla fying onto
speaker_heading: A GLASS TABLE
text: in the lobby area. The table explodes. Karla is finished.

text: looks quite dead.

dialog: finally get to spend some quality
dialog: time together.
text: Julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Why are you doing this to me?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Me, me, me. It's always about you.
dialog: I'm having bad dreams. I can't
dialog: sleep. I'm not doing well in school.
dialog: I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I trusted you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We had a connection, didn't we? I
dialog: can tell you one thing, though. Ray
dialog: didn't trust me. He was right. He's
text: dead, but he was right.
text: They come into the orchard. They are covered in mud. Julie stumbles
text: again. Goes to her knees. Works the knife free and slashes up at Will.
text: She slices him across the face.
text: He steps back, feels the blood.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: What'd you have to do that for?
text: There is a creepy pause. Will stares at his own blood. She catches her
dialog: breath...
text: Then suddenly, Will knocks the knife from her hand. He lifts her by
text: the hair. Enraged, he puches her in the face. She goes down.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 104	EXT. ORCHARD - NIGHT
text: Will has Julie in a choke hold. He drags her toward the open graves.
text: Julie is losing energy, slowly giving up.
speaker_heading: JULIE

text: Julie WAILS, struggling wildly in Ben's grasp.
speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: OMIGOD --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's my boy.

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No, no, no --
text: Ben pulls off his hook and strokes Julie's cheek with his stump.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Shush, now. No more screaming...No

speaker_heading: RAY (v.o.)
dialog: Let go of her! Now!
text: Ben and Will spin to see
speaker_heading: RAY

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What're you gonna do, boy? Call
dialog: us names?
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Let her go. Now.
text: Ray raises the .38 caliber handgun. He COCKS the hammer.
text: Ben doesn't let go of Julie. Lightning fast, he slaps his hook back on
text: and gets the point to Julie's neck.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Think about it, boy. You're no
dialog: killer.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's my job.
text: Ray hesitates, his finger on the trigger. He does look scared.
text: Ben takes a step toward Ray. Then another, pushing Julie in front of
text: him. Will moves closer, too.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Stop right there.
text: Ray's finger squeezing down the trigger.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You don't have it in you.
text: Suddenly, Will dives for Ray. Ray gets a shot off, tagging Ben in the
text: shoulder. The gun goes flying.
text: Julie spins and hits Ben in the face. He knocks her into her own
text: grave...Mud begins to slide in on her. She tries to scramble out.
text: Will and Ray wrestle, punching each other repeatedly in the face.
text: Will has Ray down and his hands around his kneck. He looks him in the
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We haven't missed you down here,
dialog: Ray boy. I got to know Julie real
dialog: well.
text: Will gets the better of Ray. He's stronger. He yanks him up -- choking
text: him. Ray is begging to check out.
speaker_heading: WILL (cont'd)
dialog: Think of all the things I'm gonna
dialog: do to her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Dad, finish him.
text: Ben charges toward Ray's back. He pulls back the hook for a roundhouse
dialog: slashing --
text: At the last second, Ray dips, elbows Will.
speaker_heading: THE HOOK
text: goes straight into Will's chest.
text: The fisherman has hooked his own son.
text: Father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank.
text: Ben stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud.
text: Ben SCREAMS in rage. Ray is tired.
text: THWACK. Ben begins beating Ray. He puches him. He straight-arms him
text: with the hook. He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving
dialog: up...
text: Ben has Ray against a tombstone. The hook slowly inches toward his
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Gonna blind you first.
text: The hook is touching the eyelid --
speaker_heading: A GUNSHOT
text: rings out. A look of wonder crosses Ben's face. He slowly turns away
dialog: from Ray.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: stands behind him holding the gun.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Just...Die.
text: BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward
text: into Julie's grave.
text: As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave...
scene_heading: A MUDDY LANDSLIDE
text: slowly covers Ben up.
text: Ben's face is covering over. His mouth starting to fill with dirt --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You can't kill me.
text: His face is completely covered. His mouth still moving.
speaker_heading: BEN (cont'd)
dialog: I'll always be with you.
text: The dirt covers him. It continues to fill, until just the
scene_heading: GLEAMING METAL HOOK
text: waves futilely out of the dirt. Then, is stops wiggling.
text: Julie goes to Ray.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 105	EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

dialog: Now, how about we get off this piece
dialog: of crap island.
text: The first rays of the morning sun appear. Ray looks adoringly at Julie

text: Ray kisses her. She kisses him back. They are silhouetted against a
text: beautiful orange sunrise.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: We don't have to tell anyone it
dialog: rained the whole time. It can just
dialog: be our little secret.

scene_heading: A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER

scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 106	EXT. HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: SUPERTITLE:			FOUR MONTHS LATER
text: Julie pedals her bicycle down the street. She has a book bag over her
text: shoulder. It feels like one of the first days of school.

text: rolls the bike right up to the front door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 107	INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Julie lets herself into the house. She leans her bike against another
text: bike in the hallway.
text: It's a perfect day. Birds CHIRPING. WIND in the willows. There's
text: another NOISE...from inside her house.
text: She goes perfectly still. And listens. Behind her, by the kitchen, the
text: shadow of a FIGURE moves. She whirls.
speaker_heading: NOTHING
text: She creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen. She pauses --
text: The dark figure almost knocks into her. She SCREAMS.
text: It's Ray. He's holding a disemboweled toaster.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 107C	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

text: The windows are closed. The closet door is shut.
text: The room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a
text: highboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. A stuffed bear
text: sits in a chair.
text: There is a CLATTER from another room. Julie freezes. She waits. She
text: hears it again. She climbs out of bed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 107D	INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Julie walks into the dark spare bedroom. The CLATTERING SOUND comes

text: the dirty imprint of a boot below the window.
scene_heading: 107E	INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Julie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy.

scene_heading: 107F	INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Julie enters the room. She looks at the closet door. It is open a
text: crack. She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it
dialog: wasn't.
text: Julie approaches the closet. She catches her refelction in the mirror
text: next to the closet. She peers into the crack of the closet. She can't
text: see anything. She throws open the closet door.
speaker_heading: NOTHING
text: She looks around the room.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What is my problem?
text: She sits down on the bed.
text: We see her bare feet from under the bed.
text: She smiles, relaxes. She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall.
text: Something has caught her eye. She freezes. She turns slowly back to
text: the reflection in the mirror. She sees the glint of steel --
scene_heading: A HOOK -- CRASH ZOOM INTO REFLECTION --
text: THE FISHERMAN CROUCHING UNDER HER BED
dialog: Julie turns too late --
