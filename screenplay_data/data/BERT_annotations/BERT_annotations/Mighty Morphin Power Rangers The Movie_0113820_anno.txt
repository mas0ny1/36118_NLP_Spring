dialog: times removed on my mother's
dialog: side. He`s just visiting for the
dialog: summer.
speaker_heading: RITA

text: staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy. The egg
text: opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air. webs of
text: ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE.
text: When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT
text: OOZE. The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in o
dialog: the sticky substance.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What... you spent two thousand
dialog: years looking for this tub of
speaker_heading: SNOT!
text: As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS. Zedd and Rita
text: are too busy arguing to notice this.
speaker_heading: ZEDD
dialog: Don't you ever have anything nice
dialog: to say?!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well, if I did I certainly
dialog: wouldn't say it to you!

speaker_heading: ZEDD
speaker_heading: WHAT!
text: Zedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips
text: apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of
scene_heading: GLISTENING SILVER.
text: He stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts
text: his hands on his head, CRACKS it.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Ahhhhhhhh.

text: and gives his trademark stance.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE
dialog: is back!!
text: Rita blushes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: He's so cute.
text: Zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to Ivan.
speaker_heading: ZEDD
dialog: I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of
dialog: all that is good and decent. It
dialog: is a supreme honor to finally
dialog: meet you.
text: Ivan gives a slight bow.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: How can I ever repay you?
speaker_heading: ZEDD
dialog: Do you recall the name... Zordon
dialog: of Eltare?
text: Ivan's face goes dark, THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP
text: WITH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING. Mordant turns to Goldar.
speaker_heading: MORDANT
text: Seems to ring a bell.
speaker_heading: ZEDD
dialog: I want you to destroy Zordon, so
dialog: that my evil may once again reign
speaker_heading: SUPREME.
speaker_heading: IVAN (hissing)
dialog: I will not only destroy him, I

speaker_heading: IVAN (reading)
dialog: "... left off Interstate 12?!"
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: What's an "interstate"?
speaker_heading: MORDANT
dialog: It's like a freeway. How long
dialog: have you been locked up? !

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: ALPHA 5

speaker_heading: AISHA

speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: ... Perhaps there is a way... I
dialog: have heard tales of another
dialog: power.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: ... They say that somewhere
dialog: beyond the Hyperion Constellation
dialog: there exists a mythological power
dialog: that is beyond all comprehension.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: How can we get to it?
speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: As the legend goes, the power is
dialog: impossible to obtain.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: We have to try, Alpha. It's our
dialog: only hope.
text: Alpha shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: It's far too dangerous. Zordon
dialog: would never allow it.
speaker_heading: AISHA
dialog: If we don't try, Zordon won't
dialog: survive!
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: If Ivan Ooze isn't stopped,
dialog: nobody will survive.
text: Alpha heaves a sigh.
speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: Ay, yi, yi, yi.

speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: This is an emergency reserve of
dialog: morphonic emissions. It should
dialog: be enough to get -you there.
text: He approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile.
speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: There is one problem. I only

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: So how do we get back?
text: Alpha gives them a grim look.
speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: ... You'll have to pray that the

speaker_heading: ALPHA 5
dialog: You're sure you want to do this?!

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Where did it originate?
speaker_heading: DULCEA
dialog: In another time, another

dialog: long ago by the "Nathadians", a
dialog: people who are now all but

text: They built an impenetrable stone

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: And how do we do that?
speaker_heading: DULCEA
dialog: By learning the ancient art of
