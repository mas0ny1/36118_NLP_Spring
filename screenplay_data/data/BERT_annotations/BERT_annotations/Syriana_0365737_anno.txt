scene_heading: 2 INT. PRIVATE NIGHTCLUB - MORNING 2

text: buckets and bottles of Absolut and Johnnie Walker.
dialog: And with them is BOB BAER, 40's, professionally
dialog: nondescript, he could be anything, a salesman, a high-

scene_heading: 5 INT. KEBAB SHOP - DAY 5
text: Corrugated metal shutters CLOSE, sealing out the light.
text: Arash ushers Bob through the gloom toward TWO MILITARY

text: Inside: A STINGER MISSILE, neatly disassembled. He finds
text: the serial number: 3j16w4921.
text: A SMILEY FACE is scratched into the metal of the Stinger.
text: Bob tries to activate the Stinger. It's dead. Arash and
text: his brother perspire. Bob is perspiring.
text: Bob thinks he hears faint MOUTH BREATHING from behind the
text: curtain closing off the rear of the shop.
text: Bob opens HIS ATTACHE CASE. He removes a pouch. The pouch
text: holds a battery. The battery has a serial number.
text: Bob finds: 3j16w4921. A perfect match. He removes the

speaker_heading: BOB

text: The BARREL OF A GUN touches the side of Bob's head. The

text: A hand rapidly hits the firing button. ROBBY BAER, 16,

text: He glances over at a cafe table where Bob and MARGARET
text: BAER, 40's, frank and guarded in a way that is
