scene_heading: EXT. A HOUSE ON A HILL - NIGHT
speaker_heading: MUSIC: :
text: We are looking up at a house. It stands some distance
dialog: away, on a hill. From the moment WE SEE it we know that
text: it is a house of terror -- imposing, Gothic, gloomy,
text: menacing. Perhaps it is reminiscent of the house in
text: Psycho, perhaps -- though not a castle -- it has the
text: deserted soulless empty quality of Kane's house when
text: seen first through its gates.
text: The MUSIC WE HEAR is Thriller music, urgent strings,
text: ‘suggesting panic, suggesting unspoken evil. Bernard
dialog: Hermann sort-of-music.
text: And the weather is overcast. There is a watery moon
text: struggling to break through racing clouds. -But a
text: thunderstorm is on the way.
scene_heading: Superimpose: MAIN TITLES
text: A car turns off a ‘highway onto a country lane leading
text: towards the house. The car would not be the-cat's whiskers
text: even in the year in which this story takes place.
scene_heading: END TITLES - SUPERIMPOSE "1954"
text: CAMERA ‘CRANES DOWN .and MOVES WITH the car AS it approaches
text: the gates of the house. They are closed. A man gets out
text: of the car. He is a BUTLER. He is dressed like a butler.
text: He has the manner of a butler. Even when opening gates
text: all alone he does so with the demeanour of a butler. ‘His
text: name is WADSWORTH. Having opened the gates, he sits back
text: in his car, and motors slowly up the private drive.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT. DOOR - NIGHT
text: As THE BUTLER's car draws to a halt, there is a distant
text: RUMBLE of THUNDER. Lights can be seen through some of
text: the ground floor windows. A savage looking German Shepherd |
text: snarls and bares his teeth .at the arriving car. Another
text: German Shepherd is crapping on top of the front steps.
text: Both dogs are chained up.
text: WADSWORTH gets out of the car, locks it methodically, and
text: mounts the steps to the front door. ‘One of the dogs leaps
text: at him, trying to attack him. He throws a chunk of raw
text: meat at the dogs. They fall upon it hungrily, and retreat
text: to the side of the steps. WADSWORTH is relieved.

scene_heading: INT. THE HALL - NIGHT
text: Methodically, WADSWORTH opens the front door. It creaks.
text: He comes in sniffs, makes a face, scrapes his shoe, shuts
text: the door, hangs up his coat on the coat stand. He wears
text: a black jacket, white tie, stiff collar and poinstripe
text: trousers. He walks across the marble floor, his foot-
text: steps echoing on the cold, grey stone. He stops at the
text: open Dining Room door and looks in. The table is
text: beautifully and meticulously laid for dinner for seven.

scene_heading: INT. THE LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: YVETTE is the French Maid. She is young, beautiful, with
text: a great figure which is tightly encased in a maid's uni-
dialog: form -- black dress, little white apron and cap, sheer
text: black stockings and dainty black shoes. But the skirt is
text: shorter than normal, and very tight over her bottom --
text: and her black dress is very low cut. Her ample bosom is
text: pushed right up and half out of the top of the dress.
text: She is an outrageous young lady, with an improbable French
text: accent which cannot be reproduced on the page. She has
text: been polishing a glass, and dancing to the latest poo
text: music on the radio. She bends forward to replace the
text: glass on the tray, her breasts falling beautifully forward.
text: WADSWORTH watches.
