speaker_heading: McBAIN

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Hey, cigarette?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I don't smoke.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: We found these on him. Traced the prescription. According to his

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: No he didn't.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Sure?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I think he would've told me.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Have any idea who killed him?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: McBAIN

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: This company was Fuller's life. He worked and lived here.
speaker_heading: McBAIN

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: I thought you knew. You didn't know?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: No, I thought we were months away from the first trial run.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Any complications?
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: None that I know of yet.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: The whole thing's a giant computer game?
speaker_heading: WHITNEY

speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Units?
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
text: Electronic, simulated characters. They populate the system. They

speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: They fuck?
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: Let's just say that they're modeled after us. Right now we have
dialog: a working prototype
dialog: Los Angeles, circa 1937.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Why '37?
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: Fuller wanted to start by recreating the era of his youth. You
text: see, while my mind is jacked in, I'm walking around experiencing
text: 1937. My body stays here and holds the consciousness of the
dialog: program link unit.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: You think one of them units crawled up an extension cord and

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROBBY
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Glad I caught you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mr. Hall. What are you doing here.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Well, it's about your father. Actually. You said you spoke with
dialog: him a few days ago. Can you tell me anything about that
dialog: conversation? Did he seem strange to you at all?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, he'd been under a lot of stress lately. He asked me to fly
dialog: to the States, so I could help with the company.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Help him run it?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Shut it down.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I worked with him for 6 years. If he wanted to shut it down, he
dialog: would've told me about it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He didn't tell you about me. But I wish he had.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: It's nice to see you again.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Sorry I'm late. Have you had a chance to look through the
dialog: paperwork?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yes, I have. And I think we have a very strong case. The company
dialog: should be yours in no time.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What do you mean strong case?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: What I'm saying is , your father changed his will in favor of
dialog: the employees. In fact you aren't mentioned in the original will
dialog: either. But as I said, I think we have a very strong case.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Who will heard the board now?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Douglas Hall.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Not bad. Owner of a &2 billion enterprise. Strange, Fuller would

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I was on a airplane when it happened.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
text: According to the security guard, Fuller left the office at ten-
text: thirty p.m., 30 minutes after your plane arrived. Autopsy shows
dialog: that he died around midnight. You had time to catch up with him.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: But I didn't. I went straight home.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
text: Didn't talk to him? No, e-mails, no faxes, no even message?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: None of the above.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: You know, that's funny. We checked Fuller's phone records. He
text: made a call with his calling card at 11:02p.m.b Your home number.
dialog: I'd appreciate it if you didn't leave for a couple of days. And

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I think it's time I call my attorney.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: You say you left your office at 10.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I was working late with Whitney. I told you that.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Anybody with you?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: You're picking up bad habits left and right.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Must be the stress.
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Then you'll need a carton. Mane's Tom Jones. Said he saw your
dialog: picture in the news paper. Said you looked like the guy Fuller
dialog: left the bar with that night. We took his statement. Said we'd

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: I saw the pictures. The guy was slaughtered.
speaker_heading: JANE

scene_heading: INT. THE BOOK STORE

dialog: Hi, honey bear. I'll be with you in 5 minutes.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Let's talk, " honey bear" You remember her?
speaker_heading: GRIERSON
text: Of course not. She's mistaken me for someone else. Or someone
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I want you to look around and tell me what you remember.
speaker_heading: GRIERSON
text: I don't know, Mr. Hall. I'd rather go home. I don't feel very
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: You have the feeling you've been here before? Please try to
dialog: remember. Do you recognized anybody?
speaker_heading: GRIERSON
dialog: I'm trying.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Her? What's her name?
speaker_heading: GRIERSON
dialog: I think her name Erika, I believe. I believe her name is Erika.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: GRIERSON
text: I'm not sure. And that one looks familiar too.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Bridget. Her name's Bridget.
speaker_heading: GRIERSON
dialog: Bridget. Oh Yes. I remember Bridget.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Did you give her something to give me? Did you give her a letter
dialog: or a note?
speaker_heading: GRIERSON
dialog: The man behind the bar. You're right. I wrote a letter. And gave
text: it to him.
scene_heading: INT. THE BASEMENT
speaker_heading: ASHTON

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: My name's Ferguson. I'm a bank teller.

speaker_heading: ASHTON
text: Cut the crap! You think I don't know what's going in? I need to
dialog: see him I need to talk to him again.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: You read the letter. I need to know what's in the letter.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
text: Everything. When I read it, I thought it was a gag. The world's a
text: sham. Fat chance. but I'm not stupid, Mr. Hall. I watched you and
dialog: Ferguson do the old switcheroo. That stuff about going to " the
dialog: ends of the earth"
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: What stuff?
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: I did exactly what the letter said. I chose a place I'd never go
dialog: to. I tried to drive to Tucson. I figured, what the hell. Never
dialog: been to the countryside. And I took that car out on the highway.
dialog: I was going over 50 through that desert. After a while, it was
text: the only car on the road. It was just me, the heat and the dust.
dialog: I did exactly what the letter said. "Don't follow any road signs
text: and don't stop for anything. Not even barricades." But just when
text: I should've been getting closer to the city. Something wasn't
text: right. There was no movement, no life. Everything was still and
text: quiet. And then I got out of the car. And what I saw scared me to
text: the depths of my miserable soul. It was true. It was all a sham.
dialog: It ain't real.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Why would Fuller write about the limitations of the simulation?
dialog: I know them.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: I'm asking the questions now. I want to know why would you put us
dialog: through this? Why are you fucking with our minds?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: You weren't supposed to find out.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: Well I did. Now I want you to show me what is real. Is this real?
dialog: Is that real blood? How do you like having your life fucked with?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Damn, what's going on? Where's the letter?
scene_heading: INT. THE 13Th FLOOR
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: Snap out of it. You won't hit me again?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: WHITNEY
text: Yeah, barely, man. Just barely. You didn't start the timer. It
dialog: couldn't engage. What are you doing this alone for anyway?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Ashton.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: he found out his world isn't real. This is a mistake. This whole
dialog: project, this experiment. We are screwing with people's lives!
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: Now you're talking crazy. I know you just had a bad fucking trip.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Bad fucking trip? These people are real. They are as real as you
dialog: and me.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: Yeah, that's because we designed them that way. In the end,
dialog: they're just a bunch of electronic circuits.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I tell you something else. I'm shutting this bad fucking trip
dialog: right down. I'm telling everybody tomorrow.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY
dialog: You can't do that. You're talking about 6 years of our lives.

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Why would I?
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: Hannon Fuller doesn't have a daughter. I think I made the age-old
dialog: mistake. "Never trust a beautiful woman."
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Who is she, then?
speaker_heading: McBAIN
dialog: We don't know. It took us a couple days to contact the French

scene_heading: EXT.OUTSIDE THE HOTEL

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Sorry about staring at you in there. You must get that a lot.
speaker_heading: NATASHA
dialog: Yeah, but mostly from the wrong kinds of guys. You're not from
dialog: here, are you?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: What makes you ask?
speaker_heading: NATASHA
text: Well, it's just I don't know I just had this funny feeling that
dialog: we met before.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

dialog: What else did the roommate say?
speaker_heading: COP
text: Says lately, Natasha hasn't been feeling well. She's been having
text: some sort of amnesia attacks. Going out all night sleeping all

speaker_heading: McBAIN

text: look, I can explain. I'm sorry. I need to see you Fuller' office.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I know the truth.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: You could call it the end of the world.
scene_heading: INT. THE OFFICE
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: How many simulated worlds like this are there?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thousands. Yours is the only one that ever created a simulation
text: within the simulation. Something we never expected.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: So you had to kill Fuller.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No. I was sent in after his death. I was to pretend to be his
dialog: daughter, inherit the company. And shut it down. But he tricked
dialog: us. He changed his will.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: If you didn't kill Fuller. Who did?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I stabbed him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: But it wasn't you. It was your user. He downloaded into you.
dialog: Manipulated you.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: Like a puppet.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: A puppet doesn't have a soul.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I can't have a soul any more than Fuller.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: But you do. Fuller did. That's I never expected that. We
dialog: programmed this world so no one in it could learn the truth. And
dialog: you and Fuller did. Don't you see what that means?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: There's just one little flaw in your thesis. None of this is
dialog: real. You pull the plug. I disappear. And nothing I ever say
dialog: nothing I ever do will ever matter. Why don't you find my user?
dialog: I'm sure he's a much better catch.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I told you about my other life. I was referring to my husband.
dialog: He's
dialog: your user. He killed Fuller.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I'm his program link. A reflection of his character profile. I
dialog: fell in love with a decent man. But he ...something happened to
text: him. He began to use the simulation as his own personal
dialog: playground. Like Fuller with the girls. He made himself a god,
dialog: and it corrupted him. he began to enjoy the killings. He became
dialog: abusive.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: What do you mean? I'm not even real. You can fall in love with a
dialog: dream.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You're more real to me than anything I've ever known.

speaker_heading: COP

text: He jacked in.

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Turn it off.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
text: Put it back. Don't do that! Put it back! What did I do? Where are
dialog: you? Look at this ! You're really a God.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: No Ashton, I'm not really a God. I'm just like you. Just a bunch
dialog: of electricity.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: It's all smoke and mirrors. Just like your world. We're nothing
text: but a simulation on some computer. It's like a machine. Like this
dialog: arcade game. You've got your players and you put your nickel in.
text: This one pitches. This one runs around the bases. Pre-
dialog: programmed movements generated by electrical energy. We're
dialog: improved on this model since then. The players can beat the shit
text: out of and try to drown some other, which is always fun.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: But the letter said
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Everything was fake? The letter was meant for me. Fuller was
dialog: talking about my world.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: So what are you saying? You're saying there's another world on
dialog: top of this one?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: Fuller found out about it. They killed him.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: Why didn't they kill you?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: Maybe they will. Maybe that's why you're pointing a gun at me.
text: I*m sorry, Ashton. We're stuck here. You and me. And the rest of
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: ASHTON
dialog: So this is where I was born.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: JANE
text: He reminds me of you. The way you used to be. I'm still the same.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because it was fun.
speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: simulation.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I was just having some fun. Just like you did.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: JANE
text: That's not true. It's okay. Just pretend you're fucking him.
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE
