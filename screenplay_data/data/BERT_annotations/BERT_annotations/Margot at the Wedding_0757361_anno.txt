dialog: Written by
dialog: Noah Baumbach
scene_heading: 1 INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY 1
text: A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The
text: boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard
text: tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This
dialog: is Claude.
text: We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle,
text: balances it in one hand as he opens the door.
text: The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars.
text: He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits
text: while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above
text: the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration
text: alternating between the food and the path.
text: He sits next to a brunette woman. He hands her a hot dog.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Here.
text: He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black
text: circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly
text: blushes and mumbles:
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Sorry.
text: He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next
text: to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder
text: length hair. Her name is Margot.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: That was quick.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I sat next to the wrong person.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Really? Where?
text: She stretches up and peers over the seats. He grabs her
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Please don't look. She'll see you.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Careful with my blouse.
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: 2 CUT TO: 2
text: Margot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude
text: listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up,
text: and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes
dialog: between cars.
text: The train roars and screeches. Claude screams. He stops,
text: looks around. He screams again.
dialog: 3 CUT TO: 3
text: Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a
text: river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water.
text: Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant.
text: Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger
text: against the glass and traces the wires.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Will the wedding be crowded?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't know. I think she doesn't
dialog: know anyone anymore.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: How long has she known Malcolm?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Only a year.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Is that short?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: Would you marry someone you'd only
dialog: known a year?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I'm not going to ever get married.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I can't say I have a lot of hope
dialog: for the whole thing.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Why are we going then?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: We're supporting her.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I thought she wasn't speaking to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No...no...I wasn't speaking to her,
dialog: but I'm over it.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY 4
text: A ferry is docked. Cars pull up onto the boat. Margot runs,
text: clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun
text: hat. Claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his
dialog: shoulder.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. FERRY - DAY 5
text: The rumbling and sputtering of the boat. People get out of
text: their cars and stretch their legs.
text: Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his
text: face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She
text: stuffs the phone in her pocket.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Why aren't you wearing your new
dialog: shades?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't think I need them right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You begged for those glasses.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I know, but...I will wear them, I
dialog: just feel like people might think
dialog: it's weird that a kid is wearing
text: dark shades.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: That's ridiculous.
text: Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk
text: sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self-
dialog: consciously.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You look very cool.
text: He takes them off.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't need them right now.
dialog: 6 CUT TO: 6
text: Margot and Claude wait. The ferry has emptied out.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Do they know we're here?
text: A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops
text: across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the
text: backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down
text: the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and
text: sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Are you...?
scene_heading: 7 INT. VOLVO - DAY 7
text: Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is
text: in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl,
text: Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind.
text: Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a
text: panda on it.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
text: Paul apologizes for not coming,
dialog: she's still getting the house
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I'm sorry it was such short notice.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
text: I don't care. Paul's frantic, but
dialog: I don't give a shit. Oh, and
dialog: Ingrid wants me to tell you that
dialog: she made us all bracelets.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: No, I wanted...I wanted to wait...
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Oh, I thought you asked me to tell
dialog: them. Anyway...
text: Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange
dialog: bracelet.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I got Knicks colors.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: They're not Knicks colors!
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It's beautiful, Ingrid.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: (to Claude)
dialog: I made this one for myself.
text: She shows him the purple and green one around her wrist.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Yours is yellow. Is that okay?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Where's your dad and Josh?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: They might come later.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
text: Josh's spring break is next week.
text: Jim teaches through Friday and then
text: they open the house in Vermont on
dialog: the weekend.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (bluntly)
dialog: It means a lot to Pauline that
dialog: you're here.
text: Margot nods awkwardly -- she blushes.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Oh. Good.
text: A car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near
text: their car. Malcolm swerves anyway.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!
text: Ingrid giggles. Margot clutches the handle above the door.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: If you're wondering about the
dialog: moustache --
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, I wasn't.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I had a full beard for a while and
dialog: then when I shaved it I left this
dialog: part for last, you know to see how
dialog: it looked, and... It's meant to be
dialog: funny.
text: Margot nods politely. The sound of tires on gravel:
scene_heading: 8 EXT. HOUSE - DAY 8
text: The trunk slams shut. The Volvo is parked in a driveway
text: alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water.
text: They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them.
text: Pauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her
text: sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot
text: smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips
text: down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You're so handsome.
text: Now she hugs Margot. They both tear up. Claude beams.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I never thought I'd get you here.
text: A loud thud. They all turn toward the property fence. A
text: large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped
text: into their yard. There's whispering and movement through
text: brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with
dialog: concern.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You're arriving in the midst of a
dialog: drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is
dialog: inside.
text: Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: It's the Voglers.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: The neighbors want us to cut down
dialog: our tree.
text: She indicates a large oak that extends up and into the
text: adjoining property.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, that's our tree!
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: They think it's sick and rotting
dialog: their property.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We're having the ceremony under it.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You took the swing down.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Pauline thinks this is their way of
dialog: trying to be friends. I think they
dialog: resent us because we're...
text: He searches for the word, but can't come up with anything.
dialog: He says wearily:
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I don't know what we are.
scene_heading: 9 INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM/INGRID'S ROOM - DAY 9
text: Claude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his
text: wrist. An old flip-clock hums on the night-table. A door
text: opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto
text: another bedroom.
text: Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a
text: realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: This is my room.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Do you like showers or baths?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Showers. What about you?
dialog: 8.
text: Ingrid shrugs. She says, already bored with the topic:
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I don't care.
scene_heading: 10 INT. STAIRWELL/MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - DAY 10
text: Pauline and Margot carry bags up the stairs. Margot now
text: wears a knit red bracelet. They're tentative with one
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Is Malcolm what you thought he'd
dialog: be?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Well, I didn't know what to --
speaker_heading: PAULINE
text: The moustache is temporary. He
dialog: left it for last when he was
dialog: shaving. It's meant to be funny.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: He told me.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Yeah...
text: They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the
text: curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm sorry -- with so little time to
dialog: prepare, we had to put you in
dialog: Malcolm's storage room --
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: This was Becky's room. Poor Becky.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a
dialog: storage room. I've just started to
dialog: feel like it's our house not my
dialog: parents. You know?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Our parents.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Of course. It might still smell
dialog: like paint, but...
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I thought he was a musician.
text: Pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to
text: unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well, music's officially a hobby...
dialog: He's painting now. And writing
dialog: letters to newspapers and
dialog: magazines. He's very meticulous,
dialog: he'll spend up to a week writing a
text: response to a music review. He's
dialog: incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
dialog: I don't know. We're doing very
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Good. I mean, you must be.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't know where to begin. What
dialog: can I tell you? It seems I'm
dialog: pregnant, but it's really early
dialog: so... I haven't told anyone. I
dialog: mean, I haven't told Malcolm or
dialog: Ingrid.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Wow...
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I
dialog: hope so. Things are good. We did
dialog: a couples seminar two months ago or
dialog: so in Maine. They give you
dialog: exercises and things to do. I know
dialog: you're not convinced, but...
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (vaguely)
speaker_heading: Mm hm.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We got engaged right afterwards.
dialog: The guy who runs it, Strickland,
dialog: wrote a really interesting book
dialog: about loving which I'll lend you if
dialog: you want.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (non-committal)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: But only if you'll read it.
dialog: Because I need it back. I made
text: notes in the margins.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I may not get to it for a while.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well, I'm not going to lend it to
dialog: you if you're not going to read it.
text: They meet eyes. Pauline quickly turns away.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It's going to be very informal by
dialog: the way. Just Mom and Becky.
dialog: Malcolm's brother. Few friends.
dialog: And now you and Claude. Nothing
dialog: like the first one.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (wary)
dialog: Becky's coming?
speaker_heading: PAULINE/MARGOT
dialog: She isn't how you.../I'd really
dialog: like...
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You go.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I was going to say, "I'd really
dialog: like some white wine."
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Oh. Yeah. We have a...
dialog: Well...I'm glad you changed your
dialog: mind and came. I never heard from
dialog: you after I sent the invite...I
dialog: even wondered if you got it.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Well, I'm so pleased we're here.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Did you get it?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yeah.
text: Pauline waits for an explanation.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I'm sorry you were so angry...
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I wasn't angry. I
dialog: was...disappointed.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Uh huh. But you see when you say,
dialog: "disappointed" it puts me in a
dialog: crummy situation. Like I let you
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: But you did in a way.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't see it like that.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Fine. I felt betrayed. Is that
dialog: word okay?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Again, you're making me the
dialog: aggressor.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You were the aggressor.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Let's not... I've become a really
dialog: good cook.
scene_heading: 11 INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY 11
text: Malcolm strums his guitar and smokes. Pauline sits at his
text: feet with Ingrid and Claude. The kids look at a record
text: sleeve. Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little
text: brown notebook. She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I can't believe you've still got
dialog: all of our old records.
text: Ingrid pulls an album toward her. Her eyes widen at the
text: scary image on the cover. She quickly turns it over and
text: hands it to her mother.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Mom, can you hide this please.
text: Pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (for Margot's benefit)
dialog: Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek
dialog: once?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: In the late `80's. It was a solo
dialog: gig after he left the Cars.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: So, you're kind of famous.
text: Malcolm reddens.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I
dialog: used to want to be, but, No. Do
dialog: you want to be famous?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Claude wants to be very famous.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Well, make sure you can handle
dialog: rejection. I can't. For me,
text: expectation just turns to
dialog: disappointment. So, ultimately I'd
dialog: rather not try. It'll all go black
dialog: for us soon enough anyway.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Claude, ignore him.
text: Pauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with
text: an expression of either contempt or confusion. Pauline grows
text: uncomfortable. She says to Claude:
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: When your mother moved to New York
dialog: she used to send me books and
dialog: records. She sent me REM's
dialog: Murmur...
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: And the Pixies.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: And X. She was very cool your
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You only liked top forty.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Yeah, but I love REM now.
text: Margot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't really listen to music
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I was dating that guy, Horace back
dialog: then. Remember him?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Was that the guy who liked to rough
dialog: you up?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No, that was our dad.
text: Pauline and Margot crack up laughing. Malcolm raises an
text: eyebrow at Claude.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Our father used to strip down to
dialog: his skivvies and beat us with a
dialog: belt.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: That man had a sexual screw loose.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It's awful -- that stuff that
dialog: happens to kids. Malcolm was
text: fondled by a male baby-sitter.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Just use that information however
dialog: you want...
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Sorry. We're with family. I
dialog: figured...
text: Claude looks at Malcolm. Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I think Becky got it the worst.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Did she ever. Raped by the horse
dialog: trainer...
text: Margot breaks into laughter. Pauline spits her seltzer back
text: into the glass. They both laugh hysterically. Tears stream
text: down Margot's face. Claude watches.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. PATIO - NIGHT 12
text: Malcolm, Pauline, Margot, Claude and Ingrid sit with a
text: homosexual couple, Alan, 40's, and Toby, 30's, and their son,
text: Bruce, 8, at an old wooden table eating crab, salad and soup.
text: Part of Alan's face is paralyzed.
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: Alan rolled over in bed and looked
dialog: at me and he said I can't feel my
dialog: face. It took three doctors before
dialog: we knew it was Bells Palsy.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: They say a brush of wind can do it.
speaker_heading: TOBY
text: Feeling is slowly coming back.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: We're all getting older... Which
dialog: is terrible -- I don't care how
dialog: universal it is. I can't remember
dialog: names anymore.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I have that. I blank out on
dialog: certain words now too. Like the
dialog: other day, I couldn't remember the
dialog: word for...
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I've forgotten it again. The stuff
dialog: in wine. Sediment! That was it.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I know that. I was talking more
dialog: about not remembering who was the
text: bassist for Motley Crüe.
text: Malcolm lights up a cigarette. He offers one to Claude who
dialog: shakes his head, No.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Ingrid, why don't you show Claude
text: and Bruce the game trunk.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Okay.
text: Claude reluctantly follows Ingrid and Bruce. He looks back
text: longingly at the table of adults.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (relieved, to himself)
dialog: Mick Mars.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Toby, I think you need to have
dialog: Bruce diagnosed.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Margot, I don't want to have this
dialog: conversation with you.
text: We follow the kids inside. We hear in the background:
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It's vital. If you keep telling
dialog: him he's like everyone else he'll
dialog: wonder why he isn't. He's
dialog: suffering.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: He's tested very well. He does B's
dialog: in school.
text: Claude stops -- his mother and Toby are arguing out the
text: window. Her eyes meet his for a second -- they make no
text: connection -- she goes back to Toby.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: But, that's how autism works. One
dialog: part of the brain can work fine
text: while the other is damaged.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: We had him diagnosed, Margot.
dialog: Nothing was found wrong.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Did you really, though?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I'm...I'm not going to have this
dialog: conversation. I'm sorry.
dialog: 16.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I know it must be so difficult for
dialog: you, but I think you have to --
scene_heading: 13 INT. KITCHEN - SAME 13
text: Pauline unloads the plates onto the kitchen counter. She
text: hesitates and exhales a deep, anxious breath.
scene_heading: 14 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 14
text: Margot paces while talking on a cell phone in the herb
text: garden. She drinks a white wine with ice cubes and smokes a
text: joint. The bottle lies at her feet, three-quarters empty.
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I left you a note.
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: Come back. Or meet me in Vermont
dialog: on Saturday.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
text: No...no. The wedding is on
dialog: Saturday. I'm here for that. I
dialog: can't really pull out. How would
dialog: that look?
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: You haven't spoken to her in years -
dialog: -
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Well, we're speaking now. She is
dialog: my closest friend despite it all...
dialog: You're the one who's been trying to
dialog: get me to call her.
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: Did you tell Claude what you're
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (suddenly laughing)
dialog: Jim, this guy, Malcolm. He's
dialog: exactly what you'd imagine except I
text: think he's clinically depressed.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MARGOT (CONT'D)
dialog: Not ugly, but completely
text: unattractive. And he has no job.
dialog: The best I can make out is that
dialog: he's a letter writer. I don't
dialog: know, the house looks weird to
dialog: me...she's trying too hard and it's
dialog: kind of a mess...they took down the
dialog: swing...
text: Silence on the other end.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: You said you weren't a hundred
dialog: percent on this. You said that
dialog: like a week ago. Can I come up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No. I don't want to see you -- I
dialog: feel happier already having done
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: Really? You feel happier...
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Please don't tell Claude anything
dialog: please, until we've talked more.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I need to tell him. And we need to
dialog: tell Josh. Did he do his homework?
speaker_heading: JIM'S VOICE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: This is happening and you have to
dialog: get your mind around that.
scene_heading: 15 INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT 15
text: Claude sleeps in bed. Margot gently touches his face. She
dialog: whispers:
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Are you asleep?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Will you remember this?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I just talked to your dad...
text: Claude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I'm only going to tell you if you
dialog: won't remember.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Okay.
text: Margot hesitates. She changes her mind and says
dialog: thoughtfully:
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Everyone finds you so funny and
dialog: charming. I always get compliments
dialog: about you.
text: Margot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and
text: smears some eye make-up off of her face.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Are you having fun? Is it nice to
dialog: see Pauline?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (opens his eyes)
dialog: Yeah, I really like her.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yeah. She is crazy though.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
text: She's really berserk. Maybe it's
dialog: hormones. You don't notice
dialog: anything different about Pauline?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: She's pregnant -- she told me. But
dialog: she's keeping it a secret -- I mean
dialog: from Malcolm and even Ingrid.
dialog: Which I think is unforgiveable.
dialog: Now she'll have to marry him.
dialog: What's she planning -- to get
dialog: married and not drink champagne?
dialog: Then she'll just be lying. I guess
text: she's afraid she'll miscarry. She
dialog: probably will. I think on some
dialog: level she's ambivalent about the
dialog: marriage and that's why she's not
text: telling him.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Are you stoned, Mom?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Maybe a little.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't like it.
scene_heading: 16 INT. MALCOLM AND PAULINE'S ROOM - NIGHT 16
text: Water runs from the bathroom. Malcolm cradles a glass of
text: whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: My scrotum is longer than my penis.
text: He turns around and looks at his ass. Pauline walks out of
text: the bathroom. She wears mens pajamas, the top open.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It's sweet how Claude looks up to
dialog: me.
text: He waits for a reaction and gets none.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you
dialog: made her out to be.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What she did to Toby and Alan
dialog: tonight didn't seem crazy enough
dialog: for you?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I guess that seemed pretty crazy.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (immediately defensive)
dialog: Well, she cares deeply.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Yeah, she's really worried about
dialog: Bruce.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: This has nothing to do with Bruce.
dialog: She thinks everyone is autistic.
text: Malcolm is about to speak, but instead he halts, paralyzed.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Nothing, you keep changing your
dialog: position -- I'm just trying to
dialog: figure out if I should agree with
dialog: you or not?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well, can't she be both, care
dialog: deeply and be crazy? Do people
dialog: have to be all one thing?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well, okay...
dialog: (back into it)
dialog: It is nice she came for the
dialog: wedding. She's so pretty, don't
dialog: you think?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (warily)
text: She's attractive.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: A little thin maybe... But it is
dialog: nice she came.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Let's fuck.
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: 17 INT. MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - SAME 17
text: Margot lies on her front, her hand underneath her. She tries
text: to masturbate. The bed creaks. Finally, she flips over and
text: gives up. She wears a rubber night-guard in her mouth.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. HOUSE - DAY 18
text: A croquet game in progress. Pauline and Malcolm play Margot
text: and Claude. Ingrid lies in the grass singing to herself.
text: The dog next to her. Malcolm concentrates -- he carefully
text: lines up his shot. Finally, he swings --
text: The ball misses the wicket. He shakes with frustration.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Fuck it!
text: Claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the
text: neighbor's yard: A naked man, 40's, crouches. Arms extend
text: from below and pull him downward. His ass pokes up over the
dialog: weeds.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Honey, you're up.
text: Claude shakes out of his reverie. He walks briskly up to his
text: ball and smacks it. It bullets forward and lands just short
text: of Pauline's ball.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Claude, don't just whack it. Think
dialog: about it before you hit.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Sorry.
text: Pauline knocks her ball into Claude's. She holds her ball
text: down with her foot and prepares to swing.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Paul, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm sending Claude's ball into the
dialog: bushes.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Take the extra hit.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't want to do that.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It's the smarter play.
text: She whacks -- Claude's ball travels about two feet.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Pauline! See, I knew you
dialog: couldn't... Your feet are too
dialog: small!
text: Margot steps up to take her turn. She regards the house.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You took the awnings down.
text: Claude looks back into the adjacent yard: Flashes of skin. A
text: breast. Pubic hair. Claude crouches to see more clearly --
text: the bodies disappear from sight.
text: Malcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes.
text: He swings -- his ball rockets past Margot's, rolls up over a
text: ridge and onto the cement drive. It quickly sails down into
text: the road and bounces into a ditch.
text: Malcolm shakes furiously. He lifts his mallet, turns toward
text: the house, rethinks momentarily, and hurls it up over the
text: incline and down to the water. Pauline puts her hands on her
dialog: hips.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well done.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Malcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach.
text: Claude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Honey, you're up.
text: He approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double
dialog: wickets.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're going the wrong way.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 23.
text: He blushes and laughs. Pauline laughs. Margot shakes her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: So stupid.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.
text: Margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
text: We're in the middle of it.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: This is why I hate games. I hate
dialog: what it does to me.
text: Pauline cackles loudly. Margot turns around and stares at
text: her. Malcolm calls from the stairs:
speaker_heading: MALCOLM (O.S.)
dialog: Wait, we're not finished!
scene_heading: 19 EXT. PATIO - DAY 19
text: The five eat a salad nicoise lunch.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline
dialog: sometimes can't make eye-contact.
dialog: How her gaze hovers just above your
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I always think I have something in
dialog: my hair. It's not necessarily bad,
dialog: Paul. It's just something you do.
text: Pauline looks mildly horrified. She suddenly turns to
dialog: Claude.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Claude have you ever seen your
dialog: mother climb a tree?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: We don't have much opportunity in
dialog: Manhattan.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: As kids Margot climbed everything.
dialog: She could even climb that tree.
text: She points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into
dialog: the neighbor's property.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Can you do it, mom?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Maybe later.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No, now.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Do it now, Margot!
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Show him, Margot.
speaker_heading: 20 CUT TO: 20
text: Margot strides toward the tree. The group follows behind.
text: She grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself.
text: Claude grins, impressed.
text: With brisk dexterity, Margot scales the tree.
text: Claude, Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I told you.
text: Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the
text: gang. They wave. She waves back.
text: The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep
text: breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The
text: neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance,
text: toxic white smoke comes out into the sky.
text: An earwig walks across her arm. She flicks it off, slips for
text: a moment and catches herself. Her breathing grows more
dialog: rapid.
dialog: 25.
text: A bug buzzes around her head. She swats at it.
text: Her family has stopped watching. Claude and Malcolm throw a
text: baseball. Pauline's gone back inside. Ingrid clears the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Shit.
text: She wipes her face, her shirt is almost entirely soaked. The
text: buzzing continues.
text: Close on Margot's ear. A small black gnat lands on the lip
text: of the lobe. It hesitates and darts inside the hole.
text: Margot gasps. She jams her pinky in her ear.
text: Pauline comes back out with an ice tea.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What's she doing now?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: She's stuck.
dialog: 21 CUT TO: 21
text: A young volunteer fireman climbs a long ladder up the side of
text: the tree and toward Margot. He reaches out his hand to her.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: I got it.
text: She slowly lowers herself.
scene_heading: 22 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 22
text: Pauline is laughing, recounting the story. Claude and Ingrid
text: laugh too. Margot shakes her head, embarrassed and furious.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: You were great on the way up.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Don't patronize me, Claude.
text: Margot turns her head to the side and pats on the top of it.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We're all laughing, Margot.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're laughing in a kind way.
dialog: Claude is taking too much pleasure
text: out of it.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I am not.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You are. You like to make fun of
dialog: me. To see me get embarrassed.
dialog: It's mean.
text: Silence. Margot puts her pinky back in her ear. She frowns.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I've got a fucking bug in my ear,
dialog: okay?
scene_heading: 23 EXT. FOREST - DAY 23
text: Pauline and Margot hike along a dirt trail. Claude and
text: Ingrid idle behind, carrying walking sticks.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I thought Claude could hand out
dialog: programs. Ingrid's going to sing.
dialog: Do you want to read a poem or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You know I can't speak in front of
dialog: people. I'm doing this
dialog: "conversation" at the bookstore in
dialog: town on Friday and I totally regret
dialog: having said I'd do it.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You're doing a "conversation?"
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yeah, talking about my work in
text: front of a crowd. I didn't invite
dialog: you because...I thought it'd be
dialog: boring.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: What? Say it.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It's nothing. It's just...I would
dialog: come...I want to come. I get a
dialog: kick out of it. It's just weird,
dialog: you know... So, you're not here
dialog: for...
dialog: (she stops herself)
dialog: Okay, I get it. When did they ask
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: A while ago. I'd said, No, but
dialog: then when I was coming here anyway
dialog: and...I guess it helps sales
dialog: and...so...so.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I see.
text: We catch a quick glimpse of people walking ahead in the path.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Did I tell you, Becky got her tubes
dialog: tied.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Why? Is she seeing someone? She's
dialog: still obese, I assume.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I think it's symbolic.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I bet mom paid for it. We should
dialog: audit mom.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I considered it in my twenties.
dialog: You know, when I was fucking
dialog: everyone. You remember.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I did my share.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: But not like me.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You want to count?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No, Margot, I don't want to count.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What was it about Dad that had us
dialog: fucking so many guys?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I think it was the only time we
dialog: could really feel unselfconscious
dialog: and get out of our heads.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: I don't think that's it. I just
dialog: think it was something we were good
dialog: at.
text: Behind, Ingrid smacks her walking stick into Claude's.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No, she said she had Aspergers.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I thought that's what that means.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No, it's like lesser retarded.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I have adult ADD.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: You mean child ADD.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: No, for some reason I have the
dialog: adult one. Maybe I'm retarded.
text: Up ahead -- in the path -- is a couple, 40's, with a six year
text: old girl. The back of the man's pants are smeared with dirt
text: and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans. The little
text: girl whines and lags behind.
text: Margot and Pauline slow down. Claude and Ingrid catch up.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: I don't want to!
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: I don't want --
text: The woman grabs the girl harshly by the arm and pulls her.
text: The girl screams.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Hey!
text: The man and woman turn around sharply.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Be careful!
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Be careful the way you pull on that
dialog: child's arm. You'll take it out of
text: its socket.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Don't tell us how to treat our
dialog: child.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't care how you treat your
dialog: child as long as you don't hurt
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: It's a girl.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: She threw a rock at me.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: She's a little girl!
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: She knew what she was doing.
text: She starts suddenly toward Margot.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: There is no hitting in our family.
dialog: Do you understand?
dialog: 30.
text: Margot backs up quickly. The woman stops about ten feet
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Stay out of it, bitch.
text: The woman turns back around. She lifts the girl into her
text: arms and they trudge over the incline and out of sight.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: That was the Voglers.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Jesus, Margot, what are you doing.
dialog: They already hate us.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (wiping her eyes)
dialog: Don't tell me what I can and can't
dialog: do. That's child abuse.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Mom, she was psychotic.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Stop picking on me. Everyone.
dialog: 24 CUT TO: 24
text: The four of them emerge into a clearing. Nobody speaks. A
text: child's pink sneaker lies in the path.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Oh God.
text: Pauline walks over to it. She crouches.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It could be anyone's.
text: Margot bursts into tears. Pauline hesitates then holds her.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: What are they going to do to us?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: They're not going to do anything,
dialog: honey.
scene_heading: 25 EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY 25
text: Malcolm looks at Pauline. He's in the midst of writing a
text: letter on a legal pad. Pauline is worked up.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We have to cut down that tree.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Where are we going to get married
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't...we'll do it in the
dialog: fucking drive-way if we have to.
text: Claude and Ingrid listen from just inside the house. Ingrid
text: looks at Claude nervously.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Your mom started a war. We have to
dialog: make sure we wear shoes because
text: they might start throwing glass.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Has that happened before?
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I can't remember. I think so. No,
dialog: it definitely has. Now I remember.
text: Behind them, Margot, made-up and wearing a dress, clomps down
text: the stairs, across the carpet and onto the porch.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (tersely)
dialog: To town. I'll be back for dinner.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Come on, nobody blames you, Margot.
text: An old orange BMW idles at the end of the driveway. Pauline,
text: Malcolm, Claude and Ingrid watch Margot cross the drive-way.
text: A man, 50's, opens the passenger door. He smokes a brown
text: cigarette. Margot gets in. The man waves at the group on
text: the patio. Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid and Claude wave back.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Is that Dick Koosman?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Yeah. He has a house up here.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What's he doing with mom?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Good question.
scene_heading: 26 EXT. HOUSE - DAY 26
text: Ingrid sits at the roots of the tree, squeezing honey out of
text: a honey bear onto her hand -- she watches the ants come.
text: Claude sits on a low branch and looks over the fence:
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: How much do your parents make in a
dialog: year?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I think about a hundred. They bank
dialog: at Chase.
text: The front door of the Vogler's opens and a boy, 14, pees from
text: the entrance-way into the plants in the yard.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Are they rich?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No. They're middle class.
text: The boy finishes and violently hurls a toy car at the fence.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Just let me live!
text: The toy lands a few feet short. He goes inside and closes
text: the door.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Upper or lower?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I think just middle.
text: Claude watches: Malcolm scurries around the side of the
text: Vogler house holding a dead mole by its tail. He stumbles,
text: recovers and flings the animal at the front door. He races
text: back toward his property.
scene_heading: 27 EXT. PORCH - EVENING 27
text: Margot and Malcolm have cocktails. Pauline drinks a bottled
text: water. Ingrid has cray pas, markers and paper and draws at a
text: table. She draws a mole.
dialog: 33.
text: Claude draws a boy with a big claw for a hand and CLAWED
text: under it. Wizard, the dog, lies at his feet.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Dick and his daughter asked us over
dialog: to swim tomorrow.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We didn't invite them to the
dialog: wedding.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're not really friends.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We're friends enough that's it's
text: awkward. Maisy baby-sits for us
dialog: all the time.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: He's doing the interview with me in
dialog: town on Friday. Did I tell you, he
dialog: and I are collaborating on a
text: screenplay, an adaptation of one of
dialog: Dick's novels.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No, I didn't even know you knew he
dialog: was up here.
text: Malcolm takes one of Ingrid's markers and doodles.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Is he even a good writer? Why do
dialog: people care about him?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You're competitive with everyone.
dialog: It doesn't matter if they even do
dialog: the same thing as you.
dialog: (to Claude)
text: He's competitive with Bono.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It's true. I don't subscribe to
dialog: the credo that there's enough room
dialog: for everyone to be successful. I
dialog: think there are only a few spots
dialog: available and people like Dick
text: Koosman and Bono are taking them
dialog: up.
text: Pauline looks at Malcolm's drawing. It's a graphic image of
text: a man fucking a woman in the ass.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Malcolm, what would ever make you
dialog: think that's something to draw
dialog: right now?
text: Claude and Ingrid stare at it. Malcolm balls it up.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Sorry, I wasn't thinking about it.
dialog: Sorry, Margot.
scene_heading: 28 INT. VOLVO - DAY 28
text: The car pulls into a driveway. A modern house. Dick and
text: Maisy come out to greet them.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You found it!
text: Margot, the kids and Pauline get out. We stay in the car
text: with Malcolm. Pauline comes to his window.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I don't want to do this...
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Come on, don't be that way.
text: Maisy sits on the hood of the car and Ingrid introduces her
text: to Claude. Dick approaches Margot -- she turns back to
dialog: Pauline.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I'm not being that way -- I just
dialog: don't feel like it. I'm going to
dialog: go back and... I have work to do.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Dick doesn't care that you don't
dialog: make any money.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Is that why you think... That's
dialog: not why I'm...I just hate swimming.
dialog: I really hate it. It's disgusting
dialog: to me. My mistake was saying I'd
dialog: do it to begin with. You have fun.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Fine, we'll have fun.
dialog: 35.
text: Malcolm's gaze goes to Maisy's breasts. Margot watches him
dialog: watch her.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: People always pee in the pool.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't think Dick and Maisy pee in
dialog: their pool.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I'll bet you 500 dollars there's
dialog: pee in that pool.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. DICK'S POOL - DAY 29
text: Pauline and Margot float beneath Claude who stands above
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: To the end and back. Claude, you
dialog: say Go.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Okay.
text: Margot knocks on the side of her head with her hand.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Go!
text: Pauline flings herself in and is off. Margot hesitates then
text: follows. Maisy and Dick watch from the chairs. Ingrid
text: floats on a raft and cheers. Claude runs along the pool-
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: How's your dad?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: He and I shared a thesis advisor at
dialog: Stanford. Did you know that?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No.
text: Pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around.
text: Margot stops short and follows her sister. They're neck and
text: neck. Their arms cut in and out of the water.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I was dating your mom back then,
dialog: did you know that?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No.
text: Pauline lands -- touches the wall first. Margot a close
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Pauline wins!
text: Pauline beams. Margot immediately drifts to the ladder.
text: She's panting heavily.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Mom cheated. You didn't touch the
dialog: wall!
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I did so. It doesn't matter. I
dialog: lost anyway.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It was close.
text: Pauline floats on her back, exhausted.
text: Ingrid swims beneath Claude -- long strands of hair stream up
text: from beneath the surface.
text: Margot gets out of the water and Dick wraps her in a towel.
text: For a moment it's an embrace. Margot looks quickly over at
dialog: Claude --
text: His foot slips.
text: He topples in.
text: Water roars around him.
text: He opens his mouth. Bubbles spurt out.
text: He drifts down.
text: Lying next to the drain is a field mouse. Its eyes are
dialog: white.
text: Splash. Hands wrap around him.
text: He goes up.
dialog: 37.
text: The sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer.
text: Pauline brings Claude to the surface and pushes him to the
text: ladder. She helps him climb out. Ingrid and Maisy are
text: grinning. Their expressions slowly shift as they see
text: Claude's face.
text: Claude is sobbing.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It's okay.
text: Margot immediately wrenches Claude from Pauline's grasp. She
text: looks shocked and angry.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I got him.
text: She leads her son behind the bushes out of everyone's sight.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It's okay, my baby.
text: She gently lets him down. His sneakers squeak and slosh.
text: Claude, soaking wet and ashamed, looks at his mother. She
text: breaks into laughter. Claude wipes the water and tears from
text: his eyes.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Now we're even.
scene_heading: 30 INT. PAULINE AND MALCOLM'S DEN - DAY 30
text: Margot, reclining on the couch, drinks a white wine with ice
text: cubes. Pauline passes the doorway and stops. She holds tear-
text: sheets of flowers and wedding decorations from various
dialog: magazines.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Here you are.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You've got a problem.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't like the girl and I don't
text: like the way Malcolm looks at her.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Oh, come on, it's sexy.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You didn't see it. I saw it.
dialog: You've got a problem.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm not worried.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We could teach Claude how to swim.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: He won't want to do it. It's too
dialog: late.
text: Pauline waits for more -- nothing comes. She takes a couple
text: steps into the room. She holds out her hand for the glass.
text: Margot passes it to her. Pauline sips.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Are you supposed to be doing that?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No.
text: She hands it back.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I liked your last story in, was it
dialog: Harpers? The one about mom. I was
dialog: very...I liked it very much.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It wasn't really about mom.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I thought it was. Anyway. Why
dialog: don't you want Claude to know how
dialog: to swim?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I didn't say I didn't want him to.
dialog: Why do you care? It's not in his
dialog: life -- we're New Yorkers. If he
dialog: wants to learn when he's older, he
dialog: can. I'm curious why you're so
dialog: interested in the whole thing.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm not. I'm just... As a safety
dialog: thing and...I'm... Forget it.

dialog: It's interesting -- this is the
dialog: first time Dick has invited us
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: But are you really friends?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Kind of. We're neighbors. We
dialog: employ Maisy. I mean I don't care,
dialog: I just think it's interesting.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Are you excited about the talk? I
dialog: thought I'd come if that's okay.
dialog: My friend, Agnes, asked me, "What's
dialog: it like to have a celebrity as a
dialog: sister?" I said, I've got no
dialog: problem with celebrity. Alice
dialog: Munro taught at Bennington and was
dialog: kind of a friend of mine.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I'm not a celebrity.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well, you're well known.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: To a very few people.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Just accept the compliment.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I guess I didn't realize it was a
dialog: compliment.
scene_heading: 31 EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY 31
text: Margot walks the path alone. She hugs herself as a light
text: breeze kicks up. Her footsteps echo in the trees.
text: The little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt.
text: She crouches down and takes it.
speaker_heading: 32 CUT TO: 32
text: CLOSE: A note is being written.
dialog: "...and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your
dialog: child I will call the police."
dialog: 40.
text: The word "any" is then underlined twice. The page is torn
text: from her little brown book.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. VOGLER HOUSE - EVENING 33
text: Margot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door.
text: She stops herself. She puts the note on the Welcome mat and
text: holds it in place with the child's shoe. She wanders around
text: to the back of the house. She looks into a lighted window:
text: It's a white tiled bathroom.
text: A wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced
text: on the sink. Mr. Vogler tears into the plastic. The carcass
text: is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs.
text: Mrs. Vogler runs the tub. She pours salt from a box in the
text: water. The man slides his hand in her waist-band. She rubs
dialog: against him.
text: Margot chews her cuticle.
text: The man saws the legs. His arm jerks back and forth,
text: straining to cut through the bone. Sweat pours down his
dialog: temples.
text: Margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the
text: window. She peers through her fingers. The blade pierces
text: the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the
dialog: floor.
text: Margot moves to another window. The pig's face now looks at
dialog: her.
text: Blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. The
text: woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid.
text: Suddenly a face appears in the glass. Margot leaps back.
text: It's a thin boy. He says something. The family turns to the
text: window. The father flicks off the bathroom light.
text: From inside Margot illuminates like an apparition.
text: Margot scampers into the trees. She pushes through branches,
text: her shirt tears. She runs.
scene_heading: 34 INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - EVENING 34
text: Claude sits on the bed. The record sleeve from Blondie's
text: "Parallel Lines" rests in his lap. He reads the lyrics to
text: the song, "Sunday Girl." He depresses the red record button
text: on an old portable tape recorder. He sings a cappella and
text: full voice, passionately, as sweetly as he can.
dialog: 41.
text: Maisy appears in the doorway and watches. Claude turns mid-
text: lyric. He jumps, startled.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: Singing?
text: Fumbling, Claude shuts off the tape recorder.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Hm? A bit.
text: She drifts into the room and hovers closely above Claude who
text: remains on the bed.
text: Margot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape.
text: She watches: Maisy takes the lyric sleeve from Claude's
text: hands. Her T-shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth
dialog: stomach.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: Can I make a suggestion?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: You should get underarm deodorant.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: You kind of smell.
text: Claude blushes.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: Better I tell you than someone
dialog: else.
scene_heading: 35 INT. MARGOT'S BATHROOM - EVENING 35
text: Margot puts on mascara and watches Claude, who stands behind
text: her, in the mirror.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I think you smell nice. You smell
dialog: real.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I stink.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It causes cancer.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Underarm deodorant?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yes. It's got chemicals and things
dialog: that are extremely harmful.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I'm not going to die from underarm
dialog: cancer.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, you'll get it somewhere else.
dialog: Like your stomach or your
dialog: testicles.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Testicles.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Don't laugh, that's a serious
dialog: thing.
dialog: Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I hope you're not interested in
dialog: that girl. I find her
dialog: insufferable.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It means I can't suffer her. She's
text: loud and stupid. She goes on about
dialog: things of which she knows nothing
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: She got into Harvard early.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Stupid people get into Harvard
dialog: early all the time.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Where did you go again?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Barnard.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I just don't think you should do
dialog: anything with her.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: We're just friends.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: If you do, use a condom.
text: Claude looks into the toilet. A square of toilet paper with
text: a red lip outline floats on top of the water.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
text: Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Are kids coming?
scene_heading: 36 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 36
text: Claude's POV through the window: Dick and Margot in the back
text: seat of the Volvo. Malcolm and Pauline the front. The
text: ignition turns.
text: Claude leaves the window. We hear the car rumble away.
text: Claude and Ingrid sit on the couch, hamburgers in front of
text: them. Maisy is cross-legged on Wizard's dog bed and chews a
text: stalk of celery.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Who do we know who's gay?
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: How do I know what gay people you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Alan and Toby.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: And Bruce. He's gay and Aspergers.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't know if Bruce is gay.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: He might be, it's very common.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Your mom is pregnant.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: No she isn't.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: She is.
text: Ingrid looks stricken.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: How do you know that, Claude?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: She told my mom. But you can tell -
dialog: - she's hormonally weird.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: Holy shit, Ingrid you're going to
dialog: have a baby sister or brother.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: My mom thinks your mom is
dialog: unreliable.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Who cares.
text: But he does. Claude bites into his burger. His eyes fix on
text: the crease between Maisy's breasts. Maisy says to Claude:
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: Do you think your mom is fuckable?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: I think she's hot, your mother.
dialog: I'd do her if I was gay. I might
dialog: anyway. I mean if she came on to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: She won't.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I'm not going to do anyone.
text: There's a scraping sound on the window. The kids turn
dialog: quickly:
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Is it scary?
scene_heading: 37 EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 37
text: The three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats
text: in the fence: The Vogler family eats at an outdoor table. A
text: pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue. Mrs. Vogler says
text: something and the kids and Mr. Vogler laugh.
text: Maisy climbs over Claude to see better. He feels her breasts
text: press against his back. Suddenly he swats crazily at his
text: ear. Ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass.
scene_heading: 38 INT. VOLVO - NIGHT 38
text: Malcolm drives quickly with Pauline next to him. He's
text: smoking with the window open, Dick and Margot in the
dialog: backseat.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Margot used to never speak. I
dialog: remember when we went on a double
dialog: date in high school, that kid Ron
dialog: asked you if English was your first
dialog: language.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It's true. I used to think I might
dialog: have some kind of brain defect.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You thought you were aphasic.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I'm still not sure.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Oh, Jesus, Margot.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It's very possible, Paul.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I just...your diagnoses sometimes
dialog: irk the hell out of me.
text: Malcolm lights another cigarette -- the car jerks sideways.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Malcolm, can you slow down.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I can drive if you like.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: No, you got dinner, the driving's
dialog: on me.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Well, I'll let you pay your half if
dialog: you'll slow down.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Well, neither Pauline or I ordered
dialog: dessert.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Malcolm, let it go.
dialog: (taunting)
dialog: Margot would insist on driving if
dialog: she knew how.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (to Dick)
dialog: My license elapsed. But I know
dialog: how.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It's probably for the best. I have
dialog: this theory, I think, historically,
dialog: women have been held back in so
dialog: many ways that when they get power,
dialog: like they do behind the wheel, they
dialog: can't help but abuse it. It's akin
dialog: to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory
dialog: about prison guards and prisoners
text: switching rolls.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: That's a charming philosophy.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yeah. Tell that one a lot.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: This isn't a blanket thing. I
dialog: mean, women can be great drivers
dialog: too...
text: He takes a long satisfied drag on his cigarette.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Said the man with the moustache
text: that he thinks he's wearing in
dialog: quotes.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It's meant to be funny.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (to Pauline, re: Margot)
dialog: Are you doing this for her benefit
dialog: or mine?
text: Malcolm pumps the brake.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (momentarily sober)
dialog: No, there they go. Okay. It's
dialog: fine. I thought I had no brakes
dialog: for a minute...
text: Malcolm pitches his cigarette out the window -- it flies
text: through Margot's window and lands on her lap.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Malcolm!
text: Dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (turning around)
dialog: What?!
text: The car swerves again -- everyone jumps.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Watch it!
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It's fine, Margot!
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (to Malcolm)
dialog: You're just so incompetent.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Why don't you fucking drive
dialog: yourselves home!
text: Malcolm screeches the vehicle over to the shoulder. They
text: jolt to a stop.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (quietly furious)
dialog: Oh, God.
text: Pauline opens the door and staggers toward the brush. She
text: leans against a tree and looks like she might vomit. Malcolm
text: watches in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You should go after her.
text: Malcolm sighs heavily and gets out of the car. Margot and
text: Dick watch out the back window. Pauline sees Malcolm coming
text: and bolts into the woods. Malcolm charges after her.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Come back with me tonight.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I've got Claude.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Come on, I've been trying to get
dialog: you up here all year.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (vaguely)
text: She's pregnant.
text: Dick leans over to Margot's neck. He licks her.
scene_heading: 39 INT. INGRID'S ROOM - NIGHT 39
text: Claude lies in bed with Ingrid. He chews off a piece of his
text: pinky fingernail. He hesitates and places it on an end-
dialog: table.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Why are you putting that there?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I just want to keep it.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I left a piece of skin in a movie
dialog: theater once so it could watch
dialog: movies all its life.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't know if it's the same
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Are you obsessed with Maisy?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: You're always staring at her tits.
text: Ingrid traces Claude's upper lip with her finger.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: You have a moustache.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
text: My mom bleaches it.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I'm going to kiss your cheek and
dialog: then you kiss mine.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't want to do that.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Because it's pointless...
text: Claude hears footsteps creak downstairs. He goes to the door
text: and peers out: Pauline and Malcolm, a little disheveled and
text: dirty, climb the stairs. Neither speaks. Malcolm goes into
text: the hall bathroom. Pauline into their room. Running water
text: groans through the old pipes.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Where are you going? I thought we
text: were having a conversation.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: You're starting to annoy me.
scene_heading: 40 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 40
text: Claude walks -- he passes an open door: Malcolm is shaving
text: his moustache -- the electric razor whirring.
scene_heading: 41 INT. MARGOT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41
text: Claude enters. It's empty. Her brown notebook rests on the
text: bedside table. He hesitates then opens it:
text: It's packed with writing -- a nearly indecipherable cursive
text: in black ink. The name Claude can be made out on the page.
text: Claude takes the book and climbs up into bed. He nestles
text: against the pillow and squints to read the writing.
speaker_heading: MARGOT (O.S.)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Claude startles. Margot stands in the doorway with a glass
dialog: of water.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I didn't think you came home.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Where would I be?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Can't Josh and Dad come to the
dialog: wedding?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: We've been through this. Go to
dialog: bed.
text: Claude slides down to the floor. He hesitates.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Can I sleep in here?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, honey.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: We can put a pillow between us.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Okay. Just for tonight.
text: Claude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in
text: the bed. We stay on him as he waits. Finally Margot climbs
text: into the covers in a nightgown.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: When you were a baby I wouldn't let
dialog: anyone else hold you. I think that
dialog: may have been a mistake.
scene_heading: 42 EXT. HOUSE - MORNING 42
text: Malcolm, his moustache gone, a cigarette dangling from his
text: mouth, hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed, white
text: tent. A workman holds a pole steadily.
text: Pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables. Ingrid
text: idles a few feet away. They're in the midst of talking:
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Why was it a secret?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Because I didn't want to get you
dialog: excited before it was real. It's
text: not really a baby yet. In two more
dialog: weeks we can celebrate together,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Why did you tell Margot?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Because she's my sister and I trust
dialog: her. How do you feel about it?
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I don't want a sister.
text: Pauline touches Ingrid's hair gently.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: I'm going to go get Wizard.
text: She runs toward the house. Pauline marches toward Malcolm.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Margot told Claude something I
text: expressly told her in confidence.
dialog: And he told Ingrid.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: PAULINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm stunned that she put me in this
dialog: position. It's so fucking
dialog: infuriating.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Well it's that thing where--
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Don't say anything. You know
dialog: what...just be there for me.
text: Silently.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Why do I have to be so careful
dialog: around her, but everyone is allowed
dialog: to make fun of me?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I don't know if --
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Malcolm, what did I just say?
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: You know, I just want you to take
dialog: my side, I don't need you to make
dialog: it better.
text: Malcolm puts his hand awkwardly on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
text: Ingrid's really upset about it.
dialog: Fuck. I can't believe she did this
dialog: to me!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I didn't tell you because... I
dialog: didn't want you to feel like you
dialog: had to marry me. I found out right
dialog: before our seminar... I'm
dialog: pregnant.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well...does that sound good to you?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I'm still digesting Margot telling
dialog: Claude. What a fucking nut job.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Sorry. I think I'm really happy.
dialog: 53.
text: Ingrid is watching from across the field.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Come here, honey!
text: Ingrid hurries through the sparkly, dewy grass. Pauline hugs
text: her and they spin.
dialog: 43 CUT TO: 43
text: Margot watches from the upstairs window. The mother and
text: daughter walk arm in arm down what will be the aisle.
text: Finally, Margot turns away -- she's in Pauline and Malcolm's
dialog: room.
text: She opens drawers: Underwear, socks, bras. Topless photos
text: of Pauline posing in the bedroom. A photograph of Margot and
text: Pauline in their teens on Halloween dressed as Pat Benatar
text: and Patty Smyth respectively.
text: Margot grins.
text: Another photo of Margot, Pauline and an obese woman -- Becky -
dialog: - in their 20's.
text: Margot's expression saddens. She opens another drawer.
text: Polaroids of Pauline and Malcolm in different sexual poses.
text: She flips through these and drops them on the bureau.
text: Amidst the underwear and socks she finds pill containers.
text: She squints to read the labels. She opens one and shakes out
text: a few blue pills into her palm. She swallows one and puts
text: the rest in her pocket.
text: More drawers open: Self-help books, incense, pamphlets on
text: Buddhism. A stack of pornographic DVD's.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey.
text: Margot starts and shoves the drawer shut.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Hey. I'm just looking at Pauline's
dialog: incense and self-help books. I
dialog: don't understand it. This junk
text: makes her look stupid and she's
dialog: not. I don't like to think of her
dialog: this way.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: She's such a hypocrite. Somehow
dialog: I'm a kook for going to therapy,
dialog: but she's got enough drugs here to
dialog: medicate a...
dialog: (settles on a word)
dialog: ...an elephant. And she's always
dialog: with these losers.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Malcolm's not a loser.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Claude...think about it.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: He's cool.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: What makes you think he's cool?
dialog: (softens)
dialog: I'm more talking about her
dialog: investment in things like the Forum
dialog: and ashrams.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What's the Forum?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Like a cult.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: She was in a cult?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Years ago. She and Lenny also
dialog: followed some guru who was a
dialog: follower of the Mukdananda who made
dialog: her drink his bath water. Who
dialog: knows what she's doing now.
speaker_heading: INGRID (O.S.)
dialog: Margot! Claude!
scene_heading: 44 EXT. FIELD - DAY 44
text: Claude hacks his way through the tall weeds.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Wizard!
text: We move past him, obscured by grass, Pauline and Ingrid yell:
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: PAULINE/INGRID
dialog: Wizard! Wiz!
text: Margot enters the frame. The kids walk ahead.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Wizard! Here, boy!
text: She stands a few feet away from Pauline. The kids can be
text: heard shouting in the distance.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: How long has he been gone?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't know. Ingrid brought him
dialog: in last night, but we couldn't find
dialog: him this morning.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Oh boy.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I guess I said something.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You did. You don't have to tell
dialog: him everything.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: He wants to know. If I don't tell
text: him, he figures it out.
speaker_heading: INGRID (O.S.)
dialog: Where is Wizard?
text: Ingrid approaches with Claude.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't know, honey.
text: Ingrid sinks into her mother's body. Claude and Margot walk
dialog: ahead.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: You didn't let him go out into the
dialog: road or something where something
dialog: could've happened to him?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Why would you think I'd do
dialog: something like that? That's awful.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I just... I'm just making sure.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: That's a terrible thing to say to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I didn't mean on purpose, I just
dialog: meant maybe in case...you knew
dialog: something. I'm sorry.
scene_heading: 45 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 45
text: Margot enters and opens the refrigerator. She gets out a
text: white wine bottle. She turns around and jumps, startled.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Woa!
text: Malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a
text: pad and paper in front of him.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Hey, sorry. I'm here.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, I... I should've looked.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I'm just writing my vows. Trying
dialog: to do something appropriate but
dialog: also funny -- not jokey, more
dialog: character based humor.
text: Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm
text: to see if he wants some. He shakes his head. She takes a
text: long drink. Silence.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: You having an okay time?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Oh, yeah. Besides Wizard getting --
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or
dialog: else, I don't know...
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: We won't.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Right, or else he's dead or
dialog: something.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It means a lot to Paul that you
dialog: came.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yeah.
text: Silence. Malcolm mumbles a tune.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Oh God, this is the same toaster we
dialog: had here as kids. Paul is so
dialog: weird.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I hear you've heard the news.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yeah. Congratulations.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Pretty cool. Hard to fully take
text: in. It's a little abstract still.
dialog: I haven't had that thing yet where
dialog: you realize that you're not the
dialog: most important person in the world.
dialog: I'm anxious for that to happen. I
dialog: guess I have to thank you -- I
dialog: wouldn't know yet if you hadn't
dialog: arrived.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Of course I can't help but worry
dialog: I'll pass some not so great genes
dialog: onto the kid. I mean, in my family
dialog: there's a lot of hand washing, you
dialog: know. I don't have it, but my
dialog: brother does.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You working on anything now?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Besides the thing with Dick?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Oh, right.
text: He nods. She nods. Silence.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: How about you?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Oh, I'm working on some acrylic
dialog: paint --
speaker_heading: MARGOT
text: Nobody fills the ice cube trays.
text: Malcolm stops, immediately embarrassed. Margot is looking in
text: the freezer. She takes out the trays and brings them to the
text: sink. She runs the water.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Sorry, what were you --
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Nothing. It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, what were you saying?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It really... Nothing.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Okay.
text: She treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full
text: trays.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I was saying I'm doing these
text: abstractions in acrylic paint. But
dialog: it's not... I'm not getting paid
dialog: or anything. I don't know, I hate
dialog: that question, "What do you do?"
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You asked me.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I know, but...
dialog: 59.
text: Malcolm exhales in frustration.
scene_heading: 46 EXT. FIELD - DAY 46
text: Pauline and Malcolm open the gate to the Vogler's property.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I think we shouldn't mention the
dialog: tree, we should let them know that
dialog: there will be people and music on
dialog: Saturday and it will be louder than
dialog: usual.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: And that they can come for a glass
dialog: of champagne. But you tell them.
dialog: I think they respond to you better.
text: They approach the Vogler's sun-worn and paint chipped house.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Well, I am ultimately one of them.
dialog: You shouldn't've made me shave the
dialog: stache.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I
dialog: was ever gay. Do you know what
dialog: that's about?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No.
text: Mr. Vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over
text: his shoulders, tramples out of the brush.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Hi.
text: Vogler stops. His face is jagged and worn.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Hi, I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm.
dialog: We've met before. We're your
dialog: neighbors.
text: The man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: You gonna cut that tree down?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Well, we grew up with that tree and
dialog: we're getting married under it
dialog: Saturday and --
text: She waits for Malcolm to jump in. He doesn't. Vogler says
text: softly, but sternly:
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: The roots are growing into our
dialog: property. It's rotting, it's
dialog: killing our plants.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We had a tree doctor out and he
dialog: said it was healthy.
text: Pauline smacks Malcolm's arm.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Would it hurt you to say anything?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What? What do you want from me?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You're making me do the whole
dialog: fucking thing.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: You brought up the tree.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: He brought up --
text: She stops herself. She says to Vogler:
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm sorry... This was better
text: thought-through back at the house.
text: Pauline's gaze goes above Vogler's head -- like Margot
text: described earlier. He runs his hand through his hair as if
dialog: something might be caught in there.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We were wondering if you and your
dialog: wife -- I'm sorry I forgot her name
dialog: -- would like to come over for...
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: VOGLER
dialog: You should ask her. She makes the
dialog: plans. I'm going to go in now.
text: He tramps inside. The screen door bangs.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I felt like you didn't give me a
dialog: chance to say what I wanted to say.
text: Pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away.
text: Malcolm comes after her, his rage growing.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I want to punch that guy in the
dialog: nose!
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You've never hit anyone.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I have too!
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Lots of -- You don't know them.
dialog: They're not around because I've
dialog: punched them.
text: A smile breaks across Pauline's face. Malcolm seethes.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not
dialog: funny. I'll fucking punch your
dialog: sister.
text: Malcolm clenches his fists. He points at Vogler's place.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: The threat is not out there. It's
dialog: in our house. It's sleeping in my
dialog: studio. I mean, I wouldn't
dialog: actually hit her, but I feel...I
dialog: feel like doing it. She's such a
dialog: fucking idiot.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: She's not an idiot. You might not
dialog: like her --
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: She is. She is an idiot! You're
dialog: an idiot.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: You're both fucking morons. I'm so
dialog: fucking... I'm trying so hard.
dialog: You don't give me any credit.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What is wrong?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I don't know, I have the emotional
dialog: version of whatever bad feng shui
dialog: would be. I don't know. You tell
dialog: me, you understand this shit.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Did you drink your teas?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Yeah, I drank my fucking teas!
dialog: Don't judge me now. Really, I
dialog: think when you look back at this
dialog: you're going to see I'm not acting
dialog: like a crazy person. That this is
dialog: the right reaction. In proportion
dialog: with what is going on. This is
dialog: right!
text: Malcolm looks around furiously. The only thing available to
text: him is a leafy stalk. He pulls on it, but it won't uproot.
text: He tears the leaves off in a rage.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You have the most oddly self-
dialog: conscious form of rage I've ever --
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I hate you.
text: Exhausted he approaches her. He says, still with anger:
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Let's make love.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: 47 CUT TO: 47
text: Pauline walks back to the house, buttoning her dress. She
text: looks up suddenly and stops: A man watches her from the lawn.
text: He holds a bouquet of flowers. Pauline runs to him.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Jim...
text: They embrace. Her hand cups the back of his neck.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE (O.S.)
dialog: Dad!
text: Claude runs from the house.
scene_heading: 48 EXT. PATIO - LATE DAY 48
text: Pauline, Malcolm, Margot, Jim, Claude and Ingrid eat fish
text: stew and peasant bread. Jim's flowers sit in a vase. He
text: wears a tan knit bracelet that Ingrid made.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It was a difficult decision because
dialog: Claude has so many friends at
dialog: school now, but it is expensive and
dialog: Bronx Science is a great public
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I didn't get into Stuyvesant.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: He's not a good test taker.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I went to Stuy.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (caught off-guard)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's
dialog: so expensive.
text: Malcolm lifts up a bottle of Jameson from the floor near his
text: chair and pours himself another stiff drink.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Josh is a great test taker, but
text: Claude thinks more abstractly.
dialog: He's more creative. Right?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I guess so.
text: Jim smiles warmly at his son.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I saw the one armed man who really
text: has two arms at the bodega.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Did you give him confusing change?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I did. I tripped him up with some
dialog: nickels. And a Canadian quarter.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: You know what I tried the other
dialog: day? Sitting down to pee. Have
dialog: you done this, Jim?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: No...no.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I did it as a lark. As a joke
dialog: really. I was going to call
dialog: Pauline in and say, guess what I'm
dialog: doing here...
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't get to have that
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I was thinking, you know, my dad
dialog: used to say, "Why stand when you
dialog: can sit." And this is a really
dialog: good example of that. I mean, it
dialog: took me so long to try because I
dialog: was embarrassed.
dialog: (to the sisters)
dialog: You guys do it all the time.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I never sit down in a public place.
text: I squat and hover.
dialog: 65.
text: Ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Anyway, I recommend it. At least
dialog: to try it.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Jim, I'm sorry about the room.
dialog: It's usually Malcolm's storage room
dialog: so it's kind of make-shift right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's fine.
text: Margot stares at Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Margot, open your gift.
text: An unopened present in blue tissue paper sits beside Margot's
dialog: plate.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I get self-conscious opening
text: presents in front of people. This
dialog: weekend is about Pauline.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Oh...poo. Open it Margot.
text: Margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the
text: tape. Pauline groans:
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Come on, get to it.
text: Margot takes out a pair of furry slippers.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Those look warm.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I remember last year in Vermont you
dialog: said your feet were freezing.
text: Her eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully. She
text: leans across the table to Jim and they kiss chastely and
text: briskly on the lips.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: 49 INT. JIM'S CAR - NIGHT 49
text: Jim drives with Margot in the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I already have slippers.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Well, that's okay. Two sets are
dialog: fine, right?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It makes me sad to get a present
dialog: that I already have.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It makes me feel like you don't
dialog: know me.
text: She jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What's wrong with your ear?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I asked you not to come. I was so
dialog: clear and you did it anyway so
text: blithely.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: We need time alone to sort this
dialog: out. You can't just run away --
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Okay, so we're here. I'm giving
dialog: you this time.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (trying a joke)
dialog: Well, now you're putting too much
dialog: pressure on me.
text: Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back. He takes
text: a moment, preparing to speak. Then:
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What is that?
text: His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. They
dialog: pass.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Keep driving.
text: Jim slowly pulls over to the shoulder.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No...no...no. Jim, no.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Let me just...
text: Jim gets out of the car. A sobbing woman crouches, cradling
text: a bloody dog.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Please help me.
text: Jim comes toward her.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Please help me. He got hit by a
dialog: car. Please help me.
text: Margot opens her door and steps out.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (warily)
dialog: Jim...
text: Jim kneels down by the whining pit bull. The woman screams:
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Help me!
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Careful, he might bite you!
text: Jim suddenly lifts up the twitching animal.
scene_heading: 50 INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT 50
text: Jim drives, his front covered in blood. Margot is shot-gun.
text: The lady rides in back with the panting pit in her lap.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Hurry...he's dying. He's dying.
text: Margot puts her hands over her ears. Jim speeds up.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: He didn't do anything. Roger is an
dialog: innocent. He's an innocent
dialog: creature.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Oh, God.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Margot.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I can't stand her.
scene_heading: 51 EXT. VETERINARY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 51
text: Jim comes outside tucking his wallet in his back pocket.
text: Margot sits on the car hood smoking a joint.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You paid, didn't you?
speaker_heading: JIM
text: She didn't have her purse with her.
dialog: It wasn't so expensive. Roger's
dialog: going to live.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't give a fuck about Roger.
dialog: And...that makes me feel like shit.
dialog: You make me feel like shit. I
dialog: wouldn't have stopped.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Of course you would've.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, I wouldn't've. I would have
dialog: kept driving. I hate myself when
dialog: I'm with you.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Margot, I'm not... I can't talk to
dialog: you when you're this fucked up.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're just like Claude in that
dialog: way...you make me feel guilty.
dialog: Sometimes I find you so despicable.
text: Margot stubs out the joint on the car roof. Jim suddenly
text: removes his sweater and puts it around her shoulders. He
text: fishes into his pants pocket for his keys. Tears start down
text: Margot's cheeks.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Before you gave me your sweater I
dialog: think I didn't realize I was cold.
text: Margot leans in to him, her forehead presses against his
text: cheek. After a moment, he puts his arms around her.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Take me home and go away.
scene_heading: 52 INT./EXT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 52
text: Margot smokes by the open door. She drinks a glass of white
text: wine. Pauline eats from a left-over Chinese container.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: If it were someone else I'd
dialog: understand it, I'd feel sympathy
dialog: even. But since it's me, I just
text: feel bad. And horribly critical.
dialog: I haven't been able to tell Claude
dialog: what's happening. And I have to.
dialog: I'm going to.
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: How can I be all these people? How
dialog: can I be married to Jim. And fuck
dialog: Dick. And want them both and then
dialog: neither of them...
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I know. We're at the age where
dialog: we're becoming invisible to men and
dialog: if a guy wants to fuck us, it's
dialog: very tempting.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm saying, if you get your sense
dialog: of self from being fuckable and
dialog: that starts to wane -- it's very
dialog: hard. I almost had an affair too.
dialog: But you know, you don't have to do
dialog: it. You can, I don't know, get a
dialog: manicure or something.
dialog: 70.
text: Margot grows furious. She turns to hide her face.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You know I tell people you're my
dialog: closest friend. I really miss you.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (barely)
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: But I can't help feeling that you
dialog: really came to my wedding because I
dialog: live a mile away from the guy
dialog: you're fucking.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Come on, Pauline. You make it
dialog: sound like I'm using you.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Yeah.
text: There is a long silence between them. Finally, Pauline
text: indicates to Margot that she has something in her nostril.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You have a...
text: Margot clears her nose quickly with her finger.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Did I get it?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Yeah, I think so.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Paul, what are you doing getting
dialog: married to this guy? He's not good
dialog: enough for you. He's so coarse,
dialog: he's like guys we rejected when we
dialog: were sixteen. You know...don't
dialog: make a mistake like this.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to
dialog: say that, but you know I'm truthful
dialog: so... Would you rather I lie?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Who should I be with then?
dialog: 71.
text: A smashing sound. Margot steps outside: Two hooded figures
text: turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground.
text: Garbage is strewn across the driveway.
speaker_heading: MARGOT (O.S.)
dialog: Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up.
dialog: I will call the police. This is
dialog: our property. Pick that up.
text: Pauline remains seated at the table, stunned. Margot comes
text: back inside.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Creeps.
scene_heading: 53 EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING 53
text: Malcolm crams the trash back in the cans. He sees something
text: amidst the milk cartons and corn husks. He reaches down and
text: lifts up a severed pig's hoof.
scene_heading: 54 EXT. FIELD - MORNING 54
text: Claude and Ingrid idle in the tall grass calling to Wizard.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Dogs usually come back, I think.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: What happened to your dad?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: He went to Vermont.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: He didn't want to come to the
dialog: wedding?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't think he could... I think
dialog: he couldn't.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You want to see me dance?
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Okay.
text: Claude dances. The gangly weeds blow around him. There's a
text: rustling in the brush. A patch of fur catches Ingrid's eye.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Wizard...
dialog: 72.
text: The animal is gone.
text: A figure appears in the distance behind Claude. The boy, the
text: Vogler's son, approaches shirtless in swimming trunks.
text: Ingrid's attention goes to him.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: You're not watching.
text: The boy comes into focus. He holds a dead squirrel by its
text: tail. Ingrid backs up next to Claude. The boy stops a few
text: feet away and hurls the squirrel at them. The kids jump back
text: as it lands at their feet.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: We have to get home.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Is that your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No, she's my cousin.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: You a fruity?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Um...no.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (to Ingrid)
dialog: You a fruity?
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: (with certainty)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: We will hurt you.
text: Claude takes Ingrid's arm and they start to walk away.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: He's a Vogler.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: He's just a stupid boy.
dialog: 73.
text: Claude sneaks a look over his shoulder -- the boy follows.
text: Claude's gait quickens.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Hold it, I have a rock in my
dialog: sandal.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Come on, Ingrid.
text: Ingrid slows, lifts her leg and removes a sandal. The boy is
text: behind them. Claude yanks Ingrid's arm and she topples over.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Oww!
text: Claude leans down to help her. The boy leaps on Claude.
text: They both crash to the ground and roll through the grass.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Get him off me. Ingrid!
text: Ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house.
text: Claude wrestles with the boy. The boy growls. He grabs hold
text: of Claude's arms and sinks his teeth into Claude's shoulder.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Ayy! Help me!
text: Claude kicks and yanks himself free. He runs wildly.
text: Close on Claude. Tears stream down. He coughs and spits.
scene_heading: 55 INT. HOUSE - SAME 55
text: Claude bursts through the front door. Ingrid sees Claude and
text: runs to the kitchen. Margot, in a suit, goes over notes.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Woa, don't run so fast.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: There's a boy! He bit me!
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Who bit you?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
text: A boy. A Vogler! Where's Ingrid?
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Let me see.
text: He tilts his head, she leans down and looks at his neck.
text: There are red and purple bite marks.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (rising)
dialog: I'm calling the police.
text: Claude grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No, don't! It'll get worse. Why
dialog: did you say anything to them?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Claude, this isn't my fault.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: That boy bit me because you
dialog: couldn't keep your fat mouth shut.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Claude, you're being a jerk.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: You shit in your shoes and then you
dialog: fuck them!
text: Margot smacks Claude in the face. Ingrid stares wide eyed.
scene_heading: 56 INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY 56
text: A placard reads: A Conversation with Margot Zeller and Dick
text: Koosman. People mull about with drinks. Pauline and Claude
text: admire the display of Margot's books.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You really want to know? I'll tell
dialog: you. She wrote a story about Lenny
dialog: and me.
dialog: (flips through pages)
dialog: Yeah, it's in here. I mean we were
dialog: talking almost every day at this
dialog: point and there was no warning.
dialog: Maybe a couple of remarks that
dialog: she'd used some things of ours...
dialog: Then The New Yorker comes -- we
dialog: have a subscription -- and there's
dialog: the story and... It's things we
dialog: said and did -- stuff I told her in
dialog: confidence.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: PAULINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it helped end our marriage.
dialog: I read it and thought, "She hates
dialog: me."
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: She doesn't hate you.
text: Pauline stares at a blown up author photo of her sister.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You think? Margot tried to murder
dialog: me when we were girls. She put me
text: on a baking sheet, sprinkled me
dialog: with paprika and put me in the
dialog: oven.
speaker_heading: 57 CUT TO: 57
text: The crowd files in. Margot and Dick stand in a corner.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Jim was here.
text: Dick flips through some notes.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Is Jim still writing?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I told him to go to Vermont without
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I'd love to see him tell a linear
dialog: story for a change. Jim never
dialog: wanted to make it easy for the
dialog: reader, did he. The nicest man
dialog: I've ever met, but he can't play
dialog: the game.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I'm not joining him. I'm going to
dialog: stay here and then...we'll see.
dialog: Right. Okay?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I didn't ask you to do that.
dialog: (pause)
text: The guy's pointing at us...
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: 58 CUT TO: 58
text: Margot and Dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of
text: rows of fold-out chairs. Only a few empty seats remain.
text: Pauline and Claude sit in the back.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I'm very interested in your story
dialog: "Middle Children."
text: Some people applaud, but it trickles off before it gets
dialog: started.
speaker_heading: DICK
text: The father is a loathsome character
dialog: yet we also feel a strange sympathy
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yeah, well I was very interested in
dialog: exploring a father-daughter
text: relationship. While he clings
text: desperately to her, suffocates her
text: really, he also silently resents
dialog: the responsibility of parenthood.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: There's this sexualized push-pull
dialog: with Daphne which I find --
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: He craves isolation really. I
dialog: always thought of him as someone
dialog: who so over identifies with
text: everyone around him that he begins
dialog: to lose all sense of himself.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You make his only recourse to
dialog: abandon his family, including his
dialog: beloved daughter.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Right, that's true. That's true.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I write historical fiction so I
dialog: don't have to answer to this, but I
dialog: wonder for someone who writes so
dialog: nakedly about family, how
dialog: autobiographical is this portrait?
text: Margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: My father was a loving person. He
dialog: had his days, of course, but...he
dialog: was devoted to us as children. I
dialog: wouldn't have written this portrait
dialog: were it true.
text: Pauline nods slightly.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: But I'm interested in how the
dialog: father could be in fact a portrait
dialog: of you.
text: Margot stares, dumbstruck.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Umm...I don't... Why do you assume
dialog: it's based on... We all take from
dialog: life. I had to have our
dialog: refrigerator repaired the other day
dialog: at our apartment in Manhattan. I
dialog: was alone with a guy, I think he
dialog: was Puerto Rican, sent over
dialog: by...Whirlpool, I think it is who
dialog: made our fridge. Although he said
dialog: he worked for an independent
dialog: organization who Whirlpool
dialog: subcontracts. I think he was
text: retarded. There was an anger in
dialog: him and suddenly I became afraid
dialog: for my life. I called Jim at NYU.
dialog: I asked him to come home.
text: Margot stops. Her face is awash in sweat.
text: Pauline takes Claude's hand and presses it to her chest. His
text: eyes widen, fixed on his mother.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It might be Frigidaire... I'm
dialog: sorry... I don't... I'm not sure
dialog: what I'm... I think I need to take
dialog: a moment...
text: She stands and walks off the stage. She realizes she still
text: has the mike. She goes back and places it on her seat.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (almost incoherently)
dialog: You're an asshole...
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: 59 INT. BOOKSTORE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 59
text: Margot grabs a pill from her pocket, puts it on her tongue
text: and drinks from the faucet. There is a knocking. Margot
text: opens the door. Claude looks up at her. Pauline and Dick
text: wait in the background.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I need to be alone right now, okay?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't know. I'll tell you
dialog: sometime. Go on.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yes. Go with mom. I'll see you
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: You said, mom.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: But you know what I mean. Go with
dialog: Pauline. Jesus, do I...do I need
dialog: to spell it out for you?
dialog: (she points)
dialog: Go. With. Her.
scene_heading: 60 INT. CHURCH - DAY 60
text: A simple, spare space, empty except for Pauline and Claude.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You're your mom's favorite. Do you
dialog: know that?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't think she has a favorite.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: She's always liked you best. More
dialog: than Jim even.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: But they're married. It's
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: But she still loves you best. It's
dialog: hard, I think, to find people in
dialog: the world you love more than your
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I like Malcolm.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Yeah? Good. I don't know. I do
dialog: too.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I can teach you to swim if you
dialog: like.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No, thanks.
text: Claude looks at the floor. His sneaker rests next to her
text: open toed sandals. She taps his foot with hers.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Has your mother talked to you yet?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't think so. About what?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Are you okay? It's hard to see
dialog: your mom like that -- get attacked
dialog: like that. Right? It was mean
dialog: what he did. I think it was really
dialog: shitty.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
speaker_heading: Mm hm.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You know, I think your mom's going
dialog: through a rough time right now
dialog: and...whatever she tells you...like
dialog: if she says she's leaving your
dialog: father...remember that she often
dialog: changes her mind and...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: PAULINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want you to worry about
dialog: anything right now.
text: Claude says nothing.
scene_heading: 61 EXT. HOUSE - LATE DAY 61
text: Pauline's Volvo rolls into the drive. She and Claude get out
text: of the front seats. Margot climbs out of the back holding a
text: big cake box. No one speaks.
text: Malcolm, in a fleece vest and safety goggles, drags a
text: chainsaw toward the oak tree. Ingrid runs to her mom.
speaker_heading: INGRID
text: He's cutting it down.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Good.
text: Pauline passes Maisy reading on the patio.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: My dad's late to pick me up. I
dialog: hope I'm not a pain.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You're not a pain.
text: Margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with
text: ice. The tent is up. The tables and chairs are placed
text: around the lawn. She watches Malcolm prepare to take the
text: tree down. She puts her pinky in her ear and twists. Claude
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I told Paul I didn't want you guys
dialog: to come.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I thought it was interesting.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: What did Paul say?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I think she liked it.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Yeah, right. Did you talk about me
dialog: afterwards?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: No.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I can tell you're lying.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: We didn't, mom.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't trust her.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: She really loves you. She does.
text: Margot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Pauline told me she's very
dialog: disappointed in you.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: She thinks you laze about the
dialog: house. Ingrid is always offering
dialog: to help clean or cook. She made
text: bracelets for all the guests. Even
dialog: Malcolm puts up the tent. You just
dialog: wait until everyone else does it
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It is true. You're never helpful.
dialog: I wish I had taught you better
dialog: manners.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I can try to make popovers. If I
dialog: can remember how.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Don't bother.
text: She looks at him with grave disappointment.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Why are you looking at me like
dialog: that?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I just see how much you've changed.
dialog: Your body language. You used to be
dialog: rounder and more graceful. You're
text: so stiff now. So blase.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (retreating)
dialog: I can't explain it.
text: Margot shakes her head. She's suddenly distraught.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It's okay though.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Claude looks devastated. He starts toward the beach.
text: Margot's eyes well up -- she says, trying to make things
dialog: better:
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're still handsome.
scene_heading: 62 EXT. HOUSE - SAME 62
text: Pauline marches toward Malcolm. Malcolm wears the safety
text: goggles and revs the chainsaw.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Are you able to do this yourself?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Pauline, do you want me to cut it
dialog: down or not?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Watch the tent.
text: The jagged blades pierce the trunk. Pauline crunches her
text: face. Malcolm stops suddenly.
text: He walks around the tree and inspects the bark.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (indicating his fleece)
dialog: I liked how it looked on Vogler.
text: Pauline starts to say something -- stops. Then:
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I think it's over between Dick and
dialog: Margot. He was so cruel to her
dialog: today. And poor Claude had to
dialog: watch it all. She should just get
dialog: out of the marriage and then she
dialog: can fuck whoever she wants, you
dialog: know. It's cowardly. And Dick
dialog: Koosman. What a choice. I
dialog: mean...you know?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I agree. I hate the idea of Dick
dialog: fucking Margot.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What does that mean? You want to
dialog: fuck Margot?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Pauline, that's not what I said.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I know you have a crush on her, you
dialog: already told me that.
text: Malcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again. They yell
text: over the noise:
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I didn't say that. I said I
dialog: thought she was attractive after
dialog: you grilled me. She has no
dialog: interest in me anyway. Not that it
dialog: would matter if she did.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Have you ever done anything like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Have you ever cheated on me?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: No!
text: Malcolm shuts the motor.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Can I do this?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Those emails you had with that
dialog: student of mine.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (exhales)
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Did that...I know you said it was
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It was.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I just... Can you say it again?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I just did. Now, can I cut down
dialog: the tree?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You never did anything with her?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: No. She emailed me after we met at
dialog: that reading at the college and...
dialog: You know we were friends.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Right, just a regular friendship
dialog: between you and a twenty year old
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Pauline, how many times do I have
dialog: to say it.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: But...why don't I believe it?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Because Margot can't understand why
dialog: you're with me and now when she's
dialog: around you look for things.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: You promise.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I promise.
dialog: 85.
text: Pauline looks at him long and hard. Malcolm takes off his
text: goggles.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Okay. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: It's okay.
text: Malcolm and Pauline continue to stare at one another. He
text: guns the chainsaw. Tears spill suddenly from his eyes.
text: Pauline startles. He flicks the switch off.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I'm going to tell you something.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (suddenly terrified)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I don't want to lose you, though.
dialog: Okay?
text: Pauline's face goes pale.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I'm going to tell you... Just let
dialog: me... Maisy...
text: Pauline teeters.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't want to know.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: ...we didn't really do anything.
dialog: We were goofing around, I was
text: making fun of her cause she dates a
dialog: jock...
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't want to know.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I shouldn't've put myself in that
dialog: position, I know that. We brushed
text: lips really. It was barely a kiss.
dialog: And then we stopped. That was it.
text: His nose runs. He wipes it messily with his arm.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Our tongues touched. I don't want
dialog: to under-sell it either. I mean...
dialog: We made out. I made out with her.
dialog: I don't know why. I don't even
dialog: like her. It's been a heady time.
dialog: (Pauline says nothing)
dialog: What are you thinking? Please,
dialog: tell me what you're thinking.
text: Pauline rushes at the tree -- she smacks her hands on the
text: trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove. It
text: doesn't budge. In frustration and rage, she runs.
dialog: 63 CUT TO: 63
text: Ingrid is the only one on the patio as Pauline approaches.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Has anyone seen Wizard?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No. Where's Maisy?
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Upstairs, I think with Claude.
scene_heading: 64 INT. PAULINE'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY - DAY 64
text: Pauline enters in a daze. A toilet flushes. Maisy comes out
text: of Pauline's bathroom.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I
dialog: hope that's okay I used yours.
text: Pauline nods strangely. She goes to the window. Her dove
text: grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: I love your wedding dress. It's so
dialog: unconventional and great.
text: Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and
text: Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau. Maisy looks at
dialog: the pictures too.
text: Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows.
text: Maisy walks down the hallway, aware that Pauline is right
text: behind her.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: Is everything okay?
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Nothing.
text: Maisy stops at the landing. Claude sits at the bottom of the
text: staircase playing with a string.
speaker_heading: MAISY
dialog: Claude, do you want to play
dialog: croquet?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Okay.
text: Pauline raises her leg -- her foot hovers at Maisy's lower
text: back. She hesitates. Claude reacts with horror. Maisy
text: turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like
text: she's doing karate. Pauline's eyes dart around aimlessly.
text: Maisy stares, confused. Pauline slowly lowers her leg.
text: Something dawns on Maisy. She races down the stairs.
scene_heading: 65 EXT. HOUSE - DAY 65
text: The deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree.
text: Malcolm is soaked in sweat. Ingrid watches from a few feet
dialog: away.
text: In the distance -- Dick's orange BMW grinds into the
text: driveway. Maisy hurries toward him.
text: Ingrid says, buried in the noise:
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: There's Dick.
text: Malcolm sees Dick. He pushes the blade harder into the wood.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Is it almost ready?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Almost.
text: Maisy is talking to her father. Dick spots Malcolm. He
text: immediately starts toward him. Malcolm hesitates. Cold fear
text: creeps up his neck.
text: Dick speeds up.
text: Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts
text: toward the water. Ingrid watches, confused.
dialog: 88.
text: Dick takes off after him. Malcolm stumbles down the long
text: wooden stairs to the beach.
text: Malcolm runs wobbily -- he pants, already out of breath.
text: Sweat pours down his face and body.
text: Dick's gait is swift -- his arms stiff, bent at the elbow.
text: His jeans make a swish swish. He takes the stairs two at a
dialog: time.
text: Malcolm grasps the railing, moving as fast as he can
text: sideways, trying not to fall. He reaches the beach, his feet
text: sinking in the sand. He trips and topples forward.
text: He looks up -- Dick lunges.
text: Dick pounds Malcolm's head and face. Malcolm throws his arms
text: up and tries to block the punches.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I didn't do anything! I didn't do
dialog: anything!
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Fucking sleazebag!
text: Dick gets up. He kicks Malcolm hard.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: I don't ever want to see you again.
text: Malcolm balls himself up against a rock. He cries:
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Fuck off, dickhead.
text: Dick marches forward and kicks Malcolm again hard.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Ow!
text: Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away. Malcolm
dialog: screams:
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Fucking dickbag! She's lying!
text: He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (choking on tears)
dialog: Oh, man.
dialog: 89.
text: There's a rustling noise in the wind. Malcolm looks -- a mud-
text: and sea-coated Wizard watches him with a panting smile.
speaker_heading: 66 CUT TO: 66
text: Wheels sputter in the gravel. Dick's car peels out with
text: Maisy in the passenger seat. Claude and Margot watch from
text: the porch.
scene_heading: 67 INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - SAME 67
text: Pauline is seated at the table with place cards, flowers,
text: silverware, napkins, dishes. Margot enters. Claude follows.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Come with me to New York.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I can't talk about it --
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Okay, but you can't marry him. You
dialog: have to go now. We can think about
dialog: what to do with the baby --
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (stands)
dialog: Margot, I can't --
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Don't turn vague, listen to me --
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I want you to pack all your things
dialog: and get out of here. You can take
dialog: our car and leave it at the ferry.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (startled)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I'll help out more. I can make
dialog: popovers.
text: Pauline looks at Claude strangely. She leans down and kisses
text: him on the lips.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Do you love me?
dialog: (Claude nods)
dialog: Good.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Don't take this out on me? I'm on
dialog: your side.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No, you're not. You're not.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I've kept my mouth shut because --
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No, you haven't kept your mouth
dialog: shut! No you haven't...kept your
dialog: mouth shut...
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Okay, I told you and I was right.
dialog: He's done an insane thing. You
dialog: don't know this man. What he did
dialog: is criminal.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Margot, I can't...
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It's pedophilia.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Get out!
text: Pauline shoves a stack of plates and silverware off of the
text: table. The plates shatter. Silence save for their
dialog: breathing.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Becky and I talk about you -- about
dialog: what a monster you are. Is it
dialog: cause Mom gave me the house? Can't
dialog: I have anything? What was I
dialog: thinking? I let you in. Get!
dialog: Out!
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: What? What are you saying? I
dialog: don't recognize you -- it's like
dialog: you're channelling someone.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (suddenly)
dialog: Ingrid!
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: 68 EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS 68
text: The purple of Ingrid's batik shirt shines in the grass
text: beneath the tree.
text: The trunk -- a gash at its base -- teeters.
text: Pauline takes off into the field.
text: Ingrid sings to herself and traces the branches in the air
text: with her finger.
dialog: Pauline sprints --
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Ingrid!
dialog: Ingrid says to no one in particular:
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: What?
text: Pauline's breaths are rapid, jagged.
text: Ingrid stands.
text: A wind whips up. The tree sways.
text: Pauline thrusts her arms out, seizes Ingrid and hurls herself
text: away from the tree.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Ow!
text: Ingrid sobs as they run. Pauline looks back. The tree is
text: still standing. They embrace a few feet out of its range.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: It wasn't going to fall!
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Malcolm trudges up the stairs. He's bloody and tattered.
text: Wizard trots behind him.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Wizard!
text: She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar. The three of
text: them stand a few feet apart.
text: There's a horrible creak -- and suddenly --
dialog: 92.
dialog: -- crack --
text: Malcolm pulls both girls toward him --
text: The tree topples -- the thick trunk rips through the wedding
text: tent and crashes through tables and chairs and the fence --
text: -- onto the Vogler's property.
scene_heading: 69 INT. VOLVO - DAY 69
text: The speedometer needle wavers around 30. Margot clutches the
text: steering wheel. Claude looks morose. Pauline and Ingrid sit
text: stonily in the back seat. The Volvo jerks into the oncoming
text: lane and back. Margot draws a deep breath.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I thought you couldn't drive.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: I can drive. Why does everyone say
dialog: that? I used to drive.
text: They inch up a small hill. A car cascades down past them.
text: The Volvo shakes. Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze:
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We have to call people and cancel.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: What happened? Can I still sing?
text: Margot rolls down the window.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (to Claude)
dialog: You do smell.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Well, I'm not wearing any
dialog: deodorant.
text: They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend.
text: The vehicle picks up speed. Margot presses down on the
dialog: brake.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What?
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't think...
dialog: (she pumps again)
dialog: No... We don't have brakes.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (resigned)
dialog: The brakes are bad, that's right.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: What do you think it means?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I mean, what can we do?
text: The car coasts faster down the hill.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Mom.
text: Margot places her arm stiffly across Claude's front.
text: Pauline wraps her body around her daughter.
text: Margot swerves into the shoulder -- she makes a sharp turn
text: into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck.
text: The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of
text: a tree.
speaker_heading: 70 CUT TO: 70
text: Margot and Claude, Pauline and Ingrid trudge through the bony
text: white trees of the forest -- their bags weigh them down.
text: They're all covered in sweat and there's dirt caked on their
text: feet and ankles.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I ruined these shoes.
text: Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain. She races
text: behind a tree. Margot follows.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Mom, are you okay?
speaker_heading: PAULINE (O.S.)
dialog: Don't look!
text: Margot stops.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: PAULINE (O.S.)
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Mom, what happened?
speaker_heading: PAULINE (O.S.)
dialog: Nothing.
text: Margot steps to see around the trunk. The kids follow
text: behind. Pauline removes her panties from under her skirt.
text: She tosses them in the brush.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Fuck.
text: Margot turns to the kids. Ingrid hides a smile.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Did she poop in her pants?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: It happens to everyone. Not just
dialog: babies. It'll happen to you too
dialog: someday.
scene_heading: 71 EXT. FERRY - DAY 71
text: Margot and Claude sit, streaked with mud and perspiration.
text: Margot drinks a beer, Claude a Coke. Margot pops a blue pill
text: in her mouth and swallows. Ingrid swings on the rail.
text: Pauline hangs up a cell phone and hands it back to her
text: sister. She takes the beer and swigs.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I left mom and Becky a message.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't think mom knows how to work
dialog: the machine.
text: Margot puts her pinky in her ear.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
text: I can hear it flapping.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You should take care of that. It
dialog: can hatch eggs.
dialog: 95.
text: Claude turns his head. In the Chevy next to them sits Mrs.
text: Vogler and the Vogler boy. She sings along to the radio.
text: She runs her hand through her son's hair gently. He nestles
text: into her shoulder.
scene_heading: 72 EXT. SEASIDE TOWN STREET - EVENING 72
text: The four of them get out of a taxi. A small, peeling hotel.
scene_heading: 73 INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 73
text: A dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall-to-wall
text: carpet. Pauline combs Ingrid's hair on one of the two double
text: beds. Ingrid practices her wedding song. Claude sits on the
text: other bed and looks into the open bathroom door: Margot
text: stands with her back to him. She talks on her cell phone in
text: a whisper. She hangs up. Claude walks inside. The sink
text: drips.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
text: Sweety, there's a bus that leaves
dialog: to Vermont from town tomorrow
dialog: morning. I just talked to your dad
dialog: and he's going to pick you up.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Aren't you coming?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I have to help out Paul and Ingrid.
text: Claude tugs gently on his yellow bracelet.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't want to go tomorrow.
text: The distant bong of a low drum and beneath that -- chanting.
text: Claude follows Margot to the window. Ingrid and Pauline are
text: already looking out.
text: Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people
text: hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the
text: rest is obscured from the window. Some marchers are dressed
text: in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard
text: coffins.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: There's Malcolm.
text: Pauline points to a guy in a vest. As he turns around we see
text: it isn't him. Pauline withdraws, suddenly on the verge of
dialog: tears.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I can't live in that house alone.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're going to be fine.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Maybe...maybe I could get a place
dialog: in Brooklyn -- Williamsburg or
dialog: something. People are living there
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You don't want to live there. It's
dialog: all young people.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: But what do you think of that idea?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Maybe. Let's see. You know if you
dialog: don't want to come with me, I'm
dialog: sure mom will let you stay with her
dialog: --
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (through tears)
dialog: You're already trying to pass me
dialog: off on mom...
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Don't say that. Come on, you'll
dialog: come home with us.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You don't even know where you're
dialog: going to live. You might have to
dialog: move in with mom too.
text: Margot tightens.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What? Oh.
dialog: (mouthing a whisper)
dialog: Didn't you tell him?
dialog: 97.
text: Margot looks at her son who continues to watch out the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: 74 CUT TO: 74
text: Pauline emerges from behind the armoire doors wearing a long
text: nightshirt that reads: I Spent The Night With Arsenio Hall.
text: She enters the bathroom. She mutters to herself.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What have I done? What have I
dialog: done?
text: Margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air. A few
text: stragglers still march in the street. Trash and pieces of
text: signage line the gutter. Margot turns into the room. She
text: puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin. She
text: watches her son who removes his jeans for bed.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Nothing. Just then I felt so much
dialog: love for you.
speaker_heading: 75 CUT TO: 75
text: Pauline tucks in Ingrid who lies next to Claude. Margot sits
text: on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook. Pauline
text: marches around and across to the other side of the room. She
text: snatches the book out of Margot's hands.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You cannot write about this. You
dialog: can't have it.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I wasn't writing about you.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You already took a part of my life,
dialog: you can't have any more. And that
dialog: goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and
dialog: Wizard. We all own our own rights.
dialog: They're not for sale.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Give it back.
dialog: 98.
text: Pauline glances at the book.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: If I could read your handwriting
dialog: I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I
dialog: ever see a story that involves a
dialog: hotel room or any of this shit, I
dialog: will fucking take your bowels out.
text: Pauline thrusts the book back at Margot --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The kids sleep in one bed. Margot and Pauline lie awake in
dialog: the other.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You've now successfully ruined two
dialog: of my marriages.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're not wearing any underwear.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It's hot, I'm pregnant. Move over.
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're not hot, your feet are cold.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Stop touching me. I am so hot.
dialog: Feel my head.
text: Margot puts her lips to Pauline's forehead.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You have a fever.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't have a fever... I'm
dialog: pregnant...are you always like
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Get used to it... Mom and Becky
dialog: share a bed -- you and I will
dialog: probably get the other.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You should just go to Vermont.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I was thinking -- you know if you
dialog: want -- you and Ingrid could go to
dialog: Vermont. Keep Claude company and
dialog: Jim adores you.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You don't like Malcolm because
dialog: you're not attracted to him.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Will you do it?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No. I won't do that for you.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did you two talk about me in town?
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I told him you often change your
dialog: mind.
scene_heading: 76 INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - MORNING 76
text: Cheap plastic tables. A small karaoke stage in front.
text: Margot, Claude, Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar. Margot
text: drinks her wine with ice. She wears Jim's sweater. The kids
text: have Cokes. The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a
text: plastic red basket lie between them.
text: A man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage. The
text: music begins. The man sways and sings "On and On" by Stephen
text: Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes
text: moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the
text: wine. She takes her son's hand and whispers:
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I'm sorry, sweety. There's
dialog: something wrong with me.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm going to call him.
text: Margot quickly turns to her sister.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No. Don't. I'm telling you.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I...I need some clothes and things.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: He should get the hell out of our
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Okay. I'll tell him to get the
dialog: hell out of our house.
text: Pauline walks over to a pay phone.
speaker_heading: 77 CUT TO: 77
text: Pauline holds the receiver to her ear. She stares at a
text: drawing of a monster fucking a woman on the wall above the
text: pay phone. Malcolm is crying.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM'S VOICE
text: The tent looks so lonely.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It has no one to get married in it.
scene_heading: 78 EXT. HOUSE - INTERCUT 78
text: Malcolm sits in the grass, the tree and wreckage behind him.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I know. And it's smashed. I'm
dialog: such a fucking idiot. Please don't
dialog: take me seriously. I mean take me
dialog: seriously, but not the fucked up
dialog: parts, you know. I love you so
dialog: much. Please marry me.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You can't do what you did again.
dialog: Do you understand?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No matter how tempting.
text: At the bar: Margot watches her sister carefully. She absent-
text: mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it
text: onto the floor.
text: Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to
dialog: Claude.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: You left it in my room.
text: It's a piece of fingernail. He hesitates then puts it in his
dialog: pocket.
text: At the phone: Pauline rests her head against the wall.
text: Malcolm is bawling on the other end.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I don't know. I don't know.
text: Malcolm clutches Wizard and sputters:
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: I ate some of the cake. I don't
dialog: know why, but I did it.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What was... How was it?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: It's not too sweet? They sometimes
dialog: make their stuff too sweet.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't
dialog: even notice... They fucked up the
dialog: cake. How sad. I love our little
dialog: baby. I miss you.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I miss you too. Maybe we should do
dialog: another seminar.
text: Malcolm says something incomprehensible.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I can't understand you, honey.
text: Margot finishes her glass of wine, her eyes still on her
dialog: sister.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: There's gramma and Aunt Becky!
text: Margot startles and looks out the window. Across the street
text: is an older woman, 70's, and a large woman, mid 30's, eating
text: ice cream cones and looking in a boarded-up shop window.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: They didn't get my message.
text: Pauline now stands above them.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I told you she can't work the
dialog: machine --
text: Ingrid's chair scrapes as she stands. She takes her mother's
text: hand. Margot remains seated.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What? You're not coming?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I'm coming, I'm coming. What did
dialog: he say?
text: Pauline and Ingrid head for the door. Claude waits for
dialog: Margot.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: What did he say?
text: She grabs her bags and drops some bills on the table.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Don't worry, I got it.
scene_heading: 79 EXT. STREET - MORNING 79
text: The sisters and children come outside. The mother and Becky
text: now idle further down the street.
speaker_heading: PAULINE/INGRID
dialog: Mom!/Nana!
text: Margot takes Claude's arm and walks quickly in the opposite
text: direction. Claude, confused, glances over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Don't look. Keep walking.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Why are we --
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: We have to get you to your bus.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: 80 CUT TO: 80
text: A huge parking lot. A bus in the distance. Claude tries to
text: keep pace with his mother.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Did you do something?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: What do you mean, do something?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I mean, why is the wedding not
dialog: happening? Is there something that
dialog: you did?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Pauline has transferred all her
dialog: stuff onto me. I don't understand
dialog: her anymore. Why'd she pick this
dialog: man? It is really berserk. And
dialog: you know, she referred to me as her
dialog: closest friend. We never see one
dialog: anoth --
text: An unfamiliar sound comes out of Margot. The sadness is
text: unexpected -- she sobs uncontrollably. She tries to speak:
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I mean we're not close. Even if we
dialog: want to be. You know?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: But was there anything real?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No! How many times do I have to
dialog: say it? Jesus. You think so
dialog: little of me.
dialog: (through her sobs)
dialog: It's good you're going. You
dialog: shouldn't be around me either. I'd
dialog: go if I were you...
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Will you find Pauline and Nana
dialog: after I leave?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (half-serious)
dialog: I don't know. Maybe I'll go to
dialog: church.
dialog: 104.
text: Margot is sweating. She wipes her brow with her sleeve. She
text: periodically looks behind her. Nobody seems to be following.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: (growing nervous)
dialog: Are you angry at me?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, honey. I'm not mad at you.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't want to go with you mad at
dialog: anyone.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Everything's fine. I'm not mad at
dialog: anyone.
text: Up ahead is a tiny depot. People climb onto a white bus.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Can you come with me?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: No, you know that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We should talk about the next few
dialog: months a little bit and what's
dialog: going to happen --
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I don't like Vermont.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Your dad will be very happy to see
dialog: you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to
dialog: hang out.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Please come, mom.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (suddenly irritable)
dialog: Claude, stop it. Okay?
text: She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man.
text: Margot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You used to need me to watch you
dialog: when you played.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (vaguely)
dialog: When you first started to play with
dialog: friends, you wouldn't do it unless
dialog: I watched you. You were afraid I
dialog: would go out the back door. I
dialog: don't know where I would go. Our
dialog: yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.
text: She takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T-
text: shirt. She isn't wearing a bra. Claude says suddenly:
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I masturbated last night. While
dialog: everyone was asleep I went into the
dialog: bathroom and did it.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You don't have to tell me, sweety.
text: The bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You've got to go.
text: Margot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claude's
text: hand. They approach the bus. Claude's body tenses.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: How will you get home?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: I don't know. I'll see. Maybe
dialog: Dick can drive me to the...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Jesus, I lost the word for a
text: second. The train.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Uh huh.
text: He looks at her longingly.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Come on. You always don't want to
dialog: leave me and you always have a good
dialog: time once you do.
dialog: (provocatively)
dialog: I think you like getting away from
dialog: me.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: I do not. I like hanging out with
dialog: you.
text: She hugs him. He clutches her.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: The world feels strange to me right
dialog: now.
text: Margot nods sympathetically. She kisses his lips and
text: releases him. He reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his
text: wrap-around punk sunglasses. Margot makes a face.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: They make your face look too wide.
text: Claude removes them and puts them back in the bag.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: See you soon.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Bye, sweety.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Say, you'll see me "soon."
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: You're acting like a baby.
text: She backs away --
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Don't see Dick.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Don't worry. I don't think he
dialog: wants to see me anyway.
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Please, Margot. Promise me.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Don't call me that.
text: Claude doesn't move. Margot points at the bus and mouths
text: "Go". She turns in the other direction. Claude, frustrated
text: and anxious approaches the vehicle.
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: 81 INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 81
text: Claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat. He
text: puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass.
text: Claude's POV: Margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her
text: ear and shakes her head.
text: The sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the
text: pavement. She starts walking.
text: The bus hisses and lurches forward. Claude strains to see:
text: Margot looks back.
text: The bus groans as it picks up speed. Margot sprints.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Wait!
text: She's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Wait! Wait!
text: She pants, breathless.
text: The bus brakes.
text: She passes Claude's window. We stay on Claude. He waits.
text: Finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and
text: panting. She kisses him on the head. The bus starts moving.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: (almost euphoric)
dialog: Did you see me running out there?
speaker_heading: CLAUDE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Margot cranes her neck to see outside.
speaker_heading: MARGOT
dialog: Good. That was a lot of running.
text: I'm out of breath.
text: Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
dialog:
