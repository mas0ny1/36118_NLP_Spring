speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated
dialog: satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That

dialog: right into place. It's magic time and it

dialog: forty years...
text: INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER
dialog: What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his
dialog: mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing.
text: Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his

scene_heading: A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN
dialog: The place is full. Everybody is somebody here.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Hostess)
dialog: Langer. ..
text: The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.
speaker_heading: MAITRE'D
dialog: Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.
text: As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other
text: Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: So what does a life of bucking the system
dialog: all add up to?
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: To never settle down with the right woman
dialog: for a life of leftovers and Christmas
dialog: mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no
text: mini van parked in the garage. I think
dialog: it's made me what I am today.
dialog: (Harry smiles to someone
dialog: across the room)
dialog: The luckiest son of a bitch on earth.
dialog: Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I
dialog: should be illegal I'm lookin' so good.
text: Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with
text: his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and
text: The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my
dialog: life would be like if I was a Regular Joe

scene_heading: NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION
text: Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older,

text: IN HER FIFTIES.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame
dialog: really my age. . .
scene_heading: INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO
text: Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he
text: looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The
text: twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD
text: BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly
text: shows them to a shitty table.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: There you have it. The story in a
dialog: nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?
dialog: (Harry TRIPS, his wife
dialog: looks disgusted)

text: to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart,
text: sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.
text: Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year
text: age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: ( singing)
dialog: To all my thugs that be livin' it

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (admiring the

dialog: So baby, you're rich... .
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Well, my mother is, sort of. Not
dialog: really...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If she lives within a mile of here, she's
dialog: rich.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: I guess a hit play will buy you a house
dialog: in The Hamptons.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'd like to meet your mother.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: No you wouldn't. I mean, she's
dialog: great. She's totally brilliant, but
dialog: she's not your type.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're overlooking one of the great
dialog: things about me. I don't have a type.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (very directly)
dialog: She's over thirty.
text: Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Oh, what?! Like you don't know you
dialog: have a slight reputation for...
dialog: 4.
text: Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: -- For what?
text: Harry waits. RINGGG!
text: He doesn't look away.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: For never dating anyone over 30.
dialog: Don't look at me like that.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's just not true.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Okay. Sorry. Over 31?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The
dialog: Hamptons to let me know you're a wise
dialog: ass.
dialog: (answers phone)
dialog: Hold on. . .
dialog: (then to Marin)
dialog: It just so happens, my dear, that women
dialog: of a certain age, don't date me. You ever
dialog: think of it that way? No, it's always me.
dialog: You dames are all alike.
dialog: (then into phone)
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (amused, to herself)
dialog: Dames...
text: Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry
text: confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who
dialog: else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't
dialog: find me. Who?
text: (glances at Marin, she's
dialog: not listening)
dialog: I'll call her later. No, I have it.
text: Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'
dialog: she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that
text: card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've
text: reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass
text: and the ocean stretch before them.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (all business)
text: Make a right, left at the second
dialog: fence.
text: Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just
text: came over her, looks out the window.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Have I mentioned how gorgeous your
dialog: breasts look in this sweater?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (blushing)
dialog: Yes you have actually.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So it would be too much to mention it
dialog: again. . .
text: Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,
text: driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wow. It's the perfect beach house.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: I know. My mother doesn't know how
dialog: to do things that aren't perfect.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Which explains you.
text: That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's
text: grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at
text: her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
dialog: such a lovely thought.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (trying to keep up with
dialog: him)
dialog: Yeah, okay, right...
text: They both grab their H
text: overnight bags and step out of the car.
speaker_heading: ARRY
dialog: So, what are we gonna do out here,
dialog: just the two of us, for two whole
dialog: days?
text: Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms
text: around his neck.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Tell me the truth, are you at all
dialog: glad we waited?
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm incredibly glad we're finally
dialog: going to do it.
dialog: (she's a bit disappointed)
dialog: If that's the same as being glad we
dialog: waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.
text: Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that
dialog: lets you kiss them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (slaps her tush)
dialog: Let's go for a swim, how long will
dialog: it take you to change?
speaker_heading: MARIN
text: Two minutes.
text: Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances
text: seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's
dialog: cigars.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My
dialog: Mom doesn't allow it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But she allows you to strip in the
dialog: front yard and bring men you're
dialog: dating here to...
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: She doesn't know everything I do...Or
dialog: when I do it.. or where I do it.
text: She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE
text: It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm
text: with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around
text: the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight
text: pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to
text: undress.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (TAKING OFF her belt)
text: The fabulous living room, perfect for
text: entertaining an intimate group of friends
dialog: or that special someone.
dialog: (DROPS her belt then
text: UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)
text: Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck
text: complete with pool and ocean view.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: MARIN (CONT'D)
dialog: (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)
dialog: Your pants, please...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ladies first.
text: Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of
text: them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Gourmet kitchen's to your left
dialog: where tonight I will whip you up a
text: culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.
text: Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES
text: WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down
text: to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: .. O-kay, going quickly now...
dialog: Master bedroom is that away...
text: They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.
speaker_heading: M
speaker_heading: ARIN
dialog: And this as they say on 'Cribs',
dialog: your favorite show, is where the
dialog: magic happens. Do we like it? Going
dialog: once, going twice ...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sold.
text: Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO
text: THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: You know when I first started
dialog: auctioneering someone told me if I was
dialog: nervous to just picture everyone in the
dialog: audience in their underwear. This sort of
dialog: gives that a whole new meaning.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why? You're not nervous now, are you?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: I'm always a little nervous.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (removing his hands)
dialog: So put on your bathing suit. I brought
dialog: some champagne, I'll put it on ice.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Me like you, Harry Langer.
text: She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the
dialog: bathroom.
text: Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He
text: sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his
text: throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a
text: stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that
text: young man.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the
text: Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into
text: his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in
text: the mirror, sucks in his gut.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the
text: fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS
text: and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively
dialog: conversation.
text: One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's
dialog: Younger Sister, ZOE.
text: ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.
dialog: It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not
text: because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and
dialog: right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond
dialog: expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of
dialog: herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she
dialog: just is.
text: Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She
text: wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE".
text: The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR
text: IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking
speaker_heading: E
text: out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.
speaker_heading: RICA
dialog: Oh God. What is this?
text: Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.
text: Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (in control)
dialog: Okay, stay right where you are. We have a
dialog: knife.
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (eyeing the knife)
dialog: Do you... live here?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial
dialog: 911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,
dialog: hand me the phone.
dialog: (reaches out to Zoe
dialog: without looking at her)
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You don't understand. I'm a friend
dialog: of your daughter's.
text: With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's
text: naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe
text: FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in
dialog: the city and you what, wandered in
dialog: here,like high on Ecstasy..?.
dialog: (looks at phone)
dialog: Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.
dialog: (redials)
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (calmly starts to move)
dialog: Honestly, if you just...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Back off. She was in the Israeli
dialog: army. She can break you in half.
dialog: Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it
dialog: whatsoever.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes. I have an intruder in my
text: house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm dating your daughter Marin. She
dialog: invited me here for the weekend.
text: She's in her room right now,
dialog: changing.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (GASPS even louder, really
dialog: scared now)
dialog: You're dating my daughter?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Now who would've thought that would
dialog: be worse news?
text: With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his
text: shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Oh, fuck.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, God.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm
dialog: sure. No, he's not a burglar
dialog: (with enormous difficulty)
dialog: He's dating my daughter.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Mom, I had no idea you were coming out
dialog: this weekend, you said you had to write.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I do. I thought I'd do it out here.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Oh, man, this is really....
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Awkward.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Totally.. .but....
dialog: (starts laughing)
dialog: You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought
dialog: he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I
dialog: don't know the man. . .
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (still laughing)
dialog: I'm sorry, it's not really funny.
dialog: I'm an idiot. I should've told you
dialog: I was bringing someone out.
speaker_heading: E
speaker_heading: RICA
dialog: No, no, I should've told you we
dialog: were coming. Well. Anyway, here we
dialog: are.
dialog: (waves to Harry)
dialog: Hello. I'm the mother.
dialog: 11.
text: All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster
text: shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Harry Langer. How are ya?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend,
dialog: Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt,
dialog: Zoe.
dialog: (they all shake hands)
dialog: Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I
dialog: mentioned him in an e-mail. We just,
dialog: totally spur of the moment thought we'd
dialog: get out of the city for a few days.
speaker_heading: ERICA AND ZOE
dialog: Of course...Right...Great...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (can't look at him)
dialog: Honey, does Harry have a robe?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (backing out)
dialog: You know what? Actually, I think I should
dialog: just take off. Let you gals enjoy your
dialog: weekend...
text: Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,
dialog: here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will
dialog: leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
dialog: we'll go into town for lunch. You two
dialog: stay. Harry, apologize about the near
dialog: arrest.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, you were impressive. Very strong,
dialog: very... "macho".
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (a little thrown)
dialog: I don't think I was exactly "macho"
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in
dialog: his underwear in my refrigerator I
dialog: hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs
dialog: uh...
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (already hating him)
dialog: Yeah. Okay. Whatever...
text: Marin watches. Dying.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: All righty then...I'm definitely gonna
text: hit the road.
dialog: (salutes Erica and Zoe)
dialog: Ladies...sensational meeting you.
dialog: (then to Marin)
dialog: Doll, call me.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so
dialog: dramatic here. What are we four
dialog: teenagers? We're all sophisticated
dialog: people. Why can't we all stay, for the
dialog: weekend? Your mother's got work to do
dialog: I've got papers to grade. You'll do your
dialog: thing, whatever that is and if we want to
dialog: hang together, we'll hang together. If we
dialog: don't, we don't. There's no reason why
dialog: any of us should give up this spectacular
dialog: weekend.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Seriously. I can handle it.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I can totally handle it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (on the spot)
dialog: I mean, well, I can "handle" it...
text: The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to
dialog: resist.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It can only go up from here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HARRY AND MARIN

speaker_heading: OE (V.O.)
text: He's obviously a penis substitute.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ERICA AND ZOE
text: Are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I mean a father substitute.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Except he's older than her father. I
dialog: can't even look at them. What is she
dialog: doing with a guy that age?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Marin was how old when you guys broke up?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Okay, so she was old enough not to
text: feel Dave was walking out on her.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out
dialog: on me? Why do people assume when you
dialog: break up after twenty years that the
dialog: guy's the one who wanted out? Just
dialog: because once we broke up he shtupped
dialog: everything that moved...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way.
dialog: Just trying to figure out why such a
dialog: smart girl is always with the wrong guy.

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Bonjour je veux une partie de votre

text: Harry and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's impressive.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: She started French lessons after she and
dialog: my Dad split up. Part of her "Keep Busy,
dialog: Don't Look Back" program. She's
text: practically fluent now.
speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: MARIN

text: Marin crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and
text: catches Harry checking out Marin's ass. He smiles as he licks
text: his ice cream. Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older
text: Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It's an epidemic.
text: Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.
text: She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her
text: glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in
text: their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is

speaker_heading: Y
speaker_heading: OUNG FRENCH GIRL
dialog: Merci madame.

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (backing off)
dialog: Woops. Sorry.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: My fault.
dialog: They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica
text: hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks
text: alongside her.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: So, Harry... What do you do?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm one of the owners of a record
dialog: company among other things...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, really? Which record company?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Drive by Records.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (appalled at the name)
dialog: "Drive By" Records??? Is that a
dialog: joke? What is that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's a Hip Hop label.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well.
dialog: (with disdain)
dialog: Okay. That's... "interesting"...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Let me see if I get where you're
dialog: headed here. . .
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate
dialog: rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent
dialog: and crude for my taste, not to mention
text: just a tad misogynistic.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, a lot of people see rapping as
dialog: poetry.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah, but come on, how many words
dialog: can you rhyme with 'Bitch'?
text: Erica places her groceries on the check out counter.
speaker_heading: MARIN

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin'
dialog: happy with it?
text: Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger
text: along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she
text: continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Well, the thing with me is that I'm about
dialog: 90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah, right...
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which

text: At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was
dialog: the big buyer of the night.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I kept winking at Marin as she was
dialog: conducting the auction and apparently
dialog: every time I did that she misunderstood
dialog: and I ended up buying cases of
text: outrageously expensive wine.
dialog: 17.
text: Zoe and Marin laugh.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Ever been married, Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No. No, I haven't.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Wow. Now why do you think that is?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Some people just don't fit the mold. And
dialog: so far...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Hey, if it ain't broke.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Exactly.
text: Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica
dialog: takes note.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Wait a second, aren't you like a famous
dialog: bachelor?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I wouldn't say I'm famous.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, I think I read a piece on you
dialog: in New York Magazine.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I guess people find it interesting
dialog: that I've escaped the noose for so
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah, wasn't the name of the article,
dialog: "The Escape Artist"?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Wait. I read that article. That was you?
dialog: You were once engaged to somebody big.
dialog: Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait.
dialog: ..Carly Simon?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah, it was somebody cool like that.
dialog: (trying to remember)
dialog: Not Martha Stewart....
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: You could just ..'ask him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, this is more fun. It's like I'm
dialog: not here.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Harry was once engaged to Diane
dialog: Sawyer. Okay?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: I'm impressed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, women your age love that
dialog: about me.
text: Erica pauses on that one.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (trying to get thru this)
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yes I do.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's not a bad thing to say 'women
dialog: your age'.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No...I'm sure it was a compliment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It was. ..just the truth.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: (stepping in)
dialog: So when was this engagement?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Long time ago. She was just this
dialog: adorable lanky girl from Kentucky
dialog: with the greatest pair of legs I'd
dialog: ever seen... Never understood her
dialog: ending up with a job where she
dialog: never showed them.
dialog: (munches on his lobster)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You're not serious? She's Diane
text: Sawyer, she goes into caves in
text: Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her
dialog: head. Who cares about her legs?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just anyone who's ever had the
dialog: pleasure of... You know what? I
dialog: hate to eat and run but...
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, wait. This is actually a very
dialog: fascinating dynamic - what's going
dialog: on at this table...
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (warning him)
dialog: Z
dialog: oe teaches Women's Studies at
dialog: Columbia. . .
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, so this is gonna hurt.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No, come on, listen, here's the rub
dialog: for women. Look at what we have
dialog: here with you and Erica. Harry,
dialog: you've been around the block a few
dialog: times, right? You're what? Around
dialog: 60, never been married, which, we
dialog: all know, if you were a woman,
dialog: would be a curse, you'd be an old
dialog: maid, a spinster, blah, blah,
dialog: blah... Okay, so instead of pitying
dialog: you, they write articles about you,
dialog: celebrate your never marrying, it
dialog: makes you illusive and ungettable.
dialog: You're a real catch. Then, take my
dialog: gorgeous sister here...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Any chance of you stopping here?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Come on, this is interesting. I
dialog: mean, look at her, she's so
dialog: accomplished, the most successful
dialog: woman playwright since who? Lillian
dialog: Hellman? She's over fifty,
text: divorced and still sits in night
dialog: after night because the available
dialog: guys her age want
dialog: (to Marin)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: ZOE(cont'd)
dialog: --forgive me honey for saying this,
dialog: but they want girls that look like
dialog: Marin so the whole over fifty
dialog: dating scene is geared completely
dialog: towards men leaving older women out
dialog: and as a result that makes the
dialog: older women more and more
dialog: productive and more and more
dialog: interesting, which, in turn, makes
dialog: them even less desirable because as
dialog: we all know -- men, especially
text: older men, are threatened and
dialog: deathly afraid of interesting and
dialog: accomplished women. It's just so
dialog: clear. Single older women, as a
dialog: demographic, are as fucked a group
dialog: as can ever exist.
text: Erica and Harry's EYES CONNECT for a millisecond. HEAR THE
text: SOUND OF PLATES CRASHING.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: OVER, we
text: Erica is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What are you, possessed? How could
dialog: you say those things?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: It just seemed so obvious to me. The
dialog: injustice of it. Thank God men die
dialog: younger than us. It's the only break we
dialog: get.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Then you know what? Write a dissertation
dialog: on it, don't announce to the world that I
dialog: stay in night after night after night and
dialog: by the way, one night after night would
dialog: have been enough. Did you ever realize, I
dialog: stay "in" as part of my job. Why do you
dialog: think I married the director of my plays?
dialog: He was the only man I ever saw. Anyway, I
dialog: like staying in and I like this time in
dialog: my life. Why do I have to defend myself?
dialog: M I was married for 20 years. I'm done.

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: What the hell was that?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm sorry, I thought I was onto
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Honey, what are you doing with this
dialog: guy? He's old, he's chauvinistic...
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: He's fun.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: He's fun? How is he fun? He's
dialog: like.. .wrong.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Wrong can be fun, Mom.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Not this wrong.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Can we not do this now? He's
dialog: actually incredibly smart and
dialog: fascinating and if you had talked
dialog: to him about something other than
dialog: his marital status you would've
dialog: found out how smart he is. He owns
dialog: like 10 different companies...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What does that mean he owns ten
dialog: different companies? He can't
dialog: commit, that's what that means. Not
dialog: that, God forbid, I want him to
dialog: commit.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he
dialog: thought you two were very spontaneous and
dialog: nice and then said he's leaving as soon
text: as the sun comes up.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What? His car doesn't have
dialog: headlights?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Wait. I have no right to get this
dialog: nuts.
dialog: (hugs her)
dialog: He's your friend. Not mine. I love
dialog: you.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (hugs her back)
dialog: I love you more.
text: This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses
text: Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin
speaker_heading: EXITS.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: No chance he said we were nice.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Please. None.
text: They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: What are they listening to?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I don't care...
dialog: (listens)
dialog: Oy. Marvin Gaye. . .
text: Erica turns on the garbage disposal. Zoe sings along,
text: "Let's get it on". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns
text: off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I know she'll never see him after
dialog: this weekend. She can't commit
dialog: either.
text: Then they hear Marin GIGGLING.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: He does sound fun.
dialog: Marin YELPS.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Admit it, he's got something. You
dialog: felt it, right?
text: Then they hear Marin SCREAM.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, this is nuts...
text: Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear
text: Marin SCREAM "MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!"
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Did she say, Mom?
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: INT. MARIN'S ROOM - ANGLE - THE DOOR
text: Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the
text: floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest.
text: His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey.
text: Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: We were fooling around and he said he
dialog: felt funny Hthen he just collapsed.
speaker_heading: ARRY
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was
dialog: the lobster...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Does your chest hurt?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Like an elephant's standing on it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (to Marin)
dialog: Call 911...tell them to send an

text: Marin hesitates.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Marin! Now!
scene_heading: HARRY'S POV - THE ROOM
text: Spinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning.
text: BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the
text: background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He
dialog: hears Zoe:
speaker_heading: ZOE(O.S.)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (coming closer)
dialog: Mouth to mouth...
speaker_heading: ON HARRY
text: Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her.
text: mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica
dialog: catches this.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You fucking guy...
dialog: 24.
text: She does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his
text: lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head.
text: As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A
dialog: SIREN...
text: AND A LOUD CLANG
text: As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics
text: WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with
text: dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and
text: ONTO A BED.
text: DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his
dialog: early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you
text: look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man
text: whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier
dialog: than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins
text: graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights.
text: The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a
text: heart monitor and connect him to an IV.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: How we doing here?
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC #1
dialog: He's had 30 minutes of chest pain,
dialog: nausea, shortness of breath, blood
dialog: pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104,
dialog: respirations 18...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Let's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm
dialog: Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain
dialog: right now?
text: The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Feel some pressure in my
dialog: chest...it's real tight.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Can you show me where the pain is?
text: Harry clenches his fist over his sternum.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: What were you doing at the onset of
dialog: the pain?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I was uh, kissing a beautiful...
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: (watching the monitor)
dialog: Where you having intercourse?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: -- Unfortunately, no.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
speaker_heading: S
dialog: ense of humor in tact...
speaker_heading: (checks EKG)
text: Hang a nitroglycerine drip. Mr.
dialog: Langer the EKG shows you have a
dialog: blocked artery which is not
dialog: allowing enough oxygen to get to
dialog: the heart muscle.. .
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm having a heart attack?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: We're gonna stop it. But I need to
dialog: know what kind of medications you
dialog: take?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (scared shitless)
dialog: I take uh... uh. . . Lipitor. . .
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: (reading the EKG tape)
dialog: Uh-huh... .Any thing else?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: -- and a white one for blood
dialog: pressure. . .
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: procardia?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: What about, Viagra?
text: Erica, Marin and Zoe ARRIVE in the DOORWAY of the ER. Harry
text: eyes them...stalls.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Mr. Langer? Did you take any Viagra
dialog: today? Mr. Langer?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No. No Viagra.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You're positive?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't take Viagra. Don't need
dialog: Viagra.
text: The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be
text: there. They turn away.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Great. Just needed to be sure
dialog: because I put nitroglycerin into
dialog: your-drip and if you had taken
dialog: Viagra, the combo would make your
dialog: heart leap right out of your
dialog: body...
scene_heading: CLOSE - HARRY'S EYES - PANICKED
text: As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE
text: and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to
text: enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm. The
text: drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the
text: Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin
text: hangs back. Harry catches the look on her face.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Let's give him an aspirin and
dialog: Metoprolol 5mg...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sorry, had an audience...
dialog: (clutching his chest)
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: It's okay. ..it was a great save.
dialog: (to Nurse)
dialog: Let's start the thrombolytic protocol.
dialog: "4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if
dialog: this works and I have every reason to
dialog: believe it will, it's going to reverse
dialog: what's going on so there will be little
dialog: or no damage to your heart. You with me?
text: (Harry nods. Julian places
text: his hand on Harry's)
dialog: Okay, here we go.
speaker_heading: THE HALLWAY
text: Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe leans against the wall.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Oh, man, what if he doesn't make
dialog: it? I don't know who to contact.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: MARIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know his family. I've gone
dialog: out to dinner with the guy three
dialog: times. I hardly know him.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: He's gonna make it. Don't worry.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: He's like a bulldog. He'll make it.
speaker_heading: ARIN
dialog: This is a nightmare. I go out with
dialog: a guy who's so old, he takes
dialog: Viagra.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Are you nuts? You go out with a guy
dialog: who's so old he's having a heart
dialog: attack!
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: All I can say is, thank God it didn't
dialog: happen when he was inside you. That could
dialog: be life altering.
text: Julian rounds the corner of the corridor. Marin rushes toward
text: him, her face begging for good news.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Your Dad's gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Oh, he's not my Dad...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Your Grandad's gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: MARIN
text: (throws her arms around
dialog: him)
dialog: Oh, thank you so much. But he's not my...
dialog: oh we're not related. He's just a friend.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Sorry.
text: His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin. Zoe and
text: Erica join them.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I'm Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a
dialog: mild heart attack. I gave him something
text: to break up the clot in his artery and it
dialog: worked beautifully.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
text: His EKG returned to normal almost
dialog: immediately which means I don't expect
dialog: any permanent damage. He's very lucky.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (shoulders sagging)
dialog: Thank you. . .
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: No, whoever got him here so fast should
dialog: be thanked. Another half hour and I don't
dialog: know if this would've worked.
text: Marin pats her Mom on the back.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, man...
dialog: (realizing it all now)
dialog: This was...intense.
text: Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: We're out of the woods. I've given him
dialog: something to sleep, it might make him a
dialog: little loopy at first but then it should
text: knock him out.
dialog: (to Erica)
dialog: You're Mrs. Langer?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. .
dialog: He was having dinner at our house. I just
dialog: met him this afternoon.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You're Erica Barry?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: The playwright?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan.
dialog: Huge fan.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Really? Oh, thanks... This is my

speaker_heading: MARIN - CLOSE

speaker_heading: ARIN
dialog: Thanks.
text: Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed
text: a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Thank you Doctor.
text: This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters
dialog: trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks.
speaker_heading: JULIAN

dialog: Green Tea beats everything plus
dialog: it's a great antioxidant. Cheers.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (turning on the charm)
dialog: So, urn, do you always work nights?
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Usually two or-three a week, gives
dialog: me a chance for a real life during
dialog: the day. . .
text: (immediately turns back to
dialog: Erica)
dialog: You know, I heard you had a place
dialog: in the Hamptons. I really am a very
dialog: big fan. I honestly think I've seen
dialog: every play you've ever written.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I think some were written before
dialog: your time. There are some Marin's
dialog: never even seen.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them
dialog: all and I saw the last one twice.
text: Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Doctor, we've got a walk in, may
dialog: need stitches. . .
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: (rises)
dialog: I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's
dialog: asleep; you all might want to get
text: some shut eye and come back in the
dialog: morning. Great to meet you Erica.
dialog: Ladies. . .
text: The Women wave and watch him exit.
text: The second he's gone:
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (to Marin)
dialog: Okay, now that's a perfect a guy
dialog: for you. He's adorable.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Mother! I've never seen a man less
dialog: interested in me.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Or more interested in you.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Me? He's thirty years old.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: No, he's older than that.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Who cares how old, he is. I mean,
dialog: he's not my type, he's like a
dialog: gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's
dialog: perfect for you and hot for you,
dialog: which makes him really perfect.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Stop it. He likes my work. Not me.
dialog: (they just stare at her)
dialog: It's insane. I would never.
dialog: (off Zoe's look)
dialog: Shut. Up.

speaker_heading: OE
dialog: Yuh-oh.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (rises)
dialog: Harry....
text: Confused, Harry turns around, a little lost, giving the Women
text: a FULL VIEW OF HIS BARE ASS. The Women muffle screams.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Harry! Over here!
text: He faces them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Honey, I want to go home. Can you
dialog: call Lowell to pick me up?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Lowell?
text: Harry wobbles. Is he going to fall? Marin freezes, looks to
text: her Mom for help. Erica rushes to Harry.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Harry, you have to get back in bed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Woman. And I say that as a
dialog: compliment... You saved my life.
dialog: (kisses her hand)
dialog: Soft.. .
dialog: ( then)
dialog: I don't remember your name but I
dialog: thank you from the bottom of my...
dialog: 32.
text: He falls on Erica, totally out of it, his head on her breast,
text: his mouth open.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (afraid to breathe)
dialog: Ugh. Look at this, even
text: unconscious, he's a lech.
text: The Nurses rush out and peel Harry off Erica.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Mr. Langer, you shouldn't be
dialog: standing.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Got to take a whiz girls.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: We'll take care of that for you,

text: Harry turns back to the Women, smiling. He likes that idea.
dialog: LOVES that idea.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay. You take care of it for me,
dialog: sweetheart. I'd like to see that...
text: As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a
text: desert sky.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: This is the most insane night of my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Yeah, but just admit that was one
dialog: great ass for a guy that age.
scene_heading: CLOSE - A LARGE VASE OF YELLOW ROSES - 36 HOURS LATER

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Now what can I do you for?

speaker_heading: LOWELL

dialog: Are we discharging Hurricane Harry?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Yes we are. Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.
dialog: Come on, I'll take you to him.
text: Julian EXITS the Nurse's Station. Lowell, carrying the

speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Fifteen years. Never a dull moment.
dialog: They arrive at:
speaker_heading: A PRIVATE ROOM

dialog: "Heart Attack -- Bouncing Back".
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Okay, Harry, looks like we're going
dialog: to have to let you go.
text: Harry sits up too fast, lies right back down. Lowell looks
text: like he might cry. The Girls hold back.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Take it easy kids, I just sat up
dialog: too fast. Doc, tell them. Am I in
dialog: good shape? How were my tests this
dialog: morning?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: He's doing extremely well.
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: (holding back tears)
dialog: Can I hug him?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug. Lowell's

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So, I'm some great date, huh?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Yeah... Mr. Excitement.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Tell me somethin', we haven't actually

speaker_heading: MARIN

scene_heading: EXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on

text: tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ...
dialog: (she stops)
dialog: Okay, now slow-ly.
text: To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by,

scene_heading: SCREEN GOES BLACK.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON JULIAN

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I ain't goin' back in there.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You don't have to but I can't put you in

speaker_heading: HARRY

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This is the best turkey sandwich I

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (rises)

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So you're not ready to show me any

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Well, I was just gonna drive into the

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (to Marin)
dialog: Wait wait wait wait. You're leaving, Zoe's

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: The morning? That's nineteen hours from

dialog: (takes a deep breath)
dialog: Okay, I can handle this. I'm just going

speaker_heading: ERICA

scene_heading: EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - SUNSET

text: Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: Smells great in here.
text: Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, I walked all the way in here,
text: only bumping into two chairs and an
dialog: ottoman.
speaker_heading: ERICA
text: Everyone bumps into that ottoman.
text: Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, thanks for letting me...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah, no...it's fine.
dialog: (answering the phone)

speaker_heading: HARRY

dialog: Oh, you got the flowers? Are they

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, can I call you in a little
dialog: bit. What's your number doll?
dialog: (spots a pad and pencil)
text: Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch
dialog: of the imagination, I think you're all
dialog: that right for my daughter but I don't
dialog: really appreciate hearing you on the
dialog: phone with other women. It's like I'm an
dialog: accomplice to you cheating, it's...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Your daughter knows I see other women.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: She does? I mean, fine, it's none
dialog: of my business...but...
dialog: (struggles to open a
dialog: bottle of wine)
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She knows I'm not monogamous...We've
dialog: discussed it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Great? And that's what? Why are you
dialog: proud of that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter
dialog: said she likes that about me.
text: (takes the wine and opens
dialog: it with ease.)
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: My daughter is confused when it comes to men.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't blame her. We're confusing.

text: answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What am I doing?
text: She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it.

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Can you hold a see, doll?
dialog: (looks to Erica)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Okay, here's the thing. I really don't
dialog: want to play the part of the uptight
dialog: Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you
dialog: want to have another heart attack, go
dialog: ahead, it's your life but I have work to
dialog: do and I don't have time to make another
dialog: run to the hospital because you're
dialog: filling your already clogged arteries
dialog: with smoke but more importantly, I'd
dialog: rather not have my house smell like a

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I have a question for you.
text: She waits. She doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What? Do I Hhave to say what?
speaker_heading: ARRY

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So you don't sleep?
speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Now seriously, why do you care what I

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just curious.
speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Listen, about last night.
speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: HARRY

text: Julian takes Harry's pulse.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (with secret glee)

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: That doesn't sound so uptight.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It was an accident. She thought I
dialog: was asleep, I thought her room was
dialog: the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You know what Freud said - there
dialog: are no accidents.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Trust me. This was an accident. Although,
dialog: why would she be walking around naked
dialog: when she knows I'm 20 feet away.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Why would you think her bedroom was
dialog: the kitchen?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It was dark, it was two in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: That could explain why she was walking
text: around naked. Deep breath...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know I've never seen a woman

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But it won't kill me when I do it, right?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And

text: Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad.
text: After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto
text: the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with
text: himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one

dialog: One more fine and I won't believe you.
text: The Phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, shoot, hold on...
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello. Hey...Oh, hi...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - JULIAN
text: Smitten. Just something about her. Watching her.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - ERICA
text: Not noticing, pouring water for her tea.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No, I'm finally getting to it...
text: Erica sees Julian sliding a slip of paper over to her. Looks
text: over at it. It's a piece of paper from his prescription pad.
dialog: On it is written...Have dinner with me tonight? Erica looks
text: up at him. Stunned. J
speaker_heading: ULIAN
dialog: (heading out)
dialog: Pick you up around seven?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: W-What about the patient?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Like he said, he doesn't need a
dialog: nurse.
text: We begin to hear strains of another French song.
scene_heading: INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - MUSIC OVER
text: Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD
dialog: player. As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this
text: attention from Julian has fueled her.
scene_heading: THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER
text: Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a
text: summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (yells, warning-like)
dialog: I'm Walking Around The house!
text: ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at
text: her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Listen, I've decided to get over the
dialog: whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we
dialog: don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Good, 'cause I've been hiding from
dialog: you all day.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I know. You want to come in?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't want to break your rhythm
dialog: or anything.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: That would be wishful thinking.
text: Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna
dialog: venture out there and go for a
dialog: short walk...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You up to that?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: My doctor recommended it. I gotta
dialog: build up to stairs and stuff like
dialog: that. You wouldn't want to join me?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: That means you don't want me to?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, I was asking if you wanted to.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, well, I would but...I don't
dialog: usually like to break once I've
dialog: started writing so I probably
dialog: shouldn't, not that a little fresh
dialog: air would hurt but...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's just a walk Erica, not a
dialog: marriage proposal.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You know my name.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up
text: on the internet.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY
text: Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only
text: two people on the beach.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: -- Did you know there are over eight
dialog: thousand websites that mention you?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: That can't be possible.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, it's true. I know everything
dialog: about you now. And not because of
dialog: last night, but...
speaker_heading: E
speaker_heading: RICA
dialog: Yeah, I understood. I actually
dialog: looked you up too. You grew up in
dialog: L.A., which I thought nobody did.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: You were the road manager for a group I
dialog: sorta never heard of, started your own
dialog: record label at 29, sold it at 45, then
dialog: started buying and selling boutique
dialog: companies then invested in a small record
dialog: company which you turned into the 2nd
dialog: largest Hip Hop label in the world.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's exhausting just hearing about it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I know, but the truth is, it goes
dialog: fast doesn't it?
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Like the blink of an eye.
text: Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then
dialog: another and another...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I noticed you have bowls of those
dialog: all over your house.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I know, I'm crazy, I just think
dialog: they're so beautiful...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But why do you only pick up the white
dialog: ones?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I don't only pick up the white ones.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, so you really are crazy.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I pick up only the white ones?
dialog: (looks in her hand)
dialog: Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm
dialog: controlling, unadventurous, what?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So you're as hard on yourself as
dialog: you are on everyone else.
text: Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down,
text: picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white
dialog: stones.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Something to remember me by.
dialog: 55.
text: Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: So can I ask you something Harry? What's
dialog: with all the young girls? I mean, what's
dialog: the story there, really?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I just like to travel light.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You just like to travel light? Oh,
dialog: please, what the hell does that mean?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Now see a thirty year old gets that.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You mean falls for that.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I mean, accepts it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: If that's what you want... a non
dialog: threatening woman, who won't get your
dialog: number, you get to run the show...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think our relationship is growing
dialog: by the way. Have you noticed?
text: There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get
dialog: out of the house. Now, you may notice,
text: interestingly, we're walking back toward
dialog: the house and its getting a little rocky
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Of course it's getting a little
dialog: rocky, we're talking about you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: See, I'll accept that slight
dialog: hostility because I'm enjoying your
dialog: company so much.
speaker_heading: T
text: hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks
text: up, daunted.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and
dialog: watch the sunset. You interested?
text: Erica checks her watch.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Big dinner date?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.
dialog: With your doctor.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not
dialog: too young for you, huh?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No, he's totally too young for me.
dialog: But we're just having dinner. It's
dialog: not a date.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Does he know that?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt
dialog: that he thinks of it that way.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you
dialog: may like it. Think of it this way -- he's
dialog: not threatening, won't get your number,
dialog: you get to run the show. You might have a
dialog: hell of a time.
text: Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.
scene_heading: THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN
text: And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope.
dialog: Dream Date.
text: AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR
text: is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Hey, look who's answering the door.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And look who's at the door.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Brought you something.
dialog: 57.
text: Julian hands him a take-out food box.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: A heart healthy dinner from our
dialog: cafeteria.
speaker_heading: ERICA (O.S.)
dialog: Hello...
text: Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress,
dialog: probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight.
text: Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You look beautiful.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Thank you.
text: Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (thrown)
dialog: We ready..?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Let me just see how Harry's doing.
dialog: It'll take two seconds. Har, have a
dialog: seat. .
speaker_heading: ANGLE - HARRY
text: sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One.
text: Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight
dialog: ahead.
scene_heading: WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS
text: as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and
text: her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh.
text: JULIAN furrows his brow.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What? That's not the face you want
dialog: to see your doctor making.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Your pulse is a little fast but
dialog: maybe you're just excited about
dialog: something.
text: Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I don't think so. I'm not excited
dialog: about anything.
text: Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
text: There it goes again. Racing.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Doc... Impossible!
text: Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Oh, there we go, now I feel better.
text: Back to normal.
text: Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a
text: pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them
scene_heading: OUT THE DOOR.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't
dialog: rush back for me and don't do anything I
dialog: wouldn't do.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Well that wouldn't leave us too
dialog: many options would it?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And do we wonder how she writes
dialog: that snappy repartee.
dialog: (whispers to Erica)
dialog: Let him pick up the check. It'll
dialog: make him feel older.
text: On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS
text: Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past
text: the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to
speaker_heading: M
text: his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:
speaker_heading: ARIN (O.S.)
dialog: Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave
dialog: a message and I'll call you back.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey, it's me...just sitting around
dialog: looking at your baby pictures...
dialog: Thinking about you...
dialog: 59.
text: He hangs up, dials another number.
scene_heading: ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and
dialog: Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -
text: Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as
dialog: funky as he wants.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old
dialog: old old Har...
text: Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages
text: around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens
text: it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck.
text: Harry smiles.
scene_heading: INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He
text: notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown
text: stone sits at the top of the pile.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (complimented)
dialog: Top of the heap...
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON JULIAN
text: Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a
text: ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the
dialog: first time in twenty-five years.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: -- So, when the land came up, I snatched it
dialog: and the house was built in record time and...
dialog: (blushing to death)
dialog: It's like a thousand degrees in here.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You know, they say doctors fall for
dialog: people who need rescuing, that we have a
dialog: need to take care of someone.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Really? I never heard that one.
dialog: (starts fanning herself
dialog: with the menu)
dialog: Julian, how old are you, like...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: -- Thirty-three.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years
dialog: older than you. More than twenty years
dialog: older than you.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You look fabulous.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Thank you but you know, I'm not sure
dialog: where you were headed with that thing you
dialog: were just saying, but in terms of us, you
dialog: just want to be friends, right?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Honestly? No.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Well, then, what is it that you...
dialog: want to be?
speaker_heading: J
speaker_heading: ULIAN
dialog: I think I'd embarrass you if I told
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I was embarrassed just getting
dialog: dressed to see you.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: This may surprise you but some
dialog: women consider me quite the guy.
dialog: I've never been married. I'm a
dialog: doctor. You wouldn't believe what
dialog: catnip that is for some women.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh yes I would. But, you don't like
dialog: girls your own age?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I do very much. But I've never met one
dialog: I've taken to quite like this and when
dialog: something happens to you that's never
dialog: happened to you before, don't you have to
dialog: at least find out what it is?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I suppose but, see, I don't date
dialog: all that much or all that well...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Oh, come on, you must beat them
text: away with a stick.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Now you're kidding, right? No, guys
dialog: my age, the ones I've met...well,
dialog: I'm not that regular a person and
dialog: they really like regular.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Men your age may be really stupid,
dialog: you ever think of that?
dialog: (takes her hand)
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yes I have. Many times.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
text: (looks from her hand to
dialog: her eyes)
dialog: There's something radically wrong with
dialog: the idea that no one loves you.
text: Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck.
text: Julian kisses her palm, then her.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I knew you'd smell good.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It's just...soap...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: How much is soap that smells like this?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I don't know. I got it at the market.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Erica, you're incredibly sexy.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No, swear to God, I'm not...
text: MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED
text: Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF
text: ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit. He
text: leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A
text: bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for
text: other evidence then hightails it out of there.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
text: Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to
text: reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his
text: way, then changes her mind and stops.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (yells)
dialog: I'm back...
speaker_heading: HARRY (O.S.)
dialog: You have fun?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It was interesting. So... Good night.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (yells)
dialog: 'Night...
scene_heading: INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She
text: hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a
text: message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?
speaker_heading: W
text: e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS.
dialog: She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing?
dialog: He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry.
dialog: Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date?
dialog: She types: I think so...
dialog: He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry?
text: Surprised, she types: I just had dinner.
dialog: He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: How does he know everything!
text: She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but,
dialog: I'm in my pjs.
dialog: He writes: Me too. Pajama party?
text: SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.
dialog: 63.
text: Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her
text: pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it,
text: takes out a bra, takes out a better bra.
text: IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it
dialog: than he has.
text: Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs
text: again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in
dialog: their pajamas.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We are cute...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: This is pretty unusual for me. I'm not
dialog: used to having sleepovers.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Me either.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Really? With your social life?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping.
dialog: Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Okay, good to know.
dialog: (heading for the kitchen)
dialog: So, what are you hungry for?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (joining her)
dialog: What are my choices? I mean I know you
dialog: think I'm not very discriminating but...
text: She looks through the fridge.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, God, what's the difference what I
dialog: think. I can't imagine what you think of
dialog: me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au
dialog: vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Pancakes.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You ever miss being married? I bet you
dialog: were great at it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not
dialog: that much anymore. Was one of us just
dialog: saying something interesting?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You said you can't imagine what I think
dialog: of you.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, right, but you don't have to answer
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be
dialog: curious but...'
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: will you tell me first why you only
dialog: miss being married at night?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (cracking eggs)
dialog: Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much
text: at night and the "alone" thing happens at
dialog: night and sleeping by myself took some
dialog: getting used to. But I got the hang of
dialog: it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the
dialog: bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have
text: a side when no one has the other side.
text: She starts mixing the batter.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay, now I'm convinced what I
dialog: think of you is right.
dialog: (Erica waits. . . )
dialog: You are a tower of strength.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (shoulders sagging)
dialog: Ughhhhhhhhhh... .
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Try not to rate my answer.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're like a thoroughbred in a world of
dialog: mutts. No, you know what you are, you're
text: like a great portrait over a fireplace.
dialog: Words have been invented to describe
dialog: women like you.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: ( fearful)
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Flinty and...Impervious.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: So you think I'm inhuman.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No. I think you're formidable.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: But cold and distant. Like I'm
text: frozen in some painting...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not at all. I think you're strength
dialog: defines you.
dialog: (sees how sensitive she
dialog: is)
dialog: But it's thrilling when your defenses are
dialog: down arid you're not isolated. That, I
dialog: believe, is your winning combo. A killer
dialog: combo actually.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: ... So I can't decide if you hate me or if
dialog: maybe you're the only person who ever got
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't hate you.
text: The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and
text: HIGH HEELS APPROACHING.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Hello?
text: Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding
text: a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Room service!
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What are you doing here at this hour?
dialog: 66.
text: Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one
text: of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths
text: down his hair. Erica catches all this.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (enters, kisses Erica)
dialog: I
dialog: had this big photography auction
dialog: tonight, then I went out with a
dialog: bunch of people, I checked my
dialog: messages and got this so sad
dialog: message from Harry so bored out
dialog: here. I thought I should come out
dialog: and at least see how he was doing.
dialog: (kisses Harry on the
dialog: cheek)
dialog: Thank you for the gorgeous flowers
dialog: by the way. They were so huge...
text: Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers.
text: Harry notes Erica's reaction.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: So how are you guys?
dialog: (sets down the Zabar's
dialog: bag)
dialog: Oh, this is too sweet. You're making
dialog: pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your
dialog: pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Don't be silly. You know I never
dialog: sleep and this one doesn't sleep
dialog: either. It's... .What's in the
dialog: bag?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (reaches into the bag)
text: A quart of matzoh ball soup for
dialog: Harry. I know it's not the remedy
dialog: for heart problems but it is low
dialog: cholesterol.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (hating to correct her)
dialog: But high sodium.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your
dialog: favorite raisin-bread. And for
dialog: me...
dialog: (reaches into the bag)
dialog: My favorite Vodka.
text: Marin's cell phone RINGS.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record
dialog: time. Everyone's still there?
text: Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches
text: her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut
text: and tosses it in her purse.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: So, Mar, now that you're here, why
dialog: don't you finish the pancakes and
dialog: I'll get back to work...
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Mom! I just got here, hold on.
text: She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: So your ex-husband stood me up
dialog: today. We were supposed to have
dialog: lunch at Barneys . He never showed
dialog: up. Was he always like this?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Honey, I don't know...
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: This is what happens after a couple
dialog: gets divorced, the kid inherits all
dialog: the problems. Not that I'm a kid.
dialog: (then to Harry, the flirt
dialog: in her coming back)
dialog: So how are you, how do you feel?
dialog: When can you go home?
text: Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She
text: picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I really am gonna do a little work.
dialog: . . you two catch up. . . and just
dialog: flip these Hin like two seconds.
speaker_heading: ARRY
dialog: You don't want pancakes anymore?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I, uh, I don't think I...I...
dialog: (looks at Marin so)
text: gorgeous, next to him
dialog: No. I don't.
dialog: 68.
text: Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes
text: following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's
text: face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first
text: she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of
dialog: jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how
dialog: perfect it is.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGEHAMPTON GENERAL STORE - DAY
text: Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket.
text: Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking
dialog: cherries.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: I'm breaking up with Harry.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Why? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: 'Cause I met someone else.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: In the two days you've been gone?
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a
dialog: thousand people everyday. Also, let's
dialog: face it, the guy's insanely old for me.
dialog: I'd be nuts to keep this going.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: True, but you know he is....
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: -- I know. He's soulful when you
dialog: don't expect it, right?
speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: ULIAN
dialog: I've waited a reasonable amount of hours

speaker_heading: MARIN

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: He just took care of it for me; He
dialog: was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate
dialog: was to be friends. ...Oh my God.
dialog: (realizes something)
dialog: He was breaking up with me. He's a

speaker_heading: ERICA

dialog: my arm.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No, I think she really did meet

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: ERICA

scene_heading: THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER

scene_heading: BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES
text: Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's
text: edge. They talk non-stop.
text: A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY
text: Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their
text: picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it
text: as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the
text: doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE
text: LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.
text: A MATCH IS STRUCK
text: and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica
text: turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of
text: them has time to think, they kiss.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (truly confused)
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I just kissed you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No, honey, I kissed you.
text: Relieyed, Erica kisses him.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I know that one was me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Try not to keep score.
text: He kisses her again and again.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Soft lips...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm so glad they still work.
dialog: I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more
dialog: like for wearing lipstick and whistling and...
text: He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him
text: back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, well, now look who's got
dialog: something that works...
text: They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: And you didn't even take Via-
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: (puts his finger on her
dialog: lips)
dialog: Kiss me before you make it go away.
speaker_heading: S
text: he kisses him long and sweet.
speaker_heading: ERICA'S BED
text: They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as
text: the sun goes down.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This could be world class
dialog: interesting.
dialog: (Erica nods)
dialog: Having any doubts?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (as they kiss)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: But so far the kissing is
dialog: spectacular.
dialog: (He looks at her)
dialog: I'm not grading you, just
text: mentioning it. Brilliant.
text: He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way.
text: He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can't get past your damn
dialog: turtleneck. . .
text: He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he
text: doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when
text: Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer,
text: takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Cut it off... Please.
text: What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts
text: cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso,
text: between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the
text: center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and
text: it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're beautiful.
text: She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
dialog: (she opens her eyes)
dialog: Beautiful...
text: They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What about birth control?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Menopause.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Who's the lucky boy...
text: He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and
text: OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist
dialog: for her. Then:,
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I think we should take your blood
dialog: pressure.
text: His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It's irresponsible not to.
speaker_heading: H
scene_heading: ARRY -' A MINUTE LATER
text: sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the
text: blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm
text: Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking
dialog: his head...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nobody but you would. . .
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah...so you're lucky.
text: Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.
speaker_heading: ERICA

dialog: One twenty over eighty!!! Baby!
scene_heading: THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF - IN SLOW MOTION

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
text: The rain is coming down in torrents.
speaker_heading: INSIDE
text: We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the
text: side of the bed. She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh my God, I do like sex.
text: CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby,
text: catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You certainly do.
text: Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Wow. So this is what you're supposed to
dialog: do on a rainy afternoon...
text: Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but
text: something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there
text: quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry
text: slowly, nervously turns to her.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I really thought I was sorta closed for
dialog: business. Just never expected this.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Nothin's ever surprised me more...
text: Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around
text: her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This is crazy. I can't remember the last
dialog: time I cried. I think I'm overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (crying with him)
dialog: Me too. That's the perfect word.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Baby, I had sex three days after a heart
dialog: attack and I didn't die!
text: Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's gotta be some kind of record.
text: Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (wiping her tears)
dialog: Let's not brag about this to our
dialog: doctor, okay?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Honey I may not be many things but one -
dialog: thing I am is a gentleman.
text: Harry holds her close.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Erica, Erica, Erica.
dialog: (she turns to him)
dialog: You know I'm not good at being
dialog: monogamous, right?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Monogamous? Please, I hardly know
dialog: you.
text: He looks at her wondering if she's for real. She smiles as
text: she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. Then he
text: kisses her.
scene_heading: LATER - THEY'RE HUDDLED UNDER THE COVERS
speaker_heading: C
text: ozy. Candles light the room. It's still raining.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: -- So there I was at nineteen, in New
dialog: York, by myself, and I'd never seen snow
dialog: before and I didn't have enough money for
dialog: the bus, so I had to walk. Had no idea
dialog: how far it was and I'm talking blizzard
dialog: and I'm in sneakers.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Awwwww,. . .
scene_heading: LATER - THEY'RE LYING ON A CHAISE
text: in Erica's room, making out. A Cell Phone RINGS. They both

speaker_heading: ERICA

dialog: Hello.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH MARIN IN A TAXI IN THE CITY - IT'S POURING

dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: MARIN

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh, that. Oh, no, we're fine...
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Are you having sex? Tell the truth.
dialog: You are, aren't you.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Absolutely not. No. That is not

speaker_heading: MARIN

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: MARIN

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Really? Marin's selling aluminum siding?

speaker_heading: LATER
text: Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I just always wanted to write a play that
dialog: ended there.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: People need romance like that. And if
dialog: someone like me doesn't write it, where
dialog: they gonna get it? Real life?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (slightly insulted)
dialog: Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It's a great city to stay up all
dialog: night in.

dialog: When's your birthday?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: February.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Mine's in January. So, how 'bout if we
dialog: still know each other by then we go to
dialog: Paris for our birthdays.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: Maybe. . .
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Oh. Sorry. You just...
text: (sees the look on his
dialog: face) .
dialog: I have no idea how to do this...be
text: intimate but not...The color is draining
dialog: from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna

dialog: then when I get back, let's not talk
dialog: anymore.
dialog: 79.
text: She gets out of bed.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're the funniest girl I ever had
dialog: sex with.
text: She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: That's somethin'...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Honey... ?
text: She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think I'm gonna go back to my
dialog: room...let you sleep.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Let me sleep? Oh, right...you usually
dialog: send the girls home. . .but I am home...
dialog: so...okay.
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Hey, it's perfectly. .. whatever.
dialog: Good night. This was..This was a
dialog: great night. For me...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Me too. At one point I even thought
dialog: soul mates, you know...
text: Erica nods. She knows.
text: HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED
text: stares straight up at the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a
text: second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves
text: to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her
text: eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in
text: the doorway.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'd like to try sleeping with you.
dialog: I
dialog: 80.
text: Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as
text: Harry climbs in next to her we:
speaker_heading: FADE THRU TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - THE FOLLOWING MORNING
text: The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.
scene_heading: HNT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME
text: arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms
text: snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room
text: is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on
dialog: full blast.
text: Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm
text: around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of
text: day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: (grabs his watch, blinks)
dialog: Can you see this?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Not really but it looks like it
dialog: says eleven.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (slips on his glasses)
dialog: It is eleven...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It can't be, that would mean we
dialog: slept eight hours.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Impossible.
text: They turn and finally look at each other. Both look wrinkled,
text: messy haired, a little wiped.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How ya doin' Ace?

speaker_heading: ERICA

dialog: have ,the best maple syrup ever. '
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Erica...
dialog: (she turns)
dialog: You are a woman to love.
text: Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman
dialog: who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up
text: for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she
text: exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten
text: off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You are woman to love. What the
dialog: hell does that mean?
speaker_heading: AN EKG MACHINE
text: Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to Julian at the end of the
text: tape. Harry sits on an examining table in JULIAN'S OFFICE,
text: buttoning up his shirt.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Okay, buddy, I'm sending you home. These
dialog: past few days have done wonders for you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, I've been working on that stair
dialog: thing. I can do it by the way.
speaker_heading: J
speaker_heading: ULIAN
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (quickly)
text: Climb a flight of stairs. Several times
dialog: actually.
text: Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Way to go. How's Erica?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (caught)
dialog: Erica?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I know you must know her name by

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes, I do. Erica, as it turns out
dialog: is an amazing woman. Does whatever
dialog: she can to make me happy. Really.
dialog: Turns out she's very giving.
text: Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Very giving.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: Yeah, well that's wonderful. I
dialog: think she's wonderful.

dialog: road.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think she's wonderful too.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: (gathering his things)
dialog: Give her my best...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Julian. Thanks for everything.
text: Julian shakes Harry's hand. Harry's eyes TEAR UP.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You're gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (touching his tears)
dialog: What the...? This is the second
dialog: time I've done this now. I get
dialog: overcome or something. . .
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: It's very common to become emotional
dialog: after having an episode like you've had.
text: Everything takes on a new meaning.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (wiping his tears)
dialog: So it's not crazy for a man to do
dialog: something entirely out of character
dialog: after having a heart attack?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: (handing him Kleenex)
dialog: Like crying?
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah and totally changing their
dialog: tastes. Like suddenly really liking
dialog: something they never thought they
dialog: could like...ever...and I'm talking
dialog: really liking it. It's...unnerving.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I think you can expect just about
dialog: anything right now. People have done some
dialog: wild things after having a heart
dialog: attack...selling businesses, getting
dialog: divorced, moving... Some people say it
dialog: saved their lives.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: But most people go back to being
dialog: themselves, right? I'll go back to
dialog: being me, won't I?
speaker_heading: J
speaker_heading: ULIAN
dialog: We'll see.

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (slipping on her dress)
dialog: Mom, you want to know the answer to

dialog: always with the wrong guy? This is
dialog: why. Because the wrong guy can't do

dialog: with the wrong guy. This thing I'm
dialog: feeling right now. This is my big
dialog: fear...that some guy could get me
dialog: unglued like this, like nothing's

dialog: Why did you order her a Martini?
speaker_heading: E

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What? It's not true? The man can not

scene_heading: A COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES

text: walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.
speaker_heading: M
scene_heading: OVING IN ON ERICA
text: as the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Mom, you okay?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah, fine.
text: Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry.
text: His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry

speaker_heading: RICA
dialog: You know what? Maybe I need a little
dialog: air...
text: Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as

text: stands right at his table. He smiles up at her.
speaker_heading: HARRY

scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Hello?
text: Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (walking quickly)

dialog: She considers it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Harry, I gotta go...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Erica, she's just a friend.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind
dialog: of a girl.

text: Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on, it's just a dinner...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Look, Harry, here's the problem. I
dialog: really like you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I really like you.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah, but I love you like you.
dialog: (that stops him)
dialog: I do. I love you.
text: Harry swoons and not in a good way.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think maybe you should consider
dialog: that you're in love with the idea
dialog: of being in love.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: ERICA
speaker_heading: D
dialog: o you? Okay. Oh, God...
dialog: (stomps her feet)
dialog: I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.
dialog: (tries not to cry in front
dialog: of him)
dialog: I've never been the dumb girl
dialog: before. It ain't so great.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Let's just calm down. This was just
text: a a meal with a friend.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: -- Did you know I called you seven
dialog: hours ago?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I was gonna call you. I've been jamming
dialog: all day, it's my first day back.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Uh-huh. . .
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I had these plans before I met you. But I
dialog: do like seeing you. I do. I'm always
text: surprised by it.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What was I thinking?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Maybe you weren't thinking for once and
dialog: look what a good time we had. Let's not
dialog: ruin something great.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Harry, I won't be good at this.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: At what?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Acting like I don't care.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I have never lied to you. I have always
dialog: told you some version of the truth.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (freaking on that one)
dialog: The truth doesn't have versions.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can you cut me a little slack? My
dialog: life's been turned upside down.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah. Mine too.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Then let's each get our bearings.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I don't want my bearings. I've had my
dialog: bearings my whole fucking life. I felt
dialog: something with you that... Oh, you don't
dialog: want to-
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes I do.
dialog: (she won't open up)
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I felt something with you, I didn't know
dialog: really existed. You know what that's like
dialog: after a twenty year marriage? To feel
dialog: something for another person that's so
dialog: off the charts, that -
dialog: (Harry looks down)
dialog: Okay, not your problem. This is why
dialog: I'm not good in relationships. You
dialog: know writers are like teachers,
dialog: those who can - do, those who can't
dialog: - write romantic comedies where
dialog: THIS does not happen in the third
dialog: act...and it certainly does not
text: happen to a 55 year old woman. In
dialog: the play I'll be 36 so it won't be
dialog: as pathetic. I'm just too old to
dialog: feel crushed.I've written this
dialog: feeling but I never really got it.
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: You know what this is?
dialog: (pointing to herself)
dialog: This is heart broken. How's that
dialog: for impervious?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're killin' me.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I just wish it had lasted more than a
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Me too.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: That's a horrible thing to say.
dialog: (walks off, comes back)
dialog: The life I had before I met you. I
dialog: knew how to do that, could do that
dialog: forever. Now look at me...what do I
dialog: do with all this?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can we talk tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What for? I saw your friend you were
dialog: having dinner with, if that's what you
dialog: want, it's never going to work with me.
dialog: Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman,
dialog: don't let this brown hair fool you, I
dialog: don't have a real brown hair on my head,
dialog: I'm almost all grey...that would freak
dialog: you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high
dialog: cholesterol and my back hurts every
dialog: morning and I'm post menopausal and I
dialog: have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis
dialog: is just around the corner and I know
dialog: you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face
dialog: it man, that's not quite the buzz you're
dialog: lookin' for.
text: A TAXI pulls up.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: And you know what? Everyday, I'm
dialog: gettin' older. ..just like you.
text: Erica opens the back door of the Taxi.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wait.
text: Erica turns.
dialog: This is his chance.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I just... the truth is... I don't
dialog: know how to be a boyfriend.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: That's what you have to say after all
dialog: this? You don't know how to be a
dialog: boyfriend.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's not a small thing.
dialog: They're both out of words.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Are we done?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't know.
text: She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it
text: PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (winces)
dialog: Ouch.
text: He grabs his heart.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh, God...
scene_heading: HARRY - ON A GURNEY

speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can

speaker_heading: DR. MARTINEZ
dialog: Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you
dialog: heard?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I
dialog: never got any.
speaker_heading: DR. MARTINEZ
dialog: (confused at how literal
dialog: he is)
dialog: All right, well you're battin' a thousand
dialog: here. Your enzymes look perfect, your
text: EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound
dialog: like the kind of pain we worry about. I
dialog: think what you experienced was normal
dialog: chest pain associated with stress.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stress?
speaker_heading: DR. MARTINEZ
dialog: And incase you haven't heard, that can
dialog: give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I

speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: No we're not. You feeling okay?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't think I've slept one night
dialog: since I've been home. Every little
text: ache and pain scares the shitout of
dialog: me...can't get a handle on my
dialog: emotional life, don't know what I
dialog: want, don't know if what I felt was
dialog: because I just had a heart attack
dialog: or was real. Plus, I feel needy. I
dialog: never used that word in my life.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Lowell, have you ever seen me like
dialog: this? Be honest.
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Nothing even close.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's right, buddy, I'm a mess.
dialog: And I'm no good at it.
dialog: (realizes something)
dialog: Those are very nice pajamas, by the
dialog: way. Did they used to be mine?
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Yes but you gave them to me, you
dialog: said you never wore them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I know. But why would I do that?
dialog: They're so elegant. Nice piping...
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Mr. Langer, you're always giving
dialog: away beautiful things.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Awwwww... How did I get like this?
dialog: (eyes fluttering shut)
dialog: I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Are you crying?

dialog: I didn't know you did that.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah, it's my new thing. I've

speaker_heading: MARIN
text: (sitting on the step with
dialog: her)
dialog: Is it Harry?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Seems I gotta learn how to do that
dialog: love 'em and leave 'em stuff.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Fucking men. You don't care when I
dialog: say fuck, do you?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Not really. Sometimes. Not right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: So now you get my theory about
dialog: love? You gotta self protect. It's
dialog: too dangerous.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Marin, that theory... how can I put
dialog: this so your feelings won't get
dialog: hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes
dialog: me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: And how would you put it if you
dialog: wanted to hurt my feelings?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Listen to me... you cannot hide
dialog: from love for the rest of your life
dialog: because maybe it won't work out and
dialog: maybe you'll become unglued. That's
dialog: not a way to live.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: So you're telling me you're happy
dialog: right now? This is good what
dialog: happened to you?
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No. This was bad. But for the three days
dialog: it was good, it was electrifying.
text: Marin's eyes fill up.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I think you must consider the possibility
dialog: that we are more alike than you realize.
dialog: I let someone in and I had the time of my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: (tearful)
dialog: I've never had the time of my life.
speaker_heading: ERICA

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm embarrassed. I just haven't
dialog: been myself lately. What can I say?
speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: ERICA

dialog: There's this totally hilarious scene
dialog: where she's dating this like chauvinist
text: older guy and just as they're about to do
text: it, the guy moans and she thinks he's
dialog: just really into her, right? Except he's

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No, it's about me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Am I in it?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: A guy like you is in it but he's
dialog: not you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What happens to this guy who's
dialog: ..not me?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Haven't totally decided. He can
dialog: live or he can die.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are you leaning towards?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Death.
dialog: (Harry reacts)
dialog: It's funnier.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He dies of a funny heart attack?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: He's sort of a schmuck who screwed
dialog: around with our heroine, so it
dialog: won't be too sad.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Schmucks are people too you know. Death
dialog: doesn't seem a little harsh?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I just went where the story took
dialog: me. It's a work of fiction, Harry.
dialog: Really...just stuff I made up.
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: (approaching)
dialog: Erica, we're ready to do the

dialog: 110.
text: Erica nods, horrified.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So I'm going to be the laughing stock of
dialog: Broadway.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Harry, he's not you. He's a version
dialog: of the truth of you. So to speak.
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants
dialog: to know, when Henry says, "I love ya",
dialog: you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You',
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Right.
text: We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know it isn't like I wanted to stop

dialog: want all or nothing?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I don't know, we're just goofy when it
dialog: comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all
dialog: right with you, I'd like to be friends
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm not ready to be your friend. How's
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Fine. I understand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Anyway, do you actually buy that horse
dialog: shit.. .that men and women can be friends
dialog: once they've had sex?
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm friends with my ex-husband, but then
dialog: again, we didn't just have sex.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We didn't just have sex either.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Then what was it? Love to know.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it
dialog: out?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: This is perfect. I have given the `Can't
dialog: We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I
dialog: think I invented the 'Can't We Be
dialog: Friends' speech. But you know what,now I
dialog: get why they never went for it. You dames
dialog: got one thing right. Sometimes sex does
dialog: change everything. Call me crazy, but I
dialog: just don't see us out on the town, being
dialog: pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you
dialog: anything, at some point, one of us will
dialog: have very unfriend like thoughts about
text: the other then pass the bread becomes
dialog: anything but pass the bread. You get what
dialog: I'm saying?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You don't want to be friends.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not "don't". Can't. Can't be friends.
dialog: Doesn't work that way.
dialog: (tries to calm down)
dialog: Okay, I'm moving into another phase of
dialog: this thing. I'm mad at you.
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: It almost feels good.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I think I'm mad at you too.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Excellent. 'Cause I don't like
dialog: thinking about you so much and
dialog: worrying about how you are and if I
dialog: ruined your life or...
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: -- You've worried about me?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to
dialog: die, worries about you.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: HARRY(cont'd)
dialog: Sometimes worrying about you feels like a
dialog: full time job.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Well, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't
dialog: have to work that shift anymore.
dialog: Again, The Stage Manager...
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER

speaker_heading: WOMAN JOGGER
dialog: You never change, do you?
text: Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman. She drinks
text: from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile. She's
text: adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Do you know me or are you just talking to
dialog: me as "man" in general, the beast women
dialog: love to hate.
speaker_heading: WOMAN JOGGER
dialog: No, no, I know you Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh. Don't tell me. I dated your daughter.
dialog: (the Woman laughs)
dialog: Right? I broke her heart then she married
text: some hard working Joe on the rebound, has
dialog: three great kids. What is so funny?
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: WOMAN JOGGER
dialog: You dated me and you broke my heart but
dialog: after you I met the right guy. I've been
dialog: married thirty-seven years, have four
dialog: kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the
dialog: way.
text: Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I dated you. .?
dialog: (the Woman nods)
dialog: Did we. ever...?
speaker_heading: WOMAN JOGGER
dialog: No...we did not.
text: He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her.
speaker_heading: HARRY

dialog: got my doctorate in marine biology,
dialog: went around the world a few times,
dialog: met the man of my dreams at Oxford,
dialog: married him, we lived in London for
dialog: 25 years. I wrote and taught, we
dialog: raised 3 sons and a daughter. I've
dialog: just finished my ninth book and now
dialog: I'm training for my first marathon.
dialog: Now, I must confess, I actually
dialog: remember the very last thing you
dialog: ever said to me.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: SANDRA(cont'd)
dialog: You walked me to my door, I was
dialog: tearful and you looked at me with
dialog: those puppy dog eyes and said,
dialog: "Honey, I just don't know how to be
dialog: a boyfriend." Now, tell me, what
dialog: have you been up to since 1964?
text: OVER Harry's face, we HEAR the SOUND of a SIREN BLARING.

speaker_heading: DR. MARTINEZ
dialog: Your realize a severe anxiety attack can

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So I'm nuts? Perfect! The one thing
dialog: I'm not taking pills for.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: DR. MARTINEZ
dialog: If you don't want ,to end up in here

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So the guy in the play, he doesn't

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: MARIN
dialog: Yeah, well...
speaker_heading: HARRY
