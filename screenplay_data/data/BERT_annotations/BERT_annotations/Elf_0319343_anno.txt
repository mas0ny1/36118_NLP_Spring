scene_heading: CU: A MODERN-LOOKING CHRISTMAS BOOK ENTITLED: ELF
text: A Christmas book entitled "ELF" sits on a table, a drawing of 6'2" BUDDY THE ELF (the guy we've seen from all the trailers and posters) is on the cover.
text: We push in on the book and it magically flips open to the first page: a drawing of small Papa Elf in his wonderful work shop.
scene_heading: INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
text: PULL OUT FROM THE BOOK TO REVEAL
text: The real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing we have just seen. PAPA ELF, 540 years old or roughly 55 in human years, is surrounded by scores of strange and specific tools and some scattered half-built toys.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: So you're here for the story? Okay. Just let me wet my whistle.
text: He pours himself a shot of milk in a snow-flake shot glass and downs it.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: (like it's liquor)
text: Whoo! That's strong! Must be two percent! Elves love to tell stories, you probably didn't know that, did you? Well, there's a lot of things about us that people don't know. For instance, we can't tell a lie. It's physiologically impossible. Here's another interesting Elf-ism: There are three jobs available to an Elf. You can make shoes at night while an old cobbler sleeps...but it's not exactly the most rewarding work.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT AWAY TO
text: Two ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of "Hot Cobbler" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.
speaker_heading: DISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF
dialog: Lazy bastard couldn't even make a flip-flop...
speaker_heading: EXT. ELF TREE - DAY
text: The exterior of a tree, we hear cooking going on inside.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF (V.O.)
dialog: ...you can bake cookies in a tree. But it's dangerous having an oven in an oak during dry season...
text: We hear a yelp and now a siren rings and then the TREE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, ELVES SCURRYING OUT.
scene_heading: INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: But the third job. Well, the third job makes being an Elf worthwhile. Some call it "the show" or the "big dance". It's the profession every Elf aspires to. And that's to build toys in Santa's workshop.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A TRACKING SHOT OF SANTA'S WORKSHOP
text: The CAMERA whips by a crowd of bustling elves building dolls, toy horses, action figures, squirt guns...everything. There's even a row of X-boxes being assembled.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: It's a job only an Elf can do. Our nimble fingers, natural cheer and active minds are perfect for toy building. They've tried using Gnomes or Trolls but the Gnomes drank too much and the Trolls weren't toilet trained.
speaker_heading: CUT AWAY:
text: 1) A drunk GNOME, stein in hand, vomiting below the table. 2) A TROLL wearing a diaper is chewed out by an Elf cleaning up the floor.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
text: And no human could ever do this work. Their hands are too big and they tend to get testy when over worked. In fact, no human has ever set foot in Santa's workshop. That is until about thirty years ago. And in case you haven't guessed it, that's our story. It was back in 1968. A particularly successful Christmas...
speaker_heading: INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
text: A Christmas tree flickers. A nurse changes a giggling ten month-old BABY's diaper.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You're quite a giggler, aren't you?
dialog: (lying him down)
dialog: Well, it's time for night-night.
text: She tucks the baby in and exits.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (as she leaves)
dialog: Merry Christmas, my angel.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: The Rocking Crib. The BABY rises, giggling. His eyes light up as he stands, holding the gate of the crib.
text: Santa's black boots drop in from the chimney. The baby shakes the gate. Quickly, Santa moves to the Christmas tree, where he lays out presents. There is an OFF-SCREEN CLANG! Santa LOOKS UP and sees the empty crib. The gate is down:
speaker_heading: BABY'S POV
text: He gleefully skitters across the floor towards a large, fuzzy teddy bear in SANTA'S BIG RED BAG.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP
text: A bevy of ELVES with slightly larger 60's Elf collars and sideburns celebrate another successful Christmas. Several elves start CHANTING for a speech. SANTA, seated in his rocker, stands to applause. Merrily, he gestures for quiet.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Alright, alright...Well, we've had another successful year. Prancer was able to control his bladder over Baltimore, and we didn't forget Delaware...
text: A party HORN blows. LAUGHTER. Santa cheerfully pats down with his hands for quiet.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: And now after a lot of hard work it's time for a vacation, starting now!
text: Santa looks at his watch as five seconds click off. The elves all rest their heads on their elbows.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Alright! Vacation's over! Back to work! Time to start preparations for next Christmas.
text: The elves cheer and get back to work. When an OFF-SCREEN COOING is heard.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: What in the name of Sam Hill...?
text: More COOING. Perplexed, Santa looks down to his bag just as a human baby, dressed only in a diaper, crawls out and smiles.
text: Silence. The elves stare in awe at the strange visitor. An ELF looks on the back of his diaper and sees the brand name "Little Buddy Diapers".
speaker_heading: ELF TWIN #2
dialog: It's name is Buddy. He must've...
speaker_heading: ELF TWIN #1
dialog: ...snuck into your sack at the orphanage. What do we do, Santa?
dialog: Santa looks befuddled.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF (V.O.)
dialog: Santa had a decision to make. But fortunately when it comes to babies, Santa's a push over. So Buddy would stay with an older Elf who had always wanted a child, but had been so committed to building toys, he had forgotten to settle down. Yes, Buddy was raised by me, his adopted father. My, how I love that boy.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE: BUDDY GROWING UP AS AN ELF
text: A giant baby is wedged into an extra-tiny crib.
text: Super 8 home movie of Papa Elf holding a two-year old baby that is almost as big as he is.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF (V.O.)
dialog: Tough Buddy grew twice as fast, he wasn't any different from the other little elves. I mean, not really...
text: Video Footage: of 7-year old Buddy riding a really small tricycle around in circles at a birthday party with a laughing Elf child on his back and another Elf under his arm.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF (V.O.)
dialog: And though it is against the Code of Elves to lie, all agreed that until Buddy asked us, no one was going to bring up the fact that he was actually a human being.
text: A series of Polaroid photos showing Buddy, 12, dunking a basketball over three elves.
text: Buddy in Elf school, wedged in a tiny desk. The ELF TEACHER is pointing to the black board where "THE CODE OF ELVES" is written.
speaker_heading: ELF TEACHER
dialog: And before we learn how to build the latest in extreme graphic chipset processors, let's recite the Code of the Elves, shall we? Number one?
speaker_heading: ELF STUDENTS
speaker_heading: TREAT EVERY DAY LIKE CHRISTMAS!
speaker_heading: ELF TEACHER
dialog: Number two?
speaker_heading: ELF STUDENTS
text: THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE ON THE NICE LIST!
speaker_heading: ELF TEACHER
dialog: Number three?
dialog: We push in on Buddy as he recites...
speaker_heading: BUDDY & EVERYONE
dialog: THE BEST WAY TO SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER IS SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR!
scene_heading: EXT. ELF HOCKEY POND - CURRENT DAY - DAY
text: An ANNOUNCER ELF is on a megahorn, doing play by play of an elf hockey team...
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: (on megaphone)
text: Lum Lum across the line, feeds it to Foom Foom, behind the net, looking, feeds Blinky...Wait! Rimpo-correction, Wombo. I think...and - uh-oh! - here comes BUDDY!
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS
text: A smiling Buddy pounds tiny elves into the boards with brute force. The elves are helpless. Buddy finishes this off with a wicked slap-shot.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: (like an elf Pat Foley)
dialog: He SCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORES! And it's 14-zero with eleven minutes left in the first period.
speaker_heading: INT. ELF LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Post game, Buddy's in the locker room. Elves congratulate him and occasionally reach up to slap him on the butt.
speaker_heading: POM POM
dialog: Good game, Buddy.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Thanks! Sorry about your shoulder, Pom Pom!
speaker_heading: POM POM
dialog: No sweat. It's just a collar bone!
text: They're all tossing their jock straps in the bin. Little Elf jocks land, and then a HUGE ONE, proportionately the size of a large serving tray. It's Buddy's.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF (V.O.)
dialog: But as much as Buddy was accepted by his friends and family, there were drawbacks to being a human in an elves' world.
speaker_heading: RAPID FIRE:
text: A dozen shots of Buddy slamming his face into doorways, beams, cabinets. These shots look shockingly painful.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles dickens! Sone of a nutcracker!
speaker_heading: INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
text: The FINALE: Buddy attempts to put a star on top of the semi-tall Elf Christmas tree.
text: But Buddy's pointy Elf slipper gets hung up in an ornament.
text: The elves step back, preparing for the inevitable: Buddy panics, wiggles his leg and pulls the tree over on top of him, falling into the fire place and engulfing in flames.
dialog: Pom Pom sprays him with a mini-fire extinguisher.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF (V.O.)
dialog: And no where were Buddy's differences more obvious than in Santa's toy shop.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
text: We see an assembly line of elves making Etch-a-sketches with wooden hammers. We pan finally to Buddy as an ELF SUPERVISOR APPROACHES.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Gee, I'm sorry, Ming-Ming. I'm gonna come in a little short on my quota today.
speaker_heading: ELF SUPERVISOR
dialog: It's okay, Buddy. How many Etcha-Sketches did you get finished?
text: Buddy is about to answer. But then his face winces up. FIGHTING BACK TEARS.
speaker_heading: ELF SUPERVISOR
dialog: How many, Buddy? It's okay, you can tell me.
text: Clearly tearing up now, Buddy sets his tiny wooden hammer to the side and reveals a box of his toys.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I only made...
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Eighty-five.
dialog: Eighty-five? He might as well have said zero. The elves all look at each other.
speaker_heading: ELF SUPERVISOR
dialog: Oh, don't worry about it Buddy. This is a great start! You're only 915 off pace.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Oh, why don't you just say it Ming Ming?! I'm the worst toy maker in the whole world! I'm a cotton-head ninny-muggins!
speaker_heading: ELF SUPERVISOR
dialog: Oh, you're not a cotton-head ninny muggins! We all have different talents, that's all.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Actually, it seems like everyone has the same talents. Except for me.
speaker_heading: ELF SUPERVISOR
dialog: That's not true, you have lots of talents. Special talents. Like, uh...
text: Supervisor Elf looks around to the other Elves for back up. They try to chime in.
speaker_heading: ELF #1
dialog: You changed the batteries in the fire alarm!
speaker_heading: ELF #2
dialog: (absurdly positive)
dialog: You sure did! Triple A's! And in six months, you'll need to check 'em again! Won't he!
dialog: (everyone agrees)
speaker_heading: ELF #3
dialog: And you're the only baritone in the Elf choir. Without you, we'd sound like a bunch of...I mean, you bring us down a whole octave!
speaker_heading: ELF #1
dialog: In a good way!
speaker_heading: ELF SUPERVISOR
dialog: See? You're not a cotton-head ninny muggins. You're Ex-traordinary!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Well, you know what? I'm sick of being extraordinary!
text: Upset, Buddy struggles to get his thighs out from under his desk, and now runs off, tagging his head on the door frame.
scene_heading: INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
text: Buddy storms into his tiny house. Papa Elf looks up from his work, surprised. Buddy can't speak. He runs over and locks himself in the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. ELF BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: This bathroom is ABSURDLY SMALL, Buddy squeezes in like Harry Houdini. The toilet is the size of a Big Gulp cup. Buddy sits on it and starts to sob. Washing his face in the tiny sink.
speaker_heading: KNOCK KNOCK.
dialog: We INTERCUT with Papa Elf at the door.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Son? Are you okay?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Go away!
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Buddy!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'm sorry, papa. May I please have some Buddy time?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Open up, son. I think we need to talk.
text: The door finally creeks open, revealing a funny wide shot of him squeezed into this box of a room. He wiggles out. Still wiggling.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Come sit with your papa.
text: Papa sits on the couch, Buddy sits on Papa Elf's knee. Papa winces.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Alright, let's hear it.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Well, everyone knows you're Santa's Master Tinker. And Grandpapa was Master Tinker before you. And great Grandpapa before ye. I'm supposed to follow in your footsteps...but I'm always letting everyone down.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Well, there's something I should probably tell you, Buddy. And it's long over due...
dialog: (intense beat)
dialog: You see...um...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What is it, Papa?
text: Papa Elf looks into Buddy's beautifully innocent eyes. He can't bring himself to do it.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: I need your help on something.
dialog: (adjusting Buddy's weight)
dialog: Up up now, nice and -- ow, OW!... There we are.
text: Papa Elf leads Buddy through a door to reveal the most amazing sight Buddy has ever beheld.
speaker_heading: SANTA'S SLEIGH
text: A GLOW emanates from the hand-rubbed, red-lacquered wood chassis, illuminating the entire room.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Wow. Santa's sleigh!
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Can I touch it?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Touch it? You're going to help me make it fly, Buddy.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I thought the magical reindeer made the sleigh fly.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: And where do the reindeers get their magic from?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Christmas spirit. Everyone knows that.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Yes, but unfortunately, Christmas Spirit is becoming a very limited resource.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: (hard to break the news)
dialog: Well, Buddy, as silly as it sounds, there are a lot of people down South who don't believe in Santa Claus.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: What? Who do they think puts all their toys under the tree?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: There's a rumor floating around that parents are putting them there.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That's ridiculous! There's no way parents could do that all in one night! And what about Santa's cookies!? I suppose parents eat them too?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: I know...but every year less and less people are believing in Santa, and today we've got a real energy crisis on our hands. See how low the Claus-o-meter is?
text: We see a gauge on the instrument panel of the sleigh with CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LEVELS written and a needle resting in the DANGEROUSLY LOW red section.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: That's why I installed this little baby back in the sixties.
text: Papa pushes a RED BUTTON, causing a JET ENGINE to shudder with a high-pitched whir. Buddy is amazed.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Oh my Gosh!
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Watch the language son.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Forgive me, Papa. What's that?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
text: A Viper turbojet with 358 cubic meters of displacement, high volume air intake and customized spark timing.
dialog: (off Buddy's look)
dialog: I know, it's a little less magical, but everyone's still getting their wish, that's the important thing, right?
dialog: (around him)
dialog: Listen, the motor mounts are giving me some wiggle. Do you want to give the ol' man a hand?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (coming around)
dialog: Do I?!
dialog: And just like that, father and son hunker down and tinker together.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - TOY TESTING - THE NEXT DAY
text: We push past a tiny door marked TESTING. Elves everywhere are testing toys. Buddy stands in front of a conveyor belt pushing Jack in the Boxes past him. He turns the crank producing the 'POP GOES THE WEASEL' tune and a puppet pops out scaring him every time. POP!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ahh!
dialog: Another one: POP!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
speaker_heading: UHHHH!
dialog: This one doesn't pop for a beat and then: POP!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (biggest one yet)
speaker_heading: AHHHH!!
dialog: (to supervisor)
dialog: I'm going to take five, okay Krumpet?
speaker_heading: KRUMPET
dialog: Okay!
text: We follow Buddy as he approaches an Elf kitchenette. But before he enters, he stops, over-hearing a few Elves drinking cider and talking behind his back.
speaker_heading: FOOM FOOM
dialog: ...and that EX-traordinary bit! That was quick thinking.
speaker_heading: ELF SUPERVISOR
dialog: Hey, I feel bad for the guy. I just hope he doesn't get wise.
speaker_heading: FOOM FOOM
dialog: Hey, he's believed he was a real Elf for this long, hasn't he?
text: WE SLAM INTO A CLOSE UP OF BUDDY'S SHOCKED FACE
text: QUICK SERIES OF FLASHBACKS FROM BUDDY'S PAST flash before his eyes not unlike 'the sixth sense'.
text: AT THE SHOEMAKER: Buddy is painfully squeezing into new shoes.
text: IN BED: Buddy tosses and turns - three beds have been pushed together to make a human twin-sized bed.
text: IN THE ELF SHOWERS: Buddy is struggling to wash under a three-foot high shower head.
text: THE ELF CHOIR PHOTO: Only Buddy's waist is visible, he's cropped out.
text: An exact replay of those rapid-fire shots of Buddy slamming his head into doorways, beams, cabinets.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles...Dickens! Sone of a Nutcracker!
text: IN THE FACTORY: tinkering with a Ken Doll, Buddy moves the arms like his arms.
text: BACK ON BUDDY, queasy. His head spins as the CAMERA CIRCLES HIM. The room spins. Buddy's knees go weak.
dialog: Pom Pom hurries over, concerned.
speaker_heading: POM POM
dialog: You don't look so good, Buddy. Are you okay?
text: Buddy tries to speak, but instead COLLAPSES RIGHT ON TOP OF POM POM, crushing him beneath his weight.
speaker_heading: POM POM
dialog: (muffled under Buddy)
dialog: I'm okay, Buddy. Don't worry about a thing. I'm warm.
scene_heading: INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER
text: Buddy wakes up from his sleep to find himself in Papa's workshop. FOCUS RACKS to Papa tending to his son.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ooooooh. I had a terrible nightmare.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: What is it, Buddy?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I dreamt I wasn't an Elf at all. I was a human. Oh, it was awful. I'm not a human, am I Papa?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: I knew this day would come. You see, Buddy, I love you and nothing can ever change that. But the fact is, it wasn't a dream. You're not like the rest of us.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You mean I'm not an Elf?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: No, son, you're a human being.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: No wonder I'm always freezing!
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: We decided it was best to let you think you were one of us.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: But I thought elves can't lie.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: We can't. But Buddy, you never asked! I thought for sure when you cracked six feet it would come up.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (getting upset)
dialog: I thought I had a glandular problem.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Your glands are fine.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (emotional)
dialog: So, you're not my Papa?
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Oh, I'll always be your Papa. It's just you have another Papa, too. A biological Papa.
text: Papa Elf opens a drawer and shows Buddy a photo: a young couple are in love...
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF (V.O.)
dialog: I then proceeded to tell Buddy of how his father had fallen in love when he was very young with a beautiful girl named Susan Welles, and how Buddy was born and put up for adoption by his mother. And how she had later passed away. I told him his father had never even known Buddy was born. And most importantly, I told him where his Dad was: in a magical land called New York City.
text: Papa Elf puts a snow globe in front of Buddy showing the Empire State Building with a sign NEW YORK CITY.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Uhh! I feel confused and sweaty! I need some Buddy time!
dialog: Buddy runs off.
speaker_heading: PAPA ELF
dialog: Buddy?! Buddy?!!
scene_heading: EXT. NORTH POLE - MINUTES LATER
text: Buddy runs and runs. He passes some ANIMATED ANIMALS, a RABBIT, a RACCOON and a SQUIRREL.
speaker_heading: RACCOON
dialog: Hey, Buddy! Want to sing and pick snow berries?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Not now Pipsy!!
text: He passes by an ANIMATED SNOWMAN in the front yard of a toasty little cottage.
speaker_heading: JIM THE SNOWMAN

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hi, Jim. What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JIM THE SNOWMAN
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: Uh, ow. Sorry...my back's out of line again. Do you mind cracking it for me again?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Sure, Jim.
text: Buddy comes from behind him, squeezes and then we hear a CRACK.
speaker_heading: JIM THE SNOWMAN
dialog: (speaking at full volume)
dialog: Ohhh, thank you, Buddy. That's soooo good. It's from all the standing. They never build me sitting down. Hey? Why the long face?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Well, Jim. It seems I'm...I'm not an Elf.
speaker_heading: JIM THE SNOWMAN
dialog: Of course you're not. You're six-three and had a beard when you were fifteen.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Papa says my real father is living in a magical place far away.
speaker_heading: JIM THE SNOWMAN
dialog: At least you have a father. I was just rolled up one day. I never had anyone to play catch with. And even if I did. I only have sticks for arms.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I guess I am pretty lucky after all.
speaker_heading: JIM THE SNOWMAN
dialog: I bet your dad would be so happy to see you, he'd hug you and never let go. I wish I had a dad to hug. And even if I did, I only have sticks for arms.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I understand about your arms, Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM THE SNOWMAN
dialog: Well, you should do all the things I can't. Go see him. Hug him. And play catch. And scratch your ass.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I will. I'm gonna go find my dad!
scene_heading: INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - THE NEXT DAY

text: Santa steps into frame and puts his arm around Buddy.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: So I hear you're going on a little journey to the big city?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yeah, but I'm kind of nervous. Jim told me New York is really different.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Don't listen to Jim. He's never been anywhere. He doesn't even have any feet. I've been to New York thousands of times.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Wow. What's it like?
speaker_heading: SANTA
text: Well there's some things you should know: first off, if you see gum on the street, leave it there. It's not free candy. Second, there are like thirty Ray's Pizzas and they all say they're the original, but the real one's on eleventh. And if you see a sign for a Peep show, it doesn't mean they're letting you look at presents before Christmas.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So much to remember...
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Don't worry, something tells me this trip is going to be good for you.
dialog: (patting him on the back)
dialog: It's time for my Buddy here to spread his wings.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I can't wait! Me and Dad are gonna go ice-skating and eat sugarplums!
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: That's the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. You see, Buddy, your father... Well he's on the naughty list.
speaker_heading: FAST PUSH INTO:
dialog: The NAUGHTY LIST, landing on "Walter Hobbs."
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: NOOOOOO!!!!
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: I'm sorry, but it's true.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: My stomach hurts. It feels like evil.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Listen, Buddy, some people. They get mixed up about what's important in life. But that doesn't mean they can't change. Maybe your dad just needs a little Christmas spirit!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'm good at that!
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: I know you are.

speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: We're trying to get yo the money, but it's been difficult to raise the funding...the children are sponsoring another bake sale next month. That should help.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: See, there's your problem. You can't expect a bake sale to make solid cash these days. Places like Dunkin' Donuts and Cinnibon are expanding their product base with alternative breakfast and desert items. Even Starbucks carries baked goods. You guys really need to start thinking out of the box.

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Would you please use the intercom? We talked about this.
speaker_heading: DEB

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN - MORNING
text: We see Buddy timidly inch his way through the Lincoln Tunnel along the walkway, pressed up against the wall while traffic roars by. Like a stray cat, Buddy dodges through traffic. His feelings of wonder are starting to be replaced with fear. He exits to the sight of the towering skyline of New York City with the sun breaking over it. He sees the Empire State Building, then looks at his snow globe.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

scene_heading: INT. GIMBELS - 9TH FLOOR SANTA LAND - LATER

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: This snow looks fake.
speaker_heading: ELF MANAGER
dialog: It's white, ain't it?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Snow doesn't just pile up unless it's moved through the use of a tool, such as a shovel. I would give this some natural erosion, a slight wind drift look.
speaker_heading: ELF MANAGER
dialog: What the hell are you talkin' about? EROSION?! Don't touch the damn snow. What are you smiling at? You think I'm a joke?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Oh, no, I'm just smiling. Smiling is my favorite.
speaker_heading: ELF MANAGER

speaker_heading: BUDDY'S POV
text: SLO-MO - JOVIE DAVIS. 20s, a petite beauty, dressed as an Elf. She glides like a vision to the Christmas tree where she hangs balls from a ladder. Buddy stares up at her.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Are you enjoying the view?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yes I am! I was standing over there and I thought you looked pretty so I came over to tell you that you look pretty.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Why're you messin' with me? Did Krumpet put you up to this?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'm not messing with you. It's nice to meet a human who shares my affinity for the Elf culture.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: I wouldn't call it an affinity. I'm just trying to get through the holidays.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Get through? Christmas is the greatest day in the whole wide world!
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Well someone's been drinking the Kool Aid.
dialog: (Buddy doesn't get it)
dialog: Believe me, after a few years of this, you'll learn to tune it all out.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Uh-oh. It sounds like someone needs to sing a Christmas Carol!
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Well, thanks, but I don't sing.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Oh, it's easy! It's just like talking, only louder and longer and you move it up and down.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Well, I can sing. I just don't sing. Especially in front of other people. I could never do that.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Never? If you can sing by yourself, you can sing anytime, there's no difference.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Actually, there's a big difference.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: No there isn't. Watch.
dialog: (suddenly singing loudly)
dialog: I'M IN A STORE AND I'M SINGING! PEOPLE ARE HERE AND I'M IN A STORE!!
text: Everyone looks at him like he's...well, Elf. Jovie seems a little uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: A SECURITY GUARD WALKS DOWN AN AISLE

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: He's ten.
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: I don't know what's going on with you, but I've just about had it.
speaker_heading: WALTER

dialog: That was the wrong answer.
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (a tiny ounce of charm)
dialog: The chicken thing was delicious.
speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: WALTER

text: Now, off in the distance, WE HEAR THE FAINT SOUND OF AN ANGEL SINGING.
text: Buddy perks up, training his ear, he slowly rises to his feet, as if following a butterfly, he meanders through the deserted aisles, more and more hypnotized as the angelic singing gets louder and louder and clearer and more beautiful.
text: Buddy pushes through the bathroom door, totally consumed by the greatest voice in the world.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
text: Jovie is in the shower stall. Singing half of the classic duet, "BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE". Buddy stands, hypnotized, outside the shower curtain, quietly joins in and sings the accompanying duet to himself. Eventually he can't help himself and belts out the chorus.
text: Jovie is silent and quickly twists off the shower and opens the curtain, wearing only a towel.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
speaker_heading: AHHHHHHHH!!!

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Santa, it's me! Buddy!

dialog: Ho Ho Ho!
dialog: The voice is wrong, the smell is wrong.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You're lying! I know it!

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (at the beard, horrified)
dialog: AAHHHH!!! Imposter! He's an imposter!!! His beard is fake! Come on, kids, get him!
text: The kids all pile on, wrestling Santa, loving it. Now the manager dives in and tries to help. Some parents and other elves try to contain the disaster in panic.
text: Jovie giggles. She is confused but intrigued by this mysterious stranger.
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - GREENWAY PRESS - DAY

dialog: Hello? My son? Michael? Is he okay?
dialog: (listening)
dialog: An Elf? He's not my -- you know what? Keep him there. I'll be right down.
dialog: Deb peeks in.
speaker_heading: DEB
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Nothing. I need to go.
dialog: (lying)
dialog: I need to swing by my apartment real quick...they're delivering a chair.
speaker_heading: DEB
dialog: (smart ass)
dialog: A police chair?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's a regular chair. Okay?! Cancel my appointments.
speaker_heading: INT. JAIL - DAY
text: A scary jail cell. Buddy looks around from his cot. Everything is cold and hard and ugly and mean.
text: And now he STARTS TO CRY. He sticks his face into the pillow and cries hard.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
text: Another convict shares the cell with him. He stares at Buddy with disgust.
dialog: But now, slowly, it's contagious. The CONVICT CAN'T HELP IT AND HE STARTS TO CRY TOO.
text: Buddy hears the cell door clang open.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
text: Walter stands at the open jail cell door.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Dad!!!
text: Buddy wipes his tears and rubs his face. Trying to look like a good son.
text: The convict wipes his tears away too, sitting up straight. But now starts crying again.
speaker_heading: EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY
text: Walter marches out of the front doors, Buddy following closely behind, almost like a puppy dog trying to keep up.
text: Walter is about to burst but holds back, until they're clear of the station.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'm so happy! I knew you'd come! I love that you came and I love you Dad! Know how much I love you?
dialog: (spreading his arms wide)
dialog: This much. Except my arms would have to be way longer, like pterodactyl wings --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Alright, pal. Who the heck are you and what's your problem?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'm Buddy. Your son.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I already have a son!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Then who am I?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Where did you get this picture?!
text: He holds up the picture he included in the gift.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Papa Elf gave it to me.
text: Walter shakes Buddy violently by the lapels. Buddy's scared.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is this some kind of game? What do you want, money?!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I just wanted to meet you...and I thought that, maybe, you might want to meet me...
dialog: Walter senses an element of truth in here somewhere.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (serious)
dialog: You really believe this, don't you?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I thought we could make ginger bread houses and eat cookie dough and go ice skating and hold hands. I'm sorry if I made you mad.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (conflicted)
dialog: Come with me.
text: Their silhouettes walk together away from camera. Buddy REACHES OUT TO HOLD HANDS, but Walter's hands stay in his trench coat...Buddy is still holding his hand out. Walter suddenly SMACKS BUDDY'S HAND DOWN.
scene_heading: INT. PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER
text: Buddy sits on the examining table as Walter watches.
text: PROP NOTE: Del Close's skull sits on a shelf in the B.G.
text: Buddy reaches into a jar of cotton balls and starts eating them quickly one at a time. Like cotton candy nuggets.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Don't eat those.
text: Buddy goes to eat one more, Walter tries to grab his arm but Buddy fakes him out and eats it anyway.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Am I sick?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: YES.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But that's not why we're here. We're here to test whether you're my son or not.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Why am I sitting on paper?
text: Buddy pulls the roll and paper spills out everywhere. The doctor and Walter try to stop him, but get tangled up.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: So it's clean for each patient that comes in. Try to sit still. I'm going to perform something called a 'finger prick.'
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (happy)
dialog: Finger prick!
dialog: (to the Doctor)
dialog: Can I wear your head lamp?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Just sit still.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Why is there a skeleton on the wall?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I don't know but there just is.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What's his name?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He doesn't have a name!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: If I squint, he looks like a pirate flag. Arrgh!
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Walter, I can't do this if he's going to keep moving around.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm sorry Ben. Buddy! Please!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: He got mad at me.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Buddy the sooner you sit still, the sooner we can clear up this horrible mess.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: After this, can we eat sugar plums together?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sure! We'll eat sugar plums, and make ginger bread houses, and paint eggs!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That's Easter not -
text: The Doctor gives Buddy's finger a tiny prick.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
text: Buddy shoves the doctor over and stumbles around holding his finger and crying.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Boot straps! Snow flickers! Son of a cobbler!
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER
text: Buddy holds his finger with a cotton ball for a moment. Then suddenly eats it.
text: Now he taps his finger and flips it around like it's dead, then turns to a LITTLE GIRL, 7, who is playing with her doll as her MOTHER fills out paperwork with the nurse.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: My finger has a heartbeat.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: It won't hurt so much after a little. What's your name?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Buddy.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I'm Carolyn.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: And what do you want for Christmas?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: A Suzie-Talks-A-Lot.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I'll put in a good word with the big man.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Thanks. Your costume is pretty.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Oh, it's not a costume. I'm an Elf. Well, I'm a human, technically. But I was raised by Elves.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (totally unfazed)
dialog: Oh. I'm a human...raised by humans.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Cool.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Walter is waiting for the results.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's a boy.
text: The blood drains out of Walter's face.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's impossible.
dialog: (feeling faint)
dialog: Is the test ever wrong?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My God. What'm I supposed to do? You saw the guy, he's certifiably insane!
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Walter, I've read about some things that suggest Buddy's behavior isn't necessarily that unusual.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The man skips.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It's rare, but there have been documented cases of people like your son.
speaker_heading: WALTER
speaker_heading: His name's BUDDY.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, BUDDY's been denied a proper childhoood with you. It's possible he may feel he was never fully nurtured, causing an alternative personality to develop.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: An Elf.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think he's trying to return to a position of child-like dependency.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So, let's get him some pills or whatever. I'll pay for them, it's not a problem.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I think what he really needs is you. This is an extreme case. A rejection now could be especially traumatic.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So, what do you want me to do, breast feed him?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What if you let him visit you? Meet the family, that sort of thing. It may help him feel like he's a part of your life.
dialog: (off Walter's look)
dialog: He's your son Walter, it's not like he's going to just go away.
speaker_heading: EXT. EMILY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Emily is leaving work, locking up the door. She turns to find Walter standing there at the bottom of the steps, hands in his pockets, smiling.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd walk you home.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You thought you'd walk me home?
dialog: They begin to walk together.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What, is that so weird?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I've worked here for four years. You've never walked me anywhere.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well it's a nice night.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why does something have to be wrong? I just said, it's a nice night, I mean really!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
dialog: (taking his arm)
dialog: Thanks, this is really nice.
dialog: On Walter as he walks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay, something's a little wrong.
speaker_heading: INT. HOBB'S RESIDENCE - LATER
dialog: They're arriving home.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh, God...that's well, it's...it's Wonderful Walter. You have a son.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Wonderful. That's one way to put it.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh c'mon. This is incredible. It may be a little complicated, but it's nothing we can't handle.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He thinks he's an Elf.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I'm sorry, what?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He thinks he's a Christmas Elf.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh, I'm sure he doesn't really think...
dialog: Walter swings open the door to the apartment to reveal:
speaker_heading: INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: BUDDY HAS BEEN BUSY. The place is a recycled winter wonderland. Yards of old garland has been meticulously strung throughout the apartment. Elaborate construction paper Christmas murals cover the walls. His sense of decorating is impeccable. Emily is floored.
text: MEANWHILE...in the kitchen, Buddy scoops globs of frosting into his mouth at a furious pace.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Buddy?
text: Buddy looks up, drooling.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This is Emily.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (muffled, mouth full)
dialog: Emuree!
text: Swallows frosting hard. He jumps up and gives her a big hug.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Walter hasn't told me anything about you!!!
text: Meanwhile, Michael, their son, has arrived.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why is mom hugging Robin Hood?
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
text: Walter, Emily, Michael and Buddy are seated around the dining room table eating spaghetti.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: ...then I traveled through the seven levels of the candy cane forest, past the castle of the abominable snowman and past the sea of swirly, twirly gumdrops. And then I walked through the Lincoln tunnel. Can you pass the Coke pretty please?
text: Michael hands over a two-liter. Instead of pouring it in his glass, Buddy chugs the entire thing. The family watches, amazed.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So, where exactly have you been for the last thirty years?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The North Pole. He's an "Elf". That's where elves live.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: He's right. Can you pass the maple syrup, pretty please.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't set out any syrup. It's spaghetti.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That's okay, I think I have some...
text: Buddy pulls some syrup out of his breast pocket and pours it over his spaghetti. Walter and Michael share a disgusted look, the first time they've been in agreement on anything in a while.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You like sugar, huh?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Is there sugar in syrup?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Then yes! We Elves try to stick to the four basic food groups: Candy, candy canes, candy corns and syrup.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So, will you be staying with us, then?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Emily.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You mean I can stay?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Emily!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh, don't be silly. Of course you can. How long do you think you'll be with us?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Well, I hadn't really planned it out, but I was thinking, like, forever?
speaker_heading: WALTER
speaker_heading: EMILY!?
speaker_heading: EMILY
speaker_heading: WHAT?!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: May I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Um, sure. Excuse me, Buddy.
text: Left alone, Buddy stares at Michael. Michael ignores him. Turning his whole chair away. Buddy looks around for a moment. And now suddenly BURPS so loud and long, it's insane.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Wow, did you hear that?
dialog: Yes, Michael did...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Walter argues with Emily in hushed tones.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Are you crazy? He can't stay here.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Clearly he has some serious issues. We can't just kick him out in the snow.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why not? He loves the snow! He told me fifteen times!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Seriously Walter! He's alone in New York. What's he supposed to do?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's his problem.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: He's your son. That means it's our problem.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Buddy and Michael sit in silence. Buddy isn't sure what to say.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Eat me.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Eat you? OKAY!
dialog: (playing, like the jungle)
dialog: I'm a Lion! Roar! CHOMP!
speaker_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Buddy is on the living room couch. Walter is tucking him in, trying to leave.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Goodnight, Dad.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Tuck me in?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I can't fall asleep if I'm not tucked in.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm not tucking you in!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I promise I'll go right to sleep.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Fine...
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: TICKLE FIGHT!!!
dialog: Walter fights him off, pissed.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No. Buddy. Stop!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Just lay down and go to sleep, okay?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Do you want to hear a story?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No. When this light goes off, you are not getting up. Understand?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Understand.
dialog: (Walter flicks off light)
dialog: Dad?
dialog: (flicks light on)
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Go to sleep.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Do you love me?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah sure. Now go to sleep.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: How much do you love me. Like on a scale from one to ten?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, I haven't known you for very long, but I would say my feelings are...significant.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (to himself; satisfied)
dialog: Significant
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Good night.
text: The lights go out for the last time. Walter closes the door and Buddy is alone in the DARK.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (in the dark)
dialog: Dad.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: Dad?
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: DAD?
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: DAD?!
dialog: (longer beat)
dialog: DAD!!!!
text: The door suddenly swings open and light shoots into the room.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: WHAT!!!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hi.
text: Walter slams the door. It's dark again.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Dad?
scene_heading: INT. HOBBS' KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Buddy has prepared a huge batch of spaghetti. The table is set up like a deranged thanksgiving feast. Buddy, the host, hurries around the kitchen as Emily eats.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: This sure is something, I'm usually the one making breakfast.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Want some more spaghetti?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Um, sure, why not.
text: Buddy dumps more spaghetti on her plate. Then sprinkles it with candy snow caps.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So how'd you sleep last night?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Great. I got a full forty minutes and still had time to build a rocking horse.
text: We see a painted and trimmed rocking horse in the corner.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: My gosh, you built that? Where did you get the wood?
speaker_heading: WALTER (O.S.)
dialog: Why is the TV on the ground?
speaker_heading: REVEAL:
text: The ENTERTAINMENT CENTER has been completely dismantled to provide wood for the rocking horse. Sawdust and paint litter the living room.
text: Walter walks into the kitchen, flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Good morning, honey.
dialog: (she kisses her husband)
dialog: Buddy made us breakfast, isn't that nice?
dialog: Walter looks at the...spaghetti. So many things to say, but no place to begin.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: He packed us lunches too.
speaker_heading: REVEAL:
text: THREE BAGS of spaghetti have each person's name written in calligraphy.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Well, I gotta run. Thanks for breakfast, Buddy.
dialog: (grabbing her bag)
dialog: And the lunch!
text: She kisses him on the cheek and leaves.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Bye Emily!
text: Buddy takes a huge spoon and lifts three pounds of spaghetti into frame.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (to Walter)
dialog: So, how many scoops?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm going to stick with coffee for now.
dialog: Now MICHAEL ENTERS. He doesn't care to notice the weird food.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to Walter, awkward)
dialog: I need my allowance.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (awkward)
dialog: Did you do the recycling?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, I did, okay?
text: Walter peels off a twenty and Michael immediately shoves it into his pocket.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: How come you guys don't hug? We always hug in the morning.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (lying)
dialog: We hugged earlier.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (partner in crime)
dialog: Yeah, we hugged already. Bye.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Bye!
dialog: Walter and Buddy are now alone.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Listen, Buddy, I wanted to talk to you.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Good, I wanted to talk to you too. I've planned our whole day...
dialog: He's made a list on the Etch-a-sketch.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: First we make snow angels for two hours, then we go ice-skating and then we eat a log of toll house cookie dough as fast as we can and then, to wrap up the day, we snuggle.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Buddy, I have to go to work.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And another thing, if you're going to be staying here, you should think about getting rid of the costume. We've got neighbors and people around here, you know?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (looking at himself)
dialog: I've worn this my whole life.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, well, you're not in the North Pole anymore.
dialog: Buddy is unsure.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You said you wanted to make me happy, didn't you?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: More than anything.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Then lose the tights...as soon as possible.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: As soon as possible?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: As soon as possible.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Yes, papa.
text: Walter turns and faces camera, pouring coffee. Behind him, Buddy TAKES HIS GREEN TIGHTS OFF and stands there NAKED from the waist down. (The audience is spared the details).
text: From the rear, Emily re-enters the kitchen and sees Buddy from behind.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I almost forg --- AHHHHH!!!!!!
text: Walter spills his coffee and turns to see Buddy from the front.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: AHHHHHHH!!!!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (as if it's a game)

dialog: Walter Hobbs.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (O.S.)
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: It worked! It's you!
dialog: We intercut Buddy at home, he's shocked by the technology.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: How'd you get this number?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Emily left an emergency list.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is there an emergency?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
text: There's a horrible sound coming from the evil box by the window! It sounds like this: ERIEKKKCTH!
text: Walter's ear is trashed before he can pull the phone away.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's not evil. It's the radiator. The heat makes noise when it comes on.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: No it's not. Wait yes it is, you were right. Everything's fine!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm hanging up now.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Okay, I love you, I'll call you in five minutes, I love you!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You don't need to call me, Buddy, okay?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Good idea. You call me.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay, I'm hanging up.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I have a present for you when you get home!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm hanging up.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I love you!
scene_heading: EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE PRIVATE SCHOOL - LATER
dialog: Dozens of kids stream out of school.
text: Michael is in the middle of the crowd when he hears his name from across the street.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (O.S.)
speaker_heading: MICHAEL! MICHAEL!
text: He looks over and sees Buddy cutting through traffic.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (turns away in embarrassment)
dialog: Oh man.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: It's me, your brother! Hey, Michael!
text: Kids start to notice and begin laughing, Michael can't bare it. Michael walks away, ignoring Buddy.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Michael! Wait up!
speaker_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
text: Michael is walking through the park, Buddy trails twelve feet behind, sort of hiding behind trees. But not really.
text: Michael finally turns and confronts him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: LEAVE!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: How about I leave, then you count to ten and come find me?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This isn't a game, spaz. Leave NOW. For REAL.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You really want me to leave
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (sad)
dialog: Oh. Okay. I'll uh, leave, then. I'm sorry.
text: Just then, a SNOWBALL WHACKS MICHAEL IN THE SHOULDER.
speaker_heading: EDGE OF THE RAVINE
text: A big bunch of JACKASS WANNA-BE teenagers look down at them and laugh.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, no. These guy are bad news. We better get out of here.
dialog: Thump! Michael gets hit in the head.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ow! PEANUT BRITTLE! SON OF A NUTCRACKER!
text: Now a barrage of snowballs rain down upon them and they dive behind a fallen tree trunk as snow missiles rip into the barricade.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Dive!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (genuinely worried)
dialog: There are too many of them!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: We can do this! Make as many snowballs as you can!
dialog: Michael quickly sculpts two snowballs.
speaker_heading: WE PAN BACK
text: To see Buddy has already rounded out a pile of THIRTY.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
text: We can't see Buddy, but we can see the snowballs shooting out of his bunker like a machine gun. A Nolan Ryan fastball ever 1.5 Seconds.
text: A series of targets explode with precision as this blur of snowballs hits guts, butts, nuts and faces. A kid raises a snowball and it immediately explodes out of his hand. This is the one thing Buddy's actually better at than hockey.
dialog: Michael stands to launch one. Exposing himself.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Noooo!
text: Michael is frozen with shock as a HUGE KID winds up and releases a snowball right at him. Buddy fires a snowball that hits the incoming snowball exploding both of them in mid-air like a patriot missile. They both sit panting.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: He's bunkered in! I'm going to flank around from the East. If I don't make it, tell my Dad I love him.
text: Buddy jumps and charges - and now Michael follows. Buddy descends upon the guy, launching a flurry of snow. The guy finally raises his arms and steps up slowly in surrender.
text: Buddy looks at the GUY WITH HIS ARMS UP, then winds up and explodes a snowball off his chest at close range.
speaker_heading: SNOWBALL GUY
dialog: Ow!
dialog: (holding his chest)
dialog: Hey, I surrendered!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (to Michael)
dialog: What does surrendered mean?
speaker_heading: INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
text: Walter does some paperwork, then hits the intercom.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Can you bring me in a bottle of water please?
speaker_heading: DEB (O.S.)
dialog: (from the intercom)
dialog: Fulton Greenway is on his way in.
dialog: Fulton Greenway? Walter immediately loses blood in his face.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fulton Greenway? Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: DEB (O.S.)
dialog: He just showed up. What size water?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: When's he coming in?
speaker_heading: DEB (O.S.)
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What do you mean now?
text: Walter buttons his suit and checks his reflection for nose hairs.
speaker_heading: DEB (O.S.)
dialog: I mean now. What size?
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY (O.S.)
dialog: Hobbs!
text: FULTON GREENWAY, the cut-throat looking owner of the company enters the office. This guy owns Greenway Press, among other things.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fulton! What a great surprise!
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: I haven't seen you since the retreat. You're looking good.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Thanks, you too. So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: Well, to be honest, I got a call from my niece.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Your niece. I don't think I've met her.
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: She's six.
text: Fulton tosses 'THE PUPPY AND THE PIGEON (the flawed book from earlier) onto Walter's desk. Uh oh.
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: She wants to know how a certain puppy and a certain pigeon escaped the clutches of a certain evil witch.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Believe me, we've already started looking at new printers. This one's obviously gotten sloppy.
dialog: Greenway holds up the proofs, signed by Walter.
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: Maybe it isn't the printer who's gotten sloppy.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (forcing a laugh)
dialog: What a disaster, huh? Twenty-five years in publishing, never seen anything like it. Well, I guess you can't bat a thousand, right?
text: Fulton Greenway nods skeptically. Walter adjusts in his seat.
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: I got news for you, even if those two pages were in there, that book still would have sucked. I read it. I'll tell you, I wish all the pages were missing.
dialog: (Walter's dying)
dialog: Have you seen the numbers from this quarter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: They should be coming in today.
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: (holds up the numbers)
dialog: They're in!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That good, huh?
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: The Pigeon and the Friggin' Puppy is tanking hard, Hobbs. My people estimate we'll be posting a minus eight for this quarter. A minus eight cannot happen.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, we'll bounce back. We always do.
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: We're not going to 'bounce back.' We're going to get a new book before the end of the quarter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Before the end of this quarter?
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: I'll be back in town on the twenty fourth. At that time, I'd love to hear, in great detail, exactly what your plans are for this new book.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: But that's Christmas Eve.
speaker_heading: FULTON GREENWAY
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hey, no problem. It'll be fun to have you in the loop.
scene_heading: INT. GIMBELS - LATER THAT DAY
text: Buddy and Michael are goofing around inside Gimbels. Buddy pegs him with a dodge ball. Michael laughs and pegs him back.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (looking at toy bugs)
dialog: Hey, look at this, it's a big mosquito!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What's a mosquito?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: They land on your arm, then stick their needle face down through your skin, suck your blood out and then fly away.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: That's a scary toy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's not just a toy. They're real. They're everywhere in the summer.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (horrified)
speaker_heading: OH MY GOD.
speaker_heading: EXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS
text: They leave the toy section and walk toward the SANTA LAND that Buddy built. We see the sign has been awkwardly changed to 'Welcome, Santa. Love GIMBELS.'
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I wish Dad were here.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: He's the greatest Dad in the world.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Are you kidding? He's the worst dad in the world.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: All he does is work.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Working is fun.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Not the way he does it. All he cares about is the money. He doesn't care about me, he doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about anybody.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Well, he is on the naughty list.
speaker_heading: AND NOW WE SPOT JOVIE
dialog: From a distance. She looked adorable before, but this time we're serious.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You like her?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Like who?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The girl you're staring at.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Um, yes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why don't you ask her out?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Out to where?
speaker_heading: MEANWHILE
text: Jovie has spotted Buddy. She gives him a shy wave. And now she's WALKING OVER to them.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (flipping out)
dialog: We should leave. I need to leave.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don't leave! Ask her out!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Out?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: On a date, you know, to eat food.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (Jovie's almost there)
dialog: Food.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: If she says yes, you're in. It's like a secret code girls have.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Well look who it is.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hi Jovie. This is --
text: Michael has ditched out. Buddy is on his own.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: ...that's my brother, Michael, over there.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: I was wondering if I'd ever see you again. So, did Gimbels give you your job back?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: No, but it worked out pretty good. They gave me a restraining order.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: You really should get out of here.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: But I really wanted to see you. You're beautiful and I feel warm when I'm around you. You make my tongue swell up.
dialog: Jovie is embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: You are the weirdest guy I've ever met in my life.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Weird, like, good?
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I haven't decided.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So, do you want to eat food?
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Do I want to eat food?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: You know...
dialog: (winking)
dialog: The code...
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: (letting that slide)
dialog: I just took my lunch break.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: Oh, right. I follow.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: (then)
dialog: But I'm free Thursday night.
text: A wry smile slowly breaks across Buddy's face. And then he suddenly explodes.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (celebrating; ridiculous)
speaker_heading: YYEEESSSSSSSSS!
speaker_heading: INT. HOBBS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Walter enters and sees Buddy and Michael as they hoist an enormous FOURTEEN FOOT TALL CHRISTMAS TREE into the corner. It scrapes the ceiling as they wedge it in place.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: A Christmas tree!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: A Christmas tree?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Buddy chopped it down in the park!
text: Buddy smiles at Walter, Walter does not smile back.
scene_heading: INT. WALTER AND EMILY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: Michael and Emily are having a heated discussion.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I don't know what you're so worked up about. They're just having a little fun.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Fun? Felonies are fun now? I thought felonies were felonies?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Okay, the tree thing was bad. We'll have to plant another one. But at least
dialog: Michael's happy for once.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's amazing what a little attention will do.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Well, you haven't exactly been there for him lately. He's a kid Walter, he's not going to raise himself.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh! So let's allow a deranged Elf-man to raise him. Great idea! Maybe we should pull Michael out of school so they can commit felonies full time!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I think you're jealous.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Jealous? Of Buddy? The man is wearing tights.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MEANWHILE
text: Buddy uses a drill to secure the trunk to the floor. ZZZZRRrrrr. He then stands at a distance. Like a high jumper, holding a star for the top of the tree in hand.
speaker_heading: POV
text: He eyes a mini-trampoline. Then the top of the tree. And now looks at the star in his hand. This has bad news written all over it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Are you sure about this? Maybe we can get a ladder.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: A ladder? What's fun about a ladder?
dialog: (concentrating)
dialog: Ready?
dialog: (taking off)
dialog: WATCH!!!!
text: Buddy runs, hits the trampoline, launches himself way off target, shooting a sharp angle into the nearest wall. BAM! HE falls behind the couch and out of sight.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (O.S.)
dialog: I'm okay.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I found a quarter!
speaker_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What was that noise?
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: Sounded like Buddy slamming into the wall and falling behind the couch.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That guy's a liability. There's no way we're leaving him alone here tomorrow. He'll trash the place. Maybe you should take tomorrow off and, you know, watch him.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I can't just take off work. I'm going upstate tomorrow for budget meetings.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well I can't stay home. I'm one bad pitch away from getting fired.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Why don't you take him to work with you?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Take him to work with me?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah, I bet he'd like it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Absolutely never.
speaker_heading: SMASH CUT TO:

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hello, Jack!

speaker_heading: CO-WORKER #3

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hello, Francisco.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Hey, Francisco! That's fun to say! Francisco!
speaker_heading: WALTER

dialog: Thanks, Deb.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Good morning, Deb! You have a very pretty face! You should be on a Christmas card!
speaker_heading: DEB
dialog: Uh, thanks.
text: She leaves. Walter watches as Buddy grabs ten different books and immediately decides they're boring.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Fran-cis-co.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We're cutting down on your sugar intake.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Why is your name on the door?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I bought that door. My name's there so no one else steals it.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Is that a joke, Dad?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: This is your office, isn't it?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well how about that? He's understanding sarcasm.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: So what are we going to build?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This really isn't that kind of work.
dialog: THE PHONE RINGS, Buddy beats Walter to it.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (super-fast into phone)
dialog: Buddy the Elf! What's your favorite color?
dialog: Walter hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Please don't touch anything!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Listen, Buddy, have you ever seen a mail room before?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (excited)
dialog: A mail room? No.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mail from all over the world gets sorted all in one place! And some of the bins are shiny.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (dreaming)
dialog: Shiny...
scene_heading: INT. MAILROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Yelling voices, loud machinery and blaring hip-hop fill the place. YOUNG, URBAN WORKERS in criminal apparel wrap and unwrap massive parcels.
text: The elevator dings open to reveal Buddy, alone, frightened. The floor manager, CHUCK, spots Buddy.
speaker_heading: FLOOR MANAGER
dialog: You Buddy?
dialog: (Buddy nods)
dialog: Well come on out of the elevator then.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Floor manager leads Buddy over to the main work area.
speaker_heading: FLOOR MANAGER
dialog: Welcome to the pit.
text: TREY, an enormous, bald African-American man and CRAIG, a bald, wiry kid with a neck tattoo, stop their sorting and look up at Buddy with threatening glares.
speaker_heading: FLOOR MANAGER
dialog: ...over here is the trench. All the mail comes out of the shooter. You scan and find the floor each piece is moving to. Put her in the canister and shove her up the tube with the same number, got it?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Yeah! I like tubes and cannisters and numbers. This place reminds me of Santa's workshop. Except here it smells like mushrooms and everyone wants to hurt me.
speaker_heading: INT. CONVERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: It's a writer's meeting. The three writers: EUGENE, HUSKEY and MORRIS sit around a table with Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So, we've got Greenway coming in tomorrow. Where are we at?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Well, Huskey and I were brain storming and we came up with what I think is a pretty big idea.
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
dialog: You're going to love this.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: I heard it already and I think it's fantastic.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (pleasantly surprised)
dialog: Okay, great. Let's hear it.
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
dialog: Picture this...
dialog: (long dramatic pause)
dialog: We bring in Miles Finch.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The Miles Finch?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: The Golden Ghost.
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
dialog: We bring him in.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: He's written more classics than Dr. Seuss. It may not be easy, but we think it's worth a shot.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So, lemme get this straight. You guys are pitching me the idea of another writer?
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
dialog: Miles Finch.
dialog: Walter looks like he's about to get angry...but then:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I like it.
scene_heading: INT. GREENWAY PRESS - MAIL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: This is Buddy at his best. He stuffs and launches mail into tubes with incredible speed and efficiency. No one's ever seen anything like it.
text: Almost without noticing, Buddy begins singing to himself.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (singing)
dialog: On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
text: He feels Trey's stares and catches himself. He turns to find a stone cold killer glare.
speaker_heading: TREY

dialog: A partridge in a pear tree.
speaker_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Walter and the writers are huddled around a speaker phone.
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: My favorite book of yours has to be Gus' Pickles. It was existential, yet so accessible.
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
dialog: It's a thrill just to be talking to you on our speaker phone.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So what do you think? Can you fly in tomorrow morning?
text: A beat, and then Miles Finch's voice comes over the speaker phone, mysterious and brilliant.
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH (O.S.)
dialog: (intercom)
dialog: I'll give you five hours tomorrow, not a minute more.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH (O.S.)
dialog: I'd like a black S-500 to receive me at the airport. I need the interior of that car to be 71 degrees.
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: DEB (O.S.)
dialog: (over intercom; BEEP!)

scene_heading: EXT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

text: He presses the buzzer BRRR!!!! It scares the hell out of him. He jumps back and is then frightened to death as he is confronted by the sight of a display window full of Chinese roasted ducks. Still sporting heads. Jovie steps out.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

dialog: You look miraculous.
speaker_heading: JOVIE

dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: She takes a sip.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: EXT. ICE RINK - LATER
text: Buddy and Jovie are skating, having fun. Jovie accidentally slides, BUMPING BUDDY. Buddy bumps her back. She bumps him back harder. It escalates until she checks him off of his feet. THEY FALL to the ice together, Jovie on top, nose to nose.
text: They look into each other's eyes and Buddy abruptly plants a kiss on Jovie's cheek.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: You missed.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Great. Let's get the uh --
dialog: (i.e. Cash)
dialog: Taken care of so we can get started.
text: Walter pulls out a small manila envelope stacked with cash and slides it across the table. The three other writers watch it slide across, moving their heads like a tennis match, until Miles stops it with his hand.
text: Miles checks the money and tucks it into his vest pocket.
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: Okay, cool.
dialog: (right to the point)
dialog: So what have you guys got so far?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (to Huskey)
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Okay, well, we were thinking something like this: we open on a young Tomato. He's been through some tough times on the farm.
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: No tomatoes. Too vulnerable. Kids are already vulnerable.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's what we were kind of thinking.
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: And no farms, everyone's pushing small-town rural. Any farm book will just be white noise.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay. Well, we don't have much time. Do you have any ideas?
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: I've got five or six strong starts. I'm sure we can put something very solid together. No problem.
dialog: (Walter is very happy)
dialog: There's one idea I'm especially psyched about. It's one of those ideas where you're just like YES!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What is it?!
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--
speaker_heading: BUDDY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Not now, Buddy. Why don't you go...uh, back to the pit? I'll come visit you later, okay?

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: MILES FINCH

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: MILES FINCH

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Boy, the candy canes here in New York just don't measure up to Elf standards, do they?
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: (another icy stare)
dialog: Gee whiz, we're all laughing our butts off.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Buddy! Please. Just go in the basement!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Do you guys have an Elf hockey league here? I'm just curious.
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: Hey, jack weed. I may be "little," but I get more action in a week than you've had your whole life. I've got houses in LA, Hawaii, Vail and Paris, with a seventy inch plasma screen in each one of them. So I suggest you wipe that friggin' smile off your face before I bite it off.
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: You feelin' strong, friend? Call me ELF one more time.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (to his Dad)
dialog: Boy, he's an angry Elf.
text: Miles suddenly ATTACKS! Buddy tries to avoid him, but Miles is surprisingly strong, flipping Buddy over the table.
text: Now out of nowhere, Buddy winds up like Popeye and decks him across the face. Buddy looks at his own fist in horror.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (looking at his fist)
dialog: What have I done?
text: This gives Miles permission to deliver five QUICK HOCKEY PUNCHES to the face. Buddy is down for the count.
text: Miles stands, victorious and grabs his coat.
speaker_heading: MILES FINCH
dialog: All of you can kiss my vertically challenged ass.
text: Miles takes the envelope of money out of his jacket and pretends to toss it on the table, pump faking. Then returns it to his vest pocket and walks out.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Miles! Wait!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: A South Pole Elf.
text: Buddy rubs his chin and stands to face his father.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Go anywhere! I don't care if you're crazy. I don't care if you're an elf!! I don't care if you're my son!!! JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE!!!

dialog: Oh, um, we'll talk about it later. I gotta go, okay?
text: Suddenly the three writers rush in. Walter hangs up.
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
dialog: Walter! Huge news. The cleaning man just found this!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What is it?
text: Huskey hands over a black journal and Walter flips through it.
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
text: Miles Finch's notebook! He left it in the conference room. There's three great pitches in the first page alone!
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Plus we've got his doodle-squiggles all over the back cover! We're not sure what they mean, but they're probably gold!
speaker_heading: HUSKEY
dialog: I say we o with the first pitch in there! It's a slam dunk!
speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: I agree, a home run.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Monster.
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: Buddy steps out of the closet...
speaker_heading: REVEAL
dialog: He's wearing his ELF SUIT again. Never before has an Elf looked so sad.
text: Buddy sits at the table and unfurls some long paper. He dips a quill pen in to some ink and writes in PERFECT CALLIGRAPHY.
speaker_heading: WE HEAR BUDDY'S VOICE AS HE WRITES.
speaker_heading: BUDDY (V.O.)
dialog: I'm sorry I ruined your lives... And crammed eleven cookies into the VCR. I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. I will never forget you. Love, Buddy.
text: Buddy sets down the scroll, and now, as if sealing it, sets his SNOW GLOBE down on the crease.
dialog: Buddy walks out into the night.
speaker_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: In his Elf Suit, Buddy trudges through the stormy New York night. The wind viciously blows. Buddy walks against it, the snow blowing into him.
speaker_heading: INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - LATER
text: Michael comes home, carrying a bunch of presents. He looks around the empty house.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Buddy?
scene_heading: INT. GREENWAY PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
text: Fulton Greenway and his crew sit at the end of the conference room, looking sharp as a tack. Walter is at the other end, looking even sharper.
speaker_heading: GREENWAY
dialog: As you know, we need a big launch, fast. To get this company back on track. So, I think I speak for my fellow board members when I say...
dialog: (dramatic pause)
dialog: This better be good.
text: Walter smiles, then re-checks his storyboards, beaming.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm confident, sir. You will not be disappointed.
speaker_heading: GREENWAY
dialog: Let's hear it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My pleasure. I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (O.S.)
dialog: Dad?!
dialog: Walter turns.
text: His son Michael is standing in the room.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Michael?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Buddy left!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What?
text: Michael holds up the calligraphy scroll Buddy wrote. Everyone is confused.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He wrote this note! He left his snow globe! He's gone!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay, listen. Let me finish this meeting and we'll figure this out. Okay?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Finish your meeting?!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How'd I know you were going to say that?
text: Michael turns to leave, furious. Walter is torn...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Michael! Wait!
text: Michael stops in his tracks, giving his dad a chance. Hopeful.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (to the board)
dialog: Mr. Greenway, we have to reschedule this.
speaker_heading: GREENWAY
dialog: We don't have time to reschedule! I want to hear the damn thing NOW!
dialog: (to Michael)
dialog: Son, this has to wait.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No it doesn't. We'll do this some other time, Mr. Greenway.
speaker_heading: GREENWAY
dialog: This isn't happening. You're going to sit in that chair and pitch me a hit friggin' book! NOW!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mr. Greenway, with all due respect, KISS MY ASS!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Kiss my ass, too!!
scene_heading: INT. GREENWAY PRESS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Walter and Michael walk down the hall, triumphantly, together.
speaker_heading: GREENWAY (O.S.)
dialog: (in the distance)
dialog: If you walk out, Hobbs, you can never come back to Greenway!
scene_heading: EXT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Buddy's on the bridge, looking down. Contemplating the worst of all possible conclusions. WAVES crash and churn far below.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - CONTINUOUS
text: Walter and Michael are walking fast, searching, half-jogging. Losing hope. Where's Buddy?
scene_heading: EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Buddy closes his eyes tight, then looks up, a tear streams down his cheek.
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE.
text: A distant point with a glowing trail of smoke. Buddy narrows his eyes to see as the point grows as it approaches. It slowly reveals itself to be SANTA'S SLEIGH!
text: Tangled with reindeer, fish-tailing, and CRASHING!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Santa?!
speaker_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN - MEANWHILE
text: Walter is facing away from the park, in the sky behind him is the diving sled. Michael sees this all. His face is aglow.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh...My...God!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (missing it; turning)
dialog: What was that?!
text: In shock, without a word, Michael takes off running toward the park.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What happened?
dialog: (running after him)
dialog: Michael, wait up!?
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA'S CRASH SIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Buddy, running, frantic, comes upon Santa's SLEIGH in the distance. The reindeer peacefully graze as Santa struggles with the smoking sleigh. The landing looks to have been rough as the sleigh has dug a deep fifty foot long trench in the snow and dirt.
text: Santa frantically attempts to repair the problem with his head hidden under a hood panel. Smoke rises.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Santa!
text: Santa jumps out from under the hood clutching a TIRE IRON.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Back off slick!!!
dialog: He then recognizes him.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Buddy?? Is that you?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Boy am I glad to see you. The Claus-o-meter suddenly dropped down to zero. There's almost no Christmas Spirit in New York. The strain was too much, the engine broke free of her mounts. I need an Elf's help.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: But I'm not an Elf, Santa. I can't do anything right.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Buddy, you're more of an elf than anyone I've ever met, and the only one who I would have working on my sleight.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Really. Will you fix the engine for me, Buddy?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I will. Papa taught me how.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: You'll have to find it first, she dropped off back there a ways.
text: Buddy runs off into the woods.
scene_heading: INT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Jovie walks out of the kitchen as NEW YORK ONE drones quietly on the TV. IT features a breaking NEWS STORY set in CENTRAL PARK. A REMOTE REPORTER is on the scene.
speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER
text: New York One has been unable to confirm anything, but it's obvious that something has happened in Central Park. Authorities are clearing out the park and all entrances have been barricaded. As you can see, quite a crowd is starting to gather.
text: The camera pans and we see a huge crowd is gathering outside Central Park, held back by barricades and police.
text: The female reporter steps over to a Latino man, who holds his 5-year old son in his arms.
speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER
dialog: Sir, you say you were able to get a first-hand look at what happened? Tell me, what did you see?
speaker_heading: LATINO MAN
dialog: I was walking along, and I saw a huge flash, and then something came swooping down...
speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER
dialog: Something? Do you mean an airplane or a helicopter?
speaker_heading: LATINO MAN
dialog: It wasn't like that. IT sounds crazy, but it looked like, uh...
dialog: He's too embarrassed.
speaker_heading: LATINO CHILD
dialog: It was Santa's Sleigh!
speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: Aren't you a cutie.
dialog: (listening to earpiece)
dialog: This could be a big hoax. I'm now told we have some amateur footage of a strange man dressed as an Elf. Let's take a look.
speaker_heading: ON THE SCREEN
text: A zoomed-in blurry image of Buddy running. He trips and falls on his face like an idiot. Then scrambles up and runs into the woods. Sort of like that old Big Foot Footage, if he had done a face plant. It ends in a freeze frame of Buddy's FACE as he looks over a shoulder.
dialog: They re-play the footage over and over and over again.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: (seeing Buddy)
dialog: Oh my God.
scene_heading: EXT. ENGINE SITE - CENTRAL PARK -
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: Walter and Michael stop at a smoking object in the snow. It's SANTA'S MISSING ENGINE.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Buddy! You're here!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (in a hurry)
dialog: There's something I've got to tell you guys!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (ignoring; focused)
dialog: No. Me first. There's something I want to tell you right now! I take back everything I said. You may be a little...how do you say... chemically imbalanced. But you've been right about a lot of things. I promise you, I'm going to be making some changes in my life. I don't want you to leave... I need you. You're my son and I love you.
dialog: They hug. This means more Buddy than anyone could ever know.
speaker_heading: SANTA (O.S.)
dialog: (from a foggy distance)
dialog: Buddy?! How are we looking?? We gotta move!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Who was that?
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA'S CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS
text: Buddy leads them to the clearing. Pulling back a tree branch to reveal:
speaker_heading: TRUTH
text: Santa's GROUNDED SLEIGH and nine grazing reindeer. Shocked awe.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (can barely speak)
dialog: Cool...
dialog: Walter cannot yet deal with this reality. His eyes getting wider and wider...about to faint?
speaker_heading: TV COVERAGE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER
text: Dick, according to authorities, the area has been cleared. Only the Central Park Rangers remain in the park.
scene_heading: EXT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: TRACKING CLOSE UP OF HOOVES
text: All lined up along a ridge. FOUR BLACK MARES breathe steam into the night air. Their RIDERS are silently staring into the night. They wear black leather boots and trench coats.
text: Chrome helmets sit atop faces shrouded in shadow. A silver eagle badge reads CENTRAL PARK RANGERS. They look down upon the sleigh, quite a distance away.
speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER (V.O.)
dialog: These forces are highly trained, but rarely see action. Some have accused them of being too "gung ho" when called into duty. And their crowd control tactics at the Simon and Garfunkel concert in '85 were much criticized.
speaker_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: JOVIE IS RUNNING down the street, heading into Central Park.
speaker_heading: EXT. GREAT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So...you're...real?
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: (re: sleigh; working)
dialog: Hold this for a sec.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This is not happening.
text: Walter and Michael, stunned, hold the hood up.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Buddy's really an Elf?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Actually, I'm adopted.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I can't believe it.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Tell me, what did you want for Christmas, Michael?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I wanted a skateboard.
text: Santa pulls out a scroll. He points to his name in calligraphy on a THICK LEATHER-BOUND BOOK.
dialog: It's THE LIST.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: (verifying)
text: Not just a skateboard, a Real Huf Board with high 145 Thunder Trucks. 52 millimeter Spitfire Classic Wheels and bolts from Diamond and some Swiss Bearings.
dialog: In this moment, Walter and Michael both really believe.
speaker_heading: ECU
dialog: We see the CLAUS-O-METER move up a little.
text: The sleigh SHUDDERS and RISES, then falls to the ground.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Before our Viper engine days, this thing used to run solely on Christmas Spirit. You two believe in me. You made my sleigh fly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: They fly away! Quick! Before they catch you!
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: I wish I could. I'm afraid I need more than the Spirit of just you two.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hold it. If you're really Santa, we can just get the news cameras in here and everyone will believe in you, then your sleigh will fly, right?
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Christmas Spirit is about believing, not seeing. If the whole world saw me, all would be lost. The paparazzi have been after me for years.
text: Michael spots the RANGERS on the crest in the distance.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Look!
text: They all look up in fear as the riders disappear into the woods. Buddy pulls Walter aside. Michael follows.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Santa needs your help.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: But, what can we do?
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: I got an idea.
dialog: He whispers a PLAN to Walter and Michael.

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Santa, let him go. You'll get it back. Now, listen to me. I need you to give Walter your hat and coat.
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: But Mrs. Claus made them for me...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hurry! Do you have any idea what would happen to Santa Clause in prison?!
dialog: Santa complies and Walter dons the over-sized ensemble.

text: REMOTE REPORTER spots Michael running out of the trees.
speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER

dialog: (to Michael)
dialog: Did you see anything?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's the real Santa! His sleigh can't fly cause nobody believes in him!
speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER
dialog: (blowing him off)
dialog: Now, this is feeling more and more like some kind of elaborate Christmas hoax.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This isn't a stunt. It's true! Everyone out there, Santa needs us to believe! I can prove he's real. This is Santa's LIST!
dialog: He pulls out the LIST and reads:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Lynn Kessler wants a Powerpuff Girls play set! Mark Webber wants an electric guitar!

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: REMOTE REPORTER
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: How did you know that?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm telling you, it's Santa! We have to get the cameras back on! He needs our help!
text: This giant scene at the barricades has gone dark. The crowd offers scattered boos. Emily consoles Michael.
speaker_heading: CROWD (O.S.)
dialog: Let the kid read! What do I want?!
text: The crowd stands around, confused. Jovie runs up to Michael and Emily, winded.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: Where's Buddy?!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He's with Santa. The sleigh won't fly. No one's believing! We need to get these cameras back on!
text: Jovie looks around. Trying to think of a plan. Inspired, she climbs atop a horse's carriage and looks out over the crowd. She's intimidated.
speaker_heading: JOVIE

dialog: The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear...
speaker_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
text: Walter, standing watch, sees the MOUNTED POLICE CHARGING.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Get out of here! They're coming! There's enough Christmas spirit to start moving!
text: Buddy jumps in. The sleigh slowly hovers forward a foot off the ground, in a herky-jerky way. The MOUNTED RIDERS come at Walter who wears Santa's hat and coat. He attempts to be a decoy.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hey! I'm right here! Ho ho ho! You got me! I surrender!
text: They ride right past him and after the sleigh.
speaker_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS

dialog: Grab the shot gun under the seat and give 'em some heat!
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: A joke, Buddy. Lighten up! Listen, there's barely enough magic to make this thing move. Keep working on the engine!
speaker_heading: EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
text: Above the huge crowd that has gathered at the barricade, we see Jovie standing on top of a car roof. Timidly, she begins singing, her sweet voice cracking with fear.
speaker_heading: JOVIE
dialog: You better watch out, you better not cry, you better not pout. I'm telling you why...
text: Walter finally arrives. He joins his family, watching Jovie.
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
text: Buddy, risking his life, working on the engine at high speed. Smoke and sparks billow out. Santa struggles to maintain control. They hit a bump and some toys fly out of the back.
text: A Jack in the Box rattles by Buddy, POPPING OPEN.
speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: Ah!
text: They find themselves blocked by a giant FOUNTAIN with the Rangers close behind.
speaker_heading: BUDDY

speaker_heading: SANTA

speaker_heading: BUDDY
dialog: (in triumph)
dialog: YES!! I DID IT!! I'M THE GREATEST ADOPTED ELF IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!
speaker_heading: SANTA
dialog: Good job, Buddy!
text: But now the belly of the coach nails the winged statue atop the fountain, yanking the whole engine back out of the sleigh. YOINK! The machine whirls and shoots off the trees. The engineless sleigh crashes down to the bricks.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (terrible)
dialog: Santa Claus is coming to town!
scene_heading: EXT. THE MOVING SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS
text: Walter's singing somehow does the trick. The CLAUS-O-METER shoots to the MAX!
text: A dash light BLINKS "HO HO HO" as the gauge hits the red zone. Santa howls in approval. The SLEIGH flies up into the night air and over the barricade, reporters and on-lookers. The rangers slide to a stop, foiled at last.
text: As the shadow of the sleigh zips high over them, the whole crowd joins in, singing their hearts out. Jovie can't believe it. She sings even stronger.
