speaker_heading: OPEN ON:
text: "Rock Lobster”, playing over black. Reveal ROBBIE HART
text: playing at a packed wedding reception as credits roll. After
text: all the dancing and credits, the song ends, the audience
text: applauds.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: And now the best man is going to say a
dialog: few words.
text: We hear polite applause.
text: The following is SUPERIMPOSED at the bottom of the screen:
scene_heading: FEBRUARY 7th, 1985.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY - CONT. ACTION
text: As the camera PANS inside, we see well-dressed men, women and
text: children (dressed 1985) seated in groups at big round tables.
text: We hear another voice.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Um, when Greg asked me to be his best
dialog: man, I, uh, I mean I said yes right away,
dialog: but I was kind of nervous...
text: The toast goes on and on. We PAN past a bored bartender, a
text: photographer snapping pictures, various guests starting to
text: lose interest, the GUY at the microphone...
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: ...I mean, Greg's my brother, man. He's
dialog: really been there for me, I mean when IT
dialog: was in rehab, when I had that problem
dialog: with my car... When I got the baby-sitter
dialog: pregnant...
text: ...a goofy uncle with a video camera, guests kicking each
text: other under the table, bridesmaids rolling their eyes and the
text: BRIDE, looking distressed. Finally, as the toast reaches a
text: sort of crescendo of pointlessness, the camera comes to rest
text: on the GROOM, his eyes narrowed in dull hate.
text: The groom stands up, and the camera follows him across the
text: floor as he walks over to the bandstand. There standing
text: patiently, smiling, is the wedding singer, ROBBIE HART.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GUY (0.C.)
dialog: ++-I got a lot of feelings inside me,
dialog: man, and Greg was the only one, the only
dialog: one to say, "Hey, fuck everyone else.
dialog: You got to let those feelings out or your
dialog: head's gonna explode..."
text: The groom leans over and whispers in Robbie's ear. Robbie
dialog: nods.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I mean I'm a person too Dad! God damn it,
dialog: I'm a person too!
text: He grabs a glass of water and then his mic.
text: Robbie cuts off the GUY in mid-toast.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (very up)
dialog: And a great person you are. The best man,
dialog: everyone! Salud!
text: Robbie raises his glass and everyone in the thankful crowd
text: follows suit. The tension is broken.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Love is really a miracle when you think
dialog: about it. Here are two people that were
dialog: born apart, raised and educated apart and
dialog: then through some extra-terrestrial, or
dialog: voodoo or something found one another and
dialog: made that major vow to remain together.
dialog: And here we all are to basically gawk at
dialog: the courage and... and... faith it takes
dialog: to make these vows to stay together
dialog: forever.
text: The BRIDE and GROOM sigh with relief, the entire room fills
text: with the warmth generated by Robbie's love inspiring speech.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: And I want you to know that even if you
dialog: only stay together for forty or fifty
dialog: years, I'll still be incredibly
dialog: impressed. But the way you two look at
dialog: each other and smile at each other, I got
dialog: a feeling a thousand years wouldn't be
dialog: enough for you. Cheers.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED :
text: Robbie cues the band, they start thumping out a tune. A guy
text: named TIMMY is on bass, a guy named JIMMY is playing drums,
text: and a young woman in a billowy yellow dress named ERICA,
text: wearing at least three scarves, is wailing away on guitar.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Now, on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Harold
dialog: Fonda, I'd like to ask everyone to get on
dialog: the dance floor and - celebrate!
dialog: (singing)
scene_heading: CEL-E-BRATE GOOD TIMES - COME ON!...
text: As Robbie continues singing Kool and the Gang's
text: "Celebration", we PAN TO a door, just to the left of the
text: stage. JULIA SULLIVAN, a young waitress, comes blasting
text: through it, two plates of prime rib in each hand.
text: LAWRENCE, aka Dr. Limo the limo driver, Robbie's best friend
text: sidles over to PHIL, the photographer. Lawrence points to
dialog: Robbie.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE.
text: The maestro does it again. He has an
dialog: incredible instinct for the quick save in
text: a human drama.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Maybe he should be taking psychology
dialog: instead of you.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Interesting point. But I'd like to change
dialog: the subject now to that waitress over
text: there and her great body.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: She must be new.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Brand spanking new.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: i'm sure she'd appreciate you talking
text: about her like she's a car.
text: Julia precariously navigates her way through the crowd,
text: finally arriving at the furthest table.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Okay, who wanted the prime rib?
text: Everyone just stares at her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED }

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Nobody wanted prime rib?

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: This table is all fish.

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Be right back.
text: Julia starts making her way back to the kitchen with the four
text: plates. Robbie finishes up his song. Applause.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (genuinely enjoying himself)
dialog: Well, all right! Hey, you guys dance
dialog: nice. You know something, folks, I'm
dialog: getting married myself next Saturday...
dialog: Applause.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Hey, thanks. So, I just want to say that
dialog: I hope that my wedding will be as special
dialog: as Harold and Claudia's.
text: Applause and "awwwww's".
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I really do mean that. One! Two! Three!
dialog: Four!

scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL KITCHEN ~- DAY
text: Julia yells over to the chef.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Four fish!
text: Julia's cousin HOLLY, who is also a waitress, comes over.
text: Even though Holly's wearing the same uniform that Julia is,
text: she wears it a lot more "va-va-va-voomishly” .
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: How's your first night going, cuz?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You remember Mondale against Regan?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Don't worry, once we get the entrees
dialog: served, it's all downhill. Coffee and
dialog: cake is a breeze...
text: Holly notices that Julia is near tears.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, Julia, it's really not so bad. You
dialog: just say “regular or decaf"...
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: It's not that, Holly. Glen hasn't called
dialog: me in a couple of days and with my track
dialog: record I'm Mondale. It's over.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Only you could be this pretty and manage
dialog: to find guys that treat you badly. I
dialog: mean, just because dip shit hasn't called
dialog: doesn’t mean he's ended it with you.
dialog: Besides, let's say he did, it’s not the
dialog: end of the world. Everybody's been
dialog: dumped. Look at me.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Not by dozens of men.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You haven't been dumped by dozens of men.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: One, Brian. Went to jail for
dialog: embezzlement. Two, Bob. Said I didn't
dialog: love him because I wouldn't get fake
dialog: implants. Three, Scott. said he dumped
dialog: me because he didn't want to be .
dialog: monogamous, but it turned out he was gay.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: Have you ever thought of trying out one
dialog: of those computer dating services?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Five, Danny. After ten months he said I
dialog: looked too much like his sister. and now
text: it looks like Glen is number six. Two
dialog: years of my life wasted...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Chef roughly slides four plates in Julia's direction.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: Four fish!
text: As Julia struggles to pick up the plates, she speaks softly
dialog: to Holly.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I thought me and Glen had something
dialog: special. Then again, I thought I had
dialog: something special with all those guys,
dialog: except maybe Scott. I'm just so sick of
dialog: being somebody's latest girlfriend, you
dialog: know? I'm ready for something more than
dialog: that. My mother thinks I should've been
dialog: married at least two years ago. She
dialog: thinks I'm going to end up by myself
dialog: watching re-runs of "Rhoda" with my
dialog: nineteen cats.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY

text: CUT TO the GROOM giving the BRIDE a suspicious look
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: We're gonna lay a little change of pace
dialog: on you right now. Our guitarist, Erica
dialog: Lamonsoff, is gonna sing an original song
dialog: of hers called "Moon Child". Take it
dialog: away, Erica!

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: ALEC
dialog: Ah, you probably don't. I'm two years
dialog: younger than you, I graduated in °81.
dialog: But I was a huge fan of the band, man.
dialog: You guys rocked! Remember when you
dialog: played at homecoming and the cops came?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (smiling at the memory)
dialog: Yeah, that night got a little outta hand.
speaker_heading: ALEC
dialog: What happened to you guys? You were the
dialog: best local band I ever heard. I thought
dialog: you'd be touring stadiums by now. Yeah,
dialog: you were my inspiration man. I mean, I'm
dialog: an accountant all now, but I sometimes
text: play gigs on Saturday night at the 119.
dialog: Maybe you could come hear us sometime.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Sure, call me I'm in the book. You should
dialog: really get your stuff out there man. You
dialog: were really hot.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Well, we kind of drifted into this
dialog: wedding stuff. But it's a lot of fun, I
dialog: really like it.
speaker_heading: ALEC
dialog: That's cool. Hey, you still going out
dialog: with Linda Lerner?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I'm marrying her next week.
speaker_heading: ALEC

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ALEC
dialog: Hey, remember that song "Blood of the

dialog: Do you still write stuff like that?
text: Robbie looks around, kind of embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Well, I'm concentrating on writing some
dialog: more serious stuff. You know, like,
dialog: meaningful...
text: In the background, Erica screeches out the chorus. Her song
dialog: is neither meaningful nor good.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I didn't write this one.
speaker_heading: ALEC
dialog: You must be a good writer though. You
dialog: could probably write a song and sell it
dialog: to a huge band like Foreigner or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Maybe someday. The songs I write now
dialog: aren’t really... polished...
text: Robbie trails off as he sees a TEENAGER across the room,
text: clinging on to the wall for dear life.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Excuse me for a second.
text: Robbie walks across the room to the Teenager, who is drunk.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE

scene_heading: EXT. BACK DOORWAY - DAY
text: The back entrance to the reception hall is a battered screen
text: door at the top of stone steps, surrounded by dumpsters.
text: Julia is sitting on the top step, taking a cigarette break,
text: the sound of the reception muted in the distance.
text: Another sound, that of rushing footsteps, can be faintly
text: heard, but gets louder and louder until...
text: Robbie rushes through the door with the Teenager, blowing
text: Past Julia. He sticks the Teenager's head into one of the
text: dumpsters; the Teenager starts to retch.
text: Julia and Robbie make eye contact. Boing. For a few
text: seconds, the only sound is the Teenager's retching. Then...
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Friend of yours?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Me? No. I just saw what was about to
dialog: happen. I couldn't let him do this in
dialog: front of his friends and/or family. You
dialog: know, the sound of vomiting doesn't tend
dialog: to enhance any party, particularly a
dialog: wedding.
text: Julia smiles.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Well, I'm glad I got to hear it.
text: The Teenager finishes retching. Robbie pulls his head out of
text: the dumpster.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: So are you ever going to drink again,
dialog: kid?
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: No, man, never.
text: The Teenager staggers back inside.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED :
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (shouting after him)
dialog: Good. Remember, alcohol equals puke
dialog: equals smelly mess equals nobody likes
dialog: you... Equals driving under the influence
dialog: equals drunk tanks equals rehab equals
dialog: Ray Milland in Lost Weekend equals liver
dialog: transplant equals do you really want to
dialog: completely destroy your life?
text: The Teenager's gone. Robbie and Julia are alone.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You're the wedding singer, aren't you?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yeah, I guess it is.
speaker_heading: “JULIA
dialog: Could you do me a favor?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, but hey, he wasn't the
dialog: right one then. The right one for you
text: must still be out there.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: The "right one for me" must have skipped
dialog: over me and settled for a college grad
text: with a good job that comes from a wealthy
dialog: family. I'm doomed to wander the earth,
dialog: alone, forever...
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Like the Incredible Hulk?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Yeah. Only not helping people.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I saw you in there helping people, giving
dialog: them fish and coffee and forks. C'mon
dialog: people can't eat without forks, just like
dialog: people can't live without real love. And
dialog: for that you'll need your head.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: And once you've got a head you need
dialog: silverware, especially forks.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I don’t know, you lost me back at the

speaker_heading: GROOM
dialog: Why did Eddie Davis dedicate that song to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BRIDE
dialog: I have no idea! It must be some kind of

speaker_heading: GROOM

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: Really... And then it gets bad again. But
dialog: after awhile it's no big deal. Acceptance
dialog: that's the whole trick when people drive

speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: That's part of my point. If I married at

dialog: me. Why not marry Glen? He's good
dialog: looking, got a steady job with income,
dialog: he's charming.
speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I thought you said men don't like

speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: That was in my day. Your generation is

speaker_heading: JOSEPH

dialog: Joseph Brunk, what can I do you for?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I'm Robbie Hart.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Yes... yes. The singing teacher. So, you
dialog: want to be a franchisee?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Gotta do better than that. We gotta
dialog: convince these people that we're doing
dialog: them a favor to let them part with their
dialog: money in exchange for some immeasurable
dialog: musical skills. Subtle perhaps to the
dialog: laymen, but to the truly musical their
dialog: talent is finally exposed. A price can't
dialog: be put on that. But we reluctantly do.
dialog: Costly but fair. Think you wanna join our
dialog: team?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Uh, how's the pay?.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Man after my own heart. The pay is great.
dialog: Here's what we do, everyone signs a
dialog: contract for thirty lessons in advance.
dialog: If they can't pay, fuck em'. They'll only
dialog: show up for three anyway. We have a no
dialog: money back policy, so we're all set. We
dialog: guarantee results, but we're businessmen.
dialog: You see Robbie, it's not just that you
dialog: teach people how to sing and make money.
dialog: It's that you make money and occasionally
dialog: teach people how to sing. Franchises are
dialog: the future.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Oh and Rob?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: Try and do something about the mood. You
dialog: gotta lift it like a small, heavy plane.
dialog: We don't want to bring people down. Bring
dialog: em' down, they don't want to sing. Don't
dialog: want to sing, don't want to pay. Don't
dialog: want to pay, don't want to see you in my
dialog: store anymore, okay?Get my drift?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JOSEPH
dialog: All right! Nine a.m., peppy and ready to

dialog: beauty. One can't deny a desire for
dialog: attractive children. They have an easier
dialog: way in the world. Right, my boy?

speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: own. But marriage isn't all it's cracked
dialog: up to be. It's a lot of sacrifice, a lot

speaker_heading: TODD

dialog: Although I've been known to do both of
dialog: those things. In case you've forgotten
dialog: we're here at a wedding. We're here to
dialog: celebrate union and possibility and joy.
dialog: And I don't know anybody that does it
dialog: better than Al Green. Instead of dulling
dialog: our senses or moving faster than we
dialog: really feel like moving, isn't it nice to
dialog: slow to a gentle pace where we can
dialog: appreciate gazing into another persons
dialog: eyes who loves you like you's like to
dialog: love yourself. "Let's Stay Together,"

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: JULIA

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Really? No... You can't, you're so... so
dialog: good. I mean you almost had me crying in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No, that wasn't me. That was Al Green. I
dialog: just sang it, I mean I'd love to write a
dialog: song like that. One that people hear with
dialog: their cells, you know, and they say,
dialog: "Hey, I've felt what that guy has felt."
dialog: I used to think I could do that, but now
dialog: I'm not so sure.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Sure you could, Wedding Singer. Did you’
dialog: see how you just entranced them out
dialog: there. I mean if you can do that, you can
dialog: do anything.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Well... that's a really nice thing to
dialog: say,but I disagree.

speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: "Love and Happiness?"
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: "Let's Stay Together."
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Yeah, that's kind of a groovy song, but
dialog: don't you think we should have something
dialog: less whiney and more upbeat?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: You think Al Green is whiney?
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (clears throat)
dialog: I think these details can be determined
dialog: in a more appropriate context. Today we
dialog: need to focus on other matters. The
dialog: church views marriage as a sacrament, a
dialog: holy union before God, unbreakable for
dialog: all eternity. Glen, did you think about
dialog: the importance of your decision before
dialog: you asked Julia to marry you?
text: The Priest notes this in the file, then looks up, closes the
text: file, folds his hands and smiles.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Well, yeah. I mean, I got everything

dialog: decision to wed?
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: {nervous and excited)
dialog: Yes, Father Quinn, I have. A wedding is
dialog: something every girl looks forward to her
dialog: whole life. It's not something to be
dialog: taken lightly, it's a huge emotional
dialog: commitment. All your friends are there,
dialog: all your whole family, they print an
dialog: announcement in the newspaper -
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: {cutting her off)
dialog: Julia, I'm talking about the marriage
text: itself, about actually being Glen's wife,
text: not about the wedding. The wedding is
dialog: really just a symbolic ritual.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I'm with you, your holiness. I mean,
dialog: after a few months the wedding's
dialog: forgotten, and all you have is an album
dialog: of pictures you never look at and a dress
