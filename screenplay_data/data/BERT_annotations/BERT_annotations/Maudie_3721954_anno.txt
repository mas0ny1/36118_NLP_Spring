text: MAUD DOWLEY, (32) an odd, impish little creature, with huge
text: saucers for eyes, is lying on the tall, overgrown grass
text: staring up at the sky, smoking a cigarette. Her fingers are
text: gnarled, her knuckles swollen with arthritis. A shadow
text: repeatedly moves across her face and leaves it.
text: The shadow is from an old swing made of rope and wood,
text: dangling from the branch of a tree. The swing is swaying
text: back and forth. As it slows down, Maud reaches up and gives
text: it another push. She keeps staring at the sky, blowing her
text: smoke towards the sky and watching as it blends into the
text: clouds above. She stares at the clouds curiously, suddenly
text: finding shapes and objects: A bunny rabbit. A steam engine.
dialog: Kittens.
text: AUNT IDA (55), a sturdy, robust woman comes out, carrying a
text: mop and bucket. She is wearing an apron and a scarf around
text: her head. Her sleeves are rolled up passed her elbows.
text: She's heavily into her spring cleaning. Beads of sweat run
text: down her forehead.
text: Maud picks herself up from the ground and takes a seat on
text: the swing. Her feet dangling, unable to reach the ground.
text: Ida hurries past Maud, a woman on a mission.
text: The clothesline is filled with sheets, billowing about in
text: the wind. The fence is lined with hooked rugs, out for
text: freshening. Aunt Ida chucks the water from the bucket off
text: to the side of the house. She takes the mop and starts to
text: whack the rugs. Little clouds of dust appear with each whack.
speaker_heading: IDA
dialog: Look at that, tsk tsk. The dust is
text: going on the sheets.
text: Ida takes the sheets off the line piling them up in her arms.
text: Maud chucks her cigarette butt, gets up and starts to help.
text: She takes the armload of sheets from Ida.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I got it.
text: But then Maud gets tangled in a sheet still on the line, and
text: stumbles. She drops a sheet.
speaker_heading: IDA
dialog: Maud. I'll have to rewash it now.
dialog: It's easier if I do it alone, you're
dialog: too awkward.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ida takes the sheets from her and heads into the house.
text: Maud sits back down on the swing - discouraged.
text: But then, she leans back, stares up at the clouds, as they
text: move swiftly across the sky. The rabbits in the clouds are
text: almost bunny-hopping their way across the sky.
text: Maud gets up and walks towards the house. As she stands on
text: the veranda, she looks out on the landscape in wonder
text: Then she lights up another cigarette....

text: into the austere dining room.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: Here you go. Would you like jam?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: That'd be nice.
text: As Ida leaves the dining room:
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: But I can get it myself Aunt Ida.
text: Moments later, she places the jam down in front of her. As
text: Ida fusses around the dining room:
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: Your brother is coming by tomorrow.
text: Maud looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Why? Is he taking me back home?
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: He's moving to Halifax. So he's
dialog: dropping off a few of your things.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: If Charles and his wife are moving
dialog: to Halifax, the house'll be empty.
dialog: I can live there and take care of
dialog: it.
text: Irene says nothing. Maud takes a sip of her hot tea and it
text: slips from her hand, spilling everywhere.

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA

text: Maud is standing in the mirror, fixing her hair, a little
text: smile on her face.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I'll be down in a minute, okay?
text: Her suitcase is on the bed, with her belongings packed neatly
text: inside. She struggles to put the last bobby pin in her hair
text: then grabs her belongings, and hurries out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. AUNT IDA'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM -- MORNING
text: CHARLES DOWLEY (37), Maud's handsome brother, is leaning
text: against the door frame as Ida brings in his tea.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: Take a seat.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I can't stay long.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: At least stay for a cup of tea and
text: a bit of cake.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: So has she been out, looking for
dialog: trouble?
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: So far, no. She keeps to herself.
dialog: She's been asking to go home.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Did you tell her?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: Not yet. I thought it best you do
dialog: it.
text: By now, Maud is standing in the doorway, having overheard

speaker_heading: OMITTED
text: Maud stands awkwardly, shy and nervous in front of her
dialog: opposing brother.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Hi Charles. Nice to see you.
dialog: Sizing him up:
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my, that's a good jacket you're
dialog: wearing, it's a good fit. You're
dialog: always such a spiffy dresser.
text: She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't tell the difference between
text: a rag and a ball gown.
text: She chuckles, nervously. Then:
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: So? You've come to take me home?
text: He shifts on his feet, and says nothing.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the big secret?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's business. Financial matters.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Well, I'm a natural at math.
dialog: Remember, I used to double check
dialog: your numbers when you were in school?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I don't have much time, I've got to

dialog: few things.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: He points to a little stack of things: books, photographs,
text: and old blanket.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Lordy. You cleared out my room.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Because I sold my house.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: What house. Our house?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It was my house. Mom left it to me.
dialog: I sold it and I'm moving to Halifax
dialog: with the band.
text: Maud is taken aback.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: You can't sell that house. I woulda
dialog: moved back there. I'd be more than
dialog: happy to have my own place, I'd look
dialog: after it --
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You can't look after yourself, let
text: alone a house, and a yard, and bills.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I'd get a job, or something.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Job doing what?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I don't know, something.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm sorry Maud. It's gone.
text: He smiles tightly, then heads towards the door. Maud follows
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Did you spend all the money they

dialog: any of that either.
speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: CHARLES

text: He keeps going towards the door.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Wait. Charles.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: Maud, come get your tea.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Charles!
text: He turns to her.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Good-bye sister.
text: He leaves. Maud watches out the door, a little stunned.
text: Ida sees she is upset.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: He's a busy man, Maud.
text: Maud fights back tears.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Yeah. I know.

scene_heading: EXT. AUNT IDA'S HOUSE - VERANDA -- DAY
text: Maud is sitting on the swing, looking through the contents

text: brushes and paints. Melancholy.
scene_heading: INT. AUNT IDA'S HOUSE - MAUD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Maud is still sitting on the edge of her bed, the lights now

scene_heading: EXT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
text: Music pours out of the jazz club as Maud approaches, trying

text: gathers her nerve and heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
text: Inside a jazz club, filled with people, the flame on a
text: cigarette illuminates a dark corner...
text: It is Maud, puffing on a cigarette, hiding from the crowd,
text: her eyes scouring the room. She has become an expert at
text: being inconspicuous. She smokes with one hand, and with the
text: other she fiddles with her sweater, pulling it up over her
text: chin as she sways to the music.
text: She spots a couple dancing. Studies them for a bit. She
text: looks to another couple sitting at a table, talking
text: intimately. She scours the room. Her eyes land on a group
text: of women. She studies them with quiet admiration as they
text: laugh. She takes note of one woman, DINA SHEA who is
text: obviously pregnant. As she makes her way toward them, she
text: bumps into a_ short, stubby, and bald MAN. Maud sees him,
text: and her face lights up.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Not sure who was gonna knock over
dialog: who.
dialog: (quickly searching
dialog: for what to say next)
dialog: Mmmmm. You smell like turkey supper.
dialog: In a good way.
dialog: (giggles. )
text: He tries to make his way around her, but she stops him.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I love this music. Gets my feet

text: He shoves her aside, annoyed.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Christ, get out of my way. Who let

scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She is about to give up and go home, until she sees Dina,
text: the pregnant woman, sitting on a bar stool by herself. Maud
text: sidles up next to her.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Bet you're seven months.
text: Maud smiles at the woman. She's very attractive, even though
text: she's tired. She's smoking a cigarette.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you started nesting? Getting
dialog: your house all fixed up nice and
dialog: cozy?
speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: Yeah, a little.
text: Maud smiles, looking somewhat envious.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: If you're looking to hire a sitter,
dialog: I'm looking for work.
text: Dina smiles politely.
speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: We won't be hiring a sitter.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: No harm in asking.
text: Awkward silence for a beat.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Not often you sees a lady in your

speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: Yeah, well, my old man is the guy
dialog: with the trumpet, I like to make
dialog: sure he gets home alright, if you
dialog: know what I mean.

speaker_heading: MAUD

scene_heading: CONTINUED: (2) 9.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: The heartburn, that's no fun. And

text: Maud laughs to herself - as if remembering. The woman isn't
dialog: sure how to take Maud.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my, worth it though.
text: Since Maud isn't going away, the woman finally engages.
speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: How old is your baby?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Oh, I don't have a baby.
text: The woman is surprised.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Died at birth.
speaker_heading: DINA
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I didn't see her, but they told me
text: she was really deformed. Sad.
text: Then she looks at Dina, who is mid-puff of a cigarette,
text: somewhat disinterested.
dialog: Maud can't resist:
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Always worried it was cuz I smoked.
text: Dina stops inhaling.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Prob'ly wasn't. Still, you never
dialog: know.

text: Aunt Ida is standing there. A stern look on her face.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: You better not tell me you were out
dialog: at that club.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I wasn't going to tell you that.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I was at the club. But I wasn't

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: You get in trouble again, I'm tossing

speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I'm only looking to meet friends.
speaker_heading: AUNT IDA

speaker_heading: MAUD
speaker_heading: Pssst. Psssst.

speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: Speak to us, O Lord, as you open to
dialog: us the Scriptures and interpret them
dialog: to us for this day.
speaker_heading: ALL WOMEN

speaker_heading: MAUD

speaker_heading: AUNT IDA
dialog: Not now, Maud.
speaker_heading: MAUD

text: As she passes by one house, she admires a family playing
text: with their LITTLE GIRL in a pink dress. She smiles to herself
text: as the little girl squeals over something.
text: She continues on, and gets many strange looks from people on
text: the street, but she does her best to ignore them.
scene_heading: INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY
text: Maud walks into the general store, her wagon left outside.
text: She immediately heads towards the aisles. Her eyes pour
text: over the shelves. MR. MCDOUGAL, the storekeeper, nods at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MR. MCDOUGAL
dialog: Can I help you with something Miss
dialog: Dowley?
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I need a sack of flour.
speaker_heading: MR. MCDOUGAL
dialog: You won't find it on the shelves, I

speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: I know. I like to look at the cans.
dialog: All the different colours. It's
dialog: pretty.
text: She smiles at him - he gives an awkward smile back, not
dialog: knowing how to take her.
text: As Maud walks through the aisles, the bell on the door rings
text: as someone else enters the store. Maud continues to study
dialog: the shelves.
speaker_heading: MR. MCDOUGAL (0.S.)

speaker_heading: EVERETT
text: A housemaid, a housemaid.
text: Mr. McDougal looks at him, not sure if he understands.
speaker_heading: MR. MCDOUGAL
dialog: Not the kind a thing we sell.
text: Everett gives him an angry look.
speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: Am I an idiot? I want to put upa
dialog: sign. A whadayacall. I need you to
dialog: write it.
text: Everett hands him a square of paper. The store keeper looks

text: dictates.
speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)
dialog: "Looking for a housemaid. Must bring
dialog: their own..."
text: Everett struggles to find the word.
speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the word I'm looking for?
speaker_heading: MR. MCDOUGAL
dialog: Sense of humour?
speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: "Cleaning tools". That's good enough.
dialog: Sign my name onto it. Say my house
text: is over the road in Marshalltown.
speaker_heading: MR. MCDOUGAL
dialog: You really need a housekeeper at
dialog: that little house?
speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: What does size got to do with
dialog: anything? You don't got that big of
dialog: a store, and you got three or four

text: Everett leaves without another word. After the bell on the
text: door jangles, indicating Everett's departure, Maud approaches
text: the bulletin board. She looks up and sees Everett's sign:
dialog: Looking for a housemaid...
text: She studies it with great interest. She reaches up to get
text: the note, but it's too high. Maud sees a stool, and she
text: drags it across the floor, climbs up on it. She reaches
text: once more for the piece of paper, this time she snatches it.
text: Then Maud runs to the door and watches as Everett pushes his
text: wheelbarrow down the street. She continues to watch him as
text: he heads off in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - EVENING 14
text: Everett wheels a wheelbarrow along a winding, lonely road.
text: Dogs are barking loudly in the near distance. This alerts
text: Everett, causing him to speed up.
text: He approaches a TINY HOUSE that sits on the side of the road.
text: His yard is littered with junk. His two dogs are tied on
text: outside a woodshed. The dogs are both very agitated, aiming

text: Everett creeps over to his house carefully once he sees his

speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! What did you take!
text: Everett chases him up the road. But he's not fast enough

scene_heading: INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Everett is taking his money, and stashing little bits in
text: different places - a bill inside a mug, a few coins ina
text: jar. Then he lifts up the cold storage trap door in the
text: floor and hides more money in a tin can, then stuffs it into
text: the cold storage and closes the hatch once more.
text: He grumbles to himself. His 13x13 house is cluttered and
text: messy. Lit by a lantern, and heated with a wood stove.
text: After Everett finishes stashing his money, he climbs the
text: ladder up to his loft.
scene_heading: INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - LOFT -- NIGHT
text: Everett pulls off his two socks and lays them side by side,
text: dangling over the bedpost. He climbs under the cover and
text: tucks himself down in his bed. He reaches towards the lantern
text: and turns down the flame until the room goes black.
text: He lays there, in the dark, a tiny bit of moonlight
text: illuminating his face as his heavy breathing attempts to
text: settle into a rhythm. He closes his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDSCAPE - MORNING
text: A wide, landscape shot of the fields and landscape surrounding

scene_heading: INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Everett is alone in a small, dimly lit shack, stoking the

text: for the hiss and dull roar of the fire.
text: As he sips on his tea, he picks up a little toy tin badge,

dialog: loose.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN ROAD, MARSHALLTOWN - DAY

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)

text: and smiles widely.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm Maud. Dowley.
text: Her nose is running from the cold.
speaker_heading: EVERETT

speaker_heading: MAUD

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: Don’t know.
text: She follows him.
speaker_heading: MAUD

scene_heading: INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE — CONTINUOUS 22
text: He tries to watch her out of the corner of his eye, as she
text: takes the place in, a grin on her face. Suddenly, Everett
text: is more aware of his rundown, filthy little house. The air
text: is thick with heat and smoke from the stove. Every surface
text: is filled with clutter and dust.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: So...you’re looking for a cleaner.
dialog: A live in?
speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: I dunno about live in.
text: Maud looks around the one room house.

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: I was hoping you were looking for a

text: around some more, “admiringly”.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D) (CONT'D)
dialog: So this is all yours? This house?

speaker_heading: MAUD

speaker_heading: EVERETT

speaker_heading: MAUD

text: He says nothing.
speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: They says I get on like I’m twelve,
dialog: SO...
text: She pulls the sweater up over her chin, an obvious nervous

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, there you go. No need for a

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Lordy, no. She'd never do that,

dialog: her own home - not that this'd be my

speaker_heading: MAUD

dialog: the fire.
text: She looks around the place. Everett stands, awkwardly
text: shifting on his feet, after a moment, he turns and leaves
text: the house again.
text: More awkwardness as Maud looks for a place to lay her bag.
text: There is no room. Everything is caked in dirt and grime.
text: Finally, Maud sits in a chair, her bag on her lap. She
text: studies several old worn mugs that hang on nails along the
text: wall. Mugs that are chipped and stained, but that had once
dialog: been quite pretty.
text: Everett comes back in with a stack of wood in his arm.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: There you are, thought you left me.

speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: I dunno. I guess -

speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)
dialog: If I got to stand here and tell you
dialog: everything, I’1ll just do it myself.
text: He leaves again. Maud looks around the tiny home. ONE room
text: with a tiny staircase going to a loft upstairs.
text: Nothing but a table, two chairs, an arm chair, a wood stove,
text: and some shelves. Some potatoes and a turnip, some carrots
text: sit on the floor next to the stove. A bucket with water in
text: it as well. Maud stands up. Where to begin?
text: Finally, she unzips her little bag, and starts to unpack a
dialog: few of her things.
text: She notices a horizontal wooden beam, and neatly lays her
text: things on it, in a row: her brush, her mirror, a picture of
text: her mother, one of FLUFFY, her cat, etc.
scene_heading: EXT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Everett is outside, curious about Maud, as he discreetly

text: collecting the dirty dishes.
text: He can hear the sounds of her humming to herself. He turns
text: up his nose at this cheeriness. As he pulls a trolly, Everett

scene_heading: INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Maud has a pot of soup on the stove, and she has a portion
dialog: of the house cleaned.
text: But she has gotten distracted by Everett’s things, unable to
text: resist poking around. She sits in a rocking chair as she
text: sifts through his old tin can filled with tattered photographs
text: and oddities: A photograph of a young boy, with a woman,
text: looks like his mother. A tiny wooden incomplete chiseled

speaker_heading: EVERETT

text: she's about to cry. But instead...
text: ...She turns her back to the wind and leans against it. It

text: It is killing her hands, but she presses on.
text: Meanwhile, she has made an attempt to set the table. His
text: mug and his plate are neatly placed. Two slices of toast
text: wait for him. Some freshly picked wildflowers are placed in

text: Everett completely ignores her and climbs down the stairs.
text: He gathers his things to head out for work. He grabs the
text: toast, slugs back the tea, and heads out the door, without

speaker_heading: EVERETT

speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAUD (CONT'D)
dialog: He used to run one a them jazz clubs

dialog: He always said people were trying to

speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: I owes nobody.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Apparently Charles never owed anyone,

speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: Only if you're stupid.
speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: Maybe. And you're not. You're a

speaker_heading: EVERETT

speaker_heading: MAUD
dialog: And can you think of anyone you owes
dialog: fish to?
text: Everett slinks back in his chair
speaker_heading: EVERETT
dialog: S’pose I owes Linehan’s, I owes them

speaker_heading: EVERETT (CONT'D)

text: Maud looks out the window, and sees Everett chopping wood.

scene_heading: INT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - DAY 158
text: Everett is home by himself. The brightly painted, jam-packed
text: little house feels empty. Everett sits in Maud’s chair and
text: paints a little “Maud-like” painting on a card. He paints
text: dogs. Nowhere near her detail or charm.
text: He stops and stares at her paintings on the wall. The little
text: chicken. So cheerful. So happy. He reaches out and touches
text: the bird. Then turns back to the painting. He scrapes the
text: paintbrush on an old sardine tin, thick with Maud’s paint.
text: Then he signs the card "Everett Lewis". He stares at it
text: long and hard, his eyes filling with tears. Having a second
text: thought, he PAINTS over the name.
text: He looks out the window. No cars. No visitors. Nothing.

scene_heading: EXT. EVERETT'S HOUSE - DAY 159

text: He sits down on the day bed. He kicks off his boots and
text: pulls off a sock. He stares at his feet, one sock on, one
text: sock off. He runs his hand along the empty space of Maud's
text: bed, before clutching her pillow.
text: Then, he looks out the window, and looks up at the clouds.
text: Suddenly, he's able to see the clouds take shape: a cheerful
