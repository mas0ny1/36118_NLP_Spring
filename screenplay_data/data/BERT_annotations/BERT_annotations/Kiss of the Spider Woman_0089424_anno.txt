scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY
text: Tapping to the music are a man's feet in sandals and a
text: gold ankle chain. His linen trousers are rolled up in
text: the heat. Dyed in his silk shirt are small faces of
dialog: Rita Hayworth.
text: He is LEWIS MOLINA, 58, an American who has lived here
text: since jumping ship at 19. His hair is tinted to hide
text: the gray. He has the weathered face of a man who has
dialog: seen it all, and been hurt by most of it.
text: As the camera moves from his feet to his face, we hear
text: Molina reading in a rather effeminate voice.
speaker_heading: MOLINA
dialog: He says he can't come back for
dialog: Christmas like he promised ... and
dialog: he's very sorry he hasn't seen his
dialog: new son yet... and he loves you

text: Spread across his table are envelopes and stamps. A

dialog: (turns to woman)
dialog: Do you want to write him back?
text: The woman is too sad to answer. The boy fiddles with
text: his Star Wars toy. Molina moistens a pen with his tongue
text: and begins to write.
speaker_heading: MOLINA
dialog: Dear Peter, the boys and I were
dialog: delighted to get your thoughtful
dialog: card ...
text: A ship horn BLARES over the music. As Molina writes, we
text: see the interior of his hang-out and 'office.'
text: The restaurant is divided by a folding partition, painted
text: with jungle leaves and spider webs. One side is a bar
text: with weary dockworkers. The other side is a modest dining
text: room with SHIPS OFFICERS at clean tablecloths.
text: GABRIEL, 35, a handsome waiter in a tunic, moves through
text: the tables with a tray of dirty dishes. His well-dressed

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Please, Senhor Molina. I will

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Molina, could I ask you a small
dialog: favor? It's only a hundred. For
dialog: my kid's school. (indicates wife)

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
