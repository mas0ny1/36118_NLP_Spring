speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK
text: The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
text: just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
text: water runs down its face and body.
text: TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the
text: baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
text: her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
dialog: baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:
speaker_heading: MIDWIFE
text: He is strong.
text: The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED. He is then gently held out
dialog: to the new MOTHER:
text: AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
text: divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
text: takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
text: She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: ... hello.
text: CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
text: She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MIDWIFE
dialog: The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?
speaker_heading: MIDWIFE
dialog: (a beat; then)
dialog: She is human.
text: A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
text: into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
text: that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.
speaker_heading: MIDWIFE (CONT'D)
text: Sarek arrives.

scene_heading: 15C EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK 15C
text: SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the
text: rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He
text: looks at the child -- his child -- and says:
speaker_heading: SAREK
dialog: Well done.
text: She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just
dialog: enough rancor:
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: He regards her. Knows he's in TROUBLE --
speaker_heading: SAREK
dialog: Your tone suggests disappointment. The
dialog: Science Council required my presence for
dialog: a session regarding--
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Don't do that. You knew I wanted you
dialog: here.
text: The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.
text: The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a
text: small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,
dialog: clinically:
speaker_heading: SAREK
dialog: As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
dialog: traditionally not present at the moment
dialog: of delivery.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Well traditionally, I'm not the one
dialog: giving birth.

speaker_heading: AMANDA (CONT'D)
dialog: I moved here -- to another planet -- to
dialog: be with you. I needed you to be with me
dialog: today. Holding my hand and telling me
dialog: I'm doing great, even when I'm just...
dialog: breathing the best I can.
text: Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at
text: the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers
text: this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:
speaker_heading: SAREK
dialog: You are correct. I should have been
dialog: here. I am sorry.
text: And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
text: him. And the two look at the baby.
speaker_heading: SAREK (CONT'D)
dialog: I had a thought. That we might name the
dialog: child after one of our respected early
dialog: society-builders. His name was "Spock".
text: She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.
speaker_heading: SAREK (CONT'D)
dialog: Your silence does not suggest enormous
dialog: enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: No... Spock.
text: (smiles, touches his
dialog: face)
dialog: ... Spock.
text: She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.
speaker_heading: SAREK
dialog: The child has your eyes.
text: She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears. She
text: gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
text: revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: ... and your ears.
text: And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
text: we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM

speaker_heading: OFFICER PITTS

dialog: presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.
text: Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
scene_heading: Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we

speaker_heading: AYEL

dialog: You will speak only to me.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN ROBAU

text: to attack a Federation vessel.
speaker_heading: AYEL
dialog: That was hardly an attack. My commander
dialog: will easily destroy your ship. If you do

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN ROBAU

speaker_heading: YOUNG SPOCK

speaker_heading: VULCAN BULLY #1
dialog: Your mother lies with many men.

speaker_heading: VULCAN BULLY #2
dialog: You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and
dialog: therefore, have no place in the universe.
speaker_heading: YOUNG SPOCK
dialog: (swallowing that too)
dialog: This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
dialog: elicit an emotional response from me.
dialog: Logic dictates you would cease by now.
speaker_heading: VULCAN BULLY #1
text: Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,
dialog: don't they?
speaker_heading: VULCAN BULLY #2
dialog: Perhaps an emotional response requires
dialog: physical stimuli.
text: And Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling
text: into one of the bowls. He looks up as:
speaker_heading: VULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D)
dialog: He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
dialog: For marrying her.

dialog: -- When Vulcans get disgusted

dialog: -- Well humans do.

text: front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:
speaker_heading: YOUNG SPOCK
dialog: I did not mean to create conflict between
dialog: you and mother.
text: After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little. No anger in his

speaker_heading: SAREK
dialog: In marriage... conflict is...
speaker_heading: YOUNG SPOCK
dialog: ... constant?
speaker_heading: SAREK

speaker_heading: 46 CONTINUED: 46
speaker_heading: SAREK

speaker_heading: YOUNG SPOCK
dialog: They called you a traitor.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You suggest that I should be completely

dialog: why?
text: Sarek is clearly conflicted by this. But he holds steady:
speaker_heading: SAREK
dialog: As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to
dialog: observe and understand human behavior.
dialog: Marrying your mother... was logical.
dialog: (Spock seems disquieted)
dialog: Spock. You are fully capable of choosing

text: An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before
text: the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,
text: seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE MINISTER
dialog: You have surpassed the expectations of
dialog: your instructors. Your final record is
dialog: flawless. With one exception. I see you
dialog: have applied to Starfleet as well.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: It was logical to cultivate multiple
dialog: options.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE MINISTER
dialog: Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
dialog: accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
dialog: A distinction all the more significant
dialog: given that you will be its first half-
dialog: human pupil. It is truly remarkable,
dialog: Spock. That you have achieved so much
dialog: despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
dialog: the Academy.
text: They all start to rise. But Spock is suddenly unsettled:
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: If you would clarify, Minister-- what
dialog: "disadvantage" are you referring to?
speaker_heading: SCIENCE MINISTER
dialog: ... your human mother.

dialog: father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.
text: His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes
dialog: the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Council -- ministers. I must decline.
text: Everyone STOPS. A solid BEAT. Confused looks turn cold:
speaker_heading: SCIENCE MINISTER
dialog: No Vulcan has ever declined admission to
dialog: this academy.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Then as I am half-human, your record
text: remains untarnished.
speaker_heading: SAREK SPOCK
dialog: Spock. You have made a
dialog: commitment to honor the Vulcan At the moment, Father, I can
dialog: way-- think of no greater way to
dialog: honor our race than to attend
text: Starfleet as its first Vulcan.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE MINISTER
dialog: Why did you come before this council
dialog: today? Was it to satisfy your emotional
dialog: need to rebel?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I came with the intention of enrolling,
dialog: as my father wished. However, your
dialog: "insight" has convinced me otherwise.
dialog: Therefore, the only emotion I wish to
dialog: convey is gratitude. Thank you,
dialog: Ministers, for your consideration.
dialog: (a contained "fuck you")
dialog: Live long and prosper.

speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying.
dialog: What's your focus?
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't
dialog: know what that means.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Let me guess: study of Alien languages:
dialog: phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means
dialog: you've got a talented tongue.
speaker_heading: UHURA
dialog: And for a moment I thought you were just
text: a dumb hick who only has sex with farm

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well. Not only.
speaker_heading: UHURA

speaker_heading: UHURA

dialog: ... and who am I, Captain Pike?
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Your father's son.

dialog: For my dissertation, I was assigned the

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: He sure learned his lesson.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Depends on how you define winning.
dialog: You're here, aren't you?
dialog: (off Kirk's look)
dialog: That instinct to leap without looking--
dialog: that was his nature, too. And in my
dialog: opinion it's something Starfleet has
dialog: lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
text: overly-disciplined.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Those cadets you took on, they'll make

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Come to think of it, I do want to feel
dialog: special. You know what? I'm gonna go

speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Enlist in Starfleet.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Enlist. You must be way down on your
dialog: recruiting quota for the month--
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: If you're half the man your father was,

speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: ... No. Guess not.

speaker_heading: PIKE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: Four years? I'm gonna do it in three.

speaker_heading: ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)

dialog: Academic immorality by one is an assault

dialog: Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this

speaker_heading: ACADEMY PRESIDENT
dialog: Step forward please. This is Commander
dialog: Spock, one of our most distinguished
dialog: graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi
dialog: Maru test for the last four years.
text: Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM. President nods.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow
dialog: managed to install and activate a sub-
dialog: routine in the programming code, thereby
dialog: changing the conditions of the test.
text: We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Your point being?
speaker_heading: ACADEMY PRESIDENT
dialog: In academic vernacular, you cheated.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Respectfully. Define "cheating".
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: To deceive by trickery.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Now let me ask you something I think we
dialog: all know the answer to: the test is
dialog: rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to
dialog: be unwinnable.
speaker_heading: ACADEMY PRESIDENT
dialog: Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of
dialog: the exam is relevant to these
dialog: proceedings.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test
dialog: itself is a cheat.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Your argument precludes the possibility

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Please, enlighten me.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: You, of all people should know, Cadet
dialog: Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.
text: ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed. The cockiness

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: "I of all people?"
speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: How long did it take you to program the

text: The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't,
dialog: it's just too damn entertaining...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Maybe you just don't like that I beat
dialog: your test.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our
dialog: vernacular. I've simply made the logical
dialog: deduction that you're a liar.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What an idiot I am for taking that
dialog: personally --
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to

speaker_heading: 48A
speaker_heading: 83 CONTINUED: (3) 83
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Enlighten me again.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: The purpose is to experience fear. Fear
dialog: in the face of certain death. To accept
dialog: that fear and maintain command of one's
dialog: self and one's crew. This is a quality
dialog: expected in every Starfleet captain.
text: Kirk absorbs that. Then --
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: So you're telling me the point. Of the
dialog: whole thing. Is to be afraid?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Fear is necessary, yes.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no
dialog: additional training to control my
dialog: narcissism when making command decisions.
dialog: No he DIN'T! Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
dialog: but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.
dialog: And I'm sure you're really proud of that,
dialog: who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you
dialog: people don't experience fear at all?
text: ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter
text: how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -

speaker_heading: KIRK (CONT'D)
dialog: And if that's the case -- What's that say

text: holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and
dialog: comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the
dialog: intimacy before -- this is their secret...
speaker_heading: UHURA

speaker_heading: SPOCK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Earth may be his next stop, but we have

speaker_heading: MCCOY
dialog: And how the hell did they do that by the
dialog: way? When did they jump so far ahead in

speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: The engineering comprehension necessary

speaker_heading: MCCOY
dialog: Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: MCCOY

speaker_heading: KIRK

dialog: want with Captain Pike?
speaker_heading: SULU

dialog: future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then
dialog: the logical thing is to be unpredictable.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: You're assuming Nero knows how events are
dialog: predicted to unfold. The contrary:
dialog: Nero's very presence has altered the flow
dialog: of history, beginning with the attack on

speaker_heading: SUDDENLY --

text: KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM -- THEN SUDDENLY HE
text: FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE
text: SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and
text: ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature
text: starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense

text: And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks

scene_heading: 160 INT. CAVE - DAY 160

dialog: but he's fucking LUNCH -- and just as you're SCREAMING, there's
scene_heading: LIGHT -- FIRE LIGHT -- and a FIGURE APPEARS, WAVING A TORCH --

speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME
dialog: ... Jim?
speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME
dialog: I have been... and always shall be...
dialog: your friend.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: -- no, I don't know you -- the only
dialog: Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy.
dialog: Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't
text: that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating:
speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME
dialog: You are James T. Kirk. Your father is
dialog: George, as is your brother. Your

speaker_heading: KIRK SPOCK PRIME

speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)

dialog: is not a matter of coincidence... but
text: rather, indication of a higher purpose.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: ... he'd call it a damn miracle.
speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME
dialog: Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's
text: way of attempting to mend itself. In
dialog: both our histories, the same crew found
text: its way onto the same ship in a time of
dialog: ultimate crisis -- therein lies our
dialog: advantage.

speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME

dialog: inspiration for joining starfleet.
text: This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagine that

speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
dialog: You should know. He proudly lived to see

speaker_heading: MCCOY
dialog: Do you. Okay then: are you out of your
dialog: Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical
dialog: thing? Maybe. The right one?
dialog: Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure
dialog: -- that kid doesn't know how to lose.
dialog: Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have
dialog: a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the
dialog: Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize
dialog: stallion in the stable."
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: ... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a
dialog: stallion must first be broken before it

speaker_heading: MCCOY
dialog: My God, Man... you could at least act
dialog: like it was a hard decision.
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: I intended to assist in the effort to re-

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking
dialog: about! How d'ya think I ended up here?
dialog: I got into a debate with my instructor on
dialog: the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
dialog: pertain to subspace travel... He seemed
dialog: to think that the range of transporting
dialog: say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few
dialog: hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
dialog: I could not only beam a bird from one
dialog: planet to an adjacent planet in the same
dialog: system -- which is no big deal anyway --
dialog: but if I were so inclined I could
dialog: actually do it with a lifeform! So I

dialog: was correct? That it is indeed possible
text: to beam onto a ship that is travelling at
dialog: warp speed. And that you only required

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I haven't been stationed here that long.
dialog: If such an equation had been discovered,
dialog: I'da heard.
speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME

speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: KIRK

text: Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to
text: collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression
dialog: isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.
text: Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But
text: worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin.
text: Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of
text: dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly --
speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I
dialog: hereby relinquish my command on the
dialog: grounds that I have been... emotionally
dialog: compromised. Please note the time and

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I like this ship. It's exciting.

speaker_heading: MCCOY

text: ON KIRK. The moment is upon him.
speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: SULU
dialog: There's not a chance. They're gonna be

speaker_heading: MCCOY
dialog: Even if we could, you can't go in guns

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: SPOCK

speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: What blind spot?
speaker_heading: CHEKOV

speaker_heading: KIRK

speaker_heading: NERO (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand. But you are wrong.
text: And just as Ayel realizes he's fucked, Nero somehow activates

scene_heading: THE OTHER END -- THE END NOW FACING AYEL -- AND JUST AS AYEL'S

speaker_heading: SPOCK
dialog: ... it was a test?
speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME

dialog: You lied.
speaker_heading: SPOCK PRIME
