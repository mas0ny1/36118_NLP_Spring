speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 1	INT. MUSEUM OF IVAN IGOR
text: where he exhibits groups and individuals done in wax.
text: The figures are of historic characters and events.
text: The place is almost in darkness as the steel blinds
text: are drawn on the windows facing the street. Through
text: the back and side windows we see and hear a pouring
text: rain. At the fade in we hear the distant rumbling of
text: thunder, and shortly thereafter there is a blinding
text: flash of lightning through the unshuttered windows
text: showing in clear relief a brutal, sinister face, the
text: black hood and cowl suggesting a medieval monk. We
text: see, lying at the foot of the monkish figure, a
text: seminude figure of a woman whose back is sadly
text: lacerated. She is lying face down. In the monk's hand
text: is a knout or cat-o'-nine-tails, as though he had
dialog: been punishing her.
text: In the background of this shot we see a workbench and
text: a work light. The vague figure of Igor is seen, at
text: work on a nearly completed bust. DOLLY UP TO A
text: CLOSE-UP of Igor's hands. We see that they are the
text: sensitive, fine hands of an artist, dexterous in
dialog: their delicate occupation.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Evidently satisfied, he goes to a basin of water and
text: puts his hands in it and stands as though resting them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3	EXT. STREET LONG SHOT MUSEUM IN BACKGROUND
text: It is raining and we see an occasional flash of
text: lightning. The figure of Worth on the opposite side
text: of street from museum, walking rapidly AWAY FROM
text: CAMERA, comes to a point diagonally opposite museum
text: and glances furtively about, starts toward the
text: entrance. When a policeman appears, he darts quickly
text: to a doorway, concealing himself. The officer crosses
text: the street and disappears along an intersecting
text: street. Worth makes a second endeavor to approach the
text: museum, when a hansom cab draws up to the curb and
text: Dr. Rasmussen and Golatily alight and cross the
text: sidewalk toward door. Worth slinks back to his hiding

dialog: Not at all. He works late and he'll be

dialog: 
text: They knock at door.
dialog:

text: washing hands. He straightens up and glances toward
text: door, showing annoyance, then starts toward door.
text: The knock is repeated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6	EXT. MUSEUM
text: Rasmussen is pressing his face to glass, looks
text: through, and we see, through the glass panel of the
text: door, Igor approaching. When he glimpses his
text: visitors, his expression changes from annoyance to
text: one of extreme pleasure, and hastening his stride he
text: opens the door quickly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (with slight foreign accent)
dialog: Well, well, my friend, this is an
dialog: unexpected pleasure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: (shaking hands with Igor)
dialog: I shouldn't have thought of disturbing
dialog: you but it happens the friend I told you
dialog: of is leaving tomorrow to supervise some
dialog: new excavations in Egypt, and he was
dialog: anxious to look at your collection
dialog: before going away. May I present Mr.
dialog: Golatily?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: It is a great pleasure. I have heard so
dialog: much about you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7	INT. MUSEUM

dialog: 
text: The two visitors are standing at the moment beside the
text: figure of Voltaire. Golatily backs away from it, half
text: closing his eyes and studying it critically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOLATILY
dialog: You could almost expect him to speak. I
dialog: wonder what he'd say after all these years.
dialog: 
text: Igor joins them, laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: You would be astonished. He is more
dialog: difficult now, to those in authority,
dialog: than even the records show. He was a very
dialog: stubborn person, I assure you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Stubborn?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: Unbelievably. For days I argued with
dialog: this fellow before I could get him as I
dialog: wanted him. But always I triumphed ...
dialog: (he laughs)
dialog: ... and few people triumphed over
dialog: Voltaire. And here ...
text: (he throws light switch on
dialog: a peasant mother and child)
dialog: ... we have something that pleases me,
dialog: though of no historic importance. It was
dialog: done because I love to model children.
dialog: 
text: The group is a peasant mother, two children playing at
text: her feet and a nursing babe at her breast.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOLATILY
dialog: But you have no right to hide such genius
text: in a side street museum.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (goes to light switch)
dialog: You are too gracious. These things have
dialog: some merit, I suspect ... but this--
dialog: (throws switch)
dialog: ... I am convinced, is fine.
dialog: (Joining the group.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOLATILY
dialog: (leaning close to figure)
dialog: Even those delicate veins, the texture of
dialog: this flesh -- I have never seen anything
dialog: more exquisite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: My partner believes that I should build a
text: horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous
dialog: crimes and criminals of London. At such
dialog: times Marie Antoinette has reassured me,
dialog: she has promised me recognition for the
dialog: devotion I gave to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOLATILY
dialog: She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If
dialog: you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to
dialog: submit this work to the Royal Academy when
dialog: I get back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: You will have won the undying gratitude
dialog: of us all.
text: (Glancing over his shoulder.)
dialog: Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOLATILY
dialog: (as they cross to door)
dialog: I regret I can't spend the time I'd like
dialog: with your exhibition, but I'm going to
dialog: worry the life out of you when I come
dialog: back.
dialog: (The three laugh.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: It will always afford me great pleasure
dialog: to see you.
dialog: (They shake hands.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOLATILY
dialog: Good night, sir.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: Thank you so much for your visit and

dialog: 
text: They bid each other good night cordially and the two

dialog: 
scene_heading: 12	EXT. MUSEUM
text: The two men pass the spot where Worth has concealed
text: himself. He peers after them from the shadows, then
text: crosses street toward museum and walks toward door of

dialog: 
scene_heading: 13	INT. MUSEUM
text: Igor, with the exuberance of a delighted child, runs
text: to the figure of Marie Antoinette and caresses her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: You heard what he said. You heard this
dialog: man who is very celebrated, what he said
dialog: of you?
text: (He backs away from
text: the figure, laughing.)
dialog: Ho-ho-ho, of course, you would say that.
dialog: You always told me so, of course.
dialog: (Then extending arms to include
text: all the figures in the gallery.)
dialog: And you, my friends -- Robespierre,
text: Danton, Marat, Maximilian, Savonarola, all
dialog: of you, how will you feel to be famous
dialog: again?
dialog: 
text: These figures, whom he has addressed individually in
text: the last speech, are all on a raised platform or
text: balcony, and he has turned and gestured toward each
text: one as he named them. He now turns to Voltaire.
text: Walking toward the figure and shaking his finger at
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: And even you, who scoffed at immortality,
dialog: who wrote so eloquently against the
dialog: thought of immortality, you are
dialog: experiencing it in spite of yourself.
dialog: 
text: We hear the door open and Igor turns.
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (surprised, questioningly)
dialog: Hello! What are you doing here so late?
dialog: 
text: We hear footsteps of someone approaching him as the
text: CAMERA SWINGS and Worth walks into picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: (brusquely)
dialog: I came back for some of the books. I am
dialog: trying to straighten out the accounts. I
dialog: don't hope to impress you, but I may as
dialog: well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (mildly, with no great concern)
dialog: That is unfortunate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 14	CLOSE-UP WORTH
text: He is furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: You're right it's unfortunate! Fifteen
dialog: thousand pounds it's cost me! And you say
dialog: it's unfortunate, as though I'd spilled a
text: spot of grog on my waistcoat.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO A
dialog: 
text: 15	CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (returning to workbench,
dialog: followed by Worth; Igor
dialog: shrugs)
dialog: Your money may have been well invested,
dialog: my friend. Something important may come
dialog: of all this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: Something important has got to come of
dialog: it! Do you know that the rent on this
dialog: place isn't paid?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (sits at bench and
dialog: starts to work)
dialog: Is that a fact?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!
dialog: (Leaning over bench
dialog: confidentially.)
dialog: Now look here, I've an idea that will get
dialog: us out of all this. We haven't twopence
dialog: between us, but we've got these.
dialog: (Draws papers from pocket,
text: slaps them on desk before
text: Igor. Igor glances at them,
text: then up at Worth in surprise.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: Fire insurance!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this
dialog: place would give us ten thousand pounds.
dialog: 
text: Igor rises slowly, unable to believe what he hears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my
dialog: friend?
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: I want the money back I've thrown into
dialog: this rubbish heap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: You are asking to burn these people ...
dialog: you are asking? ...
dialog: (Growing excited, takes a
dialog: few steps away from bench.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: 16	INT. MUSEUM MED.SHOT
text: Igor makes a sweeping gesture that takes in the entire
dialog: room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: ... to destroy all this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling
dialog: you what I'm going to do!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: And you think I will permit this, my
dialog: friend?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it
dialog: that no one comes here? The museum at
dialog: Walston Lane does well enough, and why?
dialog: They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and
dialog: Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber
dialog: of Fleet Street and things people pay to
dialog: see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: And they are welcome to them. To
dialog: perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate
dialog: their crimes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: Well, what do you think I'm in this for?
dialog: (Indicating figures, changing
text: tone and attempting to cajole
dialog: Igor.)
dialog: Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub
dialog: -- and ten thousand pounds to divide
dialog: between us!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: You're insane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: Not at all -- let me show you how easily
dialog: it can be done.
text: (He strikes match and starts
text: toward one of the figures.)
dialog: 
text: Igor springs and whirls him about. Worth strikes Igor
text: viciously and they have a terrific struggle, in the
text: course of which Worth seizes a spirit lamp used for
text: warming wax and hurls it at Igor. He misses his mark,
text: but the lighted lamp falls into the folds of the
text: draperies of one of the figures standing next to that
text: of Marie Antoinette. Igor screams his terror as he
text: dashes to extinguish the flames, and Worth,
text: springing on his back, overpowers him. By this time
text: the fire is spreading to one of the other groups.
text: Worth quickly snatches some of the flaming cloth from
text: this group and tosses it at the feet of other figures.
text: The figures are shown to be melting, gradually losing
text: form, and finally the liquid wax itself ignites with
text: a flash that is almost an explosion. Igor is seen to
text: stir, and Worth, seizing a heavy staff from the hands
text: of one of the figures, strikes him several times.
text: Apparently satisfied that Igor is helpless, Worth now
text: hurries to a rear door and makes his exit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 17	EXT. AREAWAY BACK OF MUSEUM
text: We see Worth come through door, panting and disheveled.
text: He starts away and then returns and locks door, after
text: which he runs from scene.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 18	INT. MUSEUM
text: Igor, dazed and weak, is struggling to his feet. He
text: looks toward the figure of Marie Antoinette, its
text: draperies now a mass of flame. He dashes toward it,
text: catching it up in his arms, attempting to beat out
text: the fire. The whole room now resembles the inside of
text: a furnace, and as Igor, carrying the flaming figure,
text: struggles toward the door, a portion of the ceiling
text: collapses, barring his progress. He turns and
text: staggers toward the rear. His clothes are blazing. He
text: runs to a small iron trap in floor, near which is a
text: group tableau of Sidney Carton on the Guillotine.
text: Lifting the cover, he discloses an empty drain barely
text: large enough to permit the passage of his body. As he
text: disappears through trap, the rope suspending the blade
text: of the guillotine burns through and the knife falls,
text: decapitating the figure, and the head rolls across the
dialog: floor."

speaker_heading: FADE IN ON
scene_heading: 19	SKYLINE OF NEW YORK (miniature)
text: On a building in the foreground is an electric sign,
text: the full width of the building, which reads New York
text: Express. There is a huge illuminated clock dial
text: someplace beneath the sign. The clock shows one
text: minute of twelve. As the picture fades in and the
text: minute hand jumps abruptly to exactly twelve, another
text: electric sign showing the numerals 1932 in red
text: appears immediately beneath the sign New York Express.
text: Simultaneous with this we hear the shrieks of sirens,
text: the honking of automobile horns, the screech of boat
text: whistles in the harbor, the ringing of bells, the
text: rapid firing of a pistol somewhere in the distance,
text: the shouting of the crowd, indicating the passing of
text: the old year. These sounds, in varying degrees,
text: continue all through the following scenes. As this

text: attention of the dwellers, several people open their
text: windows and look out curiously. Some of them are
text: holding cocktail glasses, and as the windows are
text: opened we hear the strains of radio music and other

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 29	CLOSE-UP MONSTER
text: A black-cloaked figure, disproportionate and

text: face is a shriveled bald pate of seared skin and bone,
text: which recedes to a pointed cranium of unnatural
text: contour. His eyes are alight with fanaticism and
text: insanity. The face is a blot of drawn, unwholesomely

text: what traces of human features remain are frightfully
scene_heading: distorted. CAMERA RECEDES TO

scene_heading: 30	MED. SHOT
text: and TRAVELS WITH him as he pushes the carriage

dialog: 
text: 31	CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW
text: He opens the window, which has a single bar from top
text: to bottom dividing its center. He leans out and
dialog: whistles. During all of this we have been hearing the
text: joyous shouts of the merrymakers. In answer to his
text: signal there is a single whistle from someplace below.
text: He throws the sheet aside and fastens a rope around
text: and under the arms of the corpse, which he pushes
text: slowly across the sill into space. After lowering the
text: body, there is a whistle from below. He throws the
text: remainder of the coil of rope out the window, but on
text: the opposite side of the upright bar, so that the
text: rope forms a double strand outside, permitting him
text: to slide to ground level. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS and we
text: PAN WITH the Monster as he returns the slab to its
text: original position. He hears someone approaching and
text: stretches out at length on the slab, covering
text: himself with the sheet. The voices grow louder and
text: the CAMERA SWINGS, PICKING UP TWO attendants and

dialog: Been separated quite some time, hadn't

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Yeah. He was playin' up to some other
dialog: twist. Winton's in bad because he left
text: there just before she folded up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND DOCTOR
dialog: Well, if she committed suicide, with
dialog: laudanum, she probably took it in its
dialog: crude form, and we'll find it in that or
dialog: very close to that state. If someone gave
dialog: it to her, it would be diluted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: How could he give it to her?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE'S VOICE
dialog: The whole thing sounded on the up and up
dialog: to me. The poor kid is too scared to lie.
dialog: He's getting a raw deal.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Florence, seated in chair
text: close to editor's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little
dialog: chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ...
dialog: everybody picking on the little fellow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: If this kid was some unknown soda jerker,
dialog: they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's
text: George Winton and they're playing him up.
dialog: It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat
dialog: editor in New York.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: (glancing from desk where
text: he has been idly scratching
dialog: with a pencil)
dialog: Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't
dialog: social register -- if it was somebody
dialog: like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would
dialog: hang him! And another thing, all this
text: gaga about the body disappearing. Eight
dialog: bodies have been stolen in New York
dialog: within the last eighteen months. Doesn't
dialog: it seem more reasonable to hook this up
dialog: from that angle?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be
dialog: silly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: No, I mean it. I think this kid's
dialog: entitled to a break.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: He's getting a break, ain't he? He's
dialog: front page.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: You give me a pain!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in
dialog: for crusading in the cause of justice?
dialog: This lousy mug, with all the money in the
dialog: world, has had two or three nasty affairs.
dialog: He's kept out o' print because his great-
dialog: grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped
dialog: that body -- he was in jail.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: You don't think he'd be sap enough to do
dialog: the job himself. I hope they give him the
dialog: works. Even if he didn't kill the kid,
dialog: he's responsible for her death, and
dialog: they can fry him any time without
dialog: making me sore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: (rising angrily)
dialog: Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough
dialog: about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: And they never proved anything against
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Except that he disappeared when things
dialog: got too hot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Or was bumped off by someone who was
text: afraid of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
text: Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Well, that's got nothing to do with this
dialog: case. Can I handle this my way?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.

speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: All right, you said I was fired. Well, I

text: but he's scared and hysterical -- and so
dialog: kinda dumb and worthless ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give

speaker_heading: TONIGHT
scene_heading: FIRST TIME IN AMERICA
text: and in front of the place, as CAMERA MOVES UP AGAIN

text: his attention is caught by the protruding end of a
text: whiskey bottle which shows in the pile. He picks up

text: A number of workmen, including painters, carpenters,

text: etc. In the center of the room, watching them, is Ivan
text: Igor. CAMERA MOVES TO A
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 58	CLOSE SHOT OF IGOR
text: He is much changed, but still recognizable as the man
dialog: we knew before the fire. His beard and hair are almost
dialog: white and have been permitted to grow to far greater
text: length, but the features are essentially the same,
dialog: except that when he speaks or moves his face is
text: strangely immobile. He is seated in a wheelchair,
text: which is propelled by sprocket wheels on the arms of
dialog: the chair. In order to manage this, there is a special
text: cup or basket attached to the handles, as his hands
text: are hideously deformed and practically useless for
text: the purpose. He is impatient and angry with the
text: workers, venting his anger immediately the janitor
text: appears. Igor propels the chair forward.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 59	MED. SHOT IGOR AND JANITOR

dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (to janitor)
dialog: Does it take you all morning to sweep
dialog: that patch of sidewalk? Come, clean up
dialog: this mess, and don't try to sweep this
dialog: trash behind those screens. I want it
dialog: removed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANITOR
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
text: Starts to clean up around nearest group. Igor wheels
text: toward another group, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA, and
text: addresses workmen angrily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: Come, look, you fellows. You spend two
dialog: days on something that should have taken
dialog: two hours.
dialog: 
text: One of the workmen turns angrily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: Say, listen, Old-Timer, they abolished
dialog: slavery in this country a long time ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: Is it slavery to do what you're being paid
dialog: for? I have announced the opening of this
dialog: museum tonight.
dialog: 
text: Wheels angrily away. The workman laughs. CAMERA FOLLOWS
text: Igor as he wheels to end of museum where Hugo and Ralph
dialog: are at work putting the finishing touches on two
text: individual figures. Hugo is a man of middle age, with
text: an insane, crafty face, unkempt hair and several days
text: growth of beard. He smiles continually to himself as
text: though some secret of his own amused him. He is deaf
dialog: and dumb and when excited or angry emits strange
text: terrifying growls similar to the noises we heard
text: the Monster utter. Ralph is rather a nice-looking
text: youngster and seems engrossed in what he is doing.

dialog: That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong
dialog: with it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a
dialog: great sculptor --
dialog: (laugh)
dialog: A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at
dialog: least two inches too long.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: But the composition as a whole -- I've
dialog: tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: If it is freedom to represent people with
dialog: limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you
dialog: have achieved your purpose. Anatomy!
dialog: Heaven forgive you. You must have studied
dialog: with a sideshow of freaks!
dialog: 
text: CAMERA SWINGS as Igor whirls chair and sees Hugo's
dialog: piece.

speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: And this fellow! Look, I ask you ...
dialog: look what this cobbler is doing!

text: Ralph grins. Igor takes one of the crutches that ride

text: shoulder. Hugo turns with a startled growl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (pointing with crutch to
dialog: figure which looks not unlike
dialog: Hugo himself -- shouts)
dialog: What is this? Are you so beautiful that
dialog: you make everything in your own likeness?
dialog: 
text: Hugo utters an uncanny sound identified with deaf-mutes.
text: Igor, realizing that Hugo doesn't hear him, just waves
text: him back to work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: It's a great mercy of Providence that this
text: fellow cannot hear.
dialog: (Turning back to Ralph,
text: suddenly extends two horribly
text: maimed, clawlike hands toward
dialog: Ralph.)
dialog: Look! Look at those claws! If I had those
dialog: hands of yours, I would show you the
dialog: meaning of what you are trying to do. All
dialog: those beautiful things that were destroyed
dialog: I could restore. It is a great irony that

dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: And now, my friend, you are to see
dialog: something that one can in truth describe
text: as art. Professor Darcey doesn't try to
dialog: keep freedom and sketchiness in his
text: figures. He is an artist. He works at
dialog: home, hours, when such people as you are
text: loafing. He is an artist.
dialog:

speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean,
dialog: dear?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Well, you see, the old chap is pretty
text: anxious to open on schedule. All of his
dialog: advertising announced the opening tonight.
dialog: 
text: As Ralph continues his explanation to Charlotte, CAMERA
text: TRUCKS UP BEHIND Florence, and OVER HER SHOULDER THROUGH
text: glass panel we see interior of museum with the various
text: figures. Close to door we see the janitor carrying on his
text: shoulder the Joan Gale figure which he places on a
text: pedestal in foreground. He carries the figure in such a
text: position that we see the back of it first, and as he
text: places it on the pedestal he turns it around so that we
text: see the face. CAMERA CONCENTRATES for several minutes
dialog: on this figure.
scene_heading: 74	CLOSE-UP FLORENCE
text: Florence stares at it, puzzled. Then recognition dawns.
text: Ralph enters PAST CAMERA and goes to door. He is about
text: to hurry into museum, when Florence detains him by a
text: hand on his arm. As she turns, we get the two in
text: profile. Her expression is one of excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Listen, Genius, what're the chances for me
dialog: to slip in and give this place the once
dialog: over?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR'S VOICE
dialog: (heard through partly opened door)
dialog: Ralph! Burton! Are you going to stay out
dialog: there all day?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: (drawing door to quietly
dialog: and lowering his tone)
dialog: I don't know ... the old man's pretty
dialog: peppery right now. Why don't you look in
dialog: tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: He might get some publicity out of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: (looks through glass
dialog: panel to Igor)
dialog: Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy
dialog: for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a
dialog: pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo
text: on his ear.
dialog: 
text: She pushes past Ralph and enters museum, followed by Ralph.
dialog:

dialog: Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and
dialog: you'll only get me in Dutch.

dialog: 
text: He suddenly looks up and sees Charlotte, who enters
text: museum a bit hesitatingly. Igor stops speaking abruptly
text: and sits, staring.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 76 	CLOSE-UP CHARLOTTE FROM IGOR'S ANGLE
text: We see Charlotte, smiling slightly. Then DOUBLE-EXPOSED
text: over her figure comes the costume worn by Igor's Marie
text: Antoinette in the London museum. This FADES IMMEDIATELY
text: and we see Charlotte as she is, smiling at Igor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 77	CLOSE-UP IGOR
text: staring, fascinated. CAMERA DRAWS BACK to include the
text: group again and Ralph notices something strange in
text: Igor's manner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: What's the matter, Mr. Igor?
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (as though coming
dialog: out of a trance)
dialog: Nothing -- nothing at all, my boy. I
dialog: should like to meet your friend.
dialog: 
text: Florence, taking advantage of the introduction, slips
text: away, as CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS, and, to avoid suspicion,
text: looks carefully at several figures during the
text: following conversation, finally arriving before the
text: Joan Gale figure, where she stops and studies the
dialog: figure carefully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte,
dialog: may I present Mr. Igor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Delighted, I'm sure.
dialog: (Igor extends hand to her.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: If you will forgive this poor, crippled
dialog: stump, my dear, I am very happy to know
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: (laughs whimsically)
dialog: Although you would be amused if I were
dialog: to tell you that I knew you before you
dialog: were born. Before this terrible thing
dialog: happened to me ...
text: (His voice quavers.)
dialog: ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even
dialog: if I had not met with this disaster, I
dialog: could never have hoped to do anything
dialog: finer, probably nothing quite so fine.
dialog: And, my child, you are that figure come
dialog: to life. I wonder, some time, would you
dialog: pose for one of my sculptors who does
dialog: very excellent work?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I'd love to, at any time.
dialog: 
text: Florence, who seems to have satisfied herself as
text: to the identity of the figure, turns abruptly
text: and comes toward them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Well, I'm a woman who craves nourishment.
dialog: Let's ankle out of here and find a beanery.
dialog: Come on, Moon-struck.
dialog: (Takes Charlotte by the arm.)
dialog: Let's get going.
dialog: 
text: Sparrow, who has been hovering in the background,
text: approaches the group and stands just behind Igor's

text: Charlotte smiles back at Igor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: We'll be coming to the opening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: At any time. You will always be welcome.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: (to Igor)
dialog: So long, Pop, see you in jail.

speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Until this evening.
dialog: 
text: The two girls exit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 78	EXT. IN FRONT OF MUSEUM
text: The two girls come from building and are starting toward

text: swings in to curb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Listen, Kid, I'm going to leave you flat.

dialog: But what about lunch?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE

dialog: 
scene_heading: 79	INT. MUSEUM
text: Hugo and Ralph return to work. Sparrow stands beside
text: Igor, who is addressing Ralph.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: And you, young man, it is a matter to
dialog: astonish one. You are engaged to that
dialog: beautiful girl, who was just here. You
dialog: have lived close to that beautiful
dialog: creature, and yet you produce such
text: caricatures as this.
dialog: (Indicating Ralph's work.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Charlotte is lovely, isn't she?
dialog: 
dialog: Igor, who seems to be in much better temper than we
text: have seen him for some time, laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: Exquisite! But I am going to rechristen
dialog: her for you, my friend. She is not to be
dialog: Charlotte any more, she is Marie
dialog: Antoinette.
dialog: 
text: Igor points to picture of himself and the figure of
dialog: Marie Antoinette.
text: Sparrow, who has been standing near them, comes closer
text: to Igor, as CAMERA MOVES UP TO CLOSE SHOT. A look of
text: extreme cunning appears on his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPARROW
dialog: She is exactly like that statue?
dialog: 
text: Picture clearly shown on wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IGOR
dialog: She is the soul of that statue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPARROW
dialog: I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS as Hugo laughs knowingly. Sparrow
text: turns quickly and looks at him suspiciously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPARROW
dialog: What are you laughing at?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: I used to be married to one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: But who did it?
text: Sparrow, who has been standing in background during

text: extreme uneasiness as Igor replies.

speaker_heading: IGOR

text: After Ralph is gone, Hugo takes a black, loose ulster

dialog: But why? She's the best friend I've got.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Nonsense. She's one of the nicest

speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Well, I do say it.

speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: You wouldn't have said that before

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I'd call it stupid at any time.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Well, that's just how stupid I am. When

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (stops and draws her

speaker_heading: WINTON
dialog: Don't you think this would be as good a

dialog: What's it all about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Well, as one of the interested parties, I
dialog: suppose I might as well tell you the glad

dialog: following had something to do with the
text: robbery at the morgue.
dialog: 
text: Winton shows nervousness and distaste.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINTON
dialog: Now look here. It's not up to us to do
dialog: our own detective work. I've had enough
dialog: trouble over this matter. I don't want
dialog: anything more to do with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Not even if it gives you a clean bill of
dialog: health?
speaker_heading: WINTON
dialog: Not even then. The police are the proper
dialog: people to conduct this affair. Now if
dialog: you've got any suspicions I'll drive you
text: to the nearest police station.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: What! And let every rag in town grab a
dialog: red-hot story? Not so you could notice it!
dialog: Now, look, I want you to drive me around
dialog: the corner and wait for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINTON
dialog: I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: (jumping from car)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINTON
dialog: Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through.
dialog: What do you want me to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: I told you what to do. Drive around the

speaker_heading: SPARROW

dialog: No, I'm not. But I've had the uncanniest

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORTH
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Nobody's watching you. You're yellow and
dialog: your nerves are gone. And let me tell you,
dialog: I'll do nothing to help your nerves until

dialog: that through your head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPARROW
dialog: All right, then, I'll phone.
dialog:

scene_heading: 120	EXT. FRONT OF WORTH'S HOUSE

text: which she tries cautiously. Finding it locked, she tries
text: to peer through window, and finally tries lower sash,
text: which opens. She climbs through window to basement.

dialog: 
scene_heading: 122	INT. BASEMENT ROOM IN WORTH'S HOUSE
text: Florence is feeling her way about. She passes in front

text: contain a coffin. She gasps and springs to her feet,
dialog: terrified.

speaker_heading: WINTON
dialog: I don't think it concerns you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND DETECTIVE
dialog: Come on, Winton. Cut out the bluffing.
dialog: We've been watching you ever since you
dialog: left The Tombs and you've done some
dialog: pretty suspicious things. Now what are
dialog: you doing here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINTON
dialog: What have I done that's suspicious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRST DETECTIVE
dialog: For one thing, you had a visitor at your

dialog: 
scene_heading: 124	INT. BASEMENT IN WORTH'S HOUSE

dialog: Hang onto him, Paul. I'll get the other

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is

dialog: I saw the most horrible thing down there.
dialog:

dialog: Are you giving me this straight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Don't take my word for it. Get down there

scene_heading: 132	INT. OFFICE IN WORTH'S HOUSE

text: The Monster appears through the door Worth just made an
text: exit through, comes to the center of the room and stands
text: listening. Evidently they become tired of ringing, with
text: no response, for we hear them start to batter in the
text: door. The Monster turns and vanishes quickly the way he
text: came. We hear the door shattered and, after a moment's

speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Nobody here, Chief.

scene_heading: 134	INT. WORTH'S OFFICE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: Can you give me a description of the
dialog: person you saw?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't
text: like anything human. He hobbled and swayed
text: like a monkey, and the face, from the
dialog: glimpse I got of it in the light from the
dialog: street, was like an African war mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: You mean he was colored?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLORENCE
dialog: Oh, what wouldn't I give for a slug of gin!

speaker_heading: SPARROW
