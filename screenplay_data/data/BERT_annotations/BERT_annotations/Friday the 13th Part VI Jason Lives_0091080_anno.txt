scene_heading: TWO SHOT ON THEM
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWES
dialog: (becoming more nervous)
dialog: Yeah, I know. But I still don't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Seeing it won't. But destroying

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: TRACKING along a row of tombstones, we follow Tommy and his

dialog: 
text: Tommy's eyes squint to read each tombstone, looking for the
text: one. LIGHTNING FLASHES.
scene_heading: WIDER - ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: Getting frustrated, but far from giving up, Tommy moves to

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON JASON'S GRAVE
dialog: 
text: LIGHTNING illuminates the tombstone that reads "Jason

scene_heading: TIGHT ON TOMMY

scene_heading: ANGLE ON ANOTHER GRAVE
dialog: 
text: Close to Jason's marker we see another. It reads "Pamela
dialog: Voorhees - Beloved Mother."
dialog: 
text: FULL SHOT ON TOMMY AND HAWES
dialog: 
text: Returning his attention to Jason's grave, Tommy points "this
text: is the one" to Hawes, who gulps and nods. Putting down the
text: other items, the boys take hold of the shovels. Tommy raises
dialog: his up first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SHOVEL
dialog:

text: it removes a large chunk of grass and dirt.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON OUR GRAVEDIGGERS

scene_heading: TIGHT ON COFFIN
dialog:

text: cracks open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: He hands the crowbar back to Hawes. They exchange a look and
text: a deep breath. Tommy then goes for it. His hands extend

dialog: 
scene_heading: TOMMY'S FINGERS
dialog: 
text: slip into the narrow space beneath the coffin lid.
dialog: 
text: PRESS IN TIGHT ON HAWES' FACE
dialog:

dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON JASON IN COFFIN
dialog: 
text: With a BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHTNING, the lid swings open to

speaker_heading: HAWES GASPS
dialog: 
text: He fights with his stomach to keep his dinner down..
dialog: 
scene_heading: TOMMY CLIMBS OUT OF GRAVE
dialog: 
text: He turns and stares down at his nemesis. A slow hatred begins
text: to build. We PRESS IN on Tommy, HEARING his horrid memories:
text: His sister screams, NO, TOMMY, NO while 10-year-old Tommy
text: kills Jason, repeating, "DIE, DIE!"
dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHT ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: As he listens, his eyes well up with a violent rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER
dialog: 
text: Tommy looks around vengefully. Seeing an old fence a few
text: yards away, he heads for it. Hawes is confused by his
dialog: actions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWES
dialog: Hey, where are you going?
scene_heading: TRACK WITH TOMMY
dialog: 
text: Without a word, he storms over to the rusty fence. He grabs
text: one of the spearlike posts and pulls it out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - DOLLY BACK
dialog: 
text: With fire in his eyes, Tommy stalks Jason with the weapon.
text: THUNDER ROARS ABOVE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWES
dialog: 
text: rushes up to Tommy, greatly alarmed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWES
dialog: What's that for? Tommy, what are
dialog: you doin', boy?!
dialog: 
text: The boy storms right past him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: REACHING THE GRAVE
dialog: 
text: Tommy glares down hatefully at this monster who has destroyed

text: and jumps down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You bastard!
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: As he lands in the grave, Tommy plunges the spear down with
text: a mighty force. THUNDER AND LIGHTNING BLAST HELLISHLY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SPEAR
dialog: 
text: penetrates deep into Jason's chest.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HAWES, DUMBFOUNDED
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWES
dialog: Oh, shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: 
text: withdraws it, then angrily rams it down again and again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON JASON'S FACE
dialog: 
text: The force of the blows causes many of the numerous maggots to
text: start dropping off his face. Grossly decayed flesh is
text: illuminated the LIGHTNING.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON TOMMY'S FACE
dialog: 
text: Exhausted, his rage finally vented, he drives the spear into
dialog: Jason for the last time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE DOWN - ON TOMMY AND JASON
dialog: 
text: Over the boy's shoulder we see the long spear extending out
dialog: of Jason's cold heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER
dialog: 
text: Recovering from his tantrum, Tommy climbs out of the grave.
text: Hawes stares open-mouthed at his friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWES
dialog: Boy, he must've really messed you
dialog: over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: 
text: reaches down, picks up Jason's hockey mask, and stares at it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INSERT - HOCKEY MASK
dialog: 
text: It seems to stare back evilly at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah. Fuck you, Jason.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RESUME TOMMY
dialog: 
text: Tommy, knowing the nightmare is finally over, tosses the mask
text: into the grave. He then bends down and starts to uncap the
dialog: gas can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER ON SCENE
dialog: 
text: Without warning, the sky EXPLODES with a mass of LIGHTNING.
text: One of the BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY is drawn to the spear as to
text: a lightning rod. SPARKS fly as the spear is struck and
text: electrified. Tommy and Hawes dive for cover.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHT ON JASON'S FACE
dialog: 
text: JASON'S DECOMPOSED EYELIDS FLASH OPEN!
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON TOMMY AND HAWES
dialog: 
text: Uncovering their heads, they look skyward in fear. Quickly,
text: Tommy gets to his feet and goes for the troublesome spear.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: The unintended lightning rod is still smoking a little from
text: the blast. He touches it. It's hot. He pulls out a pair of
text: gloves from his jacket. Putting them on, he then attempts to
dialog: remove the spear. He can't get proper leverage. So Tommy
text: jumps down into Jason's grave.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: He struggles to pull the spear out. It's apparently driven
text: into the bottom of the coffin as well. Hawes leans down into
dialog: the grave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWES
dialog: Let's just get the hell out of
dialog: here. My heart can't take any
dialog: more of this.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON JASON'S FACE
dialog: 
text: Jason's wicked eyes glare at Tommy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RESUME TOMMY
dialog: 
text: The boy, of course, does not see what's about to occur. He
text: finally yanks the spear out, and throws it up onto the grass.
text: Slowly he removes his gloves and tosses them to Hawes. He
text: starts to climb out. JASON SPRINGS UP FROM BEHIND AND GRABS
speaker_heading: HIM.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON HAWES SCREAMING
dialog: 
text: He goes crazy with hysteria. He starts to run.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE DOWN - ON GRAVE
dialog: 
text: Tommy fights for his life as Jason tries to pull him down
text: into the grave. He manages to kick Jason back down long
dialog: enough to climb out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: 
text: scrambles for the gas can as the STORM CLOUDS DETONATE ABOVE.
text: He gets it open, turns around, and starts throwing it on the
text: rising corpse of Jason.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON JASON
dialog: 
text: The gas splashes all over him as he keeps coming!
scene_heading: REVERSE ON TOMMY
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHTER - ON JASON
dialog: 
text: He's coming closer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHTER - ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: Panicking, he searches his pockets for the matches. He finds
text: them. As he pulls them out, the STORM CLOUDS ERUPT WITH AN
scene_heading: INCREDIBLE DOWNPOUR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: 
text: stops as the rain drenches him. Maggots start to wash off

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RESUME TOMMY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY'S HANDS
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: 
text: starts to close in. Suddenly HAWES EMERGES FROM BEHIND,
text: HOLDING UP A SHOVEL. He HOLLERS as he swings it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON HAWES
dialog: 
text: He WHACKS the back of Jason's head as hard as he can. It
text: doesn't even faze his undead superkiller.
dialog: 
text: JASON WHIPS AROUND ON HAWES
dialog: 
text: His arm lunges forcefully at Hawes' chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE HAWES' BACK
dialog: 
text: JASON'S HAND, CLUTCHING HAWES' HEART, BURST OUT HAWES' BACK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON GRAVE

scene_heading: TIGHT ON COFFIN

scene_heading: ANGLE ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: Horrified and weaponless, he runs like hell.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tommy races out of the cemetery to his pickup. He jumps into
text: the truck and takes off in the rain.

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: With his back to us, Jason dons his beloved hockey mask and

scene_heading: REVERSE ON TOMMY

speaker_heading: LIZBETH

speaker_heading: LIZBETH
dialog: 
text: stares at the gun, then at Darren, in shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZBETH
dialog: Where'd you get that?

speaker_heading: DARREN
dialog: Don't worry about it. Just stay

speaker_heading: LIZBETH

speaker_heading: JASON

dialog: 
text: With great apprehension he heads toward Jason, holding the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARREN
dialog: All right, scumbag. Get out of
dialog: the road.
dialog: 
text: From over Jason's shoulder we see Darren cock the trigger and
dialog: aim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARREN
dialog: Now!
dialog: 
text: Instantly Jason rams the spear into the other headlight! He

speaker_heading: LIZBETH

speaker_heading: LIZBETH
dialog: Darren, get in here right now!

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DARREN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: 
text: suddenly CHARGES him!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DARREN AND JASON
dialog: 
text: Darren fires. But the bullet either misses or it just

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SPEAR
dialog: 
text: drives right through Darren's stomach and out his back!
dialog: 
scene_heading: PRESS IN ON LIZBETH
dialog: 
text: She goes hysterical.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ON JASON
dialog: 
text: Effortlessly, he lifts up the impaled boy and tosses his limp

dialog: 
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
dialog: 
text: Lizbeth gasps. Quickly, she tries to drive away. Seeing
text: something coming, she dives across the other seat. JASON'S
text: SPEAR SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND IMPALES ITSELF INTO
text: THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON LIZBETH
dialog: 
text: The terrified girl crawls out of the open passenger door.

scene_heading: MOVING SHOT - ON JASON
dialog: 
text: He withdraws his weapon from the car and heads for his victim.

speaker_heading: LIZBETH

dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHT ON LIZBETH
dialog: 
text: Knowing it's hopeless to run, she tries a last-ditch effort
text: to barter for her life. Lying in the muddy water, Lizbeth
text: digs into her jacket. She pulls out her wallet and removes
dialog: her money and credit cards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZBETH
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Don't kill me, please. You can
dialog: have these.
dialog:

scene_heading: BACK TO LIZBETH
dialog: 
dialog: She is amazed. Where did he go? What's the difference --
text: she's safe. WRONG. As she looks behind her, JASON'S FEET
text: SLAM DOWN IN THE WATER NEXT TO HER HEAD. She opens her mouth
dialog: to scream.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - UP ON JASON
dialog: 
text: He raises the spear and RAMS IT DOWN TOWARD HER FACE! A
text: spine-chilling CRUNCH is HEARD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER
dialog: 
text: Jason stands over his victim... Her body floats on the filthy
text: water, but her head is drive down underneath. BLOOD begins
text: to bubble up around the extended spear.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HER HAND
dialog: 
text: A lifeless hand releases the money and credit cards it was

scene_heading: MOVING SHOT - ON GROUP
dialog: 
text: Entering from the bright sunshine are the sheriff and four
text: kids in their late teens. Teasing, holding on to the arm of

text: very boy-crazy; and CORT, with his long hair and heavy metal
text: T-shirt, is always ready to rock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (to sheriff)
dialog: Come on, Dad. You could have Rick
dialog: drive down Cunningham Road and
dialog: look for them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Megan, my deputies have more
dialog: important things to do than look
dialog: for camp counselors with car
dialog: trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORT
dialog: Sheriff, couldn't you like put our
dialog: an all-points bulletin for them?
dialog: That would be really wicked decent.
dialog: 
text: The sheriff shoots him a look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAULA
dialog: It's just that Darren and Lizbeth
dialog: are in charge of organizing and
text: setting up the new campgrounds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SISSY
dialog: All the little kids arrive today.
dialog: We're not ready to deal with that

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SHERIFF
dialog: 
text: He sits down behind his desk and picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I sympathize with you kids. The
dialog: best I can do is call the station
dialog: in Carpenter and have them keep a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY (O.S.)
dialog: I got a bad feeling of what
dialog: might've happened to them.
dialog: 
text: Everyone turns to look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You've got to convince the sheriff
dialog: to look for your friends.
dialog: Hopefully, they're fine. But
dialog: there's a very good chance that
dialog: Jason...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SHERIFF
dialog:

speaker_heading: SHERIFF

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Jason who?

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (ordering her)

scene_heading: ANGLE ON MEGAN AND TOMMY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (sincerely)

speaker_heading: WIDER ON SCENE

speaker_heading: SHERIFF

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: No!...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: But, Dad, we...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (very firmly)
dialog: Megan, take your friends back to
dialog: the camp. I'll let you know if I
dialog: hear anything about your
dialog: counselors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON MEGAN
dialog: 
text: She wants to argue, but the look in her father's eye tells

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (wisecracking)
dialog: Don't beat him up too bad, he's
dialog: kinda cute.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: On the door is closed, the steely-eyed sheriff leans in close

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I was going to call the clinic and
dialog: have them collect your ass. But
dialog: I don't want you around here any
dialog: longer poisoning my daughter, or
dialog: anyone else, with your warped mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (extremely concerned)
dialog: But they have to be warned,
dialog: Sheriff. Jason will return to the
dialog: area that's familiar. No matter
dialog: what you call it, it's still Camp
text: Crystal Lake to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF GARRIS
dialog: 
text: walks away, not listening to Tommy. He straps on his holster
text: and puts on his coat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (deadly serious)
dialog: We're gonna escort you and that
dialog: shit-pile pickup of yours to the
dialog: edge of my jurisdiction....

scene_heading: ANOTHER AREA OF THE FOREST
dialog:

speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: That's your problem, Larry.

speaker_heading: CORT
dialog: Yeah, he was really into it.

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON MACHETE
dialog:

speaker_heading: SHERIFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER
dialog: 
text: Angry and out of breath, the sheriff pins him down to cuff

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (clenching his teeth)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE

text: Gripping Tommy's arm with one hand, he points at something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Well, he must've got chilly in the
dialog: night and pulled the dirt back
dialog: over.
dialog: 
text: Tommy looks around to where the sheriff is pointing. The boy

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY'S P.O.V.
dialog:

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That's not right. Somebody

dialog: ...I gotta see it...
dialog: 
text: The sheriff yanks him back. The deputy pulls his .357

dialog: head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (very icy)
dialog: Now see what you've done. You've
dialog: made my deputy draw his revolver.
dialog: That could be a serious headache
dialog: for you. He's been dyin' to try
text: out his new mail-order laser scope.
text: The deputy presses his gun's grip. Instantly a tiny, bright
text: red beam appears on Tommy's temple.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF

speaker_heading: WIDER ON SCENE

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I don't find it amusing that the

speaker_heading: SHERIFF

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: MEGAN

dialog: 
dialog: BACK TO JASON
dialog: 
text: He suddenly tosses Megan aside and heads for Tommy.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Tommy, get out of there! Row to
dialog: the other side of the lake!
dialog: Hurry!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Hey, asshole! It's me you want,
dialog: remember?! Come on, chickhenshit,
dialog: I'm sittin' here waitin'!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CHAIN NOOSE
dialog: 
text: Tommy's nervous hands keep the noose out of Jason's sight as

scene_heading: ANGLE OFF SIDE OF BOAT

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE ON BOAT

scene_heading: ANGLE ON TOMMY'S FOOT

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: MEGAN COVERS HER MOUTH IN DREAD.

scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER
dialog: 
text: Jason's body also hangs lifeless, anchored vertically by the
text: chain...The two have destroyed each other.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP FOREST GREEN - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Is he kill-ded?

dialog: will not let go of her leg.
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON JASON'S HEAD AND NECK
dialog: 
text: ONE OF MEGAN'S POWERFUL KICKS DRIVES INTO JASON'S THROAT. A

text: lets go of Megan's leg. She swims away.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHT ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: He doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHT ON TOMMY
dialog: 
dialog: Still nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON NANCY
dialog: 
text: She watches Megan trying desperately to revive the lifeless
text: boy. The child gets an idea. She closes her eyes and
text: whispers a little prayer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: RESUME MEGAN AND TOMMY
dialog: 
text: The tears are now flowing down Megan's cheeks. She knows her
text: efforts are in vain. In frustration, she strikes his chest
dialog: hard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TIGHT ON TOMMY
dialog: 
text: He coughs and spits out water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON MEGAN
dialog: 
text: She WHOOPS and helps him to sit up. A few of the kids CHEER.

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON TOMMY
dialog:

scene_heading: SUBJECTIVE MOVING CAMERA
dialog: 
text: Slowly we HEAD between the tombstones, stalking the old

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE ON MARTIN
dialog: 
text: He climbs nervously to his feet, quickly dropping the weeds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (overly friendly)

dialog: 
scene_heading: OVER THE SHOULDER OF STRANGER - ON MARTIN
dialog: 
text: All we see is a dark suit and longish red-gray hair. The way

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Er.. nice to see you again, Mr.
dialog: Voorhees...Haven't seen you in
dialog: Crystal...er, Forest Green, in
dialog: quite some time.
dialog: 
text: There is only a deathly silence from the nefarious man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: Hey, I've been takin' real good
dialog: care of your wife and son's
dialog: graves. Go look. You'll be real
dialog: pleased.
dialog: 
text: Martin forces a grin to cover his fear.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MR. VOORHEES' HAND
dialog: 
text: It reaches into his back pants pocket and withdraws a small
text: wad of money. The gnarled hand gives it to Martin.
dialog: 
text: MARTIN obsequiously accepts his payment. He practically
text: genuflects before him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Voorhees. Thank
dialog: you. I'll leave you in private,
dialog: like you like. Okay, er...bye.
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: He takes his earning and dashes away...probably to the liquor
dialog: store.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON LAWN
dialog: 
text: Mr. Voorhees' black shoes head toward us and stop. Slowly,
text: we TILT UP toward his face. Just as we reach his chest...

scene_heading: ANGLE OVER HIS SHOULDER - ON TWO GRAVES
dialog: 
dialog: We recognize them from before.

scene_heading: CLOSER ON GRAVES

scene_heading: WIDER ANGLE - FROM BEHIND HIM
dialog: 
text: He stands menacingly over his family's resting place...Does
dialog: he sense something is wrong here?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSEUP OF HIS EYES
dialog: 
text: They stare down at his son's grave. These eyes are truly
text: evil. Cold. Dark. Demonic. Then the worst happens... They
text: slowly look up at us. They seem to accuse us of knowing the
text: true whereabouts of his son. AND HE WON'T STOP GLARING AT US.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE FOREST GREEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: We GLIDE tranquilly over the blue water toward the middle of
dialog: the lake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
text: SLOWLY MOVING IN on the water, it seems we are about to
text: descend into it... JASON EMERGES AT US! We PULL BACK a bit.
dialog: No, it's only his infamous MASK. Freed from it's wicked
text: owner, it floats peacefully along old CRYSTAL LAKE... for now.
