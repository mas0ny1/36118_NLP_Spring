speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: On a RINGING phone. A hand reaches for it.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Hello?
text: A young girl of 17. Sweet. Innocent in that scrubbed clean
dialog: way. Looks like a virgin. Probably not.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Who are you calling?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Who am I speaking to?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Wrong number.
text: CLICK. Sherrie hangs up. Not very polite about it.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Sherrie joins Trudie, 16, a sexy, pretty. Tells it like it
text: is. Trudie is snacking on chips while TEXTING on her
text: SIDEKICK. Two friends hanging out.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Nobody. Are you making popcorn?
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: No, did you pick a movie?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: We're going scary. SAW 4.
text: Sherrie searches the cabinets and fridge for food.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: I saw it in the theater. It sucks.
dialog: And it’s not scary -- it’s gross.
dialog: I hate that torture porn shit.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: How do you really feel? I like
dialog: Jigsaw. He kills people very
dialog: creatively.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: But you don’t give a shit who dies.
dialog: There’s no character development.
text: Just body parts ripping and blood
text: spewing. Blaaaah.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Who do you keep texting?
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: I have a Facebook stalker. He
dialog: keeps leaving me messages.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: Just stuff. Like, “Hey, what’s up.
dialog: You're hot. I wanna kill you.”
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Delete him.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
text: I did. He hacked his way back in.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Report him.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: He’s really hot. Wanna see?
text: Sherrie joins Trudie as she pulls up a profile. A glimpse of
text: a shirtless young hottie.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: That's Channing Tatum.
text: It’s hard to make out on the small screen.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: It is not? Is it?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: From his Abercrombie days. You're
text: being punked.
text: The PHONE RINGS again. Sherrie goes for the kitchen phone.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: The more impatient version of the
dialog: person you just spoke to.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I’m sorry. You don’t have to be a
dialog: bitch about it.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Of course I don’t. Eat me.
text: Annoyed, Sherrie starts to hang up when--
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: You hang up on me and I’11 cut into
dialog: your neck until I feel bone.
text: Sherrie stops in her tracks. Stunned. Trudie looks at her.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: (to Sherrie)
dialog: Who is it?
text: Sherrie’s not sure what to think. So she holds out the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: It’s for you.
text: Trudie takes it. Hesitantly.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Trudie. Who is this?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: This is the last person you’re ever
dialog: going to see alive.
text: Trudie looks to Sherrie. WTF?
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: hn (into phone)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: It’s a prank. Hang up.
text: Trudie hangs up.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: Why’d you hand the phone to me?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: You’re the one with the stalker.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: Are the doors locked?
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Don’t freak out.
text: The phone RINGS again. They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: Let it ring.
text: Beat. The RINGING stops. They look relieved. Then,
text: Trudie’s SIDEKICK buzzes on the kitchen counter. She picks
text: it up. Reads.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: It’s from stalker boy.
dialog: (holds it up)
dialog: “Answer the phone.”
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Oh for god's sake. It’s a joke,
dialog: Trudie. I bet it’s Lexi or Karen.
text: Trudie takes off for the living room.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: To make sure the front door is
dialog: locked.
text: Sherrie follows her.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - NIGHT
text: They come to the front door. Trudie checks the locks as
text: Sherrie watches. Trudie turns back to Sherrie when...
text: The DOORBELL RINGS. They both SCREAM. Staring at the front
text: door. Sherrie starts for it. Trudie stops her.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: Don’t answer it.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: It’s a joke, Trudie. Someone made
text: a dummy profile and now they’re
dialog: trying to scare you.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: I said -- who is it?
dialog: (still no answer)
dialog: Let’s call the cops.
text: Just then, Trudie’s SIDEKICK BUZZES with a message. Trudie
text: jumps out of her skin. She looks at it, reading.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: “I dare you to open the door.”
text: Trudie’s officially terrified. Sherrie is not quite sold.
text: She's contemplating opening the door.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: No, Sherrie. Don’t.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Who emails you from the front
dialog: porch?
text: Trudie shrugs. Has no idea.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: One of our asshole friends, that’s
dialog: who. I bet it’s Karen and Lexi.
text: Sherrie starts for the door. Trudie stops her.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: No, don’t, I’m scared.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE
dialog: Or Barry or Lance. It could be
dialog: anyone we know. Lisa, Bailey,
dialog: Wayne, or the hopeful long shot --
dialog: Channing Tatum.
text: Sherrie goes to the front door -- unlocks it. Trudie steps
text: back, shaking. As the door rips open revealing--
text: AN EMPTY DOORWAY. No one’s there. Sherrie steps outside
text: onto the porch.
text: Trudie watches her as she looks around. She shrugs, turning
text: back to Trudie.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s no one out here.
text: Sherrie stands in the doorway, facing Trudie -- her back
text: exposed to the outside. Just then...
text: Trudie’s SIDEKICK BUZZES in her hands. Trudie looks, opens
dialog: it up.
speaker_heading: SHERRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What does it say?
text: Trudie reads her phone.
speaker_heading: TRUDIE
dialog: It says, “I’m not outside. I’m
dialog: right behind...”
text: TRUDIE has time to register this. She spins around to see a--
text: A GHOST FACE KILLER SPRINGS FROM THE DARKNESS -- LUNGING AT
scene_heading: HER. KNIFE IN THE AIR.
text: Sherrie SCREAMS for her friend, watching as the GHOST FACE
text: stabs Trudie. The knife penetrates deep. Upon its
text: withdrawl, Trudie drops instantly. Dead.
text: Sherrie stands frozen. Until the GHOST FACE turns his
text: attention to her. That’s all it takes for Sherrie to flee.
text: She spins around. Starts out the front door when--
text: ANOTHER GHOST FACE KILLER APPEARS on the porch, completely
text: surprising her.
text: Sherrie starts to SCREAM but the GHOST FACE is too fast. A
text: flash of silver.
text: A KNIFE SLICES SHERRIE’S THROAT. STIFLING HER SCREAM.
text: She stands there a moment, clutching her neck as the blood
text: pours from it. Unable to scream. A look of confusion and
dialog: helplessness.
text: A beat. As she GURGLES for air. Then -- out of nowhere --
text: A MADDENING SCREAM.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK. SUPERIMPOSE TITLE:
speaker_heading: STAB 6
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: You're fucking kidding me.
text: Suddenly, the CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL--
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT
scene_heading: A TV SCREEN -- STAB 6 -- MAIN TITLES
text: It becomes clear the previous sequence was merely the opening
text: scene from a movie on television.
text: As the CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER REVEALING -- TWO TEEN GIRLS
text: on a couch. In a different living room. In a different
text: house. They are watching the horror movie STAB 6.
text: RACHEL and CHLOE, both 17. Best friends. Rachel grabs the
text: remote. Shuts off the TV. She’s the more outspoken one.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That was so fucking stupid. Pure
text: horse shit. The death of horror.
text: Right here. In front of us.
text: Chloe is more reserved. She tries to defend it.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I jumped. It scared me.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: A fucking Facebook killer? You're
dialog: kidding me, right?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: It’s a few years old. Now, it
dialog: would be twitter. Which would make
dialog: a lot more sense.
text: Rachel gets up and goes to the kitchen. Opens the fridge.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: A bunch of articulate teenagers sit
dialog: around and deconstruct horror
text: movies until a ghost face kills
dialog: them one by one. It’s been done to
dialog: death. The whole self-aware, post-—
dialog: modern meta-shit is over. Stick a
dialog: fork in 1996 already.
text: Chloe stays in the living room. It’s an open floor plan so
text: they can see each other.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I like STAB movies. They’re
dialog: scarier. It’s not torture porn or
dialog: zombies or aliens or Asian ghost
dialog: girls. There’s something real
text: about a guy with a knife. Who just
dialog: snaps. It could really happen.
text: Rachel opens a soda and starts back to the couch where she
text: plops back down next to Chloe.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I can’t do it. These sequels don’t
dialog: know when to stop. They just keep
dialog: recycling the same shit. Even the
text: opening scene. Some random girl
dialog: gets a call that undoubtedly ends
dialog: in her getting killed. It’s all so
dialog: predictable, there’s no element of
dialog: surprise, you see everything
dialog: coming...
text: IN A FLASH, CHLOE PULLS A BUTCHER KNIFE FROM UNDER A PILLOW
text: AND STABS RACHEL IN THE STOMACH.
text: Blood spews as Rachel registers surprise. Shock. A very
dialog: unpredictable moment.
text: Rachel looks down and stares at the knife in her stomach.
text: Complete and insidious horror. As her friend Chloe’s face
text: turns maniacal and evil. She pulls the knife out.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Did that surprise you?
text: Rachel tries to speak, but spits up blood. Beat.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Why....
text: Chloe stabs her again. Deeper this time.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Because you talk too much. Now
dialog: shut the fuck up and watch the
dialog: movie.
text: Rachel's body goes slack. As she sits there. On the couch.
text: Bleeding to death. Chloe reaches for the remote. And as
text: Rachel nears death, Chloe HITS PLAY.
scene_heading: A MADDENING SCREAM. CUT TO BLACK. MAIN TITLE CARD. AGAIN.
speaker_heading: STAB 7
scene_heading: The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING--
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A TV SET. The previous scene was also another fake out.
text: TWO TEEN GIRLS are lounging in a family room of a large
text: house. JENNY, 16, cute and bouncy, sits up LAUGHING
text: uncontrollably. She hits PAUSE.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Oh God, I love it. I’ve seen this
dialog: movie five times. It gets me every
dialog: time.
text: Her friend, MARNIE, 16, brainy, over-achiever.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: You're kidding? I don’t get it.
speaker_heading: JENNY
text: It’s like a TWILIGHT ZONE movie
text: within a movie.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: I get that. But it’s illogical.
dialog: It begs the question. If the
dialog: beginning of STAB 7 is STAB 6?
dialog: What’s at the beginning of STAB 6?
dialog: STAB 5? And, if so, what was STAB
dialog: 4 about?
text: Jenny stares at her.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You're over-thinking it.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: You know what kills me? Somewhere,
dialog: someone thought that was clever.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: MARNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s a reason I don’t watch
dialog: these movies.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I can’t believe you've never seen
dialog: them. We live in Woodsboro.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: This has nothing to do with
dialog: Woodsboro. I thought STAB was
dialog: based on true stories.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: The first three, the trilogy, was
dialog: all about Sidney Prescott and the
dialog: Woodsboro Murders.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: You know my mom went to school with
dialog: her--
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: After that, they just kept making
dialog: lame ass sequels. Money.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Do we have to finish it? I know
dialog: it’s the anniversary of the
dialog: Woodsboro massacre but I hate
dialog: horror.
text: Jenny smiles. Of course, she does. Just then, she looks to
text: the hallway.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Did you hear that?
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: I didn’t hear anything.
text: Jenny rises. Starts towards the hallway.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Don’t try and scare me. I didn’t
dialog: hear anything.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I’m not trying to scare you.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: You do this all the time.
dialog: No,
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I don’t.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Halloween night? When I walked
dialog: into the kitchen and found you dead
dialog: on
dialog: It
dialog: the floor with blood everywhere?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: was Halloween. Lighten up.
text: Jenny moves to the hallway.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I heard something.
text: Marnie doesn’t believe her. But still...
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Are we the only ones here?
text: Jenny nods.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I’m gonna check it out.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: I know you’re trying to scare me.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I swear I’m not.
text: Jenny takes off for the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
scene_heading: - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It’s dark. Jenny moves down it quickly.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - HOUSE
dialog: Marnie waits
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
dialog: Jenny enters
text: open window.
text: and watches from the living room. Uneasy.
speaker_heading: - NIGHT
text: her bedroom. Simple. Sweet. She notices an
speaker_heading: MARNIE (0.S.)
dialog: What is it?
text: Jenny calls out.
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I left a window open.
scene_heading: IN THE FAMILY ROOM
text: Marnie hears that. Calls out.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: That was stupid.
scene_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I’m just gonna check it out.
scene_heading: IN THE FAMILY ROOM
text: Marnie looks around. Goes to the back patio sliding doors.
text: Checks to make sure they’re locked. Just then, the PHONE
speaker_heading: RINGS.
speaker_heading: JENNY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you get that?
scene_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
text: Jenny has a cell phone in her hand. She’s the one who’s
text: calling her own house.
speaker_heading: JENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Marnie?
scene_heading: IN THE FAMILY ROOM
text: Marnie goes to the phone. Answers it.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hello. Who is this?
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Marnie. Who's this?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: The last person you’re ever going
dialog: to see alive.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: So lame.
text: Just then, Jenny BURSTS out LAUGHING.
dialog: 13
scene_heading: IN THE BEDROOM
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I’m sorry. I had to.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: You bitch. So not funny.
text: Jenny’s very amused with herself.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Somebody falls for it every year.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: I don’t know why you get off on
dialog: this shit -- AAHHHH...
text: Just then, Marnie SCREAMS. It’s a DEADLY SCREAM. Then, the
text: line goes dead. Jenny pauses.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Marnie? Marnie?
text: Jenny looks to the bedroom door. Is she being pranked? The
text: SCREAM was very real. She gets up and starts for the
dialog: hallway.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Jenny moves down the hallway. Back to the family room.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Marnie?
text: Suddenly, a CRASHING NOISE. Something is upturned. It’s
text: followed by silence. Jenny’s looking a little scared.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Jenny enters to find the room completely dark and empty. The
text: back patio doors are wide open. Jenny looks around.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Marnie? Where’d you go?
text: Jenny circles around the couch. Stumbles over something.
text: Tripping. She looks down and sees Marnie lying dead on the
text: floor. Her eyes COLD and LIFELESS.
text: Jenny SCREAMS. Just then, Marnie sits up LAUGHING
text: UNCONTROLLABLY. Jenny’s been punked. A victim of her own
dialog: prank.
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Gotchya. You should have seen your
dialog: face.
dialog: Jenny knows she can’t be mad.
speaker_heading: MARNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew you were up to something.
dialog: How’d you do the voice on the
dialog: phone?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: An app I downloaded.
text: Marnie gets up. Jenny helps her.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Can we please stop scaring each
dialog: other now? It’s bad enough we’ve
dialog: had to grow up in this town.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Okay, okay, you got me.
text: They both plop back down on the couch. The glass doors open
text: behind them.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Wanna watch something else?
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: We can watch the rest of the movie.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: We don’t have to.
text: Neither see the GHOST FACED FIGURE that enters through the
text: sliding glass doors. It slowly makes its way to the couch.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: It’s okay. Now that I’m in the
dialog: mood.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Are you sure?
text: The GHOST FACE moves closer to the couch. Knife in hand.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Might as well.
dialog: 15
text: Jenny reaches for the remote control. Just as the GHOST FACE
text: raises the knife.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You like horror movies. You’re not
dialog: fooling anybody.
text: As Jenny hits PLAY. The Ghost Face STRIKES with the knife.
text: THE SCREEN CUTS TO BLACK. MAIN TITLES.
speaker_heading: SCREAM 4
scene_heading: EXT. WOODSBORO - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
text: The morning sun shines bright over the quaint town of
dialog: Woodsboro, California.
text: Little moments of small town life are all around. Picture-
dialog: perfect. Innocent. Quiet. Then--
text: SIRENS BLARE as SQUAD CARS tear down Main Street, racing,
text: speeding... interrupting any hope of a peaceful day.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - RILEY HOUSE - MORNING
text: A CELL PHONE VIBRATES across the night stand. PULL BACK to
text: reveal a COUPLE sleeping. Finally, a woman sits up, barely
dialog: awake.
text: It’s GALE WEATHERS. Or more accurately, GALE RILEY. Ten
text: years later. Still strikingly beautiful. But no longer in
text: that “camera ready” way. She eyes the VIBRATING CELL PHONE.
text: Looks to her husband. SHOVES HIM.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: You're buzzing.
text: He doesn’t move. It forces Gale to get up. She walks around
text: to the night stand and takes the cell phone and SILENCES it.
text: Then, she takes a pillow and SLAMS IT DOWN on the man
text: sleeping beside her. He leaps up. Huh?
text: It’s DEWEY RILEY. All grown up. Still sweet-faced and
dialog: boyish, but experience has seasoned him. Matured him.
text: Dewey looks around but Gale has already disappeared to the
dialog: bathroom.
dialog: 16
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
text: Gale is at the sink, brushing her teeth. Dewey enters.
text: Silence. He goes to the toilet room. His limp is nearly non-
text: existent. Years of physical therapy.
text: Dewey pees. Gale spits. More silence. The unspoken tension
text: speaks volumes. Finally...
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: You know what today is, right?
text: Gale nods.
speaker_heading: DEWEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you going?
text: Gale shrugs. Dewey finishes up. Flushes.
speaker_heading: DEWEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it would be nice if you
dialog: went.
text: Gale studies herself in the mirror. She’s not the same Gale.
dialog: There’s something missing.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I’m sorry about last night. I
dialog: wasn’t in the right space.
text: Dewey finishes up. Flushes.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Wanna talk about it?
text: He turns to his wife. But she’s already left the bathroom.
scene_heading: EXT. RILEY HOUSE - MORNING
text: A nice two-story house in a nice neighborhood. Dewey exits
text: the house and moves to an SUV in the drive.
text: It has the WOODSBORO SHERIFF’S DECAL on the side. Just then,
text: a cute SPORTS CAR SPEEDS down the street. ROCK MUSIC
speaker_heading: BLARING.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Slow down.
text: Dewey hops in his jeep.
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS CAR - MORNING
text: Behind the wheel, KIRBY REED, 17, slows the car.
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Shit. Fuck.
dialog: A cute and quirky girl. Was probably a tomboy until a year
dialog: ago. Now, she’s alternative. Or so she wants you to
dialog: believe. Either way -- she’s cool.
text: She rounds the corner.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING
text: The neighborhood is lined with houses. Nice lawns,
text: sidewalks, etc. A typical small town neighborhood.
text: Kirby pulls up and parks in front of an old two-story home.
text: Full of character. She TOOTS the horn. A few moments and a
text: young girl emerges.
speaker_heading: JILL ROBERTS
text: A 17 year-old beauty. Pretty in that ingenue way. Smart.
text: Strong. Anda little bit goofy. She makes it sexy. A young
text: girl full of contradictions -- but instantly likable.
text: There’s not a mean bone in her body.
text: She hurries to the car and hops in.
scene_heading: INT. KIRBY’S CAR - MORNING
text: Kirby turns the MUSIC DOWN, launches into a huge discussion.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Okay, don’t get upset. Trevor
dialog: called me last night.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Why is he calling you?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: He knows I have your ear and he
dialog: wants to work it out.
dialog: (looks across the street)
dialog: Where’s Olivia?
text: Kirby HONKS the horn again. Suddenly, OLIVIA MORRIS, 17,
text: emerges from the house directly across the street from Jill’s
text: house. Olivia is sexy hot. Her walk, style, attitude is
text: fearless and fierce.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What did Trevor have to say?
dialog: 18
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: He was fishing. He wants to know
dialog: how upset you are.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What did you tell him?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Epic grief. Not since Bella fucked
dialog: the werewolf have you known such
dialog: grief.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (re: Olivia)
dialog: Can we not talk about this now?
text: The car door opens. Kirby nods. Gets it. But as Olivia
text: crams into the back seat.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Okay, so Trevor called me last
dialog: night.
text: Jill throws her hands up. WTF? Kirby hits the gas and they
dialog: take off.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: He called both of you? What is he
dialog: thinking?
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
text: He wants to kiss and make up.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: That’s not going to happen.
text: Just then, LADY GAGA’S TELEPHONE song starts playing. Jill
text: starts digging in her bag, for her cell phone.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Not Lady Gaga. For god’s sake,
dialog: change your ringtone. Can we hate
dialog: her yet? I so wanna hate her.
text: Jill eyes her CALLER ID -- JENNY RANDALL
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Why is Jenny Randall calling me?
text: Both Kirby and Olivia shrug.
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t like Jenny
dialog: Randall. She threw up on me at
text: Tony Marshall’s luau.
text: Jill answers while Olivia explains her hatred.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hello, Jill.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: (to Olivia)
dialog: That luau was freshman year.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: (to Kirby)
dialog: I didn’t say my anger was rational.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: Jenny? Is this you?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: What’s your favorite scary movie?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Okay, who is this?
text: Olivia and Kirby have taken notice of the call.

dialog: (to Jill)
dialog: What does she want?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: Where’s Jenny? Who is this?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I asked you a question. What’s
dialog: your favorite scary movie?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I'm hanging up.
text: CLICK. Jill hangs up. Looks to her friends.
dialog: 20
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: That was so weird. I just got a
dialog: prank phone call from Jenny
dialog: Randall.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Jenny Randall is weird. Her and
dialog: her little Marnie the Carny friend
dialog: are freaks.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: It’s Massacre Week. People go
dialog: looney, remember?
text: They continue on but Jill is clearly bugged by it.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODSBORO - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
text: The morning sun shines bright over the quaint town of
text: Woodsboro, California. Little moments of small town life are
text: all around. Innocent and simple. Picture-perfect.
text: Except on every lamp post for three blocks -- a GHOST MASK
text: has been placed over the light fixture. Somebody has played
text: a prank.
text: A CITY WORKER stands on a ladder, removing a mask. A female
text: officer oversees. This is DEPUTY JUDY HICKS, 30’s. Cursed
dialog: with cute-ness, Hicks plays it serious at all times. She’s
text: over compensating. But it just makes her cuter.
text: The SHERIFF'S JEEP pulls up. Dewey slowly gets out,
text: surveying the stunt.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Hey, Sheriff. It looks like the
text: celebration has begun.
text: Dewey looks up and down Main Street. Damn.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Damn kids. How'd they get up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: I’m sorry, you can never get away
dialog: from this.
text: She smiles, small-town sweet.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, I made some lemon squares.
dialog: They’re in my car.
dialog: 21
text: Dewey shies away from the idea.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: E-eh, no thanks, Judy.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: (moving closer)
dialog: Sheriff, you’re not cheating on
dialog: your wife if you eat my lemon
dialog: square.
text: Suddenly, Dewey’s RADIO STARTS SQUAWKING.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Sheriff? Come in, Sheriff.
dialog: Emergency.
text: Dewey grabs his WALKIE.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER
dialog: You need to get to the Randalls’
dialog: house on Miller’s Lane. It’s bad,
dialog: Sheriff, real bad.
text: Dewey looks at Deputy Hicks. Something’s up.
scene_heading: INT. HOME OFFICE - RILEY HOUSE - MORNING
text: A small home office. A few PLAQUES on the wall. An award or
text: two. Some framed photos of her days from TOP STORY.
text: On shelves are stacks of books. THE WOODSBORO MURDERS.
dialog: Based on a True Story.
text: A glimpse of the latter sequels. COLLEGE TERROR: THE
scene_heading: WOODSBORO HORROR CONTINUES. “Now a Major Motion Picture”.
scene_heading: HOLLYWOOD HORROR, The True Story of STAB 3. Etc.
text: Gale sits at her desk, laptop in front of her.
text: CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN. The words CHAPTER ONE have
text: been typed a hundred times. Gale takes a sip of coffee.
text: Taps her fingers. The words don’t come.
text: Finally, Gale pulls up GOOGLE on her SCREEN. Types in Sidney
scene_heading: Prescott -- NEW RESULTS. She DOUBLE CLICKS.
text: A NEWS CLIP STREAMS -- from a local San Francisco talk show --
text: A VIEW FROM THE BAY. Gale presses play. A young FEMALE HOST
text: addresses the CAMERA.
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: TV HOST
dialog: What inspired you to write about
dialog: your life?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY PRESCOTT
dialog: I wanted to tell my story. So much
dialog: has been written about me in the
dialog: past...
speaker_heading: TV HOST
dialog: And, of course, the movies.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY PRESCOTT
dialog: Yes, with the popularity of the
dialog: STAB films, I’ve lived my entire
dialog: adult life in this very public role
dialog: of victim.
speaker_heading: TV HOST
dialog: You survived not one, but three
dialog: horrific nightmares. I saw the
dialog: movies when I was a kid. So scary.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY PRESCOTT
dialog: I didn’t want to be defined by the
dialog: word victim anymore. Writing this
dialog: book was about letting it go. I
dialog: wanted to be free of my past and
dialog: move on once and for all.
text: Sidney looks and sounds great. Full of resilience and inner
text: peace. This is a woman who has weathered a great storm.
text: CLOSE ON GALE as she takes this in. Affected.
speaker_heading: TV HOST
dialog: Well, your book put me in tears.
dialog: It’s such a beautiful and moving
dialog: story of survival. Everyone should
dialog: read it. Buy it today, people.
text: OUT OF THE DARK by Sidney Prescott.
text: Sidney laughs at the TV Host’s shameless plug as the Host
text: holds up Sid’s book. Her picture graces the cover.
speaker_heading: TV HOST (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulations on all the great
dialog: reviews. What’s next for you?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY PRESCOTT
dialog: Between the book tour and speaking
dialog: engagements, I’m writing another
dialog: book. So, we’ll see. It’s alla
dialog: new adventure.
dialog: 23
text: Sidney smiles. Genuinely happy. Gale CLICKS -- Sid
text: disappears. The SCREEN returns to Gale’s own writing. Or
text: lack of. She stares at the words CHAPTER ONE over and over
text: again. Gale hits delete. Then, leaps up and leaves the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: EXT. JENNY RANDALLS’ HOUSE - DAY
text: The idyllic family home is a murder site. AMBULANCES,
scene_heading: SHERIFF’S CARS, COUNTY CORONERS.
scene_heading: INT. JENNY RANDALL’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Blood is everywhere. Streaked along the floor and furniture.
text: OFFICERS and TECHNICIANS investigate, dusting for prints,
text: taking photos, bagging evidence.
text: Dewey stands in the living room. His face unflinching. He’s
text: staring at the sofa where--
text: Jenny and Marnie’s bloody bodies have been left. On display.
text: Sitting upright, facing the television.
text: Behind the TV -- written in red are the words, “What’s your
dialog: favorite scary movie?”
text: A FORENSIC GUY is there inspecting the wall. He’s doing a
scene_heading: PHOTO-HANDWRITING ANALYSIS.
speaker_heading: FORENSIC GUY
dialog: Common spray paint. First glance,
dialog: the y’s and e’s are consistent with
text: a right handed male.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Full analysis?
speaker_heading: FORENSIC GUY
dialog: Few hours. Lab’s waiting on me.
text: Dewey nods, leaves the room.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - JENNY’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Dewey exits the house. Moves to the edge of the porch.
text: Alone, he lets out a DEEP SIGH, letting his true emotions
dialog: surface. This is hard for him.
text: Just then, Hicks appears, with TWO DEPUTIES behind her.
text: PERKINS, 40’s, seasoned, and HOSS, 20's, eager.
text: Dewey spins around -- not letting his emotions show. He’s
dialog: the Sheriff. A leader. And he’s good at it.
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Hoss, you and Perkins, run the
dialog: paint. Check all the locals stores
dialog: and send digital samples to county.
text: Hoss and Perkins take off. They’re on it.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Jenny Randall’s parents were on a
dialog: ski trip. They thought Jenny was
text: sleeping at Marnie’s, and Marnie’s
dialog: folks thought she was at Jenny's.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Phone records?
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Both girls had cells and the one
dialog: house phone. We’re pulling
dialog: everything.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You okay, Sheriff?
text: Dewey turns to Hicks. In honest candor.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: This is about the worst thing that
dialog: could have happened. No, Deputy,
dialog: I’m not okay.
text: Dewey takes off, leaving Hicks wistful. She feels his pain.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Red brick and tradition. Establishing.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: STUDENTS come and go. ROBBIE MERCER, 16, a lively, wicked
text: smart cool-nerd, move through the hallway with a FLIP CAMERA.
text: He stops Olivia at her locker.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: This is HALL PASS WITH ROBBIE,
dialog: coming at ya, POV. I’m here with
dialog: the luscious Olivia-don’t-look-at-
dialog: my-breasts-—I-have-a-mind--Morris,
dialog: with our topic of the week.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Which is? Hurry up.
dialog: 25
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: For all my horror ho’s out there on
dialog: the anniversary of the Woodsboro
dialog: Massacre, I have to ask: What’s
dialog: your favorite scary movie?
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: That’s all you got? Some lame ass
dialog: douche question? “What’s your
dialog: favorite scary movie?” Go away,
dialog: closet boy.
text: Just then, CHARLIE WALKER, 17, messy cute, pops into frame.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
scene_heading: THE EXORCIST, PSYCHO, THE SHINING
dialog: and anything starring Nicole
text: Kidman’s new face. Owwww.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Worst scary movie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: An exhaustive list, Robbie, but
dialog: I'll go with the entire career of
dialog: M. Night Shyamalan.
text: Just then, Kirby appears, having heard this.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
text: No way, THE SIXTH SENSE is epic.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Revoked. Now considered a fluke.
dialog: No longer valid.
scene_heading: DOWN THE HALL
text: Jill is at her locker, finishing up. She closes it, turns
dialog: and runs into...
text: TREVOR SHELDON, 17, high school jock. Perfectly handsome.
text: Perfectly cocky.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Hey, Jill, how ya doing?
text: Jill barely acknowledges him. Just an awkward gaze.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you ever going to talk to me
dialog: again?
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I hadn't planned on it.
text: She starts by him, but he cuts her off.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: C’mon, you're not being fair. I
dialog: deserve a chance to tell you what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Is it different from the facts?
dialog: Because I know what happened.
text: Jill start off -- but Trevor blocks her path. This just
text: makes her angry.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: And trying to use Kirby and Olivia
dialog: to help your case -- bad move.
text: Jill pushes passed him, but he grabs her arm, pulling her
text: back. It takes her by surprise.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Please, Jill, just talk to me.
text: Trevor tries to connect to her eyes -- he’s pleading. She
text: pulls her arm away when--
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER (0.S.)
dialog: Is everything okay here?
text: They both turn to find MR. BAKER, 30's, studious, no-nonsense
text: type, standing behind them. Beat. Jill looks to Trevor.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yeah, Mr. Baker, we’re good.
text: Jill turns and walks off. Trevor cuts eyes at Mr. Baker.
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER
dialog: Yes, Trevor, what?
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Nothing.
text: Trevor starts off, but this time Mr. Baker blocks his path.
text: He points in the other direction. Opposite of Jill.
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER
dialog: You go that way.
dialog: 27
dialog: Trevor wants to kill this teacher. But he plays it cool.
text: Turns and walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - WOODSBORO - DAY
text: A car pulls up and parks on the street. Gale gets out. She
text: stares at the small book store on the corner. She walks
text: over to it.
scene_heading: EXT. CORNER BOOK STORE - DAY
text: Gale looks in the window. Sidney’s book is the only book on
text: display. A sign reads MEET SIDNEY PRESCOTT. TODAY ONLY.
scene_heading: INT. BOOK STORE - DAY
text: A small book and old fashioned book store. It’s crowded.
text: At capacity. Standing room only.
text: At a lectern, stands Sidney Prescott, reading from her book.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I was playing the role of victim.
dialog: The only problem? I never
dialog: auditioned for the role. I never
dialog: asked for the part, but here I was
text: playing it to the hilt. Sidney
dialog: Prescott, the real life Scream
dialog: Queen. Celebrity victim. It
dialog: wasn’t who I set out to be. It
dialog: wasn’t the life I wanted.
text: In the back, Gale sneaks in, finds a spot. She listens to
text: Sidney who is full of quiet strength and honesty.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: It was clear my life was in need of
dialog: a rewrite, a re-imagining. I had
dialog: to create a new part to play. So,
dialog: I sat down and began to write a new
dialog: life for myself. A life that
dialog: accepted my past but was no longer
text: imprisoned by it.
text: APPLAUSE from the room. CLOSE ON GALE -- annoyed and
text: cynical, but oddly moved too.
text: ON SIDNEY as she greets the PEOPLE who gather around.
text: A YOUNG WOMAN, REBECCA REED, 20's, a poised and polished
text: power assistant keeps the wheels moving.
dialog: 28
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We're going to begin the book
text: signing in just a few minutes.
text: Sidney eyes a woman, mid-forties, KATE ROBERTS, who is
text: waiting to see her. A big smile and hug.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Aunt Kate, you made it. How are
dialog: you? How’s Jill?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We're good. You'll see her at
dialog: dinner. It’s been too long.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Yes, it has. I know since Dad’s
dialog: funeral, I’ve been bad with the
dialog: phone calls.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're here now. We’1ll have a good
dialog: time tonight.
text: Rebecca steps in -- not subtle at all.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: We gotta keep it moving.
text: Kate gives a wink, taking off. “Seeya tonight.” As Sidney
text: turns and comes face to face with Gale. Beat.
text: Rebecca sees them together. She motions to a PHOTOGRAPHER on
text: hand. “Get this.” The Photographer instantly starts
text: SNAPPING PHOTOS.
text: Sidney refuses to let it be awkward. She hugs Gale.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It’s good to see you, Gale. I was
dialog: hoping you would come.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Congratulations, Sidney. I haven't
dialog: read it yet...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I know where you can get a copy.
text: A lingering moment between these two women. Sidney senses
text: something different about Gale. Just then, Dewey enters and
text: Sidney lights up.
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dewey!
text: Gale watches as Sidney races to him, hugging him. Old
text: friends. Only when they break, does Sidney see Dewey’s
text: serious and worried expression.
text: Dewey turns to Gale. Who instantly reads him. Something is
dialog: very, very wrong.
text: And as if on cue -- COMMOTION ERUPTS all around. PEOPLE
text: point to the store windows. To the CARS and NEWS VANS seen
text: approaching.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - WOODSBORO - DAY
text: The quiet and peaceful town explodes into chaos as the NEWS
text: MEDIA descends on Main Street. News of the murders is out.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM — DAY
text: Mr. Baker is in the middle of class. He writes on the chalk
text: board with his right hand.
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER
dialog: Don’t forget, projects, are due
dialog: Thursday.
text: CELL PHONES start to go off in class. VIBRATING everywhere.
text: STUDENTS start texting each other. The news is spreading.
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Somebody wanna share?
text: Suddenly -- LOUD COMMOTION OUTSIDE. MEDIA TRUCKS are
text: screeching up. Distracted, the KIDS all look to the windows.
text: Even Mr. Baker is intrigued.
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: What the...?
text: Robbie reads his iphone.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper
dialog: were murdered last night.
text: The room erupts in SHOCK. Jill turns to Kirby. What? Then,
text: the BELL RINGS. Quickly, the class empties out. The news
text: taking everyone’s attention. Jill and Kirby start out.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Who called you this morning?
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I don’t know. But it came from
text: Jenny’s phone.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: This just got creepy.
text: They exit the room.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER
text: On the lawn, TV CAMERAMEN hop out and jockey for position.
text: TV REPORTERS are quickly starting stand-ups:
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: ...the murdered girls were students
dialog: here, at Woodsboro High School...
speaker_heading: REPORTER #2
dialog: ...this week marks the 15 year
dialog: anniversary of the infamous
dialog: Woodsboro Murders...
speaker_heading: REPORTER #3
dialog: +..as recounted in the bestseller
dialog: by Gale Weathers which launched the
dialog: horror franchise STAB...
text: A CROWD has gathered to watch. Shocked. Olivia sees Kirby
text: and Jill exit the school. She races over.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Do you believe this? Didn’t Jenny
dialog: call you this morning?
text: A look of dread has washed over Jill’s face. And, as if on
text: cue -- Lady Gaga’s TELEPHONE starts playing. Jill reaches
text: into her bag and withdraws her phone.
text: She looks at the CALLER ID. It reads JENNY RANDALL. Jill
text: nearly GASPS. She looks to her friends. All three of them
text: are freaking out. Beat. Finally, Jill answers it. Silence.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Congratulations, Jill.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I pick you.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What?
dialog: 31
text: Kirby grabs Jill’s phone, puts it on SPEAKER.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I pick you. Don’t disappoint me.
text: CLICK. The phone goes dead. The three girls look at each
text: other. Stunned. Terrified.
scene_heading: INT. BULL PEN - POLICE STATION - DAY - LATER
text: A bull pen. Surrounded by offices. A FLURRY of activity.
text: As DEPUTIES come and go. A chaotic atmosphere.
text: Gale moves through the bull pen. She looks around. Sees
dialog: Deputy Hicks.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Excuse me, Deputy Judy, where’s
dialog: Dewey?
text: Deputy Hicks looks a bit put out. She’s not a big fan of
dialog: Dewey's wife. But she’s professional about it.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: He’s conducting an interview at the
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: With Sidney Prescott? Are they in
dialog: the conference room? I/’11 just
text: head back.
text: Gale starts towards the back corridor, but Hicks blocks her.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: You can’t go back there, Gale.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Since when? I’m married to the
dialog: Sheriff, I’m part of the team.
text: Gale starts for the hallway again. But Hicks means business.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: It’s a murder investigation. I’m
dialog: sorry.
text: Gale’s instinct is to rip Hicks’ head off, but lets it go.
text: Decides to play the “good wife”. But she’s annoyed.
dialog: 32
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION
text: Jill sits at the conference table with Dewey. Her mother,
text: Kate, is next to her, supportive. Along with Sidney.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: “I pick you.”
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: That’s what he said.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What does it mean, Dewey?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I can’t answer that yet.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Am I in danger, Sheriff?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: To be honest, we don’t have enough
text: to go on at the moment.
text: Dewey's eyes meet Sidney. Who appears strong and composed.
text: She squeezes Jill’s hand, reassuringly.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No, you’re not. Because we’re not
dialog: going to let anything happen to
dialog: you, Jill.
text: Jill looks at them, trying to stay calm.
scene_heading: INT. BULL PEN AREA - POLICE STATION - DAY
text: Gale pours a cup of coffee, waiting, when she sees...
text: Sidney’s assistant, Rebecca, who has taken over a desk. She
text: has her iPad out, Blackberry in hand, and headset in her ear.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (on phone, compassionate)
dialog: No comment beyond Miss Prescott’s
text: sincere condolences to the victim's
dialog: family and friends. Thank you.
dialog: (next call)
dialog: This is Rebecca.
dialog: (instantly ecstatic)
text: OHMYFUCKINGGOD, Henry. Two girls
dialog: were butchered. Payday. And I was
dialog: so not feeling Woodsboro. I was
dialog: like lame PR move, right? Well,
dialog: FUCKMEWOW. Best. Idea. Ever.
dialog: 33
text: Rebecca spots Gale watching her. Gives a wave.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (CONT'D)
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Henry, I’11 call you back.
text: Rebecca clicks off. Goes to Gale. In awe.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to geek out. I didn’t get a
dialog: chance earlier. It’s an honor to
dialog: meet you. When I was a kid, it was
text: all about, “TOP STORY with Gale
dialog: Weathers.” You were my 90's.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: It’s Gale Riley now.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Aw. And you gave it all up for
dialog: love. I bow down. That is so...
dialog: not me.
text: Gale’s not sure she likes this girl. She’s not a bitch.
text: Just talky and self-involved.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: So you're Sidney’s assistant?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I’m covering the book tour for
dialog: Random. So, yes, I am assisting
dialog: Sidney, but I wear a lot of hats so
dialog: if you need anything.
text: Rebecca slides Gale her business card. Gale takes it. Hmm.
speaker_heading: REBECCA (CONT'D)
dialog: How long have you and Dewey been
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Almost ten years ago.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Aw. So it was just like your
text: characters in STAB 3. Wow.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Yeah, wow.
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I didn’t mean bad wow. It just
dialog: always seemed like more of a movie
dialog: romance than a real one because it
dialog: was a movie and in real life you
dialog: two would never be...
dialog: (catches herself)
dialog: Ooh, don’t wanna dig that hole, so,
dialog: how many kids do you have?
text: Gale stares at her, blankly. As the hole gets deeper.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - WOODSBORO - DAY
text: Several MEDIA OUTLETS have planted themselves outside the
text: POLICE STATION. Olivia and Kirby watch the ruckus from the
text: water fountain. Charlie is there too.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: I don’t understand why the killer
dialog: called Jill?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: She’s been tapped. She’s related
dialog: to Sidney. It makes it personal.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: It puts Jill up next on the victim
dialog: chain. If the killer calls, you're
dialog: dead, that’s the rule.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
text: An overused, done to death rule.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can blame techno J-horror.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: (explains)
text: THE RING, GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL.
text: Charlie and Kirby talk in a language that is foreign to
dialog: Olivia.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Someone's gotta bite it. You
dialog: can’t kill Sidney. She’s victim
dialog: royalty, she can’t die.
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Sure she can. Her character has
dialog: been gone since STAB 3 anyway.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Too dicey. Potential backlash.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
text: Laurie Strode bit it in HALLOWEEN
dialog: 8, Ripley died in ALIEN 4. There’s
dialog: precedence.
text: Olivia is completely confused by their conversation.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: What are you guys talking about?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (duh)
dialog: STAB. Someone’s gonna make a
scene_heading: sequel outta this. “STAB 8: RETURN
dialog: TO WOODSBORO.”
text: Charlie breaks out with the HALLOWEEN score while Kirby
text: mimics FRIDAY THE 13TH.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE KIRBY
text: Da-DA-da-DA-da-da... Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma...
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: This is real. This isn’t a movie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But it will be.
dialog: And that Charlie and Kirby are certain of.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Deputy Hicks fills Dewey in on her findings.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
text: The cyber team is running a full

dialog: As soon as we get something--
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I want round the clock watch on
dialog: Jill and Sidney. Use Hoss and
dialog: Perkins.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Any statement to the press?
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: No comment.
text: Hicks nods. Sees the strain on her boss’ face.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: We'll get through this, Dewey.
text: She gives him a supportive smile. Just then, Gale plows into
text: his office. Hicks starts to object but Dewey allows it.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: It’s okay.
text: Judy exits, trying to hide her disdain. Beat. As Dewey eyes
text: Gale. A long, strained look. This is hard on him.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Do you have a suspect?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: We don’t have enough as this point.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Yea, but we’ve been down this road
dialog: before. It’s a certain type of
dialog: killer that’s attracted to Sidney
dialog: Prescott. It shouldn’t be too hard
dialog: to find a horror movie freak with a
text: motive and a cell phone.
text: Dewey stares at her in amazement. She stares back. What?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: You’re excited about this.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I’m trying to be proactive before
text: someone else is killed.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: No, you're really excited about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I had a cup of coffee. What?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: This is an official murder
dialog: investigation. You can’t be a part
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I’m not a reporter anymore.
dialog: 37

text: Rebecca nods. Got it. Just then, Jill enters.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JILL
text: It was the body morphing years.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It’s good to see you. Even
dialog: though...

speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: You're very calm for what’s going

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

dialog: working.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Why isn’t she?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: She was tabloid TV. The internet

dialog: while but... it was canceled.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Isn't she writing another book?
text: Sidney gets it. Feels for her friend.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Sorry about that. I was just
dialog: making my rounds.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No, it’s okay.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS

dialog: shout.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Thanks.
text: Sid starts to her room when--
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: You don’t remember me, do ya? We

text: Sidney studies her a moment, tries to recall.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS (CONT’D)
dialog: And Drama Club, too. We were in

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS (CONT’D)

dialog: guess I wasn’t very memorable.
dialog: Awkward. Then...

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Were you BFF’s with Jenny or
dialog: Marnie? I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Well, it’s Heidi Klum first, then

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Right. Well, good-night.
text: Sid’s cool about. She exits, closes the door.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (idiot)
dialog: “When in Rome?”
speaker_heading: KIRBY

speaker_heading: OLIVIA
text: Picking up his equipment. He’s
dialog: done. They kicked him off the

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Did he tell you about A&M? He lost
dialog: the scholarship too.
text: Jill pauses. She didn’t know that.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: The guy’s ruined. All for smoking
text: a joint in the Locker Room.
speaker_heading: JILL
text: It was the Girl’s Locker Room.
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: I know, I know...
text: Just then, Jill’s CELL PHONE RINGS. Kirby eyes it on the

dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I’m not Charlie.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: What are you doing with Charlie's
dialog: phone. Huh? Mr. Ghost Face?
dialog: (to Jill)
dialog: It’s Charlie being an asshole.
text: Jill waves it away. She can’t deal with him now. She goes

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Do you think he fooled around with
dialog: Jessica?
speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Shotgun make-out, yes. Full on
dialog: blow job, doubt it.

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
text: Open the closet door.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: You do know there’s cops all over

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE

text: Beat. Kirby grows cautious. Chilled.
speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: OLIVIA

text: Kirby reaches for the door knob. Her hand shakes some.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: (to Kirby)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Suddenly, she RIPS THE CLOSET DOOR OPEN. It’s empty. Relief

speaker_heading: KIRBY

dialog: Liar. I’m over this.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: I never said I was in your closet.
text: SMASH CUT TO OLIVIA’S BEDROOM

scene_heading: IN OLIVIA’S BEDROOM

speaker_heading: OLIVIA
dialog: Nooooo!!!

speaker_heading: JILL

text: Jill and Kirby come racing out of the house after Sidney.
text: She SCREAMS at them.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sid races up the drive, to the front door. IT’S LOCKED. She

scene_heading: EVERYWHERE.
text: She's too late. The sight overwhelms Sid. She erupts into

dialog: 50
text: Sid turns to find a CELL PHONE sitting on the dresser -- as

speaker_heading: JILL

text: slices open her shirt -- as Sidney and the GHOST FACE go
text: TUMBLING down the stairs.
text: Together -- intertwined. They hit the base of the stairs.
text: Hard. The GHOST FACE instantly rises. But, Sid is

dialog: her back when...
text: Sidney KICKS the GHOST FACE off of her -- she scrambles to
text: her feet, racing to the door, coming face to face with.
text: DEPUTY HOSS AND DEPUTY PERKINS -- their guns drawn on her.

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOSS

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS

speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: While the killer circled back to
text: the girl’s house.
scene_heading: DEPUTY PERKINS
dialog: He got us with the other house,

speaker_heading: KATE
text: Two glasses of wine and an Ambien.
dialog: I didn’t hear anything.
text: Just then, Kirby comes racing in.
speaker_heading: KIRBY

speaker_heading: JILL
text: Ow. Surface wounds hurt.
speaker_heading: KIRBY

speaker_heading: DR. ORTH
dialog: It’s not bad, believe or not.
dialog: How’s the head?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
text: Massive hangover.
text: The doctor holds her stare too long. Sidney senses it.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did we go to school together?
speaker_heading: DR. ORTH
dialog: You went to school with my younger
dialog: brother, Steve. You may not
dialog: remember, but he was...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Steven Orth. Yes, of course, I do.
dialog: And he had a brother, Danny, who
dialog: was in med school.
text: He’s taken aback. Surprised, she remembers.
speaker_heading: DR. ORTH
dialog: Most people forget about Steve.
text: The guy tied to the chair in the

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Dewey called me. I came. Whatever
dialog: I can do.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You can help me find Rebecca.
dialog: (to nurse)

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Dewey said you talked to the

dialog: 54
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: He told me to leave town as quickly
dialog: as possible.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: He did?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: He said the next STAB movie was
dialog: about the death of Sidney Prescott.
dialog: I interpret that as: Get the hell

speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Leaving may not be the best thing

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: How were you supposed to know some

speaker_heading: JILL (0.S.)
dialog: Are you leaving, Sidney?
text: Sidney turns to see Jill. Sid goes to her full of
dialog: compassion.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Someone is out there killing people
dialog: because I’m here. I have to go
text: before someone else gets hurt.
text: Beat. Sadly, this makes sense to Jill. To all of them.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING
text: The PRESS is having a field day with the news of another

speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: Another young girl is dead tonight
dialog: and Woodsboro is once again the
dialog: setting for a real life horror
dialog: movie...
text: Rebecca emerges from the hospital. She hides behind TWO
text: SECURITY GUARDS trying to figure out the best way to maneuver
text: the crowd when Dewey comes barreling through.
text: The REPORTERS swarm him as he makes his way to the doors.
text: Rebecca uses this as her opportunity to flee. She darts
text: through the crowd. Unnoticed.
text: “Sheriff.” “A statement.” “Anything.” The Sheriff reaches
text: the top of the stairs and turns to the CAMERAS as microphones
text: are shoved in his face.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I can assure you that we are doing
dialog: everything we can to apprehend
dialog: those responsible.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: So you think there’s more than one
dialog: killer?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: We can’t rule it out yet.
text: Reporters continue to grill him.
dialog: 56
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: A dimly lit lot. Rows and rows of parked cars. Rebecca
text: appears moving through them. She looks around, unable to
dialog: remember where the rental is parked.
text: She presses keys. BEEP. The RENTAL CAR’S LIGHTS FLASH two
text: rows over. She starts for it when her CELL PHONE RINGS. She
text: digs into her bag. Pulls it out with her ear piece.
text: It’s marked BLOCKED CALLED. She answers, inserting her
text: bluetooth ear piece.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: This is Rebecca.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: (but not so obvious)
dialog: Sidney Prescott please?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: This is her assistant, Rebecca
dialog: Walters. Can I take a message?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yes, please?
text: Rebecca starts to dig in her bag for a pen and paper.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Okay, sure, um...
dialog: (thinks better of it)
dialog: Actually, this is a really bad
dialog: time. May I call you back?
text: Rebecca crosses to the car. She regrets picking up the
dialog: phone. So not the time for this shit.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: It’s really important. It will
dialog: just take a second.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Please tell Sidney that it’s very
dialog: important that she doesn’t -- are
dialog: you writing this down?
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Yes, I am.
dialog: 57
text: Rebecca’s not writing shit. She’s lying.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Are you sure? It sounds like
dialog: you're walking.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I’m writing. Who is this?
text: Rebecca arrives at the rental car. BEEPS the door. Opens it
text: and slides in.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Please let Sidney know it’s
dialog: imperative that she not leave town
dialog: and to illustrate this I’m going to
dialog: kill her assistant.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Excuse me...?
text: CLICK. The phone goes dead. It takes a second for this to
text: register. Horror fills Rebecca's face.
text: She LOCKS the car doors, STARTS the ENGINE. Looks to the
text: left and right then spins around and peers into the back
text: seat. It’s empty. She turns back when--
text: A HAND BURSTS THROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW GRABBING HER
speaker_heading: THROAT.
text: Rebecca’s SCREAM is cut short.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - HOSPITAL
text: Sidney is still with Gale and Jill. Aunt Kate and Kirby are
dialog: there too. Then--
text: Sid's CELL PHONE RINGS. The CALLER ID says Rebecca. She
text: picks it up.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Bec? Are you out front?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yes, Sidney, you'll find Rebecca
text: right out front.
text: Sidney face falls. Noooooo. She takes off running. Gale

scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Dewey continues to answer reporter’s questions at the

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: The police department is working
dialog: around the clock to make sure no
text: one else is hurt.
text: Behind the CROWD OF REPORTERS, Rebecca’s rental car can be
text: seen drifting down the road. Coasting. Building speed on
text: the road’s incline. Growing closer and closer -- headed
text: directly for the CROWD.
text: Finally, people start to notice. “Watch out.” The car is
text: headed right for the hospital’s entrance. Dewey sees it.
speaker_heading: DEWEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys, watch it, move aside.
text: Instant commotion. As the car parts the CROWD. Sidney and
text: the others emerge from the hospital as--
text: The car CRASHES into a MEDIA VAN. Through the busted side
text: window -- Rebecca’s lifeless body can be seen behind the
text: wheel. Her throat slashed.
text: Horrific SCREAMS from all around. As the CAMERAS film every
dialog: second of it.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER
text: A waiting room has been taken over by the police. Jill sits
text: on a couch -- Kirby is curled up asleep, next to her. Aunt
text: Kate is there too.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How's your arm?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: It’s okay. Sore.
text: Gale passes with coffee. She takes a seat next to Sidney.
text: Offers her a coffee. Sid takes it.
speaker_heading: GALE
text: Rebecca’s family has been notified.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I never should have come back here.
dialog: 59
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: This isn’t your fault, Sid. If
dialog: anything it’s mine. I wrote the
dialog: book, I sold the movie rights. I
dialog: started this.
text: Sidney looks at her.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You're right. It is your fault.
dialog: But I knew better.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now, I can’t leave. We have to
dialog: keep her safe.
text: Sidney is referring to Jill.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: We will.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I don’t care what happens to me.
dialog: But no one else can get hurt.
text: Sidney is absolute and determined. Gale nods.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Dewey is with Deputy Hicks.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
text: The Cyber team is working on

dialog: should have something soon.
text: Gale marches up, determined.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Anything at all?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: We’re on it, Gale.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Don’t do that. Don’t cut me out of
dialog: this. I’m a part of this.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: It’s not protocol, Gale, for the
dialog: Sheriff's wife to be involved--
text: Gale spins around -- ready to rip Hicks’ throat out.
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: And who is talking to Deputy Judy?
dialog: Not me.
text: Dewey jumps in between them. Ushers Gale off to the side.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Okay, you can help. Just be nice.
text: Gale looks at Dewey, very seriously. Very troubled.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: We have to stop this, Dewey, before
dialog: anyone else dies.
text: He nods. In total agreement.
scene_heading: EXT. LANDSCAPRE - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. JILL’S BEDROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - MORNING
text: The sun shines through the window. Illuminating Jill in bed.
text: Her eyes flutter open. She awakens. YAWNS.
text: She gets up and peers out the window. Sees HOSS and PERKINS
text: below -- standing guard. Alert and ready.
text: A GROUP OF REPORTERS camp out too. Then, across the street--
speaker_heading: OLIVIA'S HOUSE
text: Covered in police tape. Now, a crime scene. A quiet moment.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Sidney is drinking coffee, while talking on her cell.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: I’m staying. I'd prefer if
dialog: everything could be channeled
dialog: through your office. Thank you,
dialog: Henry, I appreciate that. I’11 let
dialog: you know more as I know it. Bye.
text: Sid hangs up as Jill enters the kitchen. Sid goes straight
text: for her and hugs her. It’s comforting to Jill.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry about Olivia.
dialog: 61
text: Jill tears up.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know when people say, “I know
dialog: how you feel,” but you know they’re
dialog: just saying that and have no
dialog: friggin’ clue how you feel?
dialog: (then)
dialog: I know how you feel.
text: Sidney’s look says it all. She does know. Jill appreciates
text: it, finding comfort in Sidney’s quiet strength.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Where’s mom?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: She stopped by work for a bit.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I saw all the reporters outside.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: That's why we’re inside.
text: Sid hands Jill a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: How do you deal with it? With
dialog: everything that’s happened to you?
dialog: You've seen so much...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Death?
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: It sucks. I hate my life. I
dialog: didn’t ask for it. But running
dialog: from it gets me nowhere. I’ve
dialog: learned to embrace it.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: How did you do that?
text: Sidney shrugs.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I wrote a book about grief and
text: guilt and hope.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: And it helped?
dialog: 62
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It helped... pay the bills. The
dialog: thing that helped most, which I
dialog: worded differently in the book, is
dialog: I finally said, “Fuck it.” This is
dialog: it. Your life. You can boo-hoo or
dialog: get on with it. I’ve earned the
dialog: right to say, “Fuck it.” So I did.
text: Sid is very frank. Jill appreciates it. She likes this side
dialog: of Sidney.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I didn’t know you had edge.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (poised)
dialog: I’m so polite, aren't I? Things
dialog: are never what they seem, Jill.
dialog: That I can assure you.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I don’t think I'd like the
text: attention. People staring at me.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: People stare at me?
text: As if she didn’t know. Sidney smiles.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I won’t lie. I’d love to
dialog: disappear. Be somebody else.
dialog: Start from scratch. No scars. But
dialog: that’s not reality.
text: Jill smiles. In adoration. She looks up to Sidney.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

text: Dewey and Gale are there with Deputy Hicks and SEVERAL OTHER
speaker_heading: DEPUTIES.
text: A brainy technician, TONY, 30, holds open a laptop.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I triangulated the cell phones.

dialog: to call Jill Roberts and now
text: Charlie Walker’s cell.
text: Tony points to the laptop.
dialog: 63
scene_heading: ON LAPTOP SCREEN -- A digital map of Woodsboro. Several

speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: See the signal strength? Those
dialog: phones are here. On this campus.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: What’s the accuracy?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: The Lab’s GPS can get within 300
dialog: feet.
text: Gale takes the lead.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Great, you guys find the phones.
dialog: Dewey and I will begin questioning
dialog: suspects.
text: They all stare at Gale. Especially Dewey.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: What are you doing? Do you see
dialog: this? It’s a badge. My badge.
dialog: Where’s yours? Oh, right, you
dialog: don’t have one.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: You said I could come.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I said you could observe.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Consult.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: Quietly.
text: Hicks and the others watch their marital bliss in action.
text: Dewey takes charge.
speaker_heading: DEWEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, you guys find the phones and
dialog: we'll begin questioning suspects.
text: Gale nods. She couldn’t have said it better herself.

scene_heading: INT. AUDIO VISUAL LAB - WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Gale looks around the room. Sees all the video equipment and

text: the wall. Lots of horror movie posters.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What is this place?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Audio visual lab. We’re one rung
text: below the Glee club.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: We're awaiting our own TV show. We
dialog: have hope.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: First, let me just say, it isa
dialog: supreme honor to be a suspect. May
dialog: we film the interrogation?
text: Robbie films with his FLIP. Deputy Hicks casually takes it
text: from him. Dewey and Gale eye Charlie.
speaker_heading: GALE DEWEY
dialog: Where’s your cell phone, Where’s your cell phone, son?
dialog: Charlie?
text: Dewey looks to Gale. “Shut up”.
dialog: 65
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D) ROBBIE
dialog: I lost it. It was stolen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know what happened to it.
dialog: Your Deputy asked already. I can’t
dialog: find it. Not since lunch
dialog: yesterday. I sat it down for two
text: seconds to grab a burrito and a
dialog: Rockstar -- gone.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: He'll submit to a polygraph.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Where were you last night?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know someone used it in Olivia’s
dialog: murder. But it wasn’t me. I
text: stayed in. Watched WICKER MAN.
dialog: The original. Ask my mom. Look,
dialog: I’m a horror junkie, to state the
dialog: obvious, but I like my violence in
dialog: movies, not in reality.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Maybe, you can’t tell the
dialog: difference between the two.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’m not Billy Loomis, Sheriff. If
dialog: anything, I’m Randy, the film geek.
dialog: I just got accepted to Tisch.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
text: He drops that, “Tisch”, like it’s
dialog: gonna get him laid.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: That makes you a prime suspect in
dialog: my book.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: He’s right, he’s too obvious.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thank you. Besides, I don’t do
dialog: teen slasher. I’m more cult,
dialog: Argento, early Lynch, my tastes are
dialog: subversive.
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Very subversive. Henry Knowles is
dialog: irrelevant.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'd never partake in some lame
dialog: sequelitis retread.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Is that what you think is going on?
text: Both boys nod. These guys are “Who’s on first” with their
dialog: timing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh yeah, someone’s trying to bring
dialog: the STAB franchise back with a
dialog: reboot.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Re-imagining.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And it sucks. It doesn’t need to
dialog: be brought back. This genre trend
dialog: of shit remakes needs to stop. Rob
dialog: Zombie.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Michael Bay.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because for every DARK KNIGHT
text: there’s 50 PROM NIGHTS.
text: Dewey looks to Gale. She shakes her head. These guys are

dialog: The same way I always do. The

dialog: I’m sorry about Olivia.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You shouldn’t be here.
text: He ignores this. He goes to her, inspects her bandaged arm.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Are you okay? I was worried. I
dialog: know I screwed up but I care about
dialog: you. I can’t just turn that off.
dialog: You were almost killed.
text: His sincerity is convincing. Jill softens. Beat.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Do they have any idea who did it?
dialog: 69
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No. They think it’s, ya know, like
dialog: in the movies.
text: Jill can’t help herself. She's glad he’s there. Despite
text: their issues. He takes her in his arms. They hug for a long
dialog: moment. Finally...
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: This doesn’t mean anything. I
dialog: don't forgive you.
text: But she continues to hold him.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: You shouldn’t. I’m guilty.
text: Jill pulls away. Looks at him.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I screwed up. I’m not going to
dialog: lie. Not after what’s happened to
dialog: you. Jessica and I lit up and got
dialog: stoned, we messed around and got
text: caught. None of it matters now.
text: He’s powerfully honest. This hits Jill hard.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You lost your scholarship.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Guess I didn’t want it. That’s

text: Just then, the DOOR OPENS. It’s Sidney.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Hey, are you hungry? I’m sorry--
text: She's surprised to see Trevor in the room.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: It’s okay, Sid. This is Trevor.
text: He was just leaving.

speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Yeah, I was leaving.
dialog: 70
text: At the doorway, he passes by Sidney -- extremely close.
text: Their eyes meet.
speaker_heading: TREVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s nice to meet you. You’re
dialog: smaller in person.
text: Trevor and Sidney’s eyes meet. He smiles. It’s just enough
text: to make Sid uncomfortable. She takes a step back, allows
text: Trevor room to pass. Then, covers to Jill.
text: Just then, NOISE from outside takes their attention. They
text: both go to look out the window. The REPORTERS are packing up

speaker_heading: MR. BAKER
dialog: Twenty different ways to Sunday is
dialog: how. C’mon, Sheriff--
text: BEHIND THE GLASS
text: Gale and Deputy Hicks watch.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: He didn’t do it.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: How can you tell? The evidence is
dialog: overwhelming.
dialog: 71
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Because the evidence is
dialog: overwhelming. Would you leave
text: three cell phones, a mask, and a
dialog: bloody knife in your trunk?
scene_heading: BACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM
text: Mr. Baker is beginning to get worried.
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER
dialog: Look, I’m being framed. It’s
dialog: obvious.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Who would want to frame you?
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER
dialog: I could make a list. I’m an

text: Dewey slides a pad and paper towards him.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Why don’t you make a list?
speaker_heading: MR. BAKER
dialog: I'm getting really nervous here.

text: Gale and Hicks continue.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: He lawyered up fast.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: He’s innocent.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Could I play devil’s advocate for a
dialog: moment. Maybe he never thought
dialog: we'd look in the trunk. Maybe he
dialog: didn’t have time to dispose of the
dialog: evidence. Maybe he’s stupid.
text: Gale looks to her.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What would you like us to do,
dialog: Deputy Judy?
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: I think we should hold him.
speaker_heading: GALE

dialog: 72

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Um, Gale? Small thing. It’s
dialog: Deputy Hicks. Or Judy. But not
dialog: Deputy Judy.
text: Gale resists the urge to rip her apart. Instead,
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Got it. Another small thing. It’s
dialog: okay to be in love with my husband

speaker_heading: KIRBY

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Sure. Come on in.
text: Hoss and Perkins enter after Jill. They look around.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sid sits in an over-sized chair watching TV. She channel
text: surfs. It’s wall to wall coverage of the murders. A NEWS
text: ANCHOR talks to a REPORTER in the field.
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHOR
dialog: (from TV)
dialog: Was an arrest made? Or is Stuart
dialog: Baker only a person of interest?
speaker_heading: FIELD REPORTER
dialog: It’s unclear. However, sources say
text: the evidence is substantial.
dialog: 74
text: Sid SWITCHES channels. More coverage. Images of the
dialog: victims. Of herself. Past victims. (Randy, Tatum) Past
text: killers. (Billy Loomis, Micky) The current victims. Gale’s
text: book. Of Gale reporting. Past and present merge together
text: with every flip of the remote.
text: Sidney switches it over to a GOSSIP SHOW on the E CHANNEL.
speaker_heading: GOSSIP HOST
dialog: “Spatial Films announced today the

text: Sid gives up. She turns the TV OFF when she hears...
text: TAT-TAT-TAT. A NOISE. She freezes. Looks to patio doors.
text: Sidney rises and goes to the TWO LARGE GLASS doors that lead
text: to the deck and back yard.
text: It’s dark. She FLIPS the back porch light. JUMPS. Startled
dialog: by her own reflection. Jesus...
text: She instantly sees the source of the NOISE. A WIND CHIME has
text: tangled itself around the post of the back porch. The night
text: breeze causes it to TAT-TAT against the post.
text: She OPENS the door and steps out onto the...
scene_heading: EXT. BACK DECK - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sid quickly tries to untangle the chime. She’s very
text: vulnerable standing out there alone. The yard is pitch black
text: around her.
text: She pulls on the chime and ends up bringing it down on top of
text: her. Shit. She then attempts to hang it back up but it’s
text: too much trouble. Fuck it. She tosses it to the side of the
dialog: porch.
text: She steps back inside. Locks the door. TURNS the outside
text: light out.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sid enters the kitchen and goes to the fridge. Opens it and
text: grabs a water when...
text: TAT-TAT-TAT. Sid spins around to the family room.
dialog: 75
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sidney approaches the back glass doors again. Pitch black.
text: She CLICKS on the porch light to reveal--
text: The WIND CHIME is now back hanging from the porch post.
text: Right where it was. TAT-TAT. But how? Who put it back?
text: Sid's face goes pale when--
text: KATE’S HEAD POPS UP FROM BELOW THE WINDOW. SID SCREAMS.
text: Kate was bent over looking under a potted plant.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I can’t find the key.
text: Sid recovers. Opens the door.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Where is everybody?

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
text: The wind chime fell down.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: The Deputies took Jill over to
dialog: Kirby’s house. I thought it was
dialog: okay. Away from me is always a
dialog: good thing.
text: Sid's making a joke. She shuts and locks the door.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Did you see they got the guy?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I saw the news. I haven’t heard
dialog: from Dewey yet.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: The English teacher. Figures.
dialog: That calls for a glass of wine.
dialog: Whaddya say?
text: Kate starts for the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You go ahead. I’m gonna turn in.

scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sidney climbs the stairs and moves down the hall to her
dialog: bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST BEDROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sid enters the bedroom. Grabs her suitcase when her CELL
text: PHONE RINGS. She grabs it -- sees the CALLER ID is blocked.
text: She debates. Then, answers it.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: GHOSTFACE
dialog: Hello, Sidney.
text: Sidney freezes. Says nothing. Pure silence.
speaker_heading: GHOSTFACE (CONT’D)
dialog: Nothing to say?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You called me. What do you want?
speaker_heading: GHOSTFACE
dialog: I want you dead.

speaker_heading: GHOSTFACE (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: GHOSTFACE
text: The movie ends.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Tell ya what, I’ll have a glass of

text: Sidney BOLTS from the room. She goes racing down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sidney comes racing into the kitchen to find--
text: Aunt Kate pouring a glass of wine. She looks up, startled to
text: see Sidney so panicked.
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: We need to get out of here now.
text: Sidney dials her CELL. Beat.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dewey, Jesus, answer.
dialog: (dials again)
dialog: This is Sidney Prescott, I’m at
dialog: Kate Roberts house, please, hurry.
text: Just then, Aunt Kate’s phone RINGS. Kate answers it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: (then)
dialog: It’s for you.
text: She holds the phone out but Sid won’t take it. Instead, she
text: motions they need get out of the house. “He’s in the house.”
text: She points to her ear. “He can hear us.” Sid grabs a knife
text: from the sink. Then, she leads Kate from the kitchen to the
dialog: family room to the...
scene_heading: THE GLASS PATIO DOORS
text: Sidney HITS the porch light to REVEAL--
text: GHOST FACE standing on the back porch. Kate SCREAMS. They
text: both turn and race back through the house, through the
dialog: kitchen to...
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - ROBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kate and Sid reach the front door. Kate UNLOCKS IT and RIPS
dialog: IT OPEN to find...
text: GHOSTFACE ON THE FRONT PORCH. KNIFE RAISED. HE STRIKES,
text: CATCHING KATE IN THE CHEST.
text: Sidney SCREAMS. As Kate falls back against her. Sidney
text: stumbles back against the wall.
text: GHOSTFACE continues attacking, STABBING Kate repeatedly.
text: Her body is a shield, protecting Sidney. Several more
text: STRIKES. Finally, Sidney breaks free -- STRIKES with her own
dialog: knife. But--
dialog: 78
text: BLADE HITS BLADE.
text: The slightest pause. It’s just enough for Sidney to flee the
text: room. Suddenly, POLICE SIRENS can be heard approaching.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sidney races back through the kitchen to the...
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - ROBERT’S HOUSE
text: Sid races to the back patio doors. She opens them, then
text: stops when she sees...
text: GHOSTFACE STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER. What? Then,
text: she realizes -- it’s not a person -- only a costume hanging
text: from the wind chime. It was put there deliberately.
text: She looks behind her just as...
text: GHOSTFACE LUNGES -- BARRELS into Sidney. They both go to the
text: ground, tumbling, rolling across the grass of the back yard.
text: Sidney is thrown onto her back -- GHOSTFACE atop her. KNIFE
text: RAISED. He STRIKES down. Sid blocks it with her arm.
text: It slices into her -- cutting her forearm. She SCREAMS.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The Sheriff Jeep pulls into the drive. Dewey and Gale leap
text: from the car, racing to the house. A SQUAD CAR is right
text: behind them -- SIRENS BLARING.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: Sidney is struggling underneath Ghostface. DEWEY AND GALE
text: can be heard inside. So does Ghostface -- he looks to the
text: house -- sees Dewey and others coming...
text: It’s all the time Sid needs - she WHACKS GHOSTFACE. He
text: tumbles over. Sid manages to crawl away... she gets to her
text: feet and turns to find...
text: AN EMPTY YARD. Ghostface has completely disappeared. A side

scene_heading: THROUGH THE PATIO DOORS
text: Dewey and Gale race to Sidney.
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Are you okay?

speaker_heading: HOSS
dialog: Not all cops die in movies.
speaker_heading: PERKINS
dialog: No, but if it’s your last day
dialog: before retirement -- you do. Or if
dialog: you're a rookie and just found out
dialog: your wife is pregnant -- you do.
dialog: Or if your partner is better

speaker_heading: HOSS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be right back.

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Zombies.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No horror. Please? I beg you

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: A zombie comedy. You can’t go

speaker_heading: KIRBY

dialog: with Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, Ben

scene_heading: INT. FOYER - KIRBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kirby races to the door. Opens it to find Deputy Hoss.
speaker_heading: HOSS
dialog: You got some visitors.

dialog: 81
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: He’s cool, but I don’t about you.
dialog: Does Jill know you’re coming?
dialog: (to Hoss)
dialog: Yes, they can come in.
text: Charlie and Trevor enter. Kirby stops Trevor.
speaker_heading: KIRBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You be cool. I don’t want any

text: She leads them into the house.
speaker_heading: KIRBY (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn’t a party. Okay? No

scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: KIRBY

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It's okay, I’m fine.
text: Sid turns to Gale.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’s Jill?
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: She's safe.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I should tell her myself. If

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: We’ll have her brought to the

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: GALE

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS

text: Sidney rises.
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Charlie and Robbie are playing a game of pool, in the middle
text: of a heated discussion.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You're totally missing my point.
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're missing mine. The original
dialog: STAB was an irreverent self aware
dialog: post-modern deconstruction of the
dialog: horror genre. How do you remake
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You tap into the zeitgeist and take
text: it to the next level.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And what’s the next level?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Post-post-modern unaware self
dialog: awareness. The genre has evolved.
dialog: The rules have changed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, they haven't. If anything it’s
dialog: gone backwards. What rules have
dialog: changed?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You don’t have to be a virgin to
dialog: survive anymore.
text: Kirby brings them drinks.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: That’s just an update. You still
dialog: have to be the less slutty one.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don’t bring her into this. She
dialog: knows nothing.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: I can trivia you under any table.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who played Leather Face first?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: (instantly)
dialog: Gunnar Hansen.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Smoke.
text: Charlie gives Kirby a sexy stare.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I felt that. Did you feel that?
dialog: That charge that moved between us
text: just then. It was there.
text: Kirby shoots him a look. “In your dreams.”
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: New rule. You can kill gay people
dialog: now. You couldn’t do that in the
dialog: 90's. Gay characters were off
dialog: limits. Total social progress.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But racial awareness has not
text: changed. The black person still
dialog: can’t be the killer.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Yet. But Obama’s in office. He’ll
dialog: change that.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: The post-modern era of the 90's is
dialog: what triggered these remakes to
dialog: begin with.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: It exposed the cliches so they had
dialog: no choice but to start over.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Because there’s no such thing as a
dialog: new idea.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That is sadistically sad. I refuse
dialog: to believe it. So if you drink and
dialog: do drugs -- will you live?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You can even say, “I'll be right
dialog: back.”
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Here’s the rule. Do the double
dialog: reverse of every cliche and you'll
dialog: be okay.
scene_heading: IN THE KITCHEN
text: Trevor makes a drink. He holds up the bottle of vodka.
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No thanks.
text: He puts it down. He’ll pass too. He pours two sodas.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: I can’t believe Mr. Baker was
dialog: behind it. That’s crazy. Do they
dialog: have any idea why?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because he’s bananas. You should
dialog: be happy.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He busted you good.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Isn’t Baker the one who caught you
text: in the locker room with the (mimes
dialog: weed) and the (mimes tits)?
text: Trevor resists ripping his head off. Charlie knows he’s
text: stirring up trouble.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Gotta pee. Talk amongst
dialog: yourselves.
text: Charlie exits into the foyer, leaving Trevor and Jill alone.
speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: Yeah, so?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I just didn’t know.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: It’s not like I’m happy about it.

speaker_heading: KIRBY

text: Robbie has stepped out on the back deck to smoke a cigarette.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Robbie lights up a cigarette. Looks around the back deck.
text: Patio furniture, built-in barbecue, and bar.
text: Manicured gardens. Green grass. A detached guest house in
text: the rear. Very nicely done.
text: Robbie goes to the bar and digs around. He finds tequila.
text: Ah. Jackpot. He pours a shot when CREEAAK! A NOISE takes
text: his attention.
text: He looks around. But sees nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - KIRBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Hoss and Perkins are in the front seat.
speaker_heading: PERKINS
dialog: I don’t know why we have to sit out

dialog: in.
speaker_heading: HOSS
dialog: They would polite. They’re kids.
speaker_heading: PERKINS
dialog: Time to do a perimeter check.
speaker_heading: HOSS
dialog: I'll go. I hate sitting in this
dialog: car. I'll be back. Oh wait, I’m
dialog: not supposed to say that -- am I?
dialog: I won't be back.
speaker_heading: PERKINS
dialog: Tricky area. In this situation
dialog: when there’s a good chance you
dialog: could return and find me dead, it
dialog: could go either way.
text: Hoss gets out of the car.
dialog: 87
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - KIRBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Kirby’s alternative influenced bedroom. Jill and Kirby are
text: on the bed, chatting.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: I can send Trevor packing. He’s
dialog: acting all creepy eye.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I don’t think he knows what to say
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: There’s something weird going on
dialog: with him. Ya know, like he’s...
dialog: (drops it)
dialog: Never mind.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: What? Say it.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: All this STAB talk about remakes.
dialog: If the killer was not only
dialog: following the rules of horror
dialog: movies but the plot of what
dialog: happened before... he’s Billy
dialog: Loomis to your Sidney.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Trevor’s not a killer.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: I wouldn't guess Mr. Baker to be
dialog: one either. Forget it, I watch too
dialog: many horror movies.
text: Jill falls back on the bed. Her mind reeling.
speaker_heading: KIRBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I get you something?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Do you mind if I just lay here for
dialog: a second?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: You take all the time you need.
dialog: I'll be downstairs.
text: Kirby gets up and goes to the door.
dialog: 88
speaker_heading: KIRBY (CONT'D)
dialog: If you need anything, holla.
text: Kirby exits, closing the door behind her.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE YARD - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Deputy Hoss moves around the side of the house. He comes to
text: a side gate. He checks it. It’s locked. He peers over the
dialog: fence.
text: He sees an empty yard. Everything seems okay. He starts
dialog: back.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - KIRBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Hoss comes around the side of the house. He crosses the

text: He can see Perkins inside. Very still. Is he sleeping? The
text: closer Hoss gets, the more worried he becomes.
speaker_heading: HOSS
dialog: Perkins?
text: He comes around to the driver's side. Sees clearly that
text: Perkins is slumped over the wheel. He races to him.
text: Suddenly Perkins lifts up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY.
speaker_heading: PERKINS
dialog: You're too easy.
text: Hoss wants to smack him but he’s STABBED IN THE CHEST. It
text: comes fast and quick. FROM BEHIND. The KNIFE PENETRATES
text: DEEP. Hoss CRIES OUT. Drops to the ground revealing...
text: THE GHOST FACE BEHIND HIM. Perkins reaches for his gun, but
text: he’s too slow. The GHOST FACE RUSHES HIM -- IN ONE SWIFT
text: MOVE...
text: THE KNIFE SLICES HIS NECK OPEN -- THE CAROTID ARTERY ERUPTS.
text: Death is quick for both men. The GHOST FACE KILLER works
text: fast. He pops the trunk. He’s going to hide the bodies.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE SECURITY MONITORS -- GHOSTFACE is seen closing

speaker_heading: KIRBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
text: She goes back to the fridge. Opens it. Grabs a water. When

text: CHARLIE IS THERE. Kirby doesn’t jump at all.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You were supposed to jump.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: The refrigerator door is no-scare
dialog: for me. It’s right up there with
text: the medicine cabinet mirror.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Now, see the medicine cabinet gets
dialog: me every time. It’s the shower
dialog: curtain that’s lame.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Or the cat through the widow.
dialog: Meoooow.
text: Kirby makes a HISSING CAT SOUND.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We really should hook up. Who else

text: He’s getting too close. Kirby pushes by him.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Where did everyone go? Where’s
dialog: Robbie?
text: Kirby looks to the family room.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Maybe, he left. Wanna watch a

dialog: Kirby considers it.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: You promise not to rub all over me?
dialog: 90
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can do that. Whaddya want to

text: Charlie goes to the remote -- starts to key up the ON SCREEN
speaker_heading: LIBRARY.
speaker_heading: KIRBY

scene_heading: INT. KIRBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

text: outside. A NOISE behind her. She turns and looks.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Jill steps out into the hall. HEARS music from below. Looks

speaker_heading: JILL

speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: That’s it?

speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I think you should quit while

speaker_heading: TREVOR

text: Jill thinks about it.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Not tonight, Trevor.
speaker_heading: TREVOR

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

text: Robbie. He lays incredibly still.
speaker_heading: KIRBY

scene_heading: INT. FRONT YARD - KIRBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Hold up, Ms. Prescott.
text: Sidney starts up the walk while Hicks goes to the PATROL CAR

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh my God.
text: Sidney sees the look on Deputy Hick’s face.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Jilli!!!

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Where’s Jill?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
text: Upstairs.
dialog: 95
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: C’mon...
text: Just then, Charlie emerges from the house, looking really
dialog: scared.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Robbie’s dead.
text: Sidney doesn’t know what to think of him. She holds out the
dialog: knife.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Stay back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why? What did I do?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: He’s okay.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Are you sure? There’s blood on his
dialog: hands.
text: Kirby sees the blood on his hands.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Why do you have blood on your
dialog: hands, Charlie?
text: Charlie holds up his hands.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I tried to help Robbie.
text: Charlie is honestly scared out of his mind. He takes a step
text: towards them when Sidney shields Kirby, protecting her.
text: Kirby races back inside the guest house. Sid is right behind
text: her. They lock the door. Charlie follows them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please. I haven’t done anything.
dialog: We gotta get out of here.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - KIRBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Deputy Hicks enters. Gun drawn. A LIGHT at the top of the
text: stairs takes her attention. It’s followed by a CLOSING DOOR.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HICKS
dialog: Sidney?
dialog: 96
text: Hicks, against all better judgement, climbs the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Charlie stands just outside the glass doors. He pleads with
text: them. While Sidney dials her CELL PHONE. She’s calling Jill
text: But there’s no answer.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: C’mon, open up.
text: He BEATS on the glass window. His face is panicked.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Go away, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hurry, we need to go...
text: Kirby is freaking out. She fights back her emotion.
text: Just then, Kirby and Sidney see GHOST FACE appears behind
text: Charlie. She realizes she was wrong.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Watch out...
text: Charlie turns just as the KNIFE STRIKES. He ducks, races
text: away, back into the yard.
text: The GHOST FACE goes after him. They disappear from view.
text: Kirby moves to the next window, just misses them. The
text: windows of the room only face the side yard.
text: She goes into the next room.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It’s a small bedroom that opens up onto the whole back yard.
text: Two huge glass doors look out onto the yard and pool.
text: Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO OUT. The back yard is plunged into
dialog: darkness. Shit. What now?
scene_heading: INT. KIRBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jill sits up on the bed. HEARS a noise from the hallway. She
text: goes to the door and opens it. Peeks out. She sees a SHADOW
text: dance across the wall.
text: She steps into...
dialog: 97
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING
text: Jill moves down the hall. There’s an open doorway at the
text: end. Jill goes to it. Peers in. She sees Deputy Hicks

text: Hicks sees her -- pulls her gun. Jill throws her hands up,
dialog: frightened.
scene_heading: INT. GUEST HOUSE - KIRBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Sidney backs away from the glass. Just then, her CELL PHONE
text: RINGS. She answers it.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: GHOST FACE
dialog: (from phone)

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: GHOST FACE
dialog: To play a game.
text: Sidney turns angry.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I’m not playing, asshole.
text: Sidney hangs up. A shivering Kirby stares at her.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Should you have hung up on him?
text: Just then, BACK YARD LIGHTS flood the yard.
text: Both Sidney and Kirby go to the glass doors and look out
dialog: onto...
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: In the middle of the yard, directly facing the GUEST HOUSE,
text: Charlie sits in a patio chair. Bound by electrical tape. It

dialog: impossible.
dialog: 98
scene_heading: INSIDE THE GUEST HOUSE
text: Kirby CRIES OUT. She’s frighteningly sober. CRAZED.
speaker_heading: KIRBY

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No, don’t...

speaker_heading: GHOST FACE
dialog: Let's try this again.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know how this works. First
dialog: question. Are you ready?
text: No, Sid’s not ready. She’s not ready at all.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No, I’m not ready.
text: A shaking, terrified, Kirby stares at Charlie in the yard.
text: Their eyes meet. He’s begging for his life. Kirby turns to
text: Sidney, finding courage.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: I’m ready.
text: Sidney puts her cell on SPEAKER so Kirby can hear.

text: knife. Sid quietly opens the door when--
speaker_heading: GHOST FACE
dialog: Sidney, you step out that door and
dialog: I will slit him ear to ear.
text: Sid closes the door back.
text: IN THE BACK YARD

text: Charlie watches, freaked, but rooting, praying...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE GUEST HOUSE

dialog: How old? Are you fucking kidding
dialog: me? That’s not a real question.
text: Kirby racks her brain -- she has no fucking idea.
speaker_heading: GHOST FACE
text: Clock’s ticking...
text: Kirby goes nuts, trying to figure it out.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: He didn’t drown -- another trick
dialog: question.
text: IN THE BACK YARD
text: Charlie TREMBLES and SHAKES -- FREAKING OUT.
dialog: 101
speaker_heading: GHOST FACE
dialog: When he was believed to have
dialog: drowned?
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: He was a little kid. He was...
text: Shit. Kirby is mouthing “9? 10?...” She’s counting it out
text: on her fingers. She has no idea. She’s a nervous wreck.
text: Sidney tries to help.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Go with one. Nine works.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: (works it out)
dialog: Wait. In the FINAL CHAPTER we
dialog: learned Mrs. Vorhees gave birth in
dialog: 1946, right? And, um, in the
dialog: original, the two counselors were
text: killed in the flashback in ‘58 and
dialog: Jason drowned the summer before,
dialog: ‘57, so born in ‘46, drowned in ‘57
dialog: would make him, uh, uh, uh --
dialog: ELEVEN!!! Jason was 11, 11, 11,
dialog: yes!!!
text: Kirby leaps up. With mad and crazy euphora.
text: IN THE BACK YARD
text: Charlie is relieved. Sort of.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE GUEST HOUSE
text: Sid looks around the yard. It’s deadly quiet.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello? Are you there?
speaker_heading: AUTOMATED VOICE
dialog: (from cell)
dialog: “If you’d like to make a call,

text: Sidney kills it. Looks around. Turns to Kirby.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY

dialog: Charlie get to the house. Okay?
text: A petrified Kirby can only nod.
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: IN THE YARD
text: Charlie watches the, curious as to hwat they’re up to.
text: Sidney unlatches the door. Looks to the left, to the right.
text: Slowly, she steps out. Kirb joins her.
text: ON CHARLIE -- Scared. Worried. Hopeful.
text: Kirby looks at the back yard. To the main house. There’s no
text: sign of anyone. Anywhere.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: I won. Didn't I?
speaker_heading: IN THE YARD
text: Casey and Sid race to Charlie. They rips at the tape around
text: his arms. All the while, looking around into the shadows of
text: the yard, knowing the KILLER could be anywhere.
speaker_heading: KIRBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I won, Charlie. I won.
text: She rips the tap of his mouth, then arms...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh god, hurry...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Finish this and get outta her. I
dialog: gotta find Jill.
text: Sidney starts for the main house while Kirby continues
dialog: freeing Charlie.
text: With his hands free, Charlie starts helping. He rips his
text: legs free from the chair. He rises up. He grabs Kirby,
text: kisses her for saving his life.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: We have to hurry.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, just one thing.
text: She looks at Charlie -- his expression turns. Then, she sees
text: the KNIFE he reaches for, hidden in the chair. The next
text: moment happens fast -- AS CHARLIE STABS HER WITH THE KNIFE.
text: It SLICES INTO KIRBY’S stomach. She stumbles back.
dialog: 103
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you fucking know 11? You
dialog: fucking cow, you were supposed to
dialog: miss that one. Goddammit.
text: Kirby looks at him with childlike innocence. Then, the pain
text: and shock follow.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, you win alright. You fucking
dialog: prick tease. You win death.
text: He STABS her again -- FURIOUS AT HER. She COUGHS UP, unable
text: to speak -- a look of stunned horror. He STABS HER SEVERAL
text: MORE TIMES -- QUICK JABS. Kirby manages a SCREAM.
text: Sidney turns in time to see Kirby drop to the ground. As
text: Charlie meets Sid’s stare.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, you look genuinely surprised.
dialog: I can explain.
text: He takes a step towards Sid. She stumbles back inside the
text: house. He starts for her.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE HOUSE
text: Sid locks the doors. Races through the house to the...
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - KIRBY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: She rips the front door open as GHOST FACE LUNGES AT HER,
text: waiting for her.
text: Sid flees to the only place she can -- upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT
text: Sid races up the stairs and down the hall. GHOST FACE is
text: fast on her heels.
scene_heading: INT. KIRBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Sidney races inside Kirby’s bedroom. She locks the doors,
text: runs to the bathroom. She shuts it. Locks it. Then...
text: SHE HEARS SOMETHING. It comes from behind the shower
text: curtain. Sidney reaches for the curtain -- pulls it aside to
dialog: find...
scene_heading: TREVOR -- HE REACHES OUT. GRABS HER. Sidney SCREAMS.
text: KNOCKS HIM OVER. Then, she moves fast. Sid rips the
text: bathroom door and bolts.
dialog: 104
text: Sid runs to Kirby’s bedroom door. She opens -- GHOST FACE is
text: before her. Sidney STRIKES with her kitchen knife.
text: It's catches GHOST FACE’S ARM. He flinches. It’s enough for
text: Sidney to squeak by.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING
text: Sid races down the hall. She gets to the stair case. Looks
text: down to see Charlie climbing up -- knife in hand.
text: Sidney runs down the hallway to an open doorway. She goes
text: inside and trips instantly over something.
text: She comes face to face with Deputy Hicks. Sidney is on top
text: of her, staring directly into Hicks’ cold, dead eyes.
text: SIDNEY SCREAMS. Rolls off her. Turns to see -- GHOST FACE
text: enter the room. Sidney looks around. There’s no where else
dialog: for her to run.
text: Slowly, GHOST FACE approaches.
speaker_heading: GHOST FACE
dialog: What’s the matter, Sid? You look
dialog: like you've seen a ghost.
text: And with that, the Ghost Face removes its mask, revealing
text: Jill underneath. She sports a wicked smile as she slips out
dialog: of the costume.
text: Sidney’s face drops to the floor.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Yep, it’s me. Surprised.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Jill. No...
text: Sidney tries to make a break for it. But she comes nose to
text: nose with a loaded gun.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I’ve got the Deputy’s gun. I’m
dialog: dying to shoot it. I’m so sick of
dialog: the knife thing. Now, get up.
text: Beat. As Sidney does as told.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT
text: Charlie is dragging Trevor’s body to the top of the stairs.
text: It’s obvious now that his feet have been bound and he’s been
text: seriously injured. His shirt is bloody red.
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: C'mon, Trevor, buddy, this might
dialog: hurt a little.
text: Charlie sits him up at the top of the stairs and then pushes
text: him. His body goes TUMBLING to the body.
text: He lands with a THUD. And a CRACK. Something broke. He lay
text: at the bottom of the stairs -- CRYING OUT IN PAIN. Charlie
text: trots down to join him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It looks like you broke your leg.
dialog: That sucks.
text: Charlie PRESSES down on it. Trevor SCREAMS IN AGONY.
speaker_heading: TREVOR
dialog: You fucker...
text: Jill appears, leading Sidney down the stairs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Jill)
dialog: You asked her the easy questions.
dialog: Didn’t you use my list? I put the
dialog: harder ones at the top. Why did
dialog: you skip?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: It’s done. Can we move on?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Can we do him yet? With DNA
dialog: testing, we’re good with time line.
text: Jill turns the gun to Trevor -- without flinching. She
text: shoots him in the forehead. He drops over dead.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Jesus... why...
text: Jill turns the gun back on Sidney.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Jill and Charlie lead Sid into the kitchen where Robbie lay
text: dead on the floor.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You got it figured out yet, Sid?
dialog: In keeping with our remake theme,
dialog: Trevor and Robbie are this
dialog: generation’s--
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Billy and Stu.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: And we’re the innocent victims.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We're Sidney and Randy. And we get
dialog: to go to college and have a sequel.
dialog: But this time -- Randy gets the
dialog: girl.
dialog: Charlie moves to Jill -- she lets him kiss her. You get the
text: sense she tolerates Charlie. They break. He smiles.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You did real good. You're the
dialog: perfect victim.
text: Jill can’t hide it. She’s full of exhilaration.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: I was so believable today. I told
dialog: so many lies I actually believed
dialog: them. I was born for this.
text: Jill's true colors start to take shape. She’s a deeply
text: troubled sociopath. She looks to Sidney.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, let’s face it. I’ve had
dialog: enough practice. Do you know what
dialog: it was like growing up in the this
dialog: family? In this town?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Her mother was a slut bag whore
dialog: just like your mother. Sisters. I
dialog: made out with her mom once. She
dialog: got drunk and slipped me the tongue
dialog: one night.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Drunk bitch.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You crazy fucks...
text: Just then, the PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Watch this.
dialog: 107
text: Jill races for it. Grabs it haphazardly and sinks into a
scene_heading: MASTER PERFORMANCE OF HYSTERIA AND FEAR.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Oh my God, help me. He’s trying to
dialog: kill me. He killed Sidney... Help.
text: Jill hangs up. Back to calm and poise. To Charlie.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon, we need to get on with it.
dialog: They’1l be here soon.
text: He raises his arms -- as Jill holds the KNIFE. She’s going
text: to stab him.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going to do this hard. It
dialog: can’t be tentative.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: C'mon, baby, let’s do this old
dialog: school, like Billy and Stu. It’s a
dialog: remake, baby.
dialog: (ala Chinatown)
dialog: No, it’s a sequel. It’s a_ remake,
dialog: sequel, remake, sequel, sister,
dialog: daughter, sequel...
text: Jill stabs him. She gets him DIRECTLY in the heart. He
text: drops to his knees. Instant pain. But his face registers
dialog: confusion too.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s not the way we rehearsed
dialog: it...
text: He doubles over, bleeding. She takes the opportunity --
text: STRIKES him again. And, in this moment, he realizes he’s
text: been played and betrayed.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: There’s been a change of plans.
dialog: The problem with you, Charlie.
dialog: It’s always been about killing
dialog: Sidney Prescott. My plan is a
dialog: little bigger. I’m going to become
dialog: her.
text: And with that, Jill stabs him again. Charlie can’t believe
text: it. He’s stunned and shocked. He falls back, crumbling to
text: the floor. Still. As Jill looks down at him with a glimmer
text: of diabolical glee.
dialog: 108
text: A quick kick of her foot. His body doesn’t move. He’s dead.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: How did you turn into this?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Nothing is ever what it seems.
dialog: Your words, Sidney. I’ve always
dialog: been this. You know what it’s like
dialog: growing up related to you? All you
dialog: hear is Sidney this, Sidney that,
dialog: Sidney, Sidney...You were always so
dialog: fucking special. Now it’s my turn.
text: Jill takes the knife.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: And now you have to die. Those are
dialog: the rules.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What rules?
speaker_heading: JILL
text: There’s only room for one lead.
dialog: Let's face it, Sid, you’re ingenue
dialog: days are over.
text: Jill STABS Sidney with the knife. She GASPS in pain. Jill
text: STABS her again quickly. This one WRACKS Sid’s body. She
text: drops to her knees. Sidney’s eyes roll back in her head.
text: Everything goes slow-motion.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Apropos. Finally, what should of
dialog: happened 15 years ago.
text: Sidney falls to the floor. Jill watches as Sidney draws her
text: last breath. Sad. Tragic. Epic. All at once.
text: Jill springs into action. She’s well rehearsed.
text: She kneels next to Charlie’s body. She takes his limp hand
text: and claws at her own face, with careful attention to his
text: fingers. She’s securing her DNA under his nails.
text: She then makes sure his class ring is facing out on his
text: middle finger and proceeds to PUNCH herself with his limp
dialog: hand.
text: It doesn't really create the desired effect. She tries
text: BACKHANDING herself. That works better.
dialog: 109
text: Quick and fast, she BASHES herself several times. It hurts
text: like hell. She CRIES out but continues until she hears a
speaker_heading: CRACK.
text: BLOOD SPEWS FORTH. It’s broken. Jill SOBS in genuine pain.
text: But, she’s not done. She leans down closer to Charlie’s
text: body. Takes his other hand and places it on her head,
text: clamping down on her hair.
text: She takes a BEAT to prepare herself. Then, YANKS AWAY.
text: RIPPING a large CLUMP OF HAIR from her own scalp.
text: Jill SCREAMS in pain. That fucking hurt.
text: She throws Charlie’s hand to the floor -- hair clutched in
text: his dead fingers. Then, she sees GALE begin to stir again.
text: Jill moves fast. She stands up and quickly moves -- racing
text: backwards, free falling into...
scene_heading: THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE
text: It SHATTERS to pieces. Jill lay there engulfed by the
text: table’s frame. GLASS is everywhere. Beat. She attempts to
text: rise -- it takes a few tries. As she CRIES OUT. She’s truly
text: hurting now.
speaker_heading: JILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me... Somebody help me...
