dialog: belt for six months, maybe a year...
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: What kind of belt?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: A surgical belt. You won't be able to do
text: very heavy lifting.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: .I try to stay away from that.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: But you spend time outdoors.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
speaker_heading: MMMM
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You didn't have very much on you when you
dialog: were admitted. Where were you going?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: I was on my way to Placerville. To the
dialog: Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a

speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: It's a weakness. But I like it.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I know what the other is too.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: How can you tell that? I'm clean.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: FREDDIE

dialog: that doesn't mean I don't have a
dialog: weakness...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: College?

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Why'd you leave?
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Sometimes my hypo's get the best of

dialog: hospital for medicines. And your belt.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: Alright. I intend to do that. You saying
dialog: you have a job for me? What? As an
dialog: orderly?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much
dialog: lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have
dialog: to learn. But maybe you could run an
dialog: elevator, something of that sort.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE
dialog: I want to get out of here, but I also
dialog: like it here. You think I was gonna die?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I know you were, Freddie.
speaker_heading: FREDDIE

speaker_heading: FREDDIE

speaker_heading: MASTER (CONT'D)
dialog: But that doesn't mean it's not there,
dialog: does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy
dialog: little piece of tape is just nothin'
dialog: without all the other equipment lined up
dialog: properly, isn't it? We CAN access the
dialog: past, traumas and seeds that abberate us
dialog: in present time and once we access them -
dialog: we challenge them and throw them away.
dialog: Previously, I'd established how to access
dialog: these aberrations and painful memories to
dialog: pre-birth/cellular times.
dialog: But the new studies prove there is a time
dialog: beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which

dialog: studies show...
dialog: Besides the everyday struggles of how we

dialog: Island, its a wound I've never conquered
dialog: and I'll tell you how I found out about,
dialog: because I never knew what in the H was
dialog: happening...
dialog: Well I did some processing to find out.
dialog: Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me
dialog: back...we processed over three hours! And
dialog: something came up. It was this:
dialog: I lived a life before and suffered a
dialog: great injury. Knee injury...
dialog: It was just around 1888. A great number
dialog: and year. Significant as the creation .

dialog: -- but I made a slip away. A digression
text: into the under constructed sewer system.
dialog: It was here that I could no be found - or
dialog: so my thinking went. All my confidence
dialog: and all my arrogance was brought upon me.
dialog: Full in the face. For I was nose to nose
text: with a twenty-five foot alligator in the

dialog: So what does this say? Injuries stay with

dialog: gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna
dialog: fix this knee. How are any of us going to
dialog: get better? More able?
dialog: We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This

speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: Some of this seems quite like hypnosis,

speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the
dialog: reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is
dialog: un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow
dialog: him to raise his awareness and IQ.
speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: What is the difference between this and
dialog: psychotherapy?
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: Yes. Well. They are very different. No.
dialog: Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no,
dialog: no. Don't associate us with such people!
dialog: That's terrible (he, he) why that's a bad
dialog: manner don't you know? I mean at that
dialog: business about sex and all that. That's
dialog: for the neurotic or the person who is
dialog: insane or something like that. That's
dialog: nothing to do with us. They've failed.
dialog: That's for the fortunate few who can
dialog: afford the fees.
speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: But some of this does in fact seem to
dialog: share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and
dialog: modern psychotherapy, does it not?
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: No it does not. This is an exact science,
dialog: you see. Comparable to physics or
dialog: chemistry - but simpler. It's
dialog: engineering. Herr Freud had his chance
dialog: and contributed some very workable data,
dialog: but in the end, he failed. So that's
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: And how long does this take?
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: That depends. But it can be quite fast.
dialog: Quite fast. Or it can take some time.
dialog: Sometimes less than 36 hours.
speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: 36 hours? And you're saying that these
dialog: methods can cure leukemia according to

speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: Are you a religious people?
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: We are not incorporated as a religion,
dialog: no. But remember this: that religion has
dialog: come uniformly from a philosophy.
dialog: Philosophy is senior to religion. You
dialog: could call us a religion of religions.
speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: Are you saying then that any religion is
dialog: rather narrow in its outlook?
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's
dialog: belief's, but religions in general can be
dialog: pre-occupied with a God or Idol or
dialog: something of some such nature who is
text: merely trying to fill the universe with a
dialog: lot of little replicas of himself - we

dialog: bend to a will of a God, you see. And if
dialog: our teachings can reconcile these views
dialog: it would be doing a great service to
speaker_heading: MANKIND -
speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: Do you think it can?
speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: I not only think it can, I know it does.
speaker_heading: JOHN MORE
dialog: You mentioned 'good science' and what it
dialog: does.. .but doesn't that, by definition,

speaker_heading: MASTER
dialog: Indeed, indeed. Which is why our
