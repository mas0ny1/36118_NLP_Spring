speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you see what I’m saying?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah, totally.
text: We reveal that SHAUN is sitting with a woman, LIZ. They are
text: both in their late twenties. LIZ looks slightly concerned,
text: SHAUN looks slightly confused. They are having a drink.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You shouldn’t feel so responsible.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I know he’s your best friend but
dialog: you do live with him.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I know...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It’s not that I don’t like Ed.
dialog: (speaks off to her right)
dialog: Ed, it’s not that I don’t like you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: S’alright.
text: We reveal ED right next to them, playing a horror themed
text: FRUIT MACHINE which bleeps spooky electronic noises. He is in
text: his late twenties and slightly overweight.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It'd just be nice if we could-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (hits the fruit machine)
dialog: Fuck!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: -spend a bit more time together-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bollocks!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: -just the two of us-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Cock it!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: We have a laugh don’t we?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah...
text: SHAUN and LIZ smile, sharing some private joke. SHAUN
text: relaxes, momentarily off the hook. But...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: But with Ed always here, it’s no
dialog: wonder I end up bringing my
dialog: flatmates out. Then that only
text: exacerbates things.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Well, you guys hardly get on do
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No, what does exacerbate mean?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It means ‘to make things worse’.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh right. Look, it’s not that I
dialog: don’t like David and Di.
dialog: (speaks off to his right)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys, it’s not that I don’t like
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: DAVID DIANNE
dialog: That’s alright. That’s alright.
text: We reveal DAVID and DIANNE, sitting next to LIZ. Both in
text: their late twenties, DAVID is trendy but straight-laced, DI
text: is colourful and chirpy. They hold hands.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: And it’s not that I don’t want to
dialog: spend time with you because I do.
dialog: It’s just, Ed doesn’t really have
dialog: too many friends-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Can I get any of you cunts a drink?
text: SHAUN closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Anybody?
speaker_heading: DAVID DIANNE
dialog: No thanks. No thanks.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I’m fine thanks, Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Pint Shaun?
text: SHAUN nods. ED holds out his palm to SHAUN, who sighs and
text: reluctantly hands him a fiver. Meanwhile, DAVID steps in.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know friends are important Shaun,
dialog: but you've got to set aside quality
dialog: time for just the two of you. I
dialog: know I would, if I was Lizzy’s
dialog: boyfriend.
text: DAVID looks at LIZ with affection, as DIANNE chips in.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Or get out more. Daffs is always
dialog: taking me out to see his listed
dialog: buildings, I’m always dragging him
dialog: to the theatre.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m not so hot on theatre.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: I took my students to see this
dialog: great new play about incest. Very
text: cool. Lots of swearing.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He’s not so hot on theatre.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Well, how about a nice meal? You
dialog: could go to that restaurant me and
text: Daffs go to. The place that does
dialog: all the fish. It’s your anniversary
dialog: soon isn’t it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It was last week.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Oh, so did you do anything special?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: We came here.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah, but that was just me and you.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: And Ed.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: He wasn’t with us.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He was sitting at the bar. It’s not
dialog: the same.
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: Shauny, hog lumps!
text: A packet of Pork Scratchings hits SHAUN square in the face.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun, what I’m trying to say is, I
dialog: need something a little more.
text: SHAUN offers her a Pork Scratching. She declines.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: More than spending every night in
dialog: the Winchester. I mean, I’m 29.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve got things I want to do with
dialog: my life, I want to get out there,
dialog: do more interesting stuff, live a
dialog: little, but I’d love to be able to
dialog: do it with you, but I want you to
dialog: want to want to do it too.
text: LIZ laughs grimly at her own silly sentence. She then takes a
text: pork scratching and regards SHAUN with a mixture of
text: exasperation and affection.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t want to go on at you,
dialog: Jesus, listen to me. I’m beginning
dialog: to sound like your Mum. Not that
dialog: I’d know what she sounds like.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You still haven’t met his Mum?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Not Yet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can’t believe you haven’t met his
dialog: mum.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It’s not that simple.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Don’t you get along with your Mum,
dialog: Shaun?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s not that I don’t get along
dialog: with her-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you ashamed of your Mum, Shaun?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No I’m not, I love my Mum.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (returning with drinks)
dialog: I love his Mum.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: She’s butter.
speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun-
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Liz
dialog: (holds up his hands)
dialog: I totally understand what you’re
dialog: saying and I agree, really I do. We
dialog: should get out there. Do more
dialog: interesting stuff. Together. We’1ll
dialog: start tomorrow, I’1ll book a
dialog: restaurant. The place that does all
dialog: the fish. We’ll do it properly.
dialog: Just the two of us. Things’1l
dialog: change. Promise.
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: LIZ (0.S.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: TITLES BEGIN
text: A MONTAGE OF GREATER LONDON, Saturday 8 A.M. (All actions in

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE -DAY
text: Bare feet shuffle into shot. Slowly we PAN UP to see-
text: SHAUN. Dead to the world. His face tired. He yawns.
text: We are in the lounge. The decor is male, the room untidy. ED
text: is sitting on the sofa, playing a video game.
text: He may have been there all night. SHAUN sits next to him,
text: picks up a game controller and presses a button. A VOICE
text: booms.
speaker_heading: GAME VOICE
text: Player two has entered the game.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Haven’t you got work?
text: SHAUN puts the controller back down.
speaker_heading: GAME VOICE
text: Player two has left the game.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM -DAY
text: A TOILET is flushed...a SHOWER run...TEETH brushed...
text: SHAUN now wears a white short-sleeved shirt. He straightens
text: his tie in the mirrored door of the bathroom cabinet, which
text: is ajar. He shuts it.
text: PETE stands in the reflection. His face like thunder.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You do know the front door was open
dialog: again last night?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -DAY
text: A DRAWER is yanked open...A KNIFE grabbed...TOAST buttered. A
text: BOTTLE OF MILK hits the table. PETE screws the lid on.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m not saying it was you.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I know man but-
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I’m saying it was Ed.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Right.
text: PETE returns the milk to its rightful place in the fridge. He
text: also wears a shirt and tie, but is somewhat smarter.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I can’t live like this. Look at the
dialog: state of it. We’re not students
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Pete-
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s not like he even brings any
text: real money into the house.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: He brings a bit.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What, dealing drugs?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Come on. He sells a bit of weed
dialog: every now and again. You’ve sold
dialog: puff.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Once! At college! To you! Anyway, I
dialog: did a lot of stupid things at
dialog: college Shaun. I dressed up as
dialog: Frank N. Furter, I drank snakebite
dialog: and black, I slept with a fat girl.
dialog: Doesn’t mean I want to do any of
dialog: them for a living.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Look I’ve known him since primary
dialog: school. I like having him around.
text: He’s a laugh.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What because he can impersonate an
dialog: orangutan? Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: He’s dead weight Shaun.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh leave him alone.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Okay, I admit, he can be pretty
dialog: funny on occasion. I had a great
dialog: time that night we sat up drinking
text: Apple Schnapps and playing Tekken
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah, when was that?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Five years ago. When is he going
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Whassup niggaz?
text: ED enters and takes the milk from the fridge, he swigs from
text: the bottle and wanders out, scratching his nuts.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’1l have a word.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE -DAY
text: SHAUN sits down by ED, who is again playing the video game.
text: PETE watches at the door.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Hey man, listen...top left...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: ...I was just going to

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: ...Since you’re...ooh nice shot.

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Two seconds.
dialog: (answers )
dialog: Alright Noodle...No I only got an
dialog: ‘enry. Shortage on...Alright.
dialog: Laters.
text: ED resumes his game. PETE’s seen enough and wades in.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Ed, since you’re not working at the
dialog: moment, could you please clean up a
dialog: bit?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I am working.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Since you are in the flat all the
dialog: time do you think you could clean
dialog: up a bit?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And if you play the answer machine,
dialog: could you take down everyone’s
dialog: messages, not just your own?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s not that taxing is it? Writing
dialog: something on a ‘post-it’ note?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Nope.
text: PETE’s mobile rings as he leaves (ring tone: ‘LIVE FOREVER’
text: by Oasis). He puts on his jacket. On the back is a ‘post-it’
dialog: reading - ‘I AM A PRICK’
text: SHAUN sees this and shakes his head wearily at ED.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. It was pretty funny.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Seriously, will you do what he
dialog: said?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I ain’t doing nothing for him.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Well, do it for me then.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (pauses game)
dialog: I’m sorry Shaun.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, I’m sorry Shaun.
text: SHAUN puzzles, before his expression turns to disgust.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh man that’s bad. You’re rotten.
text: ED laughs. SHAUN does too, as he covers his nose and mouth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I’1l stop doing them when you stop
dialog: laughing.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m not laughing. I’m going.
text: SHAUN leaves. The phone rings. The answer machine picks up.
speaker_heading: PETE (V.0O.)
dialog: Hi, you’re through to Peter and

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: LIZ (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re probably not there anyway.
dialog: I’ll try you at work. so...okay.
dialog: Bye, bye. Bye. Bye.
text: CLOSER. The RED LIGHT flashes. The screen is filled.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -CONTINUOUS
text: BANG. A FOOTBALL hits SHAUN in the head. He turns to see the
text: BORED KID grinning at him. He responds playfully.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh you’re dead!
text: SHAUN boots the ball back. He walks past PETE in his car and
text: crosses the road. He heads for the newsagent passing a
text: HOMELESS MAN in a green coat with a dog on a lead. He stands
text: with an ARM OUTSTRETCHED. SHAUN gives him some change.
scene_heading: INT. NEWSAGENT -DAY
text: SHAUN grabs a coke from the fridge and goes to the counter.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Nelson?
text: There’s no-one there. SHAUN waits, idly scanning across the
text: day's papers, their headlines partially concealed.
text: ‘G.M. CROPS BLAMED FOR...’ ‘...UNIDENTIFIED MUTILATED...’
scene_heading: ‘,..SUPER-FLU...’ ‘...DOWNED SATELLITE CAUSES...’
text: SHAUN peers closer. As if by magic, the SHOPKEEPER appears.
speaker_heading: NELSON
dialog: Hello my friend. No beer today?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Bit early for me.
text: A PALE SUITED MAN enters hurriedly, as we follow SHAUN out.
speaker_heading: PALE SUITED MAN (0.S.)

speaker_heading: NELSON (0.S.)

scene_heading: INT. BUS -DAY
text: SHAUN is sat on a bus crowded with BLANK PASSENGERS; a PASTY
text: GUY listens to his walkman, an OLD MAN slowly nods off.
text: SHAUN looks out of the window. On the street, he sees a YOUNG

speaker_heading: SHAUN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Gather round everyone...
scene_heading: INT. SHOP-FLOOR. ELECTRICAL STORE -DAY
speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: ...Senior staff member.

speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: I’m feeling under the weather, can
dialog: I have the day off?
text: A ripple of laughter. SHAUN tries to find it funny.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No, Ash genuinely is ill. So we’re
dialog: going to have to pull together
dialog: today-
text: A mobile phone interrupts.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: Yeah? Hello mate.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Noel, could you-
speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: Two seconds.
text: NOEL holds up his hand. SHAUN concedes weakly.
speaker_heading: NOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah man. I was totally munted.
dialog: Yeah I spoke to him. He’s only got
dialog: an ‘enry.
text: SHAUN is left twiddling his red biro.
speaker_heading: NOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright man. Laters.

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Thanks. As Mr. Sloman says,
dialog: “there’s no ‘I’ in ‘team’ but there
dialog: is an ‘I’ in ‘pie’...something
dialog: about a team pie...I don’t know.
dialog: That’s it-

speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NOEL

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Hey, I’m only twenty nine for

speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: Seventeen.
speaker_heading: SHAUN

dialog: Really?...Look Noel, I know you
dialog: don’t want to be here forever.
dialog: Neither do I. I got things I want
dialog: to do with my life.
speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: When?
text: NOEL points to SHAUN’s top pocket. His biro has leaked.
speaker_heading: NOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You’ve got red on you.
scene_heading: INT. ELECTRICAL STORE -LATER
text: SHAUN is demonstrating a TV to a young couple.
speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: NOEL (0.S.)
dialog: It’s your Dad!
text: SHAUN looks to the counter. With NOEL is a MIDDLE-AGED MAN.

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: PHILIP

speaker_heading: SHAUN

dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: Thought this wasn’t a social
dialog: gathering.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: How come you’re allowed to talk to
dialog: your Dad?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Look, A) he is not my Dad, he’s my
dialog: stepdad and B) it was an emergency.
speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: What, buying your Mum some flowers?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: ...Yes.

speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: LIZ (0.S.)
dialog: Okay cool, well, ring me later.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Goodbye Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Bye.

scene_heading: EXT/INT. FLORIST -EVENING
text: A DISTRESSED BUSINESSMAN, crying loudly, runs past the window
text: of a florist. Inside, SHAUN watches him go.
speaker_heading: FLORIST
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sorry, yeah, they’re for my Mum.
text: The FLORIST produces some tags.
speaker_heading: FLORIST
dialog: ‘To a Wonderful Mum’ or ‘POW! Super
dialog: Mum’.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Um...first one.
text: SHAUN writes out the card and hands it back. He looks back to
text: the street. On the other side of the road is a SCRUFFY MAN on
text: the steps of a CHURCH, surrounded by pigeons.
dialog: 19.
text: SHAUN watches as the SCRUFFY MAN swipes at the pigeons.
text: Amazingly he catches one.
text: SHAUN’s transfixed as the SCRUFFY MAN raises the pigeon to
dialog: his mouth. Surely he isn’t going to...
text: A BUS pulls up outside. SHAUN cranes to see through the

speaker_heading: COMMUTER’S VOICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: STATION GUARD
text: Suicides. Three.
text: The GUARD raises three fingers. SHAUN is a little freaked.
scene_heading: INT. BUS -EVENING
text: SHAUN is again on a bus crowded with BLANK PASSENGERS. The

text: have nodded off and is dribbling. The bus is barely moving.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -MOMENTS LATER
text: SHAUN walks. Cars honk, a traffic jam clogging up the road.
text: He looks ahead to the cause, a CAR has stalled at the lights.
text: A HAND slaps SHAUN on the arm.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Ohmigod, Shaun!
speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Surviving.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Haven’t seen you since the days

speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Ooh wow. What about you? Last time

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: YVONNE

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Not really. Kinda let it go,
dialog: y'know?
text: The SIREN wails on. YVONNE nods.
speaker_heading: YVONNE

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Four years. Last week actually.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Aw, did you doing anything special?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No, we’re going for a meal tonight.
speaker_heading: YVONNE

text: The SIREN slows. Realisation dawns. SHAUN goes ashen-faced.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE -EVENING
text: FRONT DOOR swung open...FLOWERS thrown into the sink...YELLOW
text: PAGES flung open. We see on the page: ‘Fulci’s. The place

text: SHAUN anxiously paces on the phone. ED plays his videogame.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You gonna thank me then?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Tidying up.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Doesn’t look that tidy.
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The Winchester?
speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: LIZ (0.S.)

speaker_heading: SHAUN

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK -EVENING

speaker_heading: SHAUN (0.S.) (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. LIZ’S BATHROOM -MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Liz, I can explain. Let’s just go
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What, to the Winchester?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Do you want to?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hmm, let me see. Liz, let’s have a
dialog: quiet one in the Winchester. Liz,
text: it’s Saturday night. Winchester
dialog: night. Hey Liz, there’s a quiz on
dialog: this evening. Really? Aw, I love a
dialog: good quiz. Well, do you want to
dialog: come? Yeah, where’s it on? THE
dialog: WINCHESTER! No, I don’t fucking
dialog: want to!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sorry, I just thought we could-
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It’s not the only place in the
dialog: world Shaun!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I know, we can go somewhere else.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE -CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: DAVID and
speaker_heading: DAVID and

speaker_heading: LIZ (0.S.)

speaker_heading: SHAUN (0.S.)
dialog: Well, let’s all go together.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What, you hang out with a bunch of
dialog: teachers? Sorry, a failed actress
dialog: and a twat?
text: DI look at each other, affronted.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, that’s a bit harsh.
speaker_heading: LIZ (0.S.)
dialog: Your words.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (0.S.)
dialog: I did not call Dianne a failed
dialog: actress.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Cuh!
text: DIANNE is relieved. DAVID remains affronted. LIZ storms into
text: the lounge, with SHAUN in tow, helping her with her coat.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Seriously, let’s go out somewhere,
dialog: forget all this. We’ll have a
dialog: laugh, just the two of us.
dialog: Things’1l be cool. Promise.
text: LIZ turns angrily on SHAUN, who cowers behind the coat.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh stop making these promises!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Off the top of my head? You
dialog: promised you'd stop smoking when I
dialog: did. You promised you'd go back to
dialog: the gym. You promised we’d go flat
dialog: hunting. You promised you’d start
dialog: deejaying again. You promised you'd
dialog: try drinking red wine instead of
dialog: beer. You promised you’d come on
dialog: holiday with me. You-
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: We went to Greece didn’t we?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: We met in Greece.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (disdainfully)
text: At a rave.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It’s not the same. You promised
dialog: things would change.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: You promised you'd get us free
dialog: cable.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m working on that!
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (to Liz)
dialog: Well, look...I can stop smoking. I
dialog: can give up whenever I want. See?
text: SHAUN takes out a fag packet and chucks them in the bin.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: What was the next one?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It’s not enough, Shaun.
text: LIZ walks out, leaving SHAUN with DAVID and DI.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Basically, I think your nine lives
dialog: are up-
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh get fucked four-eyes! Why don’t
dialog: you go out with her, you love her
dialog: so much?
text: DAVID goes red.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know what you mean by that.
text: SHAUN makes a ‘like you don’t know’ face and leaves.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know what he means by that.
speaker_heading: DIANNE says nothing.
scene_heading: INT. LIZ’S ROOM -CONTINUOUS
text: LIZ is sat on her bed. Head in her hands. SHAUN enters.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Got you these.
text: He offers her the flowers with a smile. LIZ clocks the tag.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: “To A Wonderful Mum”?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah...cos, remember last night,
dialog: you said you didn’t want to sound
dialog: like my Mum...
text: LIZ laughs, more out of exasperation than amusment. A pause.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: They are for your Mum aren’t they?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Smooth.
text: LIZ returns her head to her hands.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sorry. I wasn’t thinking. I’m
dialog: tired.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You're tired? It’s not the
dialog: strongest defence is it? I’m tired
dialog: Shaun.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: LIZ
text: The ‘S’ word again.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sor...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You can’t just keep saying ‘sorry’
dialog: and expect things to be okay. You
dialog: wave it around like a ‘get out of
dialog: jail free’ card.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: But, what if I am sorry?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What if you are? It’s not like you
dialog: ever do anything about it. Nothing
dialog: ever changes.
dialog: (she sighs)
dialog: Look, I’ve got to do something. If
dialog: I don’t, I’m going to end up in
dialog: that pub, every night for the rest
dialog: of my life, like those other sad
dialog: old fuckers, drinking myself to
dialog: death, wondering what the hell
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What do you mean “do something”?
scene_heading: EXT. LIZ'S FLAT -EVENING
text: SLAM. SHAUN is stood outside. Still in his work clothes.
text: Still holding the flowers. Face like...
text: THUNDER. Rain falls. SHAUN stares blankly ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WINCHESTER -NIGHT
text: SHAUN walks toward the pub, still holding the flowers. He

speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)

text: A packet of PORK SCRATCHINGS hits a glum SHAUN in the face. A

text: Behind, a wall mounted TV shows a SQUAD CAR whizzing through
text: suburbs, lights flashing. Seconds later, the pub is
text: illuminated by the FLASHING LIGHTS of a passing squad car.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck her. You got your pint. You
dialog: got your pig snacks. What more
dialog: d’you want? Your favorite monkey
dialog: don’t you? You want me to do Clyde?
text: ED proceeds to ape Clyde the orangutan from ‘Every Which Way

speaker_heading: SINEAD O'CONNOR (0.S.)

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: ED

text: ED motions to JOHN for another round.
scene_heading: INT. WINCHESTER -LATER
text: ...CURTAINS ARE DRAWN...DEAD BOLTS click into place...The TV,

text: ignites two SAMBUCA shots. He and SHAUN ritualistically down
text: them, spluttering and laughing.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You know what we should do
dialog: tomorrow?
text: A hand appears on ED’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Keep it down a bit lads.
speaker_heading: ED/SHAUN
dialog: Sorry John.
text: JOHN moves off with their empties. ED continues quietly.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You know what we should do
dialog: tomorrow? Keep drinking. Have a
dialog: Bloody Mary first thing. Get a bite
dialog: at The King’s Head. Grab a couple
text: at The Little Princess, stagger
dialog: back here and bang! We’re up at the
dialog: bar for shots. How’s that for a
dialog: slice of fried gold?
text: SHAUN remains utterly glum.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT’D)
dialog: C’mon man talk to me.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Can we just leave it Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What did she say?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: A lot.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What a bitch.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: She said if she stayed with me, she
dialog: was going to end up sitting in here
dialog: every night for the rest of her
dialog: life like these sad old fuckers,
dialog: drinking herself to death,
dialog: wondering what the hell happened.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That’s harsh. These are not sad old
dialog: fuckers. These are rich,
dialog: interesting characters.
dialog: 32.
text: Cut away to a number of SAD OLD FUCKERS around the bar.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Like who?
text: ED points to a MULLET HAIRED FIFTYSOMETHING at the bar.
speaker_heading: ED
text: Snakehips. Always surrounded by
dialog: women. Bigamist. Strangled his
dialog: first wife with a draft excluder.
dialog: Invented the mobile disco.
text: Vaguely amused, SHAUN points to an IRISH SPINSTER necking
dialog: whisky.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ex-porn star. Done it all. Mish,
text: doggy, reverse cowgirl, A2M.
dialog: Starred in the world’s first
dialog: interracial hardcore loop. Cafe au
dialog: lait.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What about John?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Who, the “Barrel”? North London
dialog: Mafia.
text: SHAUN laughs and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: That really is true. Big Al says
dialog: so.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Big Al also says dogs can’t look
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Think about it. The gruff demeanor.
text: Handy with a blade. Bernie, the
dialog: trophy wife.
text: ED points to BERNIE, the wizened landlady behind the bar.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s connected. Why d’you think
dialog: there’s a rifle over the bar?
dialog: 33.
text: ED nods to a rifle mounted on a brace.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: ‘Cos the pub’s called the
dialog: Winchester.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Exactly.
text: SHAUN lets himself laugh. ED smiles.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: See, you don’t need Liz to have a
dialog: good time.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed! Let’s just leave it now.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Listen, can I just say one thing?
dialog: And I’m not gonna say, ‘there’s
dialog: plenty more fish in the sea’. I’m
dialog: not gonna say, ‘if you love her let
dialog: her go’...I’m not gonna bombard you
dialog: with cliches. All I’1l say is,
dialog: ‘it’s not the end of the world’.
text: THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. A SHADOWY FIGURE is visible beyond the
text: frosted glass of the door. JOHN calls out to it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sorry we're closed.
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE
dialog: Uhhhhhh...
text: More EMERGENCY VEHICLES pass. The flashing lights momentarily
text: define the FIGURE at the door. Maybe it’s a trick of the
text: light, but it appears to have NO LOWER JAW. The FIGURE
text: follows the noise and shuffles off.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Pisshead.
scene_heading: EXT. PUB -NIGHT
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SIGN: “PLEASE LEAVE QUIETLY”
text: SHAUN & ED drunkenly belt out ‘White Lines’. The SNOGGING
text: COUPLE are still outside, necking furiously. ED calls over.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Haven’t you had your tea?
dialog: 34.
text: The WOMAN stops necking the man. He goes limp and drops to
text: the ground. She watches SHAUN & ED stagger off.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -CONTINUOUS
text: SHAUN & ED cross the street, still singing ‘White Lines’ in
text: harmony. Behind, another FIGURE is stumbling down the middle
text: of the road. He appears to join in with...
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE
dialog: Uhhhhhhh.
text: SHAUN and ED turn, gleefully trying to draft their new friend
text: into the sing-a-long. Again he responds with...
speaker_heading: THE FIGURE (CONT’D)
dialog: Uhhhhhhh.
text: SHAUN and ED shrug, a little disappointed.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE. LOUNGE -NIGHT
text: ‘CRUCIAL ELECTRO’ blares. An old-skool party is in full

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Still got it!
text: PETE storms in. He grabs the record off the turntable-
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Don’t scratch it!
text: -and throws it through the open window.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the second album I ever
dialog: bought!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It’s four in the fucking morning!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s Saturday-
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No, it’s fucking Sunday and I have
dialog: to go into fucking work in four
dialog: fucking hours, because every other
dialog: fucker in my fucking department is
dialog: fucking ill! Can you see why I’m so
dialog: fucking angry?
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Fuck yeah!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Pete, I’m sorry. We’re a bit
dialog: pissed. We split up with Liz
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well just keep it down okay?
text: PETE heads for the door. As he does, ED mutters-—
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Prick.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Sorry, what was that?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Nuffin.
text: PETE launches at ED, fists flying. SHAUN pulls them apart.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Hey. Come on. We’re all friends
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: He is not my friend! He’s an idiot.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It means maybe you should fuck off.
dialog: You wanna live like an animal, go
dialog: live in the shed, you thick fuck.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: Pete, leave him alone.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Stop defending him! Why do you
dialog: stick up for him all the time
dialog: Shaun? All he does is hold you
dialog: back. Or does it make life easier
dialog: having someone around who’s more of
dialog: a loser than you?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You know what I mean. I presume it
dialog: was Liz who did the dumping? Am I
dialog: right? Sort-your-fucking-life-out-
dialog: mate-
text: SHAUN is utterly floored. ED interrupts-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What’s up with your hand man?
text: We reveal that PETE’s hand is completely bandaged up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I got mugged on the way home.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: By who?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I dunno, some crackheads or
dialog: something. One of them bit me.
dialog: (Ed breaks out laughing)
dialog: It’s not fucking funny!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why did they bite you?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don’t know, I didn’t stop to ask
dialog: them! Now, I have a splitting
dialog: headache and your stupid hip hop
dialog: isn’t helping.
dialog: (storming out)
text: And the front door’s open again!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It’s not Hip Hop, it’s Electro.
dialog: Prick.
text: A shell-shocked SHAUN doesn’t reply. ED slumps on the sofa.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Next time I see him he’s dead.
scene_heading: INT. HALL/KITCHEN -MOMENTS LATER
text: SHAUN shuffles out into the hall and plays the answer phone.
dialog: We hear Liz’s message from earlier-
text: -as SHAUN stands in the darkened kitchen and stares at a
text: photo of him and Liz, pinned to a ‘THINGS TO DO’ board.
dialog: 37.
text: As Liz and Barbara’s messages play, he scrawls something on
text: the board, then drunkenly slumps onto a kitchen chair.
scene_heading: SCENE 32 MERGED WITH SCENE 31
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -SUNDAY MORNING
text: SHAUN wakes, groggy and hung-over. He’s still in the chair.
text: His eyes focus on the ‘THINGS TO DO’ board. It reads-
scene_heading: ‘GO ROUND MUM’S...GET LIZ BACK...SORT LIFE OUT’
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE -MORNING
text: ED is still slumped on the sofa.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Want anything from the shop?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Cornetto.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -MORNING

scene_heading: INT. NEWSAGENT -MORNING
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Nelson?
text: No-one is behind the counter. SHAUN grabs a Strawberry
text: Cornetto from the freezer and goes to the cooler. He opens
text: the door, not noticing two smeared BLOODY HANDPRINTS ON THE
text: GLASS. SHAUN grabs a Coke oblivious, slipping as he moves
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Nelson?
text: SHAUN goes to the counter. It seems oddly bare.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Nelson, you got any papers?
text: SHAUN shrugs and puts some change onto the counter.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: I owe you fifteen pence Nels.
dialog: Alright?
text: SHAUN leaves. In the security mirror we can see the body of
text: Nelson slumped at the back of the store.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET -MORNING
text: SHAUN crosses the street again. One of the FIGURES is close
text: now, its ARMS OUTSTRETCHED. It wears a GREEN COAT and trails
text: a dog lead in its hand. SHAUN fishes in his pockets, without
text: really looking over.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sorry mate, no change.
text: Shaun goes inside. In the distance, we can see the figure
text: Nelson shamble out of the shop.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE -MORNING

dialog: Hello...excuse me.
text: ED picks up a lump of mud and throws it at the GIRL.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oi!
text: The missile strikes her on the head. She turns slowly.
speaker_heading: WE SEE HER FACE
text: She is pale, greyish. Her eyes are lifeless and cloudy. Her
text: hair is matted with something. Her CHECKOUT GIRL’S uniform is
text: dirty and torn. The image is horrific and unmistakable.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh my God! She is so drunk.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How much have you had love?
text: She lurches forward, her ARMS OUTSTRETCHED towards SHAUN. ED
text: and SHAUN step back, giggling.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Ooh she likes you.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I think she wants a cuddle.
text: She keeps coming. Mouth open. HISSING. SHAUN backs up.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Look I’ve just come out of a
dialog: relationship-
text: He trips and falls. THE GIRL is quickly on top of him.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ed, do something!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Wait there.
text: ED runs back into the house.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed!
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: Two seconds.
text: SHAUN gets a clear look at her eyes. Something’s not right.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold it there.
text: ED has come running back with a FUN CAMERA. Takes a snap.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Get her off me.
text: ED pushes the GIRL away. She stumbles, then comes back at
text: them both. ED gets his first good look.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What’s up with your eyes? What’s up
dialog: with her eyes?
text: SHAUN jumps up and shouts to the GIRL.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Now seriously, I’m warning you...
text: She keeps coming...SHAUN clocks her name badge.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Mary. I’m going to have to get
dialog: physical. I mean it!
text: She keeps coming. SHAUN loses his patience.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Right, this is it! Fuck off!
text: SHAUN shoves MARY hard in the chest. She stumbles down the
text: garden, falls backwards and IMPALES HERSELF onto the rusty
text: remnants of a free standing clothes line. The metal pole
text: protrudes through her stomach. BLOOD oozes through her top.
text: SHAUN puts his hands to his mouth. ED bites his lip.
text: SQUELCH. She gets up. SHAUN is momentarily relieved...before
text: seeing the GAPING HOLE IN HER STOMACH. ED starts to wind on
text: the fun camera. SHAUN bats it out of his hands.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: I think we should go back inside.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay.
text: They turn to see a HULKING MAN right behind them. His eyes
text: dead also. He has massive injuries to his face and neck...
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE -MOMENTS LATER
text: ED stands by the window. The curtains are drawn.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What’s going on? Shaun?
text: SHAUN’s on the phone, dialling fast.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Shit. It’s engaged.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What about an ambulance?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s busy Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Fire engine?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed, it’s one number and it’s busy.
dialog: Why do you want a fire engine
dialog: anyway?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Anything with flashing lights man.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Are they still out there?
dialog: 42.
text: ED opens the curtains. MARY and THE HULK are still out there.
text: They look at ED. He promptly shuts the curtains again.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah...what do you think we should
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Let’s have a sit down.
text: They sit on the sofa. Upright, close to each other. They
text: watch a TIRED AND TROUBLED NEWSREADER on the TV. Behind them,
text: through the hall, we see the FRONT DOOR move.
speaker_heading: NEWSREADER (T.V.)
dialog: -although it’s been hard to
dialog: establish how this could have
dialog: happened on such a wide scale and
dialog: so rapidly-
text: BEHIND THEM. The FRONT DOOR opens.
speaker_heading: NEWSREADER (T.V.) (CONT'D)
dialog: -Environmental Health Officials
dialog: have refused to confirm that the
dialog: phenomenon is the result of a virus-
text: We see live footage of SHAMBLING FIGURES in a street.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Do you think this is the same
dialog: thing?
text: BEHIND THEM. A SUITED MAN wanders in.
speaker_heading: NEWSREADER (T.V.)
dialog: -the Home Office are asking people
dialog: to stay in their houses. Ensure
dialog: your residences are secure with all
text: windows and doors firmly locked-
text: SHAUN and ED turn to each other, then look-
text: BEHIND. THE SUITED MAN lumbers into the lounge. His shoulder
text: has been torn away. He looks pale and hungry.
speaker_heading: SHAUN/ED NEWSREADER (T.V.)
dialog: Fuck! ...avoid contact with these
dialog: individuals...
text: SHAUN & ED jump off the sofa. The SUITED MAN lurches.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: SUITED MAN NEWSREADER (T.V.)
dialog: Uhhhhhh... ...if you find your safety is
dialog: compromised, it is important
dialog: to remain calm...
text: SHAUN and ED panic. They back around the room attempting to
text: evade the SUITED MAN, who pursues them relentlessly.
speaker_heading: NEWSREADER (T.V.) (CONT'D)
dialog: -We're expecting information from
dialog: the Home Office regarding the best
dialog: way to...uh...neutralize the
text: attackers, as they are seemingly
dialog: impervious to conventional force-
text: Suddenly ED grabs a heavy glass ashtray and brings it down
text: hard on the SUITED MAN’s head. CRACK! He falls back,
text: lifeless, skull split open. SHAUN and ED stand panting.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m just going to shut the front
dialog: door.
text: SHAUN runs out into the hall. ED goes over to the body.
speaker_heading: NEWSREADER (T.V.)
dialog: ..in the meantime contact with
dialog: these assailants is highly
dialog: inadvisable...
text: SHAUN rejoins ED, who is staring at the body.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Did you see his head go?
text: THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! MARY and THE HULK want in.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT’D) NEWSREADER
dialog: We should get out there. -officials suggest that-
speaker_heading: SHAUN NEWSREADER
dialog: No we should stay inside. -in extreme circumstances-
speaker_heading: ED (CONT’D) NEWSREADER
dialog: Come on, we can take ‘em. -the attackers can be stopped-
speaker_heading: SHAUN NEWSREADER
dialog: But the man said to stay (sips his water)
dialog: indoors. -uh I repeat-
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck the man!
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: As long as we’re in here and
dialog: they’re out there, we’re safe.
text: SMASH. The back window goes. MARY and THE HULK pull the
text: curtains down and reach through the broken glass.
speaker_heading: NEWSREADER
dialog: -removing the head or destroying
dialog: the brain.
text: SHAUN takes a deep breath.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN -MOMENTS LATER
text: A WHISTLE. MARY and THE HULK stop thumping and turn to see ED
text: and SHAUN standing determinedly next to a cardboard box.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Aim for the head.
text: The boys hurl the contents of the box; a variety of kitchen
text: implements, saucepans etc. They bounce ineffectually off the
text: intruders. Within seconds the arsenal is spent.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: Now what? MARY and THE HULK close
text: in. ED looks to the nearby shed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We’ll have to get more stuff.
dialog: What’s in the shed?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I don’t know. It’s locked.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why is it locked?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s always been locked.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, what are we going to-
text: ED spies the discarded ‘CRUCIAL ELECTRO’ album on the grass.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed, no-
text: Too late. ED flings the record frisbee style. SMACK. It
text: catches THE HULK in the face, throwing his head back.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bam!
text: THE HULK staggers back up, the record sticking out of his
text: face. A look of confusion between SHAUN and ED.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN -MOMENTS LATER
text: SHAUN unclips the lid on an expensive looking record box.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Now look, some of these are limited-
text: ED grabs a record and flings it. It flies past MARY’s head.
speaker_heading: ED starts
speaker_heading: ED flings
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that one?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I think it was Blue Monday.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Aw, man! That was an original
dialog: pressing.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, for fuck’s sake.
text: flicking through the records.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: ‘Purple Rain’?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ‘Sign Of The Times’?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Definitely not.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh, come on. The ‘Batman’
dialog: soundtrack?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Throw it.
text: disappointing Prince. It lodges in MARY’s thigh.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Dire Straits?
speaker_heading: ED flings
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Throw it.
text: dreary A.O.R. It thuds into THE HULK’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oootcha!! Okay, ‘Stone Roses’?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ‘Second Coming’?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I like it!
text: ED picks another record. MARY and THE HULK bear down.
text: ED throws.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ‘Sade’?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It's Liz’s.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: She did dump you!
text: It misses and shatters against the house.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh fuck this. I’m going to the
dialog: shed.
text: SHAUN walks towards the shed. ED follows.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I thought you said it was locked.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It is.
dialog: IS NOW PART OF SCENE 42
scene_heading: INT. SHED -CONTINUOUS
text: BLACKNESS.
text: The door splinters open. SHAUN crashes through.
text: steps in after him. They survey the contents.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN -CONTINUOUS
text: SHAUN and ED emerge from the shed. SHAUN carries a cricket
text: bat, ED has a spade. MARY and THE HULK are right on top of
dialog: them. There’s no other option.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Which one do you want? Girl or
dialog: Bloke?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Um...first one.
text: WHACK. The first blow is tentative and reluctant. Each strike
text: gains confidence and force. MARY and THE HULK go down. The
text: blows become frenzied and in perfect synch.
text: MARY and the HULK are finally dead. SHAUN and ED stop,
text: hyperventilating together. Their hands bloodied. Their
text: clothes splattered. Their faces shocked. A baptism of gore.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE -DAY
text: SHAUN and ED are back on the sofa. SHAUN has a mug of tea in
text: his shaking hand. ED eats his Cornetto and points to SHAUN’s
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You’ve got red on you.
text: A FRAZZLED CORRESPONDENT talks over footage of a GREYISH MAN
text: clawing at the glass of an observation room.
speaker_heading: CORRESPONDENT (T.V.)
dialog: -scientists have now confirmed that
dialog: in all cases, people receiving
dialog: bites have experienced headaches
dialog: and nausea and developed symptoms
dialog: similar to those displayed by their

dialog: has been bitten it is absolutely
dialog: essential that you isolate them
dialog: immediately-
text: SHAUN and ED look at each other.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL -MOMENTS LATER
text: SHAUN and ED stands at the foot of stairs, looking up.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Pete? Pete?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why don’t we just go up?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m not going up there.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Because A) he might be one of them
dialog: and B) he might be really annoyed.
dialog: Pete? Must have gone to work.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (finding Pete’s keys)
dialog: How come he didn’t drive?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (reaching)
dialog: Probably got a lift. He said he
dialog: wasn’t feeling well. Pete?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Oi, PRICK?!
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ED/SHAUN
dialog: He’s not in.
text: SHAUN thinks. ED gets out his fags and offers one to SHAUN.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’ve given up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Since-
text: Just as SHAUN remembers, the phone rings.
scene_heading: SCENE 48 IS NOW DELETED
scene_heading: INT. HALL -CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: Shaun.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum! I was just going to call you
dialog: actually. Is everything okay?
text: ED’s ears prick up. He instinctively stubs out his fag.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: Some men tried to get into the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Are they still there?
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: I’m not sure. We’ve shut the
dialog: curtains.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Did you try the police?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I thought about it.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Are you okay? Did they hurt you?
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: No, I’m fine, I’m fine...
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum?
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: Well, they were a bit bitey.
text: The colour drains from SHAUN’s face.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh my God Mum. Have you been
dialog: bitten?
text: The colour drains from ED’s face too.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: No, but Philip has.

speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Has she been bitten?
speaker_heading: SHAUN

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What sort of state is he in Mum?
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, he’s fine. A bit under the

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What’s the deal?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (covers mouthpiece)
dialog: We may have to kill my stepdad.

dialog: Sit tight. We’re on our way over.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: I don’t want to cause a fuss.
speaker_heading: ED

scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE -MOMENTS LATER
text: SLAM. A boot hits the coffee table. ED laces. SHAUN paces.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So what’s the plan?
text: SHAUN takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Right...
scene_heading: Cue MONTAGE.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Because we do.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But she dumped you!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I have to make sure she’s okay.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Because I love her!
text: SHAUN surprises himself. A pause.
dialog: Alright gay. I’m not staying there
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: If we hole up, I wanna be somewhere

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: NEWSREADER (T.V.)

speaker_heading: SHAUN (0.S.)
text: I see it man. It’s right outside.

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What’s the zombie situation?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Don’t say that.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: That.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: The ‘Z’ word.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Because it’s ridiculous.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Okay...are there any out there

text: SHAUN looks out. The street seems empty.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No. Maybe it’s not as bad as all
dialog: that.

speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)

text: SHAUN skips to the loo. ED calls after.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Can I drive?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ED

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM -MOMENTS LATER
text: A ZIP is unfastened...a TOILET FLUSHED...HAND washed.
text: SHAUN stares at his reflection in the open door of the

text: NOTHING. He turns to see-
text: PETE. Standing naked in the shower, his face is contorted

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Pete, hi...
text: ZOMBIE PETE reaches out, his hand black and gangrenous.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)

dialog: locking?
text: BANG. A FOOTBALL hits SHAUN on the head. He turns to see the
text: BORED KID. Now DEAD. Standing on the pavement nearby. ED
text: panics and presses any button. The MEGANE’s alarm goes off.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Cock it!
text: The nearby ZOMBIES turn slowly. The DEAD KID approaches...
text: ED pushes another button, the alarm stops and the locks flip
text: up. SHAUN and ED dive into the car. ED turns the key-
text: ...The lights come on...The DEAD KID paws the bonnet...
text: ...The wipers activate...The ZOMBIES lurch closer... The

speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SHAUN

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD -MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: ED

dialog: Fuck. It’s gorgeous.
text: SHAUN looks around. The street is strangely quiet.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Come on, it seems clear enough.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why don’t I stay here?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Someone should stay with the car.
dialog: Keep watch. If there’s any
dialog: problems, I’1l honk three times.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Okay.
text: Uncertain, SHAUN runs up the path. ED calls after him.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don’t forget to kill Philip.
scene_heading: INT. BARBARA & PHILIP’S HALL -MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Hello pickle.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Hey Mum.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You’ve got red on you.
text: BARBARA gets a tissue from her sleeve, licks it and dabs his
text: cheek clean. SHAUN looks warily into the house.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes, I’m fine.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Where’s Philip?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: Dad's in the lounge.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: He’s not my Dad.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh Shaun, really.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sorry Mum. Listen, Ed’s outside,
dialog: we're getting you out of here.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: But we’ve got to wait for the
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I don’t know if the doctor’s
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Well, I’m not sure Philip’s going
dialog: to want to leave the house darling.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Philip’s not...why don’t you pop
dialog: the kettle on? I’1l take care of
dialog: Philip.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Okay. Are you hungry?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’1l make some sandwiches.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No fighting you two.
scene_heading: INT. BARBARA & PHILIP’S LOUNGE -CONTINUOUS
text: The door creaks open. A grey looking PHILIP is sat in an
text: armchair. He is inert, wrapped in a blanket and facing the
text: television, which plays RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING. His eyes are
text: closed. SHAUN approaches him, mind racing. He raises the
text: CRICKET BAT above his head, as organ music on the TV swells.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m so sorry Philip.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Why?
text: SHAUN yelps, hiding the BAT behind him.
speaker_heading: PHILIP (CONT'D)
dialog: What have you done now?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Nuffin.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: What’ve you got there? Flowers I
dialog: hope.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No, it’s a...cricket bat.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh.
text: SHAUN yelps again as BARBARA appears and takes the bat.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT’D)
dialog: Is that for the jumble Shaun?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: There’s a whole box of your toys
dialog: upstairs, I was going to give them
text: to the jumble.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I took them all to the tip,
dialog: Barbara.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh, what?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Shaun’s come to take us somewhere.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Don’t be silly, I’m not going
dialog: anywhere.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Well maybe you should stay here and
dialog: wait for the doctor. I’1l take Mum.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You said the doctor wasn’t coming.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: You didn’t call the doctor did you?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I just thought it was best to be
dialog: safe.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I’m quite alright, Barbara. I’ve
dialog: run it under a cold tap. And we had
dialog: our jabs when we went to the Isle
dialog: of Wight.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: But Philip-
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: It’s all a lot of overblown
dialog: nonsense. Just a bunch of drugnuts
text: running wild.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Still, should get Mum away, in case
text: they come back.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’m not going anywhere without
dialog: Philip.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum...listen, did you make that
dialog: tea?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -MOMENTS LATER
text: BARBARA makes tea. SHAUN is agitated.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Mmmm?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: How much do you love Philip?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Two sugars is it?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I haven't had sugar in my tea since
dialog: 1982.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Will you cut me some bread love?
text: SHAUN cuts bread with a fearsome looking bread knife.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum, how much do you love Philip?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh for goodness sake Shaun, must we
dialog: go through this again?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m sorry but...what would you
dialog: think if I told you that he has,
dialog: over the years, been quite unkind
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You weren't always the easiest
dialog: person to live with.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum, he chased me with a piece of
dialog: wood.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Well, you did call him a ‘you know
dialog: what’.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Did he tell you that?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes he did.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Motherfucker.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Shaun!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sorry Mother...Mum. Did you know
dialog: that, on several occasions, he
dialog: touched me?
text: BARBARA flashes SHAUN a look.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, that’s not true. Look, Mum
dialog: you don’t understand-
text: BARBARA stops what she’s doing. Turns to SHAUN.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No you don’t understand, Philip is
dialog: my husband and has been for
dialog: seventeen years. I know you haven’t
dialog: always seen eye to eye but I would
dialog: at least expect you to respect my
dialog: feelings. You have to be more adult
dialog: about these things.
speaker_heading: PHILIP (0.S.)
dialog: Yes come on Shaun...
text: PHILIP is stood at the kitchen door, his arm in a sling. He
text: looks weak but still towers over SHAUN.
speaker_heading: PHILIP (CONT'D)
dialog: ...there comes a time when you’ve
dialog: just got to be a man.
text: SHAUN glances down at the knife in his hand, then back at
text: PHILIP. His grip around the handle tightens.
scene_heading: EXT. BARBARA & PHILIP’S HOUSE -MOMENTS LATER
text: SHAUN drags his cricket bat like a stroppy teenager as he
text: leads BARBARA and PHILIP up the path. There are still no
text: ZOMBIES around.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Told you this was a fuss over
dialog: nothing.
text: ED stands at the end of the garden, hands in his pockets.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Hello Edward. My you’ve grown!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Better believe it.
text: ED nods to PHILIP then whispers to SHAUN.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT’D)
dialog: What happened? Why’s he coming?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It wasn’t as easy as all that.
text: ED tuts at SHAUN. PHILIP stands by the JAG.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: So, we're following you are we?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I think it’s best if we go in the-
dialog: (looks to ED)
dialog: Where’s the car?
text: ED looks sheepishly off. We follow his gaze to see the
text: RENAULT MEGANE wrapped around a lamppost. A write-off.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I pranged it.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You were parked.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah...guess we’ll have to take the
dialog: Jag.
text: SHAUN takes a deep breath and turns to PHILIP.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Umm. ..Philip?
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: What?
text: A ZOMBIE appears right behind PHILIP. We recognise him as one
text: of the DAZED YOUNG CLUBBERS from earlier.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Look out!
text: Too late. The ZOMBIE grabs PHILIP and takes a huge bite out
text: of his shoulder.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
speaker_heading: CHRIST!
text: SHAUN sprints over and kicks the ZOMBIE clear. PHILIP falls.
text: Another CLUBBER ZOMBIE approaches, complete with whistle.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Philip, give me the car keys!
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: You're not driving that car.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Phillip...
text: SHAUN spins and deftly smashes the 2nd ZOMBIE in the face-
text: knocking the whistle down his throat.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...give me the car keys!
text: PHILIP gives them to SHAUN, who throws them to ED.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ed! Get Mum in the car.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I’m on it!
text: ED catches the keys and looks at them. He smiles for a moment
text: before ushering BARBARA in. SHAUN pulls PHILIP off the
text: ground, his neck gushes blood.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Don’t worry about me. Worry about
dialog: your mother.
text: SLAM! SHAUN jumps in the back with PHILIP. BARBARA’s up front
text: with ED, who’s admiring the Jag’s interior.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Maybe I should drive.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I’ve adjusted the seat now.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Go on then. Just be caref-
text: He’s drowned out by ED’s HARD HOUSE tape. They scream off.
scene_heading: INT. JAG -AFTERNOON
text: London whizzes by. We catch whispers of ACCIDENTS, a CAR
text: driving erratically with a BABY CARRIAGE on the roof. We see
text: ZOMBIES beating down the doors of houses. A huddle of ZOMBIE
text: KIDS are gathered around a body next to an ABANDONED ICE
speaker_heading: CREAM VAN.
text: SHAUN attempts to bandage the profusely bleeding PHILIP with
text: his jacket. The HARD HOUSE blares from the stereo.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Can we please turn that noise down?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (offering a handful of
dialog: tissues)
dialog: Are you alright dear, would you
dialog: like a tissue?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I'd be fine, if it wasn’t for that
dialog: bloody racket.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: It is a little loud.
text: ED turns it down immediately for her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sorry Barbara.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: You do realise this is a thirty
dialog: mile an hour zone?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: ED winks at BARBARA and speeds recklessly onward.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK -CONTINUOUS
text: The JAG screeches to a halt. Everyone is thrown forward. A
text: now heavily bandaged PHILIP moans in pain.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Here.
text: The forecourt is dotted with a FEW ZOMBIES, who lurch over.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum, this won’t take a second.
text: SHAUN tries the door, it won’t open. He turns to PHILIP.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you still got the child locks
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Safety first Shaun.
text: SHAUN winds down the window and squirms out.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed, stay moving. Any problems-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Do the honks.
text: ED cruises off around the forecourt. SHAUN heads for the
text: door. Three ZOMBIES block his path. He knocks them down.
dialog: 67.
text: BUZZ. SHAUN slams the bell. Behind him the floored ZOMBIES
text: quietly pick themselves up and advance again.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (0.S.)
dialog: Hello?
text: Before SHAUN can answer- HONK! HONK! HONK! ED beeps from the
text: Jag. SHAUN turns. The ZOMBIES are right on top of him.
scene_heading: INT. LIZ'S FLAT -CONTINUOUS
text: A worried DAVID and DIANNE huddle round the entry phone,
text: which buzzes with sounds of PITCH BATTLE. LIZ emerges from
text: her room and joins them. There is a noise at the window-
text: It’s SHAUN. At the glass.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Guys? Let me in, please.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I've come to get you.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: You're bleeding.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s okay, it’s not mine.
text: LIZ opens the window. SHAUN tumbles in, bat in hand. LIZ
text: looks at him, half way between angry and impressed.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Sorry, what are you doing?
text: SHAUN stands and catches his breath.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’ve come to take you somewhere
dialog: safe.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean safe? We were
dialog: perfectly safe until you turned up.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You don’t know that.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But there were only two of them
dialog: outside a minute ago and now how
dialog: many are there?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Lots.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Lots.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Believe me, it only takes one of
dialog: them to know you’re in here. Liz, I
dialog: tried calling but I couldn’t get
dialog: through. I had to come up with a
dialog: plan.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh, you made a plan?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I don’t care what the telly says,
dialog: we have to get out of here. If we
dialog: stay, they will break down the
dialog: door, they will come up here and
dialog: they will tear us to pieces and
dialog: that’s really going to exacerbate
dialog: matters for all of us.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Smooth.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Listen to me. Please. You have to
dialog: trust me. I’ve been out there, I’ve
dialog: seen what’s happening. They’re not
dialog: just going to give up and go away.
text: They’11 keep coming.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun-
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: This isn’t about you and me Liz.
dialog: It’s about survival. We need to be
text: somewhere more secure, somewhere on
dialog: the ground. Somewhere we can
dialog: survive.
text: LIZ'’s reluctance seems to waver.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (0.S.)
dialog: We’re with you, Shaun.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: SHAUN LIZ
dialog: What? What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: We're with you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not going out there.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: You saw Titus at the National,
dialog: Daffs. I don’t want to be torn to
dialog: pieces and I’m sure, if you really
dialog: think about it, neither do you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not going if Lizzy isn’t going.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Of course she’s going.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not staying here on my own.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: You’re going aren’t you Elizabeth?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Lizzy?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Liz?
text: All eyes are on an uncertain LIZ. From outside, we hear a
text: building chorus of moans. LIZ takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Alright Flash, what did you have in
dialog: mind?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Right...uh, I’ve got a car outside,
dialog: but it’s going to be a bit cramped.
dialog: So, have either of you got
dialog: transport?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: (putting up her hand)
dialog: Yes, yes.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Good. Where?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Oh, no. I mean I’ve passed my test.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t think there’s any point
text: owning a car in London.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Okay then, let’s just gather any
dialog: blunt objects. If you get cornered,
text: bash them in the head, that seems
dialog: to work. Just keep together, stay
dialog: sharp and follow me.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: So what is the plan then?
text: SHAUN flips up his cricket bat and gathers himself.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: We’re going to The Winchester.
text: CLOSE on the incredulous faces of LIZ, DI and DAVID.
scene_heading: EXT. LIZ’S FLAT -MOMENTS LATER
text: CLOSE on the terrified faces of LIZ, DI and DAVID; as they
text: clumsily battle the ZOMBIES on their doorstep. LIZ wields a
text: hockey stick, DAVID an umbrella, DIANNE a piece of driftwood.
text: SHAUN guides them through the crowd with his cricket bat.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Where’s the car?
text: HONK! The Jag pulls up, knocking a ROADSWEEPER ZOMBIE
dialog: flying...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Whassup niggaz?
text: Everyone stops momentarily and looks at ED, before breaking
text: into a run for the Jag. LIZ squeezes into the front. SHAUN,
text: DAVID and DI pile in the back. SHAUN is jammed next to
text: PHILIP, who looks even worse. ZOMBIES encroach on the car.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Apologies for the cramped
dialog: conditions.
dialog: (to Di)
dialog: Di, you sit on Dave’s lap if you
dialog: can.
dialog: (to Phillip)
dialog: Phillip, hang in there.
dialog: (to Ed)
dialog: Ed, fast as you can okay?
dialog: (to Barbara)
dialog: And Mum this is Liz.
dialog: (to Liz)
dialog: Liz, Mum.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Hello.
text: ED hits the gas. The engine roars.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. CAR -AFTERNOON
text: The Jag is unbearably cramped. ED drives fast, flying over
text: speed bumps. The HARD HOUSE is back on the stereo. PHILIP
text: moans weakly.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Shaun...
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I know, I know. Be careful will you
dialog: Ed?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Is your Dad alright?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: He’s not my Dad.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
text: He’s bleeding.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I know. Ed, will you please be
dialog: careful?!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Thought you wanted to get there
dialog: fast.
dialog: 72.
text: ED swerves slightly. A ZOMBIE glances off the bonnet.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Oof!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I want to get there in one piece.
dialog: And why are we going this way?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Chill out, it’s a short cut.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: But the other road goes straight to
dialog: The Winchester.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Shaun...
text: SHAUN ejects the tape with a huff.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I still don’t actually understand
dialog: why we are going to The Winchester.
text: SHAUN looks at LIZ. They keep eye contact.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s a pub, it’s safe, it’s secure-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They know us there.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What makes it so secure?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (floundering)
dialog: It’s got heavy doors. It’s got dead
dialog: bolts. You’ve been to a lock in.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Several.
speaker_heading: ED
text: And there’s a rifle above the bar.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I would think that’s deactivated.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Surely.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It’s not. I’m telling you, John’s
dialog: connected. Big Al says so.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Big Al also says dogs can’t look
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: They can’t.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Can’t they?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, they can’t.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Of course they can-
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Look, the pub’s the right place to
dialog: go. Everything’s gonna be fine.
dialog: Promise.
text: Hearing the ‘P’ word, LIZ, DAVID and DI frown at SHAUN.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Shaun...
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I turned it off, alright?
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: It’s not easy.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What?
text: PHILIP is fading, he tugs on SHAUN’s arm and whispers.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Being a father Shaun. It’s not
dialog: easy.
text: SHAUN is taken aback.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What?
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: You were twelve when I met you,
dialog: you’d already grown up so much.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah...well, I wasn’t the easiest
dialog: person to live with.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I just wanted you to be strong, not
dialog: give up because you lost your Dad.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Philip, you don’t have to
dialog: explain...
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: I do. I’ve always loved you Shaun,
dialog: always thought you had it in you to
dialog: do well. You just need motivation.
dialog: Somebody to prove yourself to. I
dialog: thought that could be me.
text: SHAUN nods, eyes wide. With huge effort, PHILIP puts his hand
text: on SHAUN’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: PHILIP (CONT'D)
dialog: Take care of your Mum, there’s a
dialog: good boy.
text: PHILIP slips away. SHAUN closes his dead step-dad’s eyes.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (tremulously)
dialog: Ed, could you pull over?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Two seconds.
text: ED swerves again. Another ZOMBIE bounces off the Jag.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Sweet chin music!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed! Will you just pull over,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: ED, JUST PULL OVER!
dialog: 75.
text: ED slams on the brakes. Everyone is thrown violently around
text: the interior as the car turns 180 and screams to a stop. The
text: passengers sit in shocked silence. ED whoops.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Christ! What the hell are you
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Chill out. Everyone’s alright.
text: Furious, SHAUN punches the back of ED’s headrest.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Stop-telling-me-to-chill-out!
text: ED huffs in sulky protest. SHAUN gathers himself.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: And no, everyone is not alright.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Uh, well...Mum?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: What’s wrong Pickle?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum, it’s Philip...he’s gone.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Where’s he gone?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum, he’s dead.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No he’s not.
text: SHAUN looks at PHILIP who stares back milky eyed, UNDEAD.
speaker_heading: ZOMBIE PHILIP
dialog: Uhhhhhh...
text: Shit. A scramble for the doors. ZOMBIE PHILIP claws hungrily
text: at SHAUN. BARBARA, LIZ and ED pile out; ED accidentally knees
text: the HARD HOUSE tape back into the stereo. It BLARES again.
text: DAVID and DI struggle to get out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It won’t open!
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: It won’t open!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed, the child locks!
text: ED slopes towards the door, but LIZ quickly steps in before
text: him to open it. DAVID and DI fall out, followed by SHAUN. He
text: turns to see PHILIP lunge at him. SHAUN slams the car door.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Safety first Philip.
text: SHAUN swings round and glowers at ED. He glowers right back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now what?
text: The GANG are out in the open. The HARD HOUSE draws the
text: attention of several nearby ZOMBIES, who begin to close in.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: We have to keep moving.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: But how do we get Philip out of the
dialog: car?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: We haven’t got time.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What about the blunt objects?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Do you want to get them?
text: ED nods to the slavering PHILIP. BARBARA looks on in shock.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Shaun, we can’t just leave your
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: He’s not my Dad!
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh Shaun-
text: SHAUN grabs a shaken BARBARA by the shoulders. BEHIND we see
text: ZOMBIE PHILIP lunging forward into the front seat.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: He’s not Mum. He was but he’s not
dialog: anymore-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’m sure if we just-
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: That’s not even your husband. I
dialog: know it looks like him but believe
dialog: me, there is nothing of the man you
dialog: loved in that car now. Nothing.
text: BEHIND we see ZOMBIE PHILIP reach forward and SWITCH THE HARD
text: HOUSE OFF. He sits back and looks almost peaceful.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s go shall we?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're not seriously suggesting we
dialog: walk are you?
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY -LATER
text: SHAUN walks briskly along a high-fenced back alley.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Everyone okay back there?
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah, we’re having a whale of a
dialog: time.
text: We see the GANG tagging along behind him; LIZ, DAVID and DI
text: followed by a dazed BARBARA. ED skulks at the back, smoking.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Maybe we should all hold hands,
dialog: y'know? Make a crocodile?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you have any idea where you’re
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry Lizzy.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (whispering to Shaun)
dialog: Do you though?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Totally, totally.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: But are we close?
text: SHAUN peers through fence slats into a nearby garden. The
text: MULLET HAIRED FIFTYSOMETHING from the pub lies dead on the
text: grass surrounded by a ravenous huddle of FEMALE ZOMBIES.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Pretty close.
text: LIZ looks back to the glazed BARBARA, concerned.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Is your Mum going to be okay?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I hope so. Did you manage to
dialog: contact your folks?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: They’re in Antigua.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: D’you think it’s happening there?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I hope not.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Look Liz...about last night. I know
dialog: a lot of things were said, but I
dialog: just wanted you to know that-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun, you said this wasn’t about
dialog: you and me.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s not. I just wanted-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You said it was about survival.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It is-
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You're not doing all this just to
dialog: prove something are you?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Because, I meant everything I said
dialog: last night. Nothing’s changed-
text: A SCREAM in the distance is answered by a chorus of distant
text: and not so distant moans which seem to surround them.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe this isn’t the best time to
dialog: talk about it.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I know, I know, I just-
text: BANG. SHAUN walks right into-
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Ohmigod, Shaun!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yvonne?
text: YVONNE is heading in the opposite direction with an uncannily
text: similar bunch of FRIENDS and FAMILY.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: How you doing?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Uh...surviving.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Hey Liz. Long time no see.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hey Yvonne. Haven’t seen you
dialog: since...
text: YVONNE replies with her dance again, then turns to her party.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Sorry, this is my boyfriend Declan.
dialog: That’s my Dad, my friends Mark and
dialog: Maggie, my cousin Tom.
text: Everyone mumbles a respective ‘hello’.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: YVONNE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Shaun and his girlfriend
dialog: Liz-
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: They’ve broken up.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Oh really...?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Yeah...
text: SHAUN looks at the ground. YVONNE looks awkward.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: That’s a shame...Well we should
dialog: skoot. Have you got somewhere
dialog: you're going?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah, we're heading to the
dialog: Winchester.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: The pub?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Right, well. Good luck.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You too.
text: YVONNE and SHAUN hug. This time it’s real and affectionate.
text: The two groups move their separate ways. There is a weird
text: poignancy to this passing...before YVONNE calls out.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: Shaun?
text: YVONNE points in a completely different direction.
speaker_heading: YVONNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Isn't the Winchester that way?
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY -AFTERNOON
text: CRASH. A gate is kicked open.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What’d I tell you? Pub’s just over
dialog: there.
text: We see the WINCHESTER’s sign in the distance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ‘Just over there’? What about the
dialog: twenty garden fences?
text: We CRANE DOWN to reveal a line of back gardens. SHAUN steps
text: forward and peers into the next garden.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What’s the matter David, never
dialog: taken a short cut?
text: SHAUN attempts to vault the fence in a super cool fashion.
text: However it breaks under his weight, an entire section of
text: fence FALLING FLAT. SHAUN quickly gets up and beckons the
text: others to follow. BARBARA dawdles behind in a dazed fashion.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’m sure Jill and Derek live round
dialog: here.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDENS -AFTERNOON
text: The GANG move commando style, from garden to garden.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course, in reality, we are
dialog: trespassing. Am I right, Lizzy?
text: LIZ doesn’t answer. She is distracted by evidence of other
text: lives affected by the crisis...a dog sitting next to a DEAD
text: BODY...the twitching silhouette of a HANGED MAN...a ZOMBIE IN
text: PYJAMAS clawing at PATIO DOORS.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FINAL GARDEN -CONTINUOUS
text: They reach a family garden, complete with outdoor games.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Right...Everyone just stay where
dialog: they...hang on, are we all here?
text: DI does a quick head count.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: One, two, three, four, five. Yes.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: There’s six of us.
text: A YELP from next door.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mum!
text: SHAUN jumps onto a TRAMPETTE and vaults the fence with
dialog: lightning speed...
scene_heading: EXT. PENULTIMATE GARDEN -CONTINUOUS
text: ...and lands to find BARBARA sprawled on the grass. He helps
text: her to her feet.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum, are you okay?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I don’t think Jill & Derek do live
dialog: here.
text: SHAUN looks to the house. The PATIO DOOR is now open...
scene_heading: EXT. THE FINAL GARDEN -CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun, are you okay?
text: CRASH. SHAUN tumbles through the fence, struggling with the
scene_heading: PYJAMA ZOMBIE.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Oi!
text: LIZ and DIANNE leap into action. DAVID panics. ED slopes
text: around for a weapon, but LIZ is already brandishing a KID’S
text: CHAIR. ED shrugs and backs off.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Break it up!
text: LIZ whacks the PYJAMA ZOMBIE, breaking the chair over its
text: head. SHAUN gets to his feet and turns to see DAVID standing
text: around and ED texting someone. SHAUN can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Shaun!
text: DIANNE pulls a SWINGBALL out of the ground and throws it to
text: SHAUN. He looks at it, unsure what to do.
dialog: 83.
text: LIZ demonstrates a stabbing move. SHAUN flips up the sharp
text: end of the SWINGBALL pole and drives it through the PYJAMA
text: ZOMBIE’s chest, pinning him to a tree. Breathless, he spins
text: round to DAVID and ED.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Feel free to step in anytime!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You seem to be doing alright.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn’t want to cramp your style.
text: Incredulous, SHAUN shakes his head. He walks over to a
text: child’s slide, by the fence.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Right-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: So sorry about that.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: -Everyone just stay where they are.
dialog: I’ll check if the coast is clear.
text: SHAUN climbs up...then climbs down.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Is it clear?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Lots.
text: We CRANE UP over the fence to reveal a HUNDRED WALKING DEAD
text: between them and the pub. The GANG peer through the gaps.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh well, that’s just great.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: There are a fair few of them.
text: SHAUN stands a little way off, looking despondent.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I trust Shaun has another genius
dialog: scheme up his sleeve?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: This is hardly constructive David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No Lizzy, this is a waste of time.
dialog: We should have stayed at the flat.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Why didn’t you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Because what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because of...Captain Wow!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Will you stop it!
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: We’re not going to get anywhere by
dialog: moaning.
speaker_heading: PYJAMA ZOMBIE (0O.S.)
dialog: Uhhhhhh...
text: All turn to the PYJAMA ZOMBIE. It’s ‘alive’, but stuck on the
text: SWINGBALL pole, the ball too big for the hole made by the
text: shaft. It MOANS, frustrated. DIANNE has an idea.
scene_heading: EXT. FINAL GARDEN -MOMENTS LATER
text: The GANG stand studying the captive PYJAMA ZOMBIE.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Right, shake out. Get nice and
dialog: limber. Have another look at the
dialog: way he moves. Remember it’s very
text: limp. Almost like sleepwalking. And
text: look at the face, vacant with a
text: hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's
dialog: lost a bet. And the voice, it’s a
text: glottal rumble with a neutral ‘A’.
dialog: Okay everyone, let’s have a look
dialog: shall we?
dialog: 85.
text: They all do their zombie impressions. LIZ gives good moan.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice, good vocal work Liz.
text: BARBARA is glazed over.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Barbara, that’s excellent.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’m sorry dear, I was miles away.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Daffs?
text: DIANNE moves on. DAVID gives a lacklustre performance.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh come on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I feel silly.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Just try to make yourself very
dialog: loose.
text: DAVID tries again. It’s exactly the same.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s mournful, sorrowful, you’re
dialog: dead and you hate it.
text: DAVID tries again. It’s still the same.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Better. Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I’1l do it on the night.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: This is the night.
text: ED makes a sarcastic ZOMBIE noise. SHAUN tuts.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What about yours?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What?
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, who died and made you king of
dialog: the zombies?
text: SHAUN flashes him an admonishing look, then proceeds to do a
text: pretty good ZOMBIE impression. ED has to concede.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Pretty good.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Okay, now let’s try it
dialog: altogether...1, 2, 3-
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE WINCHESTER -EVENING
speaker_heading: THE GANG
dialog: Uhhhhhh...
text: All doing their ZOMBIE impersonations, the GANG slowly move
text: towards the pub. They are surrounded by legions of genuine
text: ZOMBIES, who seem to be falling for it, despite only SHAUN,
text: LIZ and DIANNE putting in any effort. DAVID is stiff with
text: fear, ED isn’t trying and BARBARA is just glazed.
text: They reach the pub door and surreptitiously bang on it. It’s
text: locked. The GANG speak in whispers between their fake moans.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Get round me.
text: The GANG surround SHAUN. He kneels at the letter box.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: John, Bernie, are you there?
dialog: (louder )
dialog: John! John! Bernie!
text: Some of the nearby ZOMBIES are faintly suspicious.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT’D) DAVID
dialog: It’s Shaun and Ed. We come in It’s not working.
dialog: all the time.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT’D) DAVID
dialog: We do the quiz. They can hear you!
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT’D) DAVID
dialog: Y'know, Q.W.A. Quizzers With They know!
dialog: Attitude
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Stay in character Daffs.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I can’t see them.
text: More ZOMBIES cotton on to the GANG’s noise. LIZ looks
text: BARBARA who is now rifling around in her handbag.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Is everything okay Barbara?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’m sure I had some more tissues in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun, we have to get inside.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Break the window.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Don’t be so stupid. We’1ll be
dialog: totally exposed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We are totally exposed. Break the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Is there another way in Shaun?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: There's a-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Two seconds...
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hey E-ball. Can’t talk now. No, I
dialog: ain’t got nuffin. No, I’m right in
dialog: the middle of something. Yeah,
dialog: weird innit?-
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: What you doing?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What am I doing? What are you doing
dialog: you stupid moron?
dialog: 87.
dialog: over to
text: A HALLOWEEN RING TONE. SHAUN glares furiously at ED, almost
text: daring him to answer it. He does, holding up a hand.
text: SHAUN SMACKS THE MOBILE FROM ED’S HAND. It skitters away.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Fuck off.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No, you fuck off. Fuck-fucking-off!
text: SHAUN smacks ED hard with each successive ‘fuck’.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun-
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’ve spent a lifetime sticking my
dialog: neck out for you, you idiot and all
dialog: you ever do is fuck things up. Fuck
dialog: things up and make me look stupid.
dialog: Well, I’m not going to let you do
dialog: it. Not today.
text: ED is for once, speechless. LIZ taps SHAUN on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun...
text: SHAUN turns to see EVERY SINGLE ZOMBIE LOOKING AT THEM.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: You were saying about another way
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Uh...yeah, there’s a-
text: CLATTER. DAVID has tipped over the NEARBY BIN, spilling the
text: contents across the floor. He lifts it above his head.
speaker_heading: LIZ SHAUN
dialog: WHAT YOU DOING? WHAT YOU DOING?
text: He launches the bin at the pub window. SMASHES IT WIDE OPEN.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Get inside!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No. They’11 follow us!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: They’11 follow us. Keep up the act.
dialog: I’m going to have to do something.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What do you mean, “do something”?
text: SHAUN makes a big decision. He runs over to a picnic table-
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
text: EVERY SINGLE ZOMBIE turns their attention to SHAUN.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait ‘til I’ve gone, then get
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: LIZ ED
dialog: Gone where? Gone where?
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: (looks directly at Ed)
dialog: I won't be gone long.
speaker_heading: (to LIZ)
dialog: Promise.
text: SHAUN looks at ED who looks back, concerned. A moment of
text: silent understanding. SHAUN jumps down right into the thick
text: of the approaching hordes and sprints off, yelling and waving
text: his arms, drawing all the ZOMBIES away. He disappears out of
text: sight. The GANG are all shocked by this, particularly ED.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shall we go in then?
text: As the GANG move toward the pub, BARBARA picks up the bunch
text: of flowers from the strewn rubbish and looks at the card.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Come on Barbara. Leave them.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: But they’re for me.
text: As LIZ helps BARBARA through the window, a single ZOMBIE, the
text: DEAD IRISH SPINSTER turns to see them disappear inside.
scene_heading: INT. THE WINCHESTER -LATER
text: CAMERA PANS 360 round the pub lounge. It’s deserted, lit only
text: by fading shafts of daylight. The curtains have been drawn
text: over the broken window and billow ominously. We find LIZ and
text: DIANNE sitting silently with BARBARA staring at the opening.
text: ED stands forlornly by the fruit machine. DAVID paces.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Will Shaun be gone long?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: No Barbara.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s a good twenty minutes since he
dialog: went.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Seventeen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Either way we should think about
dialog: blocking up the window. We’re
dialog: totally exposed.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: How will Shaun get back in?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sure he’1l knock.
text: Nobody moves. We can hear DISTANT MOANS outside.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh for goodness sakes, let’s at
dialog: least get some lights on.
text: DAVID strides over to some light switches. LIZ leaps up.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: David, wait-
text: DAVID goes ahead and flips the switches. Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Power's off.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: That’s a good thing. We don’t want
dialog: to advertise our whereabouts more
dialog: than we already have.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No of course not-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do we David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, of course not Lizzy. I’m just
dialog: trying to be pro- active.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to face some facts here;
text: the power and phones are off,
text: there’s no sign of the owners and
dialog: there’s a bloody great hole in the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You did that you twat!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Someone had to make a decision. I
dialog: don’t know if you noticed but we
dialog: were in a spot of bother back
dialog: there. Somebody needs to take
dialog: control of this situation and if no-
dialog: one else is prepared to take on
dialog: that responsibility, then perhaps I
dialog: should.
text: Nobody speaks. Again we hear the DISTANT MOANS.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Will Shaun be gone long?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He’1l be back soon.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How can you know that? How do we
dialog: know he’s even coming back?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: I don’t think he’d leave us Daffs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wouldn’t he? Lizzy, are you really
dialog: going to put your faith in a man
dialog: who last night you spectacularly
dialog: binned for, among other things,
dialog: being unreliable? A man whose idea
text: of a romantic nightspot and an
dialog: impenetrable fortress are the same
dialog: thing. A pub. We are in a pub. What
dialog: the hell are we going to do?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I could get a round in.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Will Shaun be gone long?
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Look, let’s just keep quiet and
dialog: wait for Shaun. We can barricade
text: the window when he gets back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ok, then what? I mean how long are
dialog: we going to be here? Hours? Weeks?
dialog: What about food? What are we going
dialog: to eat?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Toasties?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, there’s a Breville out back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Phew, that’s okay then. Oh wait,
dialog: there’s no power!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Shut up, we got plenty of bar
dialog: snacks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well as long as we’ve got nibbles,
dialog: we're saved. That must be why Shaun
dialog: dragged us here. Dragged us here
text: and buggered off.
speaker_heading: LIZ
text: He’s coming back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why, because he promised? Even if
dialog: he does come back, do you really
dialog: think his master plan will extend
dialog: to anything more than sitting in
dialog: the dark eating peanuts? He’s gonna
dialog: stroll on in and make everything
dialog: okay is he? He’s-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I DON’T KNOW DAVID! I don’t know
dialog: anymore than you do. What I do know
dialog: is that we’re here now and we have
dialog: to make the best of it.
dialog: (takes a breath)
dialog: Ed, get me adouble vodka.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Right you are.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: I’1l have one too actually. Would
dialog: you like a drink Barbara?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, fuck it. Let’s all get
dialog: bladdered shall we? Great idea. Why
dialog: don’t we have some nibbles while
dialog: we're at it?
text: DAVID flounces behind the bar and rifles through boxes of
text: snacks, before petulantly throwing them out into the lounge.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: We've got Mini Chedders....
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: David-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We've got Twiglets...
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Daffs-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ...we've got ‘Hog Lumps’...
text: A HAND SNATCHES THEM FROM MID-AIR! A perfect catch.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Pickle?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Hello Mum.
text: SHAUN IS BACK. Striding in from behind the bar. There’s shock
text: and delight from all but DAVID. SHAUN strolls over to LIZ.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything okay?
text: SHAUN pops a Pork Scratching into his mouth.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Any sign of John and Bernie?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: We haven’t seen them.
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Did you check upstairs?
text: SHAUN goes to the back corridor and tries a door marked
text: ‘PRIVATE’. He forces it a little. It won’t open.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: I think it’s locked.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What’s the phone situation?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Dead. Same as the power.
text: SHAUN nods and takes stock. He offers LIZ the Scratchings.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Nice of you to join us.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Promised didn’t I?
text: DAVID steps in.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How did you lose them?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I just gave them the slip. It
dialog: wasn’t too difficult. They’re not
dialog: all that.
text: SHAUN casually leans back against the bar.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So you haven’t been bitten then?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Do I look like I’ve been bitten?
text: DAVID eyes SHAUN’s bloodstained shirt, suspiciously.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (indicating stains)
dialog: Look, this is all from earlier and
dialog: this is from Philip.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And what's that?
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Pen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And how did you get in?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: There is a back door. Through the
dialog: yard. I tried to tell you before
dialog: you went and smashed the window.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What stopped you?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You went and smashed the window.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wasn’t the one blowing our cover
dialog: by having a tiff with my boyfriend.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: He’s not my boyfriend.
text: A freshly pulled pint slides down the bar into SHAUN’s hand.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Might be a bit warm. Cooler’s off.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Thanks babe.
text: SHAUN takes a long swig. Everyone looks at him expectantly.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: So what’s the plan then?
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE WINCHESTER -EVENING
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Anybody want a peanut?
text: The GANG sit in the dark, in their OPENING SCENE positions at
text: their usual table, BARBARA is huddled nearby. Empty glasses
text: and mountain of empty snack packets on the table. Chairs and
text: tables are stacked against the doors and windows. The general
text: mood has soured. DAVID looks at SHAUN smugly.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: How about another drink?
dialog: 96.
text: Nobody does. SHAUN looks to the pool table.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: How about pool?
text: Again, no response.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Probably a bit noisy...with
dialog: the...uh ball release...
text: SHAUN fiddles with his beermat.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ed, why don’t you do your ‘Clyde’?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Nah.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Have you ever seen ‘Every Which Way
dialog: But Loose’? Ed does the most
dialog: amazing impression.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No it’s not.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yes it is. Come on, do it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: But it’s brilliant.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You've built it up too much, now.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Go on, it’s funny.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Yes c’mon Ed let’s see it.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah, come on.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I’m not a performing monkey.
text: BARBARA leans forward and reads ED’s t-shirt.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: “I got wood”.
text: No-one speaks. A STREET LIGHT flicks on outside. SHAUN looks
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: The power’s on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s not, I’ve already tried it.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: But the grid isn’t out. It’s the
dialog: fuses. I’1l just switch ‘em back
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What about the lights?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, we don’t really want to
dialog: advertise our whereabouts more than
dialog: we already have. We may as well put
text: a sign outside saying ‘All You Can
dialog: Eat’.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: I think there is one.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, they do a buffet on Sundays.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: The lights operate on a separate
dialog: circuit, I'll just flip the mains
dialog: breakers so we can get the telly
dialog: on. It’s quite simple David.
text: SHAUN flashes LIZ a confident smile and heads off.
scene_heading: INT. BACK CORRIDOR -CONTINUOUS
text: SHAUN walks into the dim back corridor, past the door marked
text: ‘PRIVATE’. We linger on the DOOR HANDLE for a moment...
text: SHAUN finds the fuse box by the back door, the window of
text: which looks out into BLACKNESS. He flips the switches.
speaker_heading: LIZ (0.S.)
dialog: That’s it!
dialog: 98.
text: Curious, SHAUN peers out into the dark. He finds the relevant
text: switch and flips on the garden light.
text: ZOMBIES...LOTS OF THEM. SHAUN snaps off the light and yanks
text: down the door blind in a moment of panicked denial. He rushes
text: back to the bar, past the door marked ‘PRIVATE’.
text: Unseen by SHAUN, the DOOR HANDLE now TWITCHES...
scene_heading: INT. BAR -CONTINUOUS
text: SHAUN returns to the bar, slamming the back door behind him.
text: DIANNE stood on a bar stool, flipping through the channels on
text: the wall-mounted television. We see the message-
scene_heading: ‘STANDBY FOR FURTHER INFORMATION’
text: -displayed on every single channel. Only the fonts differ,
text: The BBC, very austere, MIV, very funky etc. Everyone stares
text: at the TV with growing concern. ED sidles up to LIZ.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Liz, you got a quid?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Um...yeah.
text: LIZ gives ED a pound. He thanks with a smile. She smiles
text: back. ED goes off. SHAUN returns. She nods to the TV.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s never anything on is there?
text: SHAUN says nothing. He looks ashen faced and guilty.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
text: SHAUN glances to the back door.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: We got a bit of a problem.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: They followed me.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I thought you said you gave them
dialog: the slip?
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: ...Yeah.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do they know we’re in here?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Well, we’ll just have to be extra
dialog: quiet won’t we?
text: SHAUN nods again, comforted...as LIZ goes ashen faced.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What?
text: LIZ turns to see ED pop the quid into the FRUIT MACHINE.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Ed, No!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed, no!
text: Too late. ED hits a button...and hits the JACKPOT. There is a
text: cacophony of BELLS, BUZZERS and SPOOKY NOISES.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Turn it off!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Turn it off!
text: SHAUN dives to the floor and flips the switch. SILENCE.
dialog: Then from outside-
text: TAP...TAP...TAP...Everyone looks to each other gravely. TAPS
text: become THUMPS. GROANS become audible. Noise builds.
text: THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! The GANG draw together and listen. LIZ
text: puts a hand on SHAUN’s shoulder...ED puts a hand on BARBARA’Ss
text: shoulder...DAVID puts a hand on DI’s shoulder...JOHN THE
text: LANDLORD puts a hand on DAVID’s shoulder!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!
text: Everyone scatters as ZOMBIE JOHN LURCHES TOWARD THEM.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Where the hell did he come from?
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I don’t know but-
speaker_heading: FREDDY MERCURY (0.S.)
dialog: ‘Tonight, I’m gonna have myself a
dialog: real good time, I feel ali-i-i-ive’
text: “Don’t Stop Me Now” by QUEEN starts up on the JUKEBOX.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Who the hell put this on?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It’s on random!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh for fuck’s sake.
text: The THUMPING builds. JOHN advances. SHAUN acts.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Right, Dianne, stay with Mum!
text: DIANNE runs to move BARBARA out of the way.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: David, kill the Queen!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: The jukebox!
text: DAVID looks madly around the base of the JUKEBOX.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
text: Liz, Ed, grab something weapony.
text: SHAUN looks around for blunt objects. ED points to the bar.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What about the rifle?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s not real!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How about some cocktails?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The flaming spirits. Drambuie,
dialog: Sambuca, Brandy. Get a rag in.
dialog: Light it. Woof!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I dunno, the whole place could go
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What then?
text: ZOMBIE JOHN IS UPON THEM. SHAUN knocks into the pool table.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: How about pool?
text: Agreed. SHAUN vaults over the table, grabs THREE CUES and
text: throws one to LIZ and ED. They tense up, ready for action.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay John. Time at the bar.
speaker_heading: FREDDY MERCURY (0.S.)
dialog: ‘Having a good time, having a good
dialog: time’.
text: As ‘QUEEN’ kick off, the trio launch into action, whacking
text: ZOMBIE JOHN with their cues (This is choreographed in such a
text: way that the action corresponds with the song’s lyrics).
text: DAVID, meanwhile, is having no luck with the jukebox.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can’t find the switch!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Get the fuses!
dialog: DAVID runs off to the-
scene_heading: INT. BACK CORRIDOR -CONTINUOUS
text: DAVID sees the fuse box. Panicked, he hits everything.
scene_heading: EXT. PUB -CONTINUOUS
text: The pub lights FLASH, illuminating A SEA OF ZOMBIES.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. BAR -CONTINUOUS
text: SHAUN, LIZ and ED subject ZOMBIE JOHN to a volley of blows.
text: He catches ED’S CUE and BREAKS IT IN HALF.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR -CONTINUOUS
text: DAVID desperately flicks more switches. The back yard light
text: comes on, throwing ZOMBIE SHADOWS onto the blind. DAVID
text: freaks out and backs away, moving past the door marked
text: ‘PRIVATE’ which is now slowly opening to reveal ZOMBIE
text: BERNIE. In her slippers. DAVID yelps and retreats into-
scene_heading: INT. BAR -CONTINUOUS
text: DAVID slams the corridor door and barricades it with chairs.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Why is Queen still on?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I couldn’t find the switch!
text: ZOMBIE JOHN rounds on LIZ, pushing her backwards over a
text: table. ED gives up his broken cue and runs off.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ed!
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: Two seconds!
speaker_heading: LIZ (0.8)
dialog: Shaun!
text: LIZ gets back up, brandishing A FIRE EXTINGUISHER. She lets
text: it off in ZOMBIE JOHN’s face. When the gas clears, ZOMBIE
text: JOHN’s face is iced with frost...but he keeps coming.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (0.S.)
dialog: Shaun!
text: SHAUN turns. DIANNE plucks THREE DARTS from the dartboard.
text: She flings the first...IT WEDGES INTO A BAR POST.
text: The second dart...HITS JOHN IN THE CHEST.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yes!
text: The third...HITS SHAUN! He yelps in agony.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: Shauny!
text: SHAUN looks up. A DART PROTRUDING PAINFULLY FROM HIS HEAD!
text: ED is behind the bar, the RIFLE in his hands. He throws it
text: through the air. Despite the pain, SHAUN catches it. He looks
text: at the rifle in frustration, then with one ALMIGHTY BLOW OF
text: THE BUTT, sends JOHN’s head backwards into the JUKEBOX.
text: SPARKS fly. QUEEN stops. JOHN drops...
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Why didn’t you shoot him man?
text: SHAUN rounds on ED with the rifle.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Because it’s-
text: BANG. The RIFLE goes off. SHAUN is THROWN BACKWARDS. OPTICS
text: SHATTER behind ED. His jaw drops...with joy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I fucking knew it! What did I say?
dialog: Big Al was right!
text: SHAUN gets up, looks at the SMOKING RIFLE, then at ED.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Okay...
dialog: (plucks dart from skull)
dialog: ...but dogs can look up.
scene_heading: INT. THE WINCHESTER -MOMENTS LATER
text: DRAWS and CUPBOARDS are opened...SHELVES cleared...A BOX OF
text: SHELLS is discovered...
text: SHAUN has his work tie wrapped round his head. The rifle lies
text: on the bar. The THUMPING from outside is louder than ever.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Anyone fired a gun before?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Apart from Ed.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm a pacifist.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Apart from David and Ed.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: (putting her hand up)
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Good. Where?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
text: In a production of ‘Lear’. All the
dialog: military were played by women...it
dialog: was a starter pistol.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s not really a serious
dialog: qualification.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: We took it to the Edinburgh
dialog: Festival.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Sorry, what’s Ed’s experience?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: He shot his sister in the leg with
text: an air rifle.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: She asked me to.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (to Shaun)
dialog: I think you should do it.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I think we should all do it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How can five people operate one
dialog: gun?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Look, none of us have any real
dialog: experience, okay, and we’ve only
dialog: got-
text: ED glances into the BOX OF SHELLS and shakes them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Twenty nine.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: -twenty nine bullets-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Call them shells.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: -twenty nine shells, so we should
dialog: work together on this. I need
dialog: someone to help me reload and
dialog: everyone else to keep look out.
dialog: I’ll fire. As Bertrand Russell once
dialog: said, “the only thing that will
dialog: redeem mankind is cooperation”. I
dialog: think we can all appreciate the
dialog: relevance of that now.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Did you get that off the back of a
dialog: beer mat?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Guinness, Extra Cold.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I won’t say anything.
dialog: 105.
text: CRASH! The barricade of tables by the broken window SHUDDERS.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: They definitely want to come in.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Liz, can you get Mum out of the
dialog: way? Ed, get me some shells. David,
dialog: Di, over here.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
text: (running past the gun
dialog: barrel)
dialog: Crossing.
text: LIZ goes over to BARBARA, who still clutches the flowers and
text: leads her off. BARBARA focuses on LIZ and smiles.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Barbara?
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do you want to come with me?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh yes, that would be lovely. It’s
dialog: nice to meet you finally. Shaun's
dialog: always talking about you.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I’ve got something for you.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Barbara, I really ought to-
text: BARBARA produces an ornate ring on a chain around her neck.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Shaun’s father gave me this.
dialog: Shaun’s real father that is. Philip
dialog: never minded. I’ve kept it for
dialog: twenty years.
text: LIZ smiles, unsure how to react.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to have it.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Barbara, me and Shaun have-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It’s only right.
text: BARBARA pushes the ring into LIZ’s hand and winces. LIZ looks
text: down, a tissue protruding from BARBARA’s sleeve suddenly
text: blushes dark red. LIZ pushes the sleeve up. Beneath the wad
text: of blood soaked tissues, is a LARGE BITE.
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t want to say anything. I
dialog: thought Shaun would be worried.
text: SHAUN looks over to BARBARA and LIZ. Something is wrong.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Liz?
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Here they come!
text: CRASH. The barricade of chairs and tables topples. Hands push
text: at the curtains. SHAUN has no choice, but to fight.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Get behind me, get behind me.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: There’s one!
text: DI points. A DEAD FACE peers into the bar. SHAUN takes aim.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sorry, we’re closed!
text: CLICK. Nothing. Everyone looks at the rifle. SHAUN shakes it.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: That happened to me on stage.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is it the safety button?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Cock it!
text: SHAUN looks from ED to the rifle. He cocks it and fires BANG!
text: BANG! BANG! The ZOMBIE falls back pulling the curtains with
dialog: it.
text: CRASH. The window in the right hand door goes. ZOMBIES CLAW
text: TO GET IN. Dianne sees them first.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Over there!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Over where?
dialog: BANG!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Three o’clock!
text: The team SPIN AROUND as a unit. SHAUN fires, though his aim
text: is erratic. Another ZOMBIE clambers in at the first breach.
dialog: BANG! BANG!
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Ooh, over there...uh...quarter to
dialog: twelve!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What?
dialog: BANG!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 11:45!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Keep it simple!
text: BANG! SHAUN manages to take out the door ZOMBIES.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Top left.
text: They all swing to the left. SHAUN pulls the trigger. CLICK.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Reload.
text: ED feeds SHAUN two shells.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m on it!
text: SHAUN cocks and fires, HITTING A ZOMBIE IN THE HEAD. BANG!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ooh nice shot.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Thanks. Let’s block up the window.
text: DAVID and DI run to fix the fallen barricade.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Take over a minute.
text: SHAUN hands the rifle to ED and runs to BARBARA and LIZ.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s up? Are you alright?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun, I’m so sorry.
text: LIZ says nothing, she looks at BARBARA.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Mum, what is it?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I didn’t want to be a bother.
text: SHAUN sees the blood.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh God, Mum, I don’t understand-
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: The man in his pyjamas...I didn’t
dialog: want to say anything. I thought
dialog: you'd be upset.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: No...
text: ED sees SHAUN hug BARBARA. He hands the rifle to DIANNE.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Take over a sec.
text: ED runs to the back of the room. DAVID peers after him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What the hell’s going on?
dialog: (shouting to the others)
dialog: WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
speaker_heading: LIZ
text: Barbara’s hurt.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: I know first aid!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know first aid!
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Take over a mo.
text: DIANNE hands the rifle to DAVID and rushes over. She arrives
text: to see BARBARA lying feverish in SHAUN’s arms. ED stands
text: around, unsure what to do. LIZ comforts SHAUN. DAVID sees her
text: hand on his shoulder and looks down to his rifle.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Shaun...
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Hold on Mum. You’re going to be
dialog: fine.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Shaun, I forgot to thank you.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: For what?
text: BARBARA shows SHAUN the flowers. He is baffled for a moment.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It’s been a funny sort of day...
text: BARBARA starts to convulse.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh Jesus Mum. No, no, no...
text: BARBARA’s breathing slows. SHAUN buries his face in her hair-
scene_heading: CLICK-CLICK.
text: All turn to see DAVID POINTING THE RIFLE AT BARBARA.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We have to deal with her.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Daffs!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: For Christ’s sake.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She’s going to come back.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: She’s not gone anywhere.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She’s gonna change.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: She’s my Mum.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She’s a zombie.
text: SHAUN positions himself between BARBARA and the rifle.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Don’t say that!
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: David, stop it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Move away. I’m going to count to-
text: SHAUN leaps up, GRABS A BOTTLE FROM THE TABLE AND SMASHES IT.
text: He holds the broken bottle to DAVID’s throat.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
text: DON’T POINT THAT GUN AT MY MUM!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun, come on now.
text: ED pulls a DART from the bar and aims it at DAVID’s neck.
speaker_heading: ED
text: DON’T POINT THAT GUN AT BARBARA!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Ed, don’t exacerbate things.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Well, this isn’t exactly fair.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Here.
text: ED flips a POOL CUE from the floor and hands it to DIANNE.
text: She raises the CUE above ED’s head.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Um, thank you.
text: ED smashes ANOTHER BOTTLE and holds it to DIANNE’s throat.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: S’okay.
text: LIZ steps in, hands raised, affecting calm.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Can we just stop and think about
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Tell him to put the gun down.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tell him to take the bottle away
dialog: from my throat.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh grow up!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She’s going to change Lizzy. She’1l
dialog: change and kill us all. You know
dialog: I’m right. Your ex can’t seem to
dialog: grasp that.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: That’s what this is, isn’t it? It’s
dialog: me.
dialog: (to Liz)
dialog: He just doesn’t like me. He never
dialog: has. He’s always hated me and now
dialog: he wants to shoot my Mum.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She's not-
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You’ve always looked down your nose
dialog: at me. You never thought I deserved
dialog: her. That I was good enough.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh, we all know you’re in love with
dialog: Liz.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That is not true.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh yes it is!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Dianne)
dialog: It’s not true!
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Yes it is.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?!
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: I know you only hung out with me at
dialog: college to get close to Liz and
dialog: when she knocked you back, I was
dialog: there to pick up the pieces. I’ve
dialog: come to terms with that Daffs. Why
dialog: can’t you?
text: DAVID flushes red and stammers to LIZ.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Liz, I want you to know that my
dialog: feelings for you are essentially-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: David, please! There are slightly
dialog: more pressing matters at hand here.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yeah, like the fact that ‘Daffs’
dialog: here is pointing a gun at my
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not the one being unreasonable
dialog: ‘Pickle’.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: For Christ’s sake, she’s not dead.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You said it yourself about your
dialog: stepdad.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She’s finished. Stop being such a
dialog: hypocrite!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You’re the one who’s gone from
dialog: Chartered Accountant to Charlton
dialog: Heston!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not a Chartered Accountant!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You look like one!
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m a lecturer!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You're a twat!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She’s not your Mum anymore! Any
dialog: second now she’1l be just another
dialog: zombie.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: DON'T SAY THAT!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We’re not using the ‘Z’ word.
speaker_heading: LIZ
scene_heading: PLEASE! CAN WE CALM-THE-FUCK-DOWN!
text: The shouting excites the ZOMBIES clamouring to get in.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, I can see what David is trying
dialog: to say...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you Lizzy.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: ...even if he is being a twat.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Yup.
text: DAVID fizzes with indignation.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: And Shaun...Shaun look at me...I
dialog: can’t begin to imagine how hard
dialog: this must be for you, but we can’t
dialog: afford to fall apart. Shaun...babe,
dialog: I know you don’t want to hear this
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: BARBARA (0.S.)
dialog: Uhhhhhh. ..
dialog: 115.
text: BARBARA is standing upright, behind DAVID. Everyone stops at
text: the sound of her mournful whine. Her eyes are a milky white,
text: skin a lifeless grey, face twisted, almost pleading. SHAUN
text: takes the rifle from DAVID and points it at her. His hands
text: shake, his eyes fill with tears. His finger tenses.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You do it! Do it!
text: BARBARA looks at DAVID, her expression twists into a scowl.
text: ZOMBIE BARBARA hisses and LUNGES FORWARD.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m sorry Mum.
speaker_heading: BANG.
text: DAVID is flecked with blood. ZOMBIE BARBARA drops.
text: TOTAL SHOCK. SHAUN lets the rifle fall to the floor. Everyone
text: is speechless. DAVID takes off his glasses to clean them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I think we’re all agreed that
dialog: you did the right thing there.
text: DAVID replaces his glasses. CRACK! SHAUN punches him hard in
text: the face, sending him sprawling. DAVID rolls over, he now has
text: the rifle in his hands, HE POINTS IT AT SHAUN.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: David!
text: CLICK...the rifle is empty. DAVID looks desperate and
text: ashamed. Everyone else is appalled. SHAUN hasn’t flinched.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Right, I’m leaving.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not staying here.
text: DAVID walks to the BOLTED FRONT DOOR and starts to move the
text: tables and chairs away. The NOISE outside RISES.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: If you open that door, we won’t
dialog: stand a chance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What, and you will in here?
text: DAVID begins UNLOCKING THE DEADBOLTS to the front door.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: David don’t. It’s suicide!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I think you should go man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We will. We can run.
text: (picks up a broken pool
dialog: cue)
dialog: We can defend ourselves.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: What do you mean ‘we’?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean, ‘what do you mean
dialog: we’?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: You don’t honestly think I’m going
dialog: to go out there do you? Opening
dialog: that door now would be a very, very
dialog: silly thing to do.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So, you're staying here? With him?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Shaun didn’t-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: After all he’s got us into!
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: (holding up her finger)
dialog: Ah-ah. Shaun didn’t ask you-
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dianne, how-
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: (explodes)
dialog: LET ME FINISH!
dialog: (David shrinks back)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shaun didn’t ask you to come here.
dialog: You came for the same reason I did.
dialog: You didn’t know what else to do.
dialog: Now, get away from that door this
dialog: instant.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But-—
speaker_heading: DIANNE
speaker_heading: DAVID!
text: DAVID crumples, the pool cue dropping from his hand. He steps
text: away from the door and slumps against the window in tears.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry Dianne. I’m sorry Lizzy.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Maybe we’re not the ones you should
dialog: be apologising to.
text: DAVID turns to SHAUN, his face quivering with guilt.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m sorry Shaun.
text: SHAUN nods. Silently accepting the apology.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Well done Daffs. That took guts-
text: SMASH! DEAD HANDS BREAK THROUGH THE WINDOW! DAVID is pulled
text: back as ZOMBIES BITE DOWN ON HIS BODY. He screams in pain.
text: SHAUN, LIZ and DI try desperately to pull DAVID back, as he
text: is dragged outside and TORN TO PIECES.
text: They attempt to keep hold, but fall backwards, to find
text: themselves clutching David’s SEVERED LOWER LEG. The screaming
text: remainder of DAVID is being sucked into the hungry crowd.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: DAVID! NO!
text: Still holding David's leg, DIANNE gets up and runs straight
text: to the front door; UNLOCKING THE FINAL DEADBOLT!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Di, don’t!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Di, don’t!
dialog: 118.
text: Too late. DIANNE opens the door and runs out to save David,
text: thrashing at the ZOMBIES with her boyfriend’s leg.
speaker_heading: DIANNE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m coming Daffs!
text: DIANNE is swallowed by the crowd, ZOMBIES quickly take her
text: place. Lots of them. All shapes and sizes, all walks of life.
text: All ravenous. THE FLOODGATES ARE OPEN.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh dear.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Cocktails?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do it!
text: ED runs off. SHAUN grabs the RIFLE. LIZ grabs the shells. He
text: reloads and open fire at the encroaching tide of ZOMBIES. LIZ
text: feeds him ammo as they slowly back up to the bar.
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: Heads!
text: A FLAMING COCKTAIL sails over LIZ and SHAUN’s head and
text: explodes over the door. It ignites the surrounding curtains
text: and carpet. ZOMBIES fall back momentarily.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Keep ‘em coming.
text: The front barricade FALLS, ZOMBIES dropping clumsily into the
text: room. Another COCKTAIL EXPLODES, holding them back.
text: The BACK DOOR shifts. The barricade of tables and chairs
text: fall. DEAD HANDS reach into the bar, grabbing ED’s neck.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Gun please?
text: SHAUN spins and throws the rifle to ED, who catches it and
text: blasts over his shoulder. The HANDS fall back, releasing him.
text: Behind, a PIZZA DELIVERY ZOMBIE walks through the fire.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Ed! Over here!
text: ED chucks the rifle to LIZ. She is unsure what to do; the
text: PIZZA ZOMBIE’s head is protected by a helmet. Deftly, she
text: smashes the visor with the gun butt and fires into the hole.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Smooth!
text: SHAUN notices BARBARA’s body. He grabs his jacket and lays it
text: over her face, placing the flowers on top.
text: BANG! The BACK DOOR gives. ED turns to see ZOMBIES pour in.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Shaun! Look who it is!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Fuck a doodle doo.
text: Leading the pack is the naked ZOMBIE PETE. ED tries to ignite
text: a COCKTAIL but his lighter won’t work.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Bitch!
text: SHAUN sees that ED is in trouble and calls for the rifle.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: To me!
text: LIZ chucks him the rifle. ZOMBIE PETE lunges at ED, hissing.
speaker_heading: ZOMBIE PETE
dialog: Uhhhhh.. .
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don’t groan at me, you thick fuck.
text: ED gets PETE in a headlock. But he is distracted by a
text: HALLOWEEN RINGTONE trilling out from somewhere in the bar. ED
text: looks up to see a COMMUTER ZOMBIE holding his phone.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey that’s mine, you cheeky-
text: ED screams as PETE BITES DOWN INTO HIS ARM. ED throws his
text: head back in pain, making his neck available to the nearby
text: ZOMBIE BERNIE, who takes a MASSIVE CHUNK out of it.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Nooooc00000000!
text: SHAUN takes aim at ED’s attackers but can’t get a clear shot.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pete!!!
text: Amazingly, PETE hears this and turns around to face SHAUN.
text: PETE’s dead eyes lock with SHAUN’s.
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: I said leave him alone!
text: SHAUN blows PETE’s head clean off. He swings back to ED but
text: can no longer see him. There are too many ZOMBIES between.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ed!
text: The front of the pub is now wide open. LIZ fends off the
text: increasing numbers with a HAT STAND. They’re everywhere.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun. Bar!
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: But-
text: LIZ bundles SHAUN behind the bar. They crouch down, kicking
text: the back door shut and holding it with their feet.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ed!
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ed!
text: SHAUN peers back. He sees nothing but ZOMBIES.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: ED!
text: A HUGE SHAPE tumbles over the bar next to SHAUN and LIZ.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What?
text: ED is alive but badly bitten, his neck GUSHING BLOOD.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I thought you were-
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Chuck us a cloth will
dialog: you?
text: SHAUN does so. ED presses the beer cloth to his neck. ZOMBIES
text: now fill the bar, having breached the first fire barricade.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Get the brandy!
dialog: 121.
text: SHAUN grabs a bottle of brandy and offers it to ED.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Not for me you tit. Smash it on the
dialog: bar.
text: SHAUN jumps up and smashes the bottle. He grabs his lighter
text: and ignites the spirit. Flames rip along the bar, a new fire
text: wall erupts. SHAUN rejoins ED and LIZ, triumphant.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Where are the bullets?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Call them shells.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Where are the shells?
text: SHAUN jumps up again to retrieve the shells from the bar. He
text: burns his fingers and crouches down again sucking his thumb.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh, fuck it! Owww! Fuck it!
text: ZOMBIES now reach through the flames, pushing at the pumps.
text: Alcohol rains down. ED takes a few gulps.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: So, what are we going to do then?
dialog: Where are we going to go?
text: SHAUN and LIZ look round at a loss. Then-
text: BANG. A FOOTBALL hits the back of the bar, smashing a mirror.
text: It falls down and settles on the TRAPDOOR to the cellar.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: The cellar?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Maybe we can get out.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, there’s the barrel hatch.
text: That leads out into the street.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: You mean go back outside?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Which would you prefer, mortal
dialog: peril or certain death?
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Um...first one.
text: They head for the TRAPDOOR. But- The ZOMBIE IRISH SPINSTER
text: drops over and gets to her feet.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh give us a fucking break!
text: On the fiery bar, the BOX OF SHELLS suddenly explodes. Stray
text: bullets fire off everywhere. One ricochets off the pub bell
text: and hits the ZOMBIE IRISH SPINSTER in the head. She falls,
text: disappointed. SHAUN, LIZ and ED make for the hatch.
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR -CONTINUOUS
text: They pull ED down into a dark cellar, filled with boxes and
text: laundry. SHAUN grabs some piping from the floor and shoves it
text: through the handle of the trapdoor, wedging it shut.
text: ED slumps against the wall, the beer cloth already sodden
text: with blood. LIZ grabs some linen from the washing line and
text: uses it to bandage ED’s wounds.
text: In the far corner of the cellar, a shaft of orange street
text: light illuminates the outline of the BARREL HATCH.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I can see the street!
text: He puts the rifle down and jumps up, hanging from the
text: handles. The BARREL HATCH does not budge.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on!
text: SHAUN pulls frantically before dropping down. He tries again,
text: desperately trying to force open the hatch.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: COME ON!
text: LIZ watches with an increasing air of disappointment.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Shaun.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: WHY WON’T IT OPEN?
dialog: 123.
text: SHAUN drops down again and slides down the wall, utterly
text: defeated. He laughs grimly.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: So that’s that then. We’re trapped.
dialog: ‘Let’s go to the Winchester’. Who
dialog: the fuck came up with that idea?
dialog: (puts head in hands)
dialog: Oh man, I’ve really ballsed this
dialog: up.
text: LIZ leaves ED and sits with SHAUN on the floor. The noise
text: from upstairs is muffled, the cellar oddly quiet.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: No you haven't.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I have Liz. I’m useless. I couldn’t
dialog: save us. I couldn’t save Di and
dialog: David. I couldn’t even save my own
dialog: mother. I should have been there. I
dialog: can’t-
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You shouldn’t feel so responsible.
dialog: You tried. You did something.
dialog: That’s what counts. God knows where
dialog: we'd be if you hadn’t.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I s'pose.
text: The CELLAR DOOR SHAKES violently. LIZ and SHAUN look at it.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do you think they’1l get through?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: How many shells have we got left?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Two. I guess we could take out a
dialog: few of them. If they stand ina
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I wasn’t thinking about them.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I know.
dialog: 124.
text: SHAUN looks around at the surrounding bottles and barrels.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can’t we just drink ourselves to
dialog: death?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I don’t think we’ve got time.
text: The CELLAR DOOR SHUDDERS again. SHAUN looks at the rifle.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: There’s only two shells. What about
dialog: Ed?
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: I don’t mind being eaten.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: How are we gonna do this?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I don’t know. I suppose one of us
dialog: has to go first.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Maybe one of us has to ‘do’ the
text: other and then ‘do’ themselves.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Maybe you should ‘do’ me first.
dialog: I’1l only muck it up if I have to
dialog: ‘do’ myself.
text: SHAUN briefly mimes this out, then shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I really don’t know if I’ve got it
dialog: in me to shoot my mum, my flat-mate
dialog: and my girlfriend all in the same
dialog: evening.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What makes you think I’ve taken you
dialog: back?
text: The CELLAR DOOR buckles. The COPPER PIPE BENDS.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Well, you don’t want to die single
dialog: do you?
text: They laugh and look deeply into each other’s eyes.
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: Actually, I would like to be shot.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Besides, I’ve changed y’know? I
dialog: haven’t had a fag since yesterday.
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He hasn't.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Maybe we should have one now.
text: LIZ takes out a crumpled packet of cigarettes. SHAUN looks
text: shocked. LIZ smiles innocently.
speaker_heading: LIZ (CONT'D)
dialog: You left them in my room.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: They were in the bin!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I was desperate.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Sneaky cow.
text: They each take a cigarette. LIZ shrugs.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Aah, I won't say anything.
text: SHAUN ignites his lighter. The flame illuminates A RED BUTTON
text: on the wall, above which is a sign reading...
speaker_heading: ‘WAY OUT’
text: SHAUN holds the lighter up to reveal an electric door
text: mechanism. They were sitting on the SERVICE LIFT all along.
text: He and LIZ exchange a look. They nod. A silent agreement.
text: CRACK. The CELLAR DOOR splinters. DEAD FINGERS claw through
text: as the smoke thickens. They are almost inside.
text: SHAUN runs to ED’s side. He is pale and visibly fading.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Come on. We’re leaving.
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I might just stay here.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: But we can all get out.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I think you two should make a go of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I’1l only hold you back.
text: SHAUN looks at his friend and realises he’s right. With a
text: somber nod, he offers ED the RIFLE.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t you want it?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Nah. You have it. I can’t hit
dialog: anything with it anyway.
text: ED takes the RIFLE from SHAUN.
speaker_heading: SHAUN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I’m sorry I shouted at you earlier.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: S'alright. I’m sorry too.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, I’m sorry Shaun.
text: SHAUN puzzles, before his expression turns to disgust. ED
text: laughs. SHAUN winces, as he covers his nose and mouth.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Oh Jesus. That’s not funny.
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I’1l stop doing them when you stop
dialog: laughing.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: (welling up)
dialog: I’m not laughing.
text: The CELLAR DOOR finally gives. Smoke now pours through.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You better be off.
text: SHAUN looks at ED. A silent goodbye. He joins LIZ on the
text: SERVICE LIFT. She has found an old FIRE AXE and a LARGE
text: CHAIN. SHAUN chooses the axe. LIZ hits the RED BUTTON.
text: The service hatch opens. SHAUN and LIZ are bathed in orange
text: streetlight. The lift starts to ascend.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Bye Ed. Love you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Cheers.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: I love you too man.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Gay.
text: ED disappears from view, lost amid the THICK SMOKE and the
scene_heading: ENCROACHING MOANS, as SHAUN and LIZ reach-
scene_heading: EXT. THE OUTSIDE -CONTINUOUS
text: SHAUN and LIZ rise up onto the street, a shot rings out from
text: the cellar beneath. SHAUN and LIZ exchange a look. It’s just
text: them now, versus an ARMY OF ADVANCING ZOMBIES.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Ready.
text: They both raise their weapons, ready to fight on together.
text: The CHORUS OF MOANS is now deafening. But then-
text: Another sound. An ENGINE ROARING, approaching fast.
dialog: 128.
text: SHAUN and LIZ are dazzled by BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS, as one of a
text: CONVOY OF MILITARY TRUCKS mounts the curb next to the
text: Winchester, knocking several ZOMBIES flying.
text: FIGURES leap from the back. ORDERS barked. SHOTS are fired.
text: SHAUN and LIZ are disoriented until they hear...
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Ohmigod! Shaun!
text: A SMALLER FIGURE moves in front of the headlights. SHAUN
text: squints into the glare.
speaker_heading: SHAUN
dialog: Yvonne?
text: YVONNE steps forward, her face becoming visible.
speaker_heading: YVONNE
dialog: How you doing?
text: SHAUN and LIZ exchange a look.
speaker_heading: SHAUN LIZ
dialog: Surviving. Surviving.
speaker_heading: YVONNE (CONT'D)
dialog: They’re taking us somewhere safe.
dialog: Thought you might want to tag
dialog: along. Is it just the two of you?
text: SHAUN and LIZ nod somberly.
speaker_heading: YVONNE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well...Glad somebody made it.
text: YVONNE beckons SHAUN and LIZ towards the truck. With the
text: sound of GUNFIRE and PITCH BATTLE echoing around them, they
text: disappear into the BLINDING LIGHT.
