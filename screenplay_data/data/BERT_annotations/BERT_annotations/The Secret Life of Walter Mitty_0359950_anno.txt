text: During the morning rush hour, a crowd of businessmen waits on
text: the corner to cross the street. Walter is among them, dressed
text: in a short-sleeve business shirt and tie and with a briefcase
text: on hand. Nothing happens. Then Walter's head explodes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CREDITS BEGIN
dialog: 
text: Up toward the clouds, propelled skyward, were the contents
text: (ideas and images) of Walter's head; they've begun to float
text: toward the ground.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SKYSCRAPER, NYC - SAME
dialog: 
text: Some office work is going on. Then past the window (outside)
text: comes floating down, in slow motion, Juan Valdez the
text: Colombian Coffee guy (his donkey's floating down way in the
dialog: distance).
dialog: 
dialog: This happens outside other high-rise and professional
text: building windows - a floating Bishop Desmond Tutu, the
text: silver Monopoly piece Top Hat, Statler and Waldorf (the two
text: elderly curmudgeons from The Muppet Show) and additional
text: detritus from Walter's mind such as Manute Bol, The Beastie

scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: You know, you didn't really provide
dialog: much detail about your occupation.
dialog: Most people put theirs on their
dialog: eHarmony page. You don't care to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Is that like a must? Can't I just
dialog: say like "I'm employed" or
dialog: something?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: (like okay but that's not
dialog: a great idea)
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My work's not really that
dialog: interesting. To women. Um. Or men.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: What do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm a Practical Asset Manager. For
dialog: a corporation.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: (sounds like he agrees
dialog: it's not interesting)
dialog: ....okay. What do you do when
dialog: you're not working?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mostly I guess I commute to work?
dialog: It's like an hour and--
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Okay. No worries. I'll submit this
dialog: information, then check back in the
dialog: afternoon for your possible
dialog: eHarmony matchups. That's exciting,
dialog: huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It is, Todd. Yeah. Hey, when can I
dialog: leave a "wink" for someone? To see
dialog: if they "wink" back, or..?
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Walter's looking at his laptop. On screen is the eHarmony
text: dating page for CHERYL M. (34), pretty but she looks like the
text: sort of pretty girl who takes the bus; text beside her photo
dialog: reads "Leave a wink for Cheryl M. to indicate your
dialog: interest..."
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: I'll have your eHarmony profile all
text: uploaded in a minute.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Cool.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: So like in two minutes. But hey,
dialog: you're a little light, if you don't
dialog: mind me saying this, in your "Been
dialog: There, Done that" column.
dialog: 
dialog: Part of the eHarmony client profile has a section Been There,
dialog: Done That - where people list their accomplishments, travels,
dialog: etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I forgot what I put there?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: ...Nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh, okay.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: We should beef that up. If you can
dialog: think of anything to add that would
dialog: make it, you know, not blank....
dialog: give me a ring, I'll add it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I sure will.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: (like he's a little
speaker_heading: CONCERNED)
dialog: ...Are you okay, man?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (doesn't know the guy,
dialog: surprised he asked)
dialog: ...Me?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah. Why?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: You sound, I don't know, a little
dialog: stressed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (thinks its odd this guy's
dialog: taking a personal
speaker_heading: INTEREST)
dialog: No, I just had some stuff on my
dialog: mind. The past couple months.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: ....What kind of stuff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (still thinking this
dialog: personal interest is a
speaker_heading: LITTLE ODD)
dialog: Just, you know... life stuff.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Yeah, I get that.
dialog: 
text: Some awkward moments pass as Walter's unsure about following
text: through on heavy conversation with a stranger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...okay thanks for asking, I guess,
dialog: um, Todd was your name?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Todd Mahar. I'll be your eHarmony
dialog: counselor, while you're with us
dialog: here at eHarmony.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay. Cool.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
speaker_heading: (GETS IT)
dialog: Yeah. Hey, let's hope you'll have a
dialog: special lady on your mind later
dialog: today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sounds good, Todd.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Later, Walter.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Later... Todd.
dialog: 
text: They finish their call. Walter looks at the computer picture
text: of Cheryl M., then out the window at actual Cheryl M. (CHERYL
text: MELHOFF, 34) crossing the street just outside the window for
text: the Time-Life building lobby. Then as Walter stands to go,
text: outside the Starbucks window, a grand piano (exploded from
text: Walter's head) falls from the sky onto the middle of the 53rd
dialog: street.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 6TH AVE, NYC - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's out on 6th among a crowd waiting for a light to
text: cross. Then a black and white New Orleans Jazz Funeral
text: procession passes in front of him - black and white in the
text: sense everyone in it and all their instruments and lively
text: waving umbrellas are in black and white. Walter and the

scene_heading: INT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Walter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What's up, Roy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Hey. We just got acquired. Our
dialog: company. This morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR, TIME-LIFE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's in an elevator with two other guys in suits. He

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Gary? You're Vice President of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ... we just got acquired. Did you
dialog: know that? Roy said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: The company that I'm supposed to be
dialog: acquiring companies for? It just
dialog: got acquired?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, Roy said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Okay, that's not promising for me
dialog: probably.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, they probably have their own
dialog: acquiring guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY MANNHEIM
dialog: He's probably the guy who acquired
dialog: us.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECOND MAN IN A SUIT
dialog: Yeah. That was me. Ted Hendricks.
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: This is the second man in a suit (TED HENDRICKS) who's been
text: with them all the while. They all shake hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Ted Hendricks. Vice President of
dialog: Acquisitions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY MANNHEIM
speaker_heading: (AWKWARD)
dialog: Gary Mannheim. Um. Vice President
dialog: of Acquisitions. Too. So what are
dialog: you going to be doing at the
dialog: company, Ted?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Managing the acquisition.
dialog: Identifying overlap. Reducing staff
dialog: where we find redundancy. What's
dialog: your focus been here, Gary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY MANNHEIM
dialog: ...I've been managing acquisitions.
dialog: Identifying overlap. Then reducing
dialog: staff where I find redundancy.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Further awkward moments pass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Wow, okay. That's not...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY MANNHEIM
dialog: Yeah, that's not good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: (TO WALTER)
dialog: What do you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm a Practical Asset Manager.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Do you play an important role here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I do. Yeah. Totally. I work in a
dialog: one-on-one basis (on a one-on-one
dialog: basis I mean) with all our
dialog: photographers.
dialog: 
text: Ted just looks at him for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: I'm sorry. I was really getting
dialog: into this song. What were you
dialog: saying?
dialog: 
text: Walter listens to the elevator muzak Ted just referred to.
text: It's like Maneater in muzak; no one could get into it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I was just saying I manage our film
dialog: negatives from the moment they arri-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: (starting to leave)
dialog: Let's talk later. We have a
dialog: specific time set aside to
dialog: conference with employees of the
dialog: former company.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What time is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: I'm not sure. But it's not at this
dialog: time.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: I have to see the board and start
dialog: evaluations now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay. Thank you.
dialog: (flustered, feeling that
dialog: was a dumb thing to say)
dialog: I mean "not thank you." I mean like
dialog: "looking forward to it" I should
dialog: have said.
dialog: 
text: Ted just looks over. The door's closing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (through the closing
speaker_heading: DOORS)
dialog: Looking forward to it.
dialog: 
text: The doors are almost closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: I'll come by sometime this week.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Awesome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARY MANNHEIM
dialog: Are you going to come by my...um?
dialog: 
text: The doors close. Ted's not coming by Gary's office.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Walter walks up a long hallway toward his department floor;
text: on the walls are hugely blown up Life Magazine photographs.
text: Twelve foot high Muhammad Ali, Morgan Freeman (Oscar pose),
text: Moon Landings. - Walter looks small compared. The last photo
text: he passes is familiar - a black and white of a New Orleans
dialog: Jazz Funeral.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR, LIFE - LATER
dialog: 
text: The division Walter works in has fifty employees seated

speaker_heading: READING:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Heard rumbling's Life's over. Wanted to give you something
dialog: cool if this is the last photo batch. Hope when you open it
dialog: and look inside you'll think it's pretty special.
dialog: 
text: Walter's unwrapped the gift.
dialog: 
text: It's a leather wallet. Its front is embossed with the
dialog: inscription from S.O. to Walter Mitty - thanks for the great
dialog: work.
dialog: 
text: Walter looks back at the letter; it finishes - by the way,
dialog: neg 12 is my best ever. Landmark. The Absolute Quintessence
dialog: of Life. .... the rest of the batch kind of sucks. Sean
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RECEIVING ROOM, LIFE MAGAZINE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter has been working through a Life photo order negative
text: box - it's marked Sean O'Connell. There's a co-worker
text: (HERNANDO) cleaning up in the distance. Walter has been
text: examining a negative roll with his loupes (magnifiers worn as
text: eye glasses). THEN HE NOTICES SOMETHING THAT STOPS HIM. The
dialog: negative roll, where the 12th negative should be, has been
text: cut; 12 is missing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hey, Hernando-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: This 12th neg? From this last Life
dialog: roll?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's not here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: What's it of?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's of something that's the
dialog: Absolute Quintessence of Life. Or
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: What's "quintessence?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It means like the best ever.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A moment goes by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: And you can't find it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Um no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: Wow. That's not going to go over
dialog: well with the new asshole.
dialog: 
text: The storage room is separated from the greater division floor
text: by a wide glass window wall. At that moment, Walter has
text: noticed new supervisor Ted Hendricks on the other side of the
text: glass. He's holding a conversation with a LIFE EDITOR there.
text: Walter can hear it (muffled).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: How's the issue shaping up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: We got an email from Sean
dialog: O'Connell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: The photographer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Yes. He said he got the cover shot.
text: His best. The Quintessence of Life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: What does Quintessence mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Like the best ever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Okay. Awesome.
dialog: 
text: Ted starts to walk away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS (CONT'D)
dialog: (repeating to himself for
speaker_heading: SOME REASON)
dialog: Quintessence.
dialog: 
text: This has Walter concerned.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIFE MAGAZINE CAFETERIA - LATER
dialog: 
text: The cafeteria is a large white room, with massive black and
text: white Life photographs serving essentially as wallpaper.
text: Particularly, they are images of physical and human immensity
text: (photographs of the summitting of K2 and the beachheads of
dialog: Normandy) and make the office workers here (Life magazine's
text: low-level corporate workers among whom Walter is one) seem
dialog: tiny in terms of their personal accomplishments but also
text: physically. Walter and a co-worker TIM NAUGHTON sit in front
text: of the Massive K2 mountain summit photograph.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Tim, did you find out anything
dialog: about Negative Box 2-6? Where it
dialog: was sent from?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: (like he's a real big
speaker_heading: DEAL)
dialog: That's the Sean O'Connell
dialog: commission?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, the guy who took this--
dialog: 
text: Walter gestures to the K2. It's taken from above a guy who
text: just summitted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: There's nothing in shipping. The
dialog: box just showed up it seems like.
text: There's no receipt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...I'm getting nervous with these
dialog: new guys around. Lost negative. But
dialog: I'm not going to freak out. I think
dialog: my work here the last nine years
dialog: speaks for itself. I've made my
dialog: mark.
dialog: 
text: Then new superior Ted Hendricks walks past, accompanied by
text: Life's EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATORS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Who am I evaluating next?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: (holding an employee file
dialog: labeled W. Mitty)
dialog: W. Mitty.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND EXECUTIVE
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: He's the black guy from Accounts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THIRD EXECUTIVE
dialog: ...He's not black.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THIRD EXECUTIVE
dialog: Yeah. He's just a white guy. With a
text: mustache.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND EXECUTIVE
text: He doesn't have a mustache.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIFTH EXECUTIVE
dialog: Of course he doesn't have a
text: mustache. He's a woman.
dialog: 
text: They've walked past Walter and out of the cafeteria - but
dialog: Walter's heard every word - not promising.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TIME-LIFE BUILDING, 6TH AVE, NY - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter sits at the cement bench on 6th just out front of the
text: Time-Life building. He's looking at a photograph he's taken
text: from his briefcase. It's a bad print - the kind someone takes
text: before their camera's set - over exposed, out of focus - it's
dialog: impossible to discern the subject.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
speaker_heading: (WONDERING)
dialog: What is this?
dialog: 
text: Cheryl Mellhoff sits down beside Walter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What is this?
dialog: 
text: He hands her the foggy print - it's clear they have an
dialog: established working friendship.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it's either a man with one
text: sideburn. Or a candelabra. Or a
dialog: Happy Days lunch box.
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: (can't make it out clearly
speaker_heading: EITHER)
dialog: It's... is it two badminton
dialog: racquets? What's it supposed to be?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's the Quintessence of Life. So I
dialog: don't think it's two badminton
dialog: racquets. Sean O'Connell took this
dialog: just before he took another one we
dialog: lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: (like that's significant)
dialog: You lost a Sean O'Connell?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (looking at the out of
speaker_heading: FOCUS PRINT)
dialog: ...I'm trying to figure out what
dialog: this picture is. I think he
dialog: focused, set his lens then took the
dialog: missing picture. It's just a better
dialog: picture of this. What is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Maybe Sean has it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The negative? Yeah, I tried to
dialog: reach him. He's always in Bahrain.
dialog: Or a shanty town or somewhere - I
dialog: got one email off.
dialog: 
text: Walter shows Cheryl an email exchange from Sean O'Connell -
dialog: 
dialog: It reads - in need of info for neg 12 of neg roll three, box
dialog: 2-6.
dialog: 
dialog: Sean's reply - Best picture I've taken. The total F'ing
dialog: Quintessence of Life. I hope you're as happy with it as I am.
dialog: 
dialog: Walter's reply = Cool, but can't find it.
dialog: 
dialog: Sean's reply - Out of Office. This is an auto reply. Sean
dialog: O'Connell will be out of the office through the month of
dialog: November.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
text: No cell phone. He's out on a
dialog: freelance. I'd really like to find
dialog: him.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Walter has taken further photographs from his briefcase
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: These are pictures from the last
dialog: roll he sent in. I'm trying to draw
text: a bead on his location by analyzing
dialog: these.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Have you figured anything out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Not yet. Because my trail is...
dialog: water.
dialog: 
text: Walter starts showing Cheryl the photographs. The first of
text: which is water - just a picture of water, could be an ocean,
dialog: lake, or pool (puddle).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: A Starbucks, which I don't know
dialog: which one.
dialog: (flipping to the next one)
text: And a man (or woman's) thumb.
dialog: 
text: This is a picture of a thumb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been trying to figure out the
dialog: gender (of the thumb), as I sat
dialog: here. How many people in the world?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Six billion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Everyone's got two, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Two, too, what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Thumbs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Yeah. But I think there are more
dialog: Starbucks, so I don't know if
dialog: that's what you'd call a hot trail--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Look what Sean gave me.
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Walter has taken the gift wallet out - S.O. to Walter Mitty -
dialog: thanks for the great work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Because we covered, you know, so
dialog: many hotspots together the last 9
dialog: years...
dialog: (a little more quietly)
dialog: ...boldly
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: (having some fun with
speaker_heading: WALTER)
dialog: You guys covered the hotspots
dialog: together boldly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: As a team. Yeah. By Sean actually
dialog: going to the hotspots, and by me
dialog: staying here waiting for the
dialog: pictures of hotspots to come back
dialog: so I can boldly transfer them to
dialog: magazine format.
dialog: 
dialog: Cheryl's laughed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: ...What did you do this weekend?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We're moving my mom here. I went
dialog: and packed her house up. What about
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: My son and I went on a bike ride in
dialog: Lake Valhalla. Jersey. We brought
dialog: lunch. Had lunch in an actual
dialog: field, of grass. We went swimming.
dialog: My friend Marny lives on the lake.
dialog: (getting to what's on
dialog: everyone's minds around
speaker_heading: THERE)
dialog: ...This is going to be the last
dialog: issue. Life's going to be strictly
dialog: online after this merger. No new
dialog: photographs. We're just going to be
text: an internet photo storehouse.
dialog: That's what I'm hearing. They're
dialog: going to let most of us go.
dialog: 
dialog: Walter sits there for awhile. That's tough news. He's got a
text: lot on his mind. Then he gets a text: From Odessa, it reads:

text: Walter's running through the huge Time-Life lobby for the
text: 50th St. glass exit doors, but outside the lobby it's not New
text: York right now. It's Sana'a, Yemen. And running parallel to
text: Walter, along the window glass wall beside him, is rugged war
text: photographer SEAN O'CONNELL, loaded with camera gear. Walter
text: runs out the building entrance and is now running side by
text: side with Sean in Sana'a, Yemen in the midst of an anti-
text: American rally, making a desperate dash together out of there
text: under a volley of middle-eastern shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What's with all these shoes?
dialog: 
text: Angry Middle-easterners are throwing their shoes at Walter
text: and Sean as they sprint by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: It's a sign of disdain here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: That's a lot of shoes, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: They've been targeting western
dialog: journalists all summer. It's been a
dialog: real hot August.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Thanks for doing all the field work
dialog: here and risking your ass and
text: getting hit by shoes and stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Let's just get this camera bag out
dialog: of here. We can shoot the shit
text: later, O'Connell. Over whiskeys.
dialog: 
dialog: There are in Sana'a, Yemen, but they're chasing an actual NYC
text: metro south. Walter has finally reached its doors, though
text: he's continuously struck by shoes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. 104 BUS, NYC - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's slightly out of breath. He's caught the bus. It's
text: just New York again. Walter walks up the crowded bus aisle
text: and finds a seat. Some time passes. Walter looks out the
text: window, his daydream has faded.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. 104 BUS, MOVING, NYC - LATER
dialog: 
text: A little later, Walter's got his lap top out, trying to leave
text: a "wink" for Cheryl M. (Cheryl Mellhoff) on eHarmony . It
text: doesn't work: unable to perform request. Walter looks at it -
text: it's not the smooth next step he was expecting. He tries
dialog: again. Same result.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. 104 BUS, MOVING - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's in the midst of a phone call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I tried to leave a "wink." For
dialog: someone. But it didn't work.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Well, they're not required to
dialog: respond to you favorably. We can't
speaker_heading: FORCE--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No, it says "unable to perform
dialog: request," Todd. So I don't think my
dialog: wink really went through. Do I have
dialog: like a broken page or something?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Broken page? I've never heard of
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, okay, something's not
dialog: working. On my page.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Yeah, let me look here
speaker_heading: (KEYBOARD NOISE)
dialog: Okay, we received your application
dialog: breaking your personality into 29
dialog: different dimensions, and, okay, I
dialog: see the problem. You don't have
dialog: any.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Any what?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Dimensions.
dialog: 
text: Further time passes.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...I don't have any dimensions?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Not that we can determine. Through
dialog: our models. You're just lacking
dialog: distinguishing features as our
dialog: system sees it. Based on our really
dialog: extensive evaluation, you seem, to
dialog: us, a little too indistinguishable
dialog: from everybody else.
dialog: 
text: A pretty long time passes as Walter wrestles with this
dialog: consideration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not standing out. In a way
dialog: that would allow anyone to actually
dialog: notice you. So hey, let's enhance
dialog: your profile. Let me ask you, did
dialog: you always want to be a practical
dialog: asset manager?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I don't want to be one now. I just
dialog: am one.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Why do you do it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's an occupation. When I became
dialog: an adult I thought that would be
dialog: possibly a good thing to have.
dialog: Because I keep getting bills from
dialog: places.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: What are some of your
dialog: accomplishments?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
scene_heading: (AFTER THINKING)
dialog: ...I studied music.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: How long?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: April.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: April? One April?
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah. But I was working at Orange
dialog: Julius to save money for college.
dialog: That April. And my hands were
dialog: always sore from working the
dialog: Frother.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Can you play any pieces?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Which?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: A piece of Cheers. The first piece.
dialog: Part.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: I don't know if we should list
dialog: that.
dialog: 
text: Walter gets a text from Odessa that says I'm leaving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hey, Todd. I have to go. I have a
dialog: piano situation I have to take care
dialog: of.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EHARMONY COUNSELOR
dialog: Okay, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Um hey, can I have my four hundred
dialog: dollars back?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter walks up to Battery Park to find (really) a grand
text: piano sitting in the park. He stops and stares at it awhile.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter sits at the abandoned piano (in pristine shape).
text: Regular NY foot traffic passes around him. He absentmindedly
text: starts playing the first bars of Cheers. Then he just keeps
text: doing it because he's thinking of other things.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GUY IN PARK
dialog: Stop playing Cheers, Dick.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then Walter sees Cheryl Mellhoff and her son RICH (9), headed
dialog: his way from across Bridge Street. They've got two
text: skateboards. Walter smiles when he sees them and waves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE STREET - LATER
dialog: 
text: Cheryl, Walter and Rich push the grand piano toward quiet
text: Bridge Street. It's on its wheels and a couple skateboards.
text: It's rolling down the street pretty well. They're about to
text: push it out onto the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Rich, are you ready to push a piano
text: down a street and get honked at by
dialog: everybody in New York?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: (like it's going to be
speaker_heading: FUN)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: They do. The honking begins right away, but they keep rolling
text: the grand piano down Bridge Street. It looks like it might be
dialog: fun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I can't believe they left it in the
dialog: park. How old is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Her dad bought it for her when she
text: was six. It's seventy-years-old.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Your sister just took off?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My sister's not the responsible one
dialog: in the family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: No kidding, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: She told them no steps. I paid them
dialog: for a first floor move. But she
dialog: screwed up and got my mom a
text: apartment on the 15th floor. The
dialog: movers weren't equipped to get it
dialog: up there. She didn't have the money
dialog: for them to take it back. She had
dialog: to get her braces adjusted, so she
dialog: just took off.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Braces. How old is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE STREET - LATER
dialog: 
text: It's pretty late now. Walter has placed a tarp over the
text: piano. They rolled it into a city parking space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: You're sure this is your sister's
dialog: parking space?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah. Hey, Rich. You're pretty good
dialog: on that.
dialog: 
text: Rich is skateboarding around a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I used to skateboard a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: (something about the idea
dialog: makes her smile)
dialog: When?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Maine. When I was a kid.
text: (trying to unburden her of
dialog: the other skateboard)
dialog: Hey. I'll bring it in tomorrow. I
dialog: don't want you to have to carry it
dialog: all the way home. I got it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You helped me move a piano. I can
dialog: carry this. See you Rich. Thanks
dialog: for putting your back into it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICH
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Just, you know... helping out, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: See you tomorrow.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: Walter's got the piano all tarped. Cheryl and Rich take off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you sure I can't walk you home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: I'm going to drop Rich at his
dialog: Dad's. Thanks, Walter.
dialog: 
text: Walter hangs out a moment. He's watching them go. Then he
text: starts walking off with Rich's skateboard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CORNER, BRIDGE AND STATE NYC - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's alone again. He's back near the park in the city,
text: waiting to cross State. He puts the skateboard down and
text: starts kind of messing around with it a little, moving around
text: on it a little bit. Then he takes off on it pretty well, then
text: he grinds the low garden curb - nicely done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: THIS IS A CLOSE UP OF THE NON-SPECIFIC PHOTOGRAPH OF WATER
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FILM PROCESSING ROOM, TIME-LIFE BLDG - DAY
dialog: 
text: Walter's got the water photo under a light lamp. He's
text: scrutinizing it, hoping to gain some information.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (quietly, to himself)
dialog: Is this the Arctic Ocean..? A glass
dialog: of Sprite.
dialog: 
text: Then he finds something. There's been a light leak at the
text: edge of the frame. Here, with the picture blown-up and light
text: poured on, Walter can make out something reflected in the
text: water. It's the stern of a fishing trawler. Its vessel name
text: and registry number are visible. She's the Erkigsnek SO709.
text: Her port home is almost visible painted beneath, but only the
text: first two letters are legible due to the light leak - Nu.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BREAK ROOM, LIFE MAGAZINE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter and his colleague Tim Naughton have met up in their
text: breakroom, having some coffee. On the wall beyond them is a
text: massive photo of Evel Knievel on fire.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hey were you able to use the
dialog: Circulation computer to find that
dialog: ship? That boat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: Yeah, it's registered in Nuuk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Nuuk?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: That's a town. I think the town in
dialog: Greenland. It's a coastal fishing
dialog: vessel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ....Greenland.
dialog: 
text: Walter considers that. It connects to nothing for him. He
text: turns to other matters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Tim, what would you say is a good
dialog: accomplishment of yours, like
dialog: something that you'd put on an
dialog: online dating page?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
dialog: Tim considers this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON (CONT'D)
dialog: I broke Adam Lopez's record for
dialog: hitting the highest singing note
dialog: for a male, I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Seriously?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: After a moment, Gary hits the highest singing note ever
text: recorded for a male.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Wow...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: But I don't know if I'd put that on
dialog: eHarmony.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON (CONT'D)
dialog: I just don't think that's really
dialog: going to do a lot for the ladies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah. How did you know you can do
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: My voice goes way up there when I'm
dialog: emotional, or whatever, can't
dialog: really control it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I was thinking about putting that
dialog: I've never really been late coming
text: back from lunch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
dialog: ...I don't know. Kind of weak.
dialog: That's not exactly winning the Tour
dialog: de France.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...Yeah
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHOPPED SALAD, CHAIN SALAD FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter is visible at a table for one. He's finishing up
text: lunch. He checks his watch. Then he stands to leave to get
text: back to work on time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STATE STREET - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's running to the subway station a half-block ahead.
text: Then he passes a man who's just standing there silently
text: extending (to Walter) a cup of water. Walter takes it without
text: breaking stride, drinks it and drops the cup on the sidewalk
text: it was unusual. Then Walter hustles down the subway steps
text: and checks his watch to ensure he's running on time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY MOVING - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter has taken his subway seat. Then a shirtless, beaming
text: Frenchman leans into view (in the seat behind Walter's) and
text: offers Walter pats (congratulatory) on the back.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 6TH AVE, NYC - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's made it to the corner of 6th and 49th. He looks up
text: ahead at the Time-Life building (his destination). Then he
text: checks his watch and finds he'll be on time. He's relieved
text: Then a Frenchman comes up and sprays Walter in the face with
text: Champagne. Then multiple Frenchmen mob Walter, fighting for
text: turns at congratulating him through frantic head rubs.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 6TH AVE, NYC - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter is carried on the group of Frenchmen's shoulders as
text: they run him up 6th avenue, chanting.

speaker_heading: FRENCHMEN
dialog: (European sports chant)
dialog: Wal-ter Mi-tty.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY, TIME-LIFE BUILDING - LATER

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR, MOVING - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Among more serious-looking businessmen and woman, the raucous

text: Walter's just being mobbed by ecstatic Frenchmen.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORTIETH FLOOR, ELEVATOR LOBBY - LATER
dialog: 
text: No one's around. We hear the quiet "ding" of the elevator
text: arriving. Then Walter gets out. There are no crowds anywhere -
text: just Walter in his short-sleeve dress shirt, tie and
text: briefcase. He reaches his division floor offices door and
text: enters his pass-key. Then his mom walks up - EDNA MITTY, 76.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Hi, honey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (noticing her, surprised)
dialog: Hey, Mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Hi, Walter. Is it all right I'm
dialog: dropping by?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sure,
dialog: (meaning the open office
speaker_heading: AREA)
dialog: we'll just go through here to my

speaker_heading: TIM NAUGHTON
speaker_heading: (TO WALTER)
dialog: They just called a conference.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (following Tim, with his
text: mom at his side, to her)
dialog: Hey, your new place is almost
dialog: ready. We just had a little hiccup
dialog: due to Odessa just not getting the
dialog: right one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Well, she's the artist...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why did she get the cool name? She
dialog: got to turn out cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: I named her after a wonderful visit
dialog: your Dad and I had to Odessa, our
dialog: family's homeland, one summer, in
dialog: southern Ukraine. There's a
dialog: beautiful river there also named
dialog: Odessa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why did you name me Walter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: I named you after Walter Matthau
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (noticing that a
dialog: conference is starting)
dialog: Okay. This is starting I think. We
dialog: should probably just stop here to--
dialog: 
text: They've walked out onto the division floor where a group of
text: forty or so employees has been gathered together to allow Ted
text: Hendricks a speech (which he's forcing a colleague to make).
text: They stand a short distance away, in the middle of letting
speaker_heading: THEM KNOW:
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE
dialog: This will only take a moment. I
dialog: just wanted to inform you all,
dialog: reluctantly, that this month's
dialog: issue will be the last.
dialog: 
text: The employees have been expecting this. Nonetheless, the news
text: saddens and concerns them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You are all valued employees. But
dialog: as we undergo this transition we
dialog: wanted to be candid with you that
dialog: some of you will be--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
text: (correcting him, a little
dialog: more quietly, just to
speaker_heading: HIM)
dialog: Most.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE
dialog: (to Ted, quietly)
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Most of them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE
dialog: We wanted to be clear that most of
dialog: you will be determined non-vital to
dialog: the new partnership. The remaining
dialog: few employees will carry over into
dialog: the new organization. We'll be
dialog: deciding which category your
text: positions fall into over the course
dialog: of the next week.
dialog: 
text: Tim Naughton, among the gathered (soon to be former)
text: employees, has begun a quiet, high-pitched, weeping. Walter
text: has had to field this news while his mother stands beside
dialog: him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TED HENDRICKS COLLEAGUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now for some good news. We're very
scene_heading: EXCITED TO--
dialog: 
text: At this point, Ted Hendricks nudges the guy to move over so
text: Ted can assume the speaking part for the good news portion.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Okay. So, we're very excited to
dialog: play a part in publishing what will
dialog: be the very last issue of Life
dialog: Magazine, which has been an
dialog: American Institution for 75 years
dialog: and whose renowned covers have
dialog: touched us all really touching
dialog: ways. And for the final issue, our
dialog: cover is going to be something
dialog: which is...
dialog: (he forgot the word, looks
dialog: at the editor for help)
dialog: What was that word?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDITOR
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Quintessence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Our cover will probably be the most
dialog: famous ever because it really has
dialog: the awesome quintessence of Life.
dialog: And we're all going to be a part of
dialog: this historic happening. Even those
dialog: of you who will, right after the
dialog: happening, be asked to leave. Thank
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Ted begins to clap (for some reason). So the gathered
text: employees also begin some watered-down clapping. Walter is
text: among them, standing beside his mom, who is clapping too.
text: Then they all stop the fake good cheer and head back to work.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM, PRACTICAL ASSETS, LIFE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Later, Walter's mom is with him in his work area, back in the
dialog: storage area of practical assets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (to colleague Hernando,
dialog: little rattled about the
dialog: quintessence cover news)
dialog: Check for negative 12 in the wash
text: bins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: So the moving bill came, for my
dialog: move down here. I wanted to bring
dialog: it by. Thank you so much Walter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mom, come on. It's nothing.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Walter takes his mom's bill. He's paying it. He seems a
text: little worried about money. Hernando comes back into the
dialog: area.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: (about the negative)
dialog: It's not in there, Walter.
dialog: 
dialog: It's bad news. Walter is going to have to tell his superiors
text: the negative is lost.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TED HENDRICK'S OFFICE, LIFE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter has approached (reluctantly) Ted Hendrick's office to
text: confess the negative's gone. But he finds Ted on the phone
text: and waits politely in the open doorway for Ted to finish the
text: call. (Ted has his back to Walter).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: Yes, sir. It's gone very smoothly.
text: The last issue's underway.
speaker_heading: (LISTENING)
dialog: The cover? Yeah. It's amazing. It's
text: so quintessence. It encapsulates
dialog: majesty. Totally. It has some
text: splendor, in it, too, probably.
dialog: Also, I'm pretty sure it's
dialog: illustrious and just really
dialog: awesome. It took my breath away.
dialog: And I haven't even seen it yet.
speaker_heading: (LISTENING)
dialog: We're getting it processed from
dialog: practical assets now.
speaker_heading: (LISTENING)
dialog: Yes, sir. We're going to retain
dialog: eleven employees. I'm going to be
dialog: evaluating them over the next week.
dialog: 
text: His situation worsened, Walter turns and leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM, PRACTICAL ASSETS, LIFE - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter has returned to the storage room. He's looking at his
text: laptop at a map of Earth. Specifically, at Greenland.
text: Hernando's working in the distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You know, the thing about
dialog: Greenland... it's really not that
dialog: far, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Greenland.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: What's Greenland?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's a country/island. Sean might
dialog: be there. It's not as close as
dialog: Canada but it's really not as far
dialog: as it sounds. When you hear it.
dialog: Look.
dialog: 
text: Hernando looks at the map. It is (actually) really not that
dialog: far from Canada.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERNANDO
dialog: Yeah, it's not that far.
dialog: 
text: Then Walter leaves the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S DIVISION FLOOR - LATER
dialog: 
text: Everyone's at work, in the cubicle spaces. Walter comes

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 6TH AVE, NYC - LATER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ODESSA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I've processed the digitization of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS
dialog: I know. Because I've been asking

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: THAT'S NOT--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED HENDRICKS

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Warlord?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA

speaker_heading: ITINERARY)
dialog: ...Klipspringers?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Why did you just say that word?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: In some parts of the world they
dialog: carry small deer like we carry,
dialog: say, quarters. To pay bribes. Also,
dialog: blankets or clothing items like

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (this is getting bizarre)
dialog: ...koofiyads.

text: it in google with the other clues.
dialog: 
text: The first result is the Wikipedia page for...
dialog: 
dialog: Mogadishu, Somalia.
dialog: 
text: Walter processes this. Not great. On a nearby customer's
text: laptop, a youtube clip plays:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUTUBE CLIP
dialog: 
dialog: Of David After Dentist.
dialog: 
text: But Walter has been miniaturized and morphed into a little

text: famous little drugged-up, young David from the youtube
text: phenomenon clip David After Dentist wherein a five-year-old

text: express kid rage that he can't control his situation - but
dialog: we're watching a grown man do it and it applies specifically
text: to the frustrations and challenges of his grown-up life.
dialog: 
text: Then, in Starbucks, Walter takes out his gift wallet from
text: photographer Sean O'Connell. He looks at the inscription:
dialog: 
dialog: From S.O. To Walter Mitty - Thanks for the great work.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: SKATEBOARD)
dialog: Hey, I picked this up for you,

speaker_heading: CHERYL

dialog: Do you have any idea where Sean is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No, I lost him. He said I had it
text: though. Like he knew. He smiled. He
dialog: said "you have it." "You." What's
dialog: he talking about?
dialog: 
text: At this point, Rich wipes out. He's scared. He slid on the
text: pavement pretty far and he's shaken up. He bumped his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHERYL
dialog: Honey. Hey. Come here. That was

speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHERYL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Excuse me. Can you pass key me in?

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: STEVE PENDERS
dialog: Those are grounds--

speaker_heading: WALTER

dialog: 
text: Steve serves into Walter.

text: with a center magnifying lens). Then his cell phone vibrates.
text: He's got an email. He reads it.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: it looks weird because we're seeing it through Walter's
text: magnifying loupes - but much of it is clear: It's from human
dialog: resources and reads in part: because you have been terminated
dialog: with cause you do not qualify for severance or to salary
dialog: beyond your last day of work. This message confirms that
dialog: today's date (11/12/11) constitutes the last day of your.....

scene_heading: EXT. STREET, BROOKLYN - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's among some others, walking up a sidewalk home, but
text: he's been so thrown by being fired in this manner that he's
text: forgotten to take his head-mounted loupes off. It's an
dialog: unusual image.
dialog: 
text: This is a view through Walter's loupes as he walks through
text: Brooklyn trying to get his head together. The middle images
text: are magnified but the outside circumference isn't - it's
dialog: unusual and sort of pretty - to see people pass by, sometimes
text: enhanced, then not, all a little dizzy, like Walter's
dialog: feeling.

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR, WALTER'S BUILDING - LATER

scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter walks into his apartment. He sits down in the small
text: living room (he's still wearing the loupes). Some time
text: passes. Nothing seems to happen. Then, slowly, after
text: considerable time, a look of powerful and complete
text: astonishment comes over him. He's looking at something that
dialog: has just shifted his world.
dialog: 
text: We see things from Walter's perspective (through the loupes).
text: Most everything is out of focus because he's wearing them.
text: But he's looking, in real life (in his apartment), at exactly
text: the out of focus image that he has been carrying around a
text: photo of. The object is in his apartment. He looks at this
text: out of focus (because of the loupes) real object. Then he
text: looks at the photo he still holds. They are indisputably the
text: same. Then he looks back at the real object and removes his
text: loupes to bring it into focus. It's the piano.
dialog: 
text: Some time goes by.

speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: He came to visit. To talk about
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Yeah. He asked me some questions
dialog: about you? What your work schedule
dialog: was, when you left, when you came
dialog: home. He said you really understood
dialog: Life. He wanted to know about your
dialog: work. He said you "got Life."
dialog: 
text: Walter listens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I just sent him my recipe for

speaker_heading: EDNA

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Man, I've been desperately
text: searching for him. For a long time.
dialog: Thanks, mom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA

dialog: about work that often.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I know. I don't want you to worry.
dialog: It's not always cool and easy.
dialog: ... why did you take a picture of
dialog: your piano?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: I was concerned we couldn't keep
dialog: it, Dear. I know it's a burden. I
dialog: didn't know if we could manage. So
dialog: I thought I might not see it again.
dialog: I wanted a picture.
dialog: 
text: She smiles at Walter. Then Edna looks at the out of focus
dialog: print.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA (CONT'D)
dialog: That's not a very good picture. But
dialog: that's okay. She's right here.
dialog: 
text: Edna pats her actual piano. Then she looks at Walter with
dialog: great affection.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, I wonder sometimes... you

speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: what?
dialog: (meaning no one really
dialog: gets that wish)
dialog: I have a lot of company.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: EDNA

speaker_heading: EDNA (CONT'D)

dialog: of men and women headed for jobs that were not "fall back"
dialog: jobs but longed-for walks of life - astronaut, beekeeper,

dialog: 
dialog: We jump cut through Walter doing this several times. Then we

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: SEAN

text: Walter's listening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That was the gift. The picture. The
dialog: wallet was just someplace to keep
dialog: the picture. I put it in the little
text: picture slot in the wallet. The
dialog: little picture holder. I thought
dialog: that would be cute. I said "look

speaker_heading: SEAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I-- can you believe it - I just

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The picture?

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, I didn't know I was throwing
dialog: that out, but... yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The wallet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I just didn't believe in Life's

dialog: cannot believe it) chucked it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So you have no idea what it is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The picture?

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Walter's dispirited (and cold).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Do you want to know what it was? It

dialog: 
text: Walter turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (kind of excited, smiling)
dialog: Real life.
dialog:

text: Walter to recline. Sean does too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: They're pretty rare.
dialog: 
text: Sean has his camera rigged up. He just shifts it a little as
text: the snow leopards draw nearer. This all thrills a part of
text: Walter. Sean nods at the camera to mean that Walter should
dialog: take the picture, if he'd like.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Walter seems to like that idea. He looks through the lens, he
text: prepares to take the picture. He's smiling.

speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Your hand's over the lens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh.

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: The situation makes no sense. But it's where they've found

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: It's "f"d up. I know. But if I

dialog: And I won't have enough to get her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ODESSA (O.S.)
dialog: So we may end up having to pay for

dialog: (starting the song)
dialog: 
text: The song kicks in. It's an electric area now. The song's
text: powerful. The crowd's starting to feel like a mob. Walter's
text: still a beach ball they're sending up to the stage. He
text: crosses seventy feet on his back, passed up by a couple
text: hundred hands. Soon the crowd has him on the stage. Right
dialog: among the band.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZACH DE LA ROCHA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Hey. Walter Mitty. How are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZACH DE LA ROCHA
dialog: (gesturing to the crowd)
dialog: Tell them who you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (into the mic Zach handed
speaker_heading: HIM)
dialog: I'm Walter Mitty! I'm enjoying the
dialog: show!
dialog: 
text: The music keeps playing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO ZACH)
dialog: I know all the words.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZACH DE LA ROCHA
dialog: (can't hear him)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I love this song. I know all the
dialog: words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZACH DE LA ROCHA
dialog: (hading him the mic and
speaker_heading: MEGAPHONE)
dialog: Well sing them.
dialog: 
text: Walter takes the gear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sing them out, Walter. Sing out,
dialog: Man!
dialog: 
text: The music has some drive for sure. Walter's getting pumped.
text: He looks at the crowd - all anti-establishment jumping up and
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (starting the song)
dialog: Come with it now.
dialog: 
text: Walter performs the first sets of verses, mic through a
dialog: megaphone. He's got some decent body language and an okay
text: metal-rap flow (and he still has his briefcase).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
text: Rally round the family, with a
text: pocket full of shells.
dialog: 
text: The crowd's liking it. Soon, they want Walter to stage dive
text: and join them. He does it.
dialog: 
dialog: There's no way that this crowd stays inside the concert
text: grounds, and its energy level won't keep things safe. Soon
text: enough the sparks of a riot start when some folding chairs
text: start flying from the crowd over to the police, now flying
text: cups of ice and water. Then there's face to face, cop-
text: protestor taunting. There are five thousand young people in
text: the street (and Walter) and they're too close to the sedans
text: that drove the business leaders there. When a folding chair
text: hits a lady cop it's a riot.
dialog: 
dialog: Down in the middle of it, Walter's got some mixed-feelings -
text: some fear, but the mayhem's releasing something pent up that
text: makes him feel good. He's thrashing around as hard as
text: anybody. He's pushed past a news camera whose feed we have
dialog: the perspective of.
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi, Mom.
dialog: 
text: They all spill into the LA street next door. So, it's one of
dialog: those fifteen minutes where rules don't work anymore. The
text: music, sun, collective anger. Someone throws a chair through
text: a Starbucks window. Walter gets involved in some property
text: destruction, all caught up in this big feeling. He tries to
text: kick over a post office drop box, but it's welded in there,
text: so he can't. Then he gets arrested.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit....
dialog: 
text: Walter's down on the pavement with a policeman's knee in his
dialog: back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, that's my shoulder blade.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PADDY WAGON, POLICE TRANSPORTER - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's alone in the back of the police wagon. His arms are
text: shackled. He's sitting on the built in metal bench, until the
text: transporter hits a bump and he falls to the metal floor. It's
dialog: not easy to stand when your hands are cuffed. But Walter
text: struggles up. But he's standing without any means to
text: stabilize himself and every time the wagon turns he gets
text: chucked around.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, LA - LATER
dialog:

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Um, shoot, I don't have my cell

dialog: 
text: After a moment, Walter calls this number. He waits while it
dialog: rings.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, LA - LATER
dialog: 
text: Walter's being released. His short-sleeve dress shirt is
text: torn. Worked over. He's worked over. He doesn't look like

dialog: contents.

scene_heading: ACCOUNTING CLERK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Okay. Possibly there's that? For
dialog: me?

scene_heading: INT. VILLA, ROOM, RETIREMENT - LATER

speaker_heading: WALTER

text: something on the magazine racks that's stopped him. He stands
text: there for a while looking at it.
dialog: 
text: It's the last issue of Life Magazine. Its cover is a black
text: and white photograph of Walter siting on a cement bench out

text: brown bag beside him; he's looking over photo prints with his
text: loupe, working carefully on some day in the past to fulfill
dialog: the wishes of Life's photographers- a person who's work the
dialog: world never knew took place. It's really good. You can see
text: the word LIFE on the building sign above the bench. So the
text: last photograph, on the last cover of Life, elegantly honors
dialog: the people who quietly worked there and cared for it.
dialog: 
text: Walter stands in front of the newsstand looking at it. It's
text: the first time he's seeing it. It's a message that to Sean,
dialog: at least, and possibly to others his work was meaningful.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - DAY
dialog: 
text: On another day, Walter's sitting in Battery Park across the
