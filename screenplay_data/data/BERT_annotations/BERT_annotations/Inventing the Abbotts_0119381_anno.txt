speaker_heading: (LATE SPRING, 1957)
text: OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED
text: ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large
text: striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long
text: steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn,
text: practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall
text: center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up
text: sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and
text: ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the
text: tent assumes its full and finished form.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - TENT
text: -- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The
text: residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the
text: commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching
dialog: trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand
text: promenade.
scene_heading: 2EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY 2
text: JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their
text: way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and
text: seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is
text: rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular
text: culture chameleon who takes on the colors and
dialog: affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment
dialog: (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley).
text: Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent
text: on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent
dialog: indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the
dialog: many parties they throw every year).
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Didn't get invited, huh?
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Go to hell.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Who cares? I'm not going and I
dialog: got invited.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Who invited you?

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Pam, I guess. I don't know.
dialog: Didn't open the envelope. I mean,
dialog: come on, every time an Abbott girl
dialog: gets her period they have some
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Oh, shut up.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Kotex parties, Kotex party hats,
dialog: pin the Kotex on the...
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Shut up!
text: Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm --
text: Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely
text: interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as
text: LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway
text: and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed-
text: and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he
text: exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent
dialog: pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by
text: Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper
text: humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns
text: and walks down the block.

scene_heading: 4INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER) 4
text: ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker.
dialog: Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very
text: popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott
text: daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and
text: discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down
text: the busy hall.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: I tried to call you last night but
dialog: the line was busy.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: No it wasn't.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 3.
speaker_heading: 4CONTINUED: 4
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: It was busy all night.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Maybe you had the wrong number?
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Are you mad at me?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: No. Are you mad at me?
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: No. Who said I was?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: I just wanted to talk to you last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: We can talk tonight at the party.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: I wasn't invited.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Yes, you were.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: No, I wasn't.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Well, now you are. But if you're
dialog: mad at me you don't have to come.
text: She gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a
text: classroom as the BELL RINGS. The corridor is quickly
text: vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of
text: Eleanor's smile.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. HOLT HOME - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR) 5
text: ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard
text: house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping-
text: pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage
dialog: that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950
text: Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway.
text: The garage doors are open and the garage light is on.
text: We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of
text: "Heartbreak Hotel" in his best Elvis fashion.
scene_heading: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 3A/4.
scene_heading: 6 INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR) 6
text: Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a
text: coat and tie) still singing "Heartbreak Hotel" while he
text: carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen
text: and a bottle of India ink. Jacey's reflection appears in
text: the mirror behind Doug -- he's wearing a coat and tie too.
text: Jacey does a pained take on Doug's handiwork:
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Oh, Christ!
scene_heading: 7 INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOURMINUTES LATER) 7
text: HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was
text: grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when
text: Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the
text: matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious
dialog: woman without interest in appearing to be anything other
text: than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two
text: teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches
dialog: second grade at Haley Elementary School.)
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: He has to wash it off, Mother.
dialog: You cannot let him go to the party
text: unless he washes it off.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It'll look worse if I wash it.
dialog: It's India ink, it'll turn gray,
dialog: it'll look like dirt.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: He looks like such a clown and he
dialog: doesn't even know it! He doesn't
dialog: get how things work in this town.
dialog: I thought you weren't even going
dialog: to the party?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Changed my mind.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Doug, you do understand that you
dialog: may be the only person at this
dialog: party with artificial sideburns?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You do understand that your
dialog: sideburns don't look real?
dialog: Doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he
text: conceals his disappointment and nods:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 5.
speaker_heading: 7CONTINUED: 7
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That they look, really, as though
dialog: you'd drawn them on?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (swallows, then
dialog: shrugs)
dialog: Yeah.
text: She looks hard at Doug for a beat, then turns to Jacey.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Well, darling, it seems he does
dialog: understand. Why don't you just go
text: on to the party and ignore Doug.
dialog: Just have a good time and pretend
dialog: you don't even...
text: Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front
text: door before his mother can finish her sermon.
scene_heading: 8EXT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 8
text: The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band
text: playing "QUE SERA" and the sounds of the party as Doug
text: lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns
text: and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into
text: the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks
text: up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent.
text: Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac,
text: caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.
scene_heading: 9INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT 9
text: Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a
text: tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand.
text: Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls
text: over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother
text: has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: 9CONTINUED: 9
text: They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines
text: (Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy,
dialog: waiting like predators for their chance to dance with
dialog: Eleanor.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I'm going out to the lake
dialog: tomorrow. Sandy wants to show-off
dialog: her dad's new boat. Why don't you
dialog: come?
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: I have to work.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Well, I guess you'll just have to
dialog: write me a letter.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You said you wanted to talk to me
dialog: in private.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: I meant... just... we never get a
dialog: chance to be together, alone, you
dialog: know?
text: STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and
text: cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey
text: handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being
text: separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as
text: he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.
scene_heading: 10 INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - BUFFET TABLE - DOUG 10
text: -- sampling the hors d'oeuvres. He places the ones he
text: doesn't like back onto the platter. PAMELA ABBOTT steps
text: over to Doug. She is his age (fifteen), the youngest of
dialog: the Abbott girls, and the least stuck-up.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: u DOUG
dialog: Hi.
text: She points at Doug's chest.
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Like your tie.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 7.
speaker_heading: 10 CONTINUED: 10
text: Doug glances down at his tie and Pam flips her index
text: finger up across the tip of his nose. Doug scowls and
text: points at her bust.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Can I borrow a Kleenex?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Greaser.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (mouth full of
dialog: food)
dialog: Got any smokes around here?
scene_heading: 11 INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT 11
text: Doug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard.
text: The tent can be seen in the b.g. The band is playing
speaker_heading: "MONA LISA."
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So, is this Peter guy Alice is
dialog: gonna marry rich?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Of course. He's one of the Atlas
dialog: Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh.
dialog: He's a bully.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: So how come Alice's marrying him?
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Because my parents want her to and
dialog: Alice is afraid of my parents.
dialog: It's practically an arranged
dialog: marriage. They think Alice has
dialog: peanut shells for brains or
dialog: something, so they sort of
dialog: suggested that maybe it was time
dialog: to tie the old knot and they sort
dialog: of suggested that Peter was the
dialog: one to do it with.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Jeez, no one can be that much of a
dialog: pushover.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 8.
speaker_heading: 11 CONTINUED: 11
speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Look, Alice is the good daughter,
dialog: Eleanor is the bad one, and I'm
dialog: the one who sort of gets off the
dialog: hook. That's just the way it
dialog: works. Which one are you?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You mean, which kind of brother am
dialog: I? You got me? The little
dialog: brother, I guess.
scene_heading: 12 INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER) 12
text: The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his
text: wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has
text: the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her
text: smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a
dialog: tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and
dialog: sleep a bit too little.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen -- I'd like
dialog: to propose a toast in honor of our
dialog: cause for celebration tonight --
dialog: the engagement of our daughter,
dialog: Alice, to Mister Peter
dialog: Vanlaningham.
text: He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER
text: VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the
dialog: prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three
text: sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh
text: family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the
text: applause and AD-LIBBED toasts.
text: The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and
text: Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to
text: Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto
text: the dance floor.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: 12 CONTINUED: 12
text: The guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither
dialog: father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close
dialog: quarters.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY &amp; TENT - NIGHT 13
text: The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the
text: tent and walks down the driveway. He's had enough of
dialog: high society for tonight.
scene_heading: 14 EXT. SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT 14
text: Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential
dialog: neighborhood) softly singing "You Ain't Nothin' but a
text: Hound Dog." He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb,
text: strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As
text: he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see
text: several trash cans on fire in the near distance.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT 15
text: Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in
text: the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds
text: of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is
text: playing "In Old Monterey"). Jacey stands in the shadows
text: of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER) 16
text: Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears
text: -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.
scene_heading: 17 EXT. HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK &amp; GARAGE - NIGHT 17
speaker_heading: (MINUTES LATER)
text: As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the
text: garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge
text: of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand
text: still on the light fixture pull chain.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Three out of five?
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Two out of three. You serve.
text: Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of
dialog: ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce
dialog: competitors.
scene_heading: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 10.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY 18
text: Lloyd Abbott pulls his (1957) Cadillac up to the pumps.
text: The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey. He wears a
text: Texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: 'Morning.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Fill 'er up. Hi-test.
text: Jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the
text: windshield. Lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash,
text: climbs out of the car, and empties the ashtray in the
dialog: trash can.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: That was a nice party last night.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You were there?
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Yes, sir. Eleanor invited me.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Did she? Didn't see you.
dialog: (slight beat)
dialog: You going to be an engineer like
dialog: your dad was?
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: I want to be an architect.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Hmmm... I guess some people care
dialog: more about having ideas that they
dialog: do about making money.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: I care about making money.
text: Lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that
text: enables it to slide in-and-out of the dash.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: That full suspension file drawer
dialog: your dad invented is still in
dialog: production, did you know that?
dialog: We'll ship thirty-maybe-forty
dialog: thousand of those file cabinets
dialog: this year. Hell, that drawer put
text: Midwest Steel Desk on the map.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Yes, sir. I know.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: 18 CONTINUED: 18
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: An architect, huh?
text: The GAS NOZZLE CLICKS OFF, Jacey hangs up the nozzle, and
text: replaces the gas cap. Lloyd pulls out his wallet.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: You want some free advice?
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Don't waste your life making other
dialog: people rich. Keep the change.
text: He hands Jacey a five-spot and gets into his car. Lloyd
text: drives away in his Cadillac. Jacey crumbles the five
text: dollar bill into a ball. As he returns to the office he
text: catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette
text: machine. He frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie.
scene_heading: A19 INT. BOATHOUSE (LAKE) - LATER THAT DAY A19
text: The abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure
text: situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. Doug
text: strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over,
text: holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. The
text: amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly
text: disappears as the gas is consumed. VICTOR, Doug's
text: partner in crime and best friend, is impressed. (Victor
dialog: is fifteen, too.)
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Jeez Louise! How'd you do that?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Intestinal gas -- produced by
dialog: bacterial metabolism of food
text: residues in the colon. A mixture
dialog: of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon
dialog: dioxide, and methane. That's the
dialog: secret ingredient.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What's so secret about it?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Not everyone can produce methane.
dialog: It's genetic, that means it's
dialog: inherited. There's a lot of
dialog: methane in my family.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You're full of shit.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Look it up, it's all in the
dialog: encyclopedia.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: They don't got farts in the
dialog: encyclopedia.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey, they got 'vagina' in the
dialog: dictionary, they got farts in the
dialog: encyclopedia.
text: The ROAR of a PASSING SPEEDBOAT attracts Doug's interest.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Vagina is in the dictionary?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: 'A canal leading from the uterus
dialog: to the vulva'.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You sure read a lot, man.
dialog: (slight beat)
dialog: A canal?
scene_heading: B19 EXT. BOATHOUSE DOCK (LAKE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY B19
text: Doug steps out of the boathouse onto the sagging dock and
text: sees a fast speedboat cutting across the lake towing a
text: male water skier. (Another young man is driving the boat
text: with two young women in bathing suits as passengers.)
text: Victor comes out as the speedboat's wake rocks the old
dialog: dock.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Assholes!
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: It's Jacey -- that's him skiing.
dialog: He must've skipped out on work.
scene_heading: 19 EXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON SPEEDBOAT 19
text: -- with Jacey skiing behind it. STEVE is at the helm.
text: Eleanor and SANDY lounge in their bathing suits.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: 19 CONTINUED: 19
text: As they pass a ski ramp Steve points to it. Jacey gives
text: him a thumb's up gesture and Steve circles the boat
text: around for the approach.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: No way! He's never done the ramp.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He wants to do it.
text: Steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open.
text: Jacey swings out on the end of the tow-rope and pops over
dialog: the wake.
text: Eleanor leans over to Steve.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You know you're going too fast?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Yeah, I know.
text: The boat zips by the ramp and Jacey's skis contact the
text: slippery surface and his skis go out from under him. He
text: takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes
text: tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water.
scene_heading: 20 INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT 20
text: Jacey is soaking in the bathtub. Doug enters without
dialog: knocking.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Time to eat.
text: Doug washes his hands. Jacey climbs out of the tub and
text: fetches a towel. And Doug reacts to...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Jacey's back and buttocks are severely bruised. Jacey
text: wraps the towel around his waist and turns to his
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Don't tell Mom.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh, shit...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: 22 INT. TEXACO STATION - JACEY 22
text: -- sticks the mop he's been using into a pail and goes to
text: answer the bell. He hesitates as he sees the Abbotts and

speaker_heading: ELEANOR (O.S.)
dialog: Hi.
text: Jacey finds Eleanor standing in the garage doorway.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I heard you got accepted to Penn.
speaker_heading: JACEY
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR

speaker_heading: JACEY

dialog: know what I think about Steve, I
dialog: never think about him. I just do

dialog: good at doing all the thinking.
dialog: Why should I?
dialog: (slight beat)
text: Alice is going to have a baby.
dialog: She and Kilroy didn't waste any
dialog: time. He's already talking about
dialog: having another, and Alice is up-
text: chucking every hour on the hour.
dialog: She's got morning-noon-and-night
dialog: sickness. I've got the feeling
dialog: she'll be barefoot and puking for
dialog: years to come. Wallpaper patterns
dialog: -- that's all she talks about.
dialog: She and my mother spend hours
text: looking at wallpaper pattern
dialog: books. That's another thing I
dialog: never think about... wallpaper.
dialog: (another beat)
dialog: Well, I think this is called the
dialog: silent treatment. I get enough of
dialog: that from my father, I don't need
dialog: it from you. Good luck at Penn.
text: She starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and

scene_heading: 62 EXT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S POV 62
text: Helen steps off the porch and approaches Joan, who is
text: doing most of the talking -- but Joan seems to require a

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I don't think that's necessary.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Well, if I were you I would talk
dialog: to him and tell him...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: No, I'm sorry, Joan, I will not do
dialog: that. If you have something to
dialog: say to my son, then you'll have to

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I just thought you would like to

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: And why on earth should I believe
dialog: anything you say, Joan?
text: Joan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her
text: station wagon and drives away.
text: Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks
text: it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to
text: go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the
text: porch steps. Without warning, she expertly pitches the
text: baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand
text: sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I'm going to ask you one question,
dialog: Doug, and if you have no idea, or
dialog: don't want to answer, just tell
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Is there any sense, you think, in
dialog: which Jacey has... oh, I don't
dialog: know, it sounds ridiculous...

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: I see.
dialog: (another beat)
dialog: Go finish your homework.
text: Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside.
text: Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that
text: Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a
text: bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is

text: group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a
text: reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age
text: (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela
text: dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the

speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hi.

dialog: cause.
speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: PAMELA
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: PAMELA

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: PAMELA
