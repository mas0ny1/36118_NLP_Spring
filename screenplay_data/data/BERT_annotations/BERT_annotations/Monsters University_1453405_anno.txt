speaker_heading: YOUNG MIKE
dialog: Whoa.

dialog: his cap)
speaker_heading: MU is.
text: Employees (Scarers, assistants, can wranglers, etc.) start to
text: stream onto the floor. The tour guide ushers Mike and the

text: ON MIKE, studying everything on the scare floor. Not
text: watching, he puts a foot past the line.
speaker_heading: MI TOUR GUIDE
dialog: Oops. Stop right there. Don’t
dialog: cross over that safety line, human
dialog: children are extremely toxic.
text: Mike steps back and watches all the activity, in awe. But
text: just as the doors start to get wheeled onto the floor, the
text: bigger kids push their way to the front, blocking Mike’s
dialog: view.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: (excited walla)
dialog: Look at that!
speaker_heading: YOUNG MIKE
dialog: Whoa - hey...guys, watch the eye!

speaker_heading: YOUNG MIKE

speaker_heading: KID #1
dialog: Look, he’s gonna do a real scare!
speaker_heading: KIDS

speaker_heading: YOUNG MIKE
dialog: (sigh)
speaker_heading: MEAN KID
dialog: Cool! I wanna be a scarer!
speaker_heading: KID #2
dialog: Yeah, me too!
text: Mike gives it one more shot.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MIKE
dialog: Come on guys, I wanna see!
speaker_heading: MEAN KID
dialog: Out of the way, Wazowski, you don’t
dialog: belong on a scare floor.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: (walla)
dialog: Whoa! Cool!
text: Mike backs away as his smile fades.
text: Mike looks frustrated, not being able to see. Just then, a

text: ON TEACHER.
text: She tries to keep the kids together.
speaker_heading: MRS. GRAVES
dialog: Brian, do not step over the line.

speaker_heading: MRS. GRAVES
dialog: (scream)
dialog: Michael?!
text: They all see Mike watching the MU scarer as he opens the door
text: to the human world and slinks inside. The door starts to
text: close behind him. But not before Mike, moving fast, slips
dialog: through the door and into the human world too!
scene_heading: INT. HUMAN KID’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Inside the human kid’s room, Mike hides in the shadows as the
text: scarer starts his stealthy approach to the kid. The scarer
text: is totally unaware that Mike is in the room.
text: Mike’s terrified, but the more he watches the scarer, the
text: more he gets caught up in the excitement and awe of it all.
text: The scarer is about to scare when suddenly the kid’s bedroom
text: door opens and the parents peep in. Mike is hiding right
text: behind the door, inches away from the humans!
text: The scarer hides too, blending into the shadows.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: See, I told you he’s fine.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, I thought I heard something.
text: The parents close the door and the scarer re-emerges,
text: continuing to build his scare.
text: Mike watches the scarer scratch the end of the bed.
text: The kid hears this and rises up in bed. The scarer slides
text: under the side of the bed and then looms up over the kid.
dialog: SCREAM!
text: ON MIKE as he watches. His mouth falls open, in awe.
scene_heading: INT. SCARE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: The scream can fills to the top.
text: The MU scarer steps through the door, a satisfied look on his
text: face - a solid scare. The door shuts down.

text: dozens of people staring at him, panicked.
speaker_heading: MU SCARER
dialog: What?
text: The MU scarer steps aside, revealing Mike smiling, a dazed,
text: dreamy look in his eye.

dialog: What were you thinking?!
dialog: (walla)
dialog: This is ridiculous, young man! You
dialog: coulda got yourself killed, kid!
dialog: Did you touch anything?! Do you
dialog: know what could have happened?!
text: Meanwhile, as the scarer who was in the room with Mike dons
text: his MU hat, someone comes over and confers with him. The
text: scarer looks over at Mike, putting things together.
text: As the angry walla continues, the MU scarer approaches Mike
text: again, sternly. Mike is still in awe of everything he just
dialog: saw.
speaker_heading: MU SCARER
dialog: That was real dangerous, kid. I
dialog: didn’t even know you were in there.
text: Mike looks at the scarer, ashamed.
text: And then, the scarer can’t help but smile, realizing
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: MU SCARER (CONT'D)
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Wow, I didn’t even know you were in
dialog: there....
dialog: (laugh)
dialog: Not bad, kid.
text: He winks and slaps his MU hat on Mike, then crosses away.
speaker_heading: MRS. GRAVES

dialog: Hey, wait, what are you-?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SULLEY

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (re: jacket)
dialog: Well, then you'll get this back

scene_heading: INT. SCARE CLASS
text: Professor Knight addresses the class for their final.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT
dialog: Today’s final will judge your

dialog: and perform the appropriate
text: scare...in the scare simulator.
text: ON THE SIMULATOR - a simulated human child’s bedroom,
dialog: complete with robotic child, much more low tech then we’1ll
dialog: see in Monsters, Inc.
text: ON THE STUDENTS - staring at the simulator, nervous.
text: ON KNIGHT - lifting the settings on the simulator to medium.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT (CONT’D)
dialog: The child’s sensitivity level will
dialog: be raised from bed-wetter to heavy
dialog: sleeper. So give it everything
dialog: you've got.
text: He closes and locks a control box at the bottom of the bed
text: and turns to the class.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT (CONT’D)
dialog: Dean Hardscrabble is with us this
dialog: morning to see who will be moving
dialog: on in the scaring program, and who
dialog: will not.
text: He gestures to Hardscrabble standing off to the side.
text: ON SULLEY watching Hardscrabble, fear setting in.
text: Hardscrabble casually dusts her record-breaking scream can as
text: she moves to the front of the class.
text: Mike and Randy look over to Hardscrabble, fear setting in.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT (CONT’D)
dialog: Let’s get started!
scene_heading: INT. SCARE CLASS - MOMENTS LATER
text: A nervous student stands on stage by the simulator, waiting
dialog: for his exam to start.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT
dialog: I am a 5-year-old girl afraid of
dialog: spiders and Santa Claus. Which
dialog: scare do you use?
text: Dean Hardscrabble flies from the floor up to the window. The
text: student trying out can’t help notice.
scene_heading: STUDENT TRYING OUT #1
dialog: Uh, that’s a seasonal creep and
dialog: crawl.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT
dialog: Demonstrate.
text: The student walks through the door to the simulator and
text: lunges, roaring at the sim kid.
scene_heading: STUDENT TRYING OUT #1
speaker_heading: ROAR! !
text: The student looks to Professor Knight.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT
dialog: Results will be posted outside my

text: The next student steps up.
text: ON MIKE who forces himself to stop watching the tests.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Focus.

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (exhale)
text: Johnson crackle and howl.
dialog: (checks the book)
dialog: Yes!
dialog: (laugh)
text: Mike continues to study.
text: REVEAL SULLEY watching Mike, resentful - that confident
dialog: little guy is the first person to ever make him second-guess
dialog: his scaring abilities.
speaker_heading: STUDENT (0.S.)
speaker_heading: ROAR!
dialog: 44,
text: Sulley turns to see Johnny and the RORs enter and sit in the
text: stands. Johnny looks to Sulley.
text: Sulley turns back to Mike confidently, but it’s all for show -
text: Mike has gotten under his skin.
text: ON Mike as Sulley walks by and “accidentally” bumps Mike’s
text: books off the wall. Mike glares at him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, do you mind?
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Don’t mind at all.
text: Sulley starts warming up, obnoxiously, right by Mike.
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Roar! Grri!! Arr!
text: Mike shoots daggers at Sulley.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: C’mon Mike, let’s just move.
text: Mike jumps down near Sulley and picks up his books.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Stay outta my way. Unlike you, I
dialog: had to work hard to get into the
dialog: scare program.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: That’s because you don’t belong
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Rahr!
text: Sulley is surprised but he roars back.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Roar!
dialog: (laugh, to himself)
dialog: That’s what I thought....
text: Sulley goes back to practicing as Mike’s cocky smile melts.
text: His words have gotten under Mike’s skin.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!
dialog: Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!
text: Mike gets into Sulley’s face and starts practicing his scares
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!
dialog: Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!
text: Sulley keeps doing the same scare move. With every lunge,
text: Mike does a different move.
text: Other students start to take notice of the guys.
text: Randy looks up at Hardscrabble, concerned. He sees that
text: Hardscrabble is taking notice....
text: Mike and Sulley get closer and closer to one another and then
text: Sulley steps back, tripping on the books.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (stumbling back vocs)
dialog: Whoa-
text: Sulley stumbles back and bumps into the stand holding
text: Hardscrabble’s scream can. It starts wobbling....
text: The can wobbles strongly then falls.
text: There's a beat - then it appears to be undamaged. Whew-
dialog: they’re safe.
text: Suddenly, the scream is released, sending the can spinning
text: around the room! Students have to duck out of the way as it
text: flies back and forth.
text: It finally lands in front of Mike and Sulley, emptying
dialog: completely.
text: Suddenly a huge, dark figure lands in front of them, wings
text: outstretched. Mike and Sulley come face to face with Dean
text: Hardscrabble. She picks up her empty scream can.
text: Randy looks from Mike and Sulley to Hardscrabble, then blends
dialog: himself invisible.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m so sorry.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: It was an accident.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: What, this? My one souvenir from a
dialog: lifetime of scaring? Accidents
dialog: happen don’t they? The important
dialog: thing is: no one got hurt.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're taking this remarkably well.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Now, let’s continue the exams.
dialog: (to Mike)
dialog: Mr. Wazowski, I’m a 5-year-old
text: girl on a farm in Kansas afraid of
dialog: lightning. Which scare do you use?
text: Mike looks around confused, why is she taking over?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Shouldn’t I go up on the--
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: Which scare do you use?
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: That is a shadow approach with a
text: crackle holler.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Demonstrate.
text: Mike moves through the steps of the scare deliberately.
text: He takes a deep breath, preparing to scare when:
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop! Thank you.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But I didn’t get to sh--
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: I’ve seen enough.
text: Hardscrabble turns to Sulley.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m a 7-year-old boy--
dialog: 47.
text: Sulley steps forward and ROARS ferociously. Hardscrabble is
text: unimpressed.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (interrupting)
speaker_heading: ROAR!
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: I wasn’t finished.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: I don’t need to know any of that
dialog: stuff to scare.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: That "stuff" would have informed
dialog: you that this particular child is
text: afraid of snakes. So a roar
dialog: wouldn’t make him scream, it would
text: make him cry, alerting his parents,
dialog: exposing the monster world,
dialog: destroying life as we know it, and
dialog: of course, we can’t have that, so
dialog: I’m afraid I can not recommend that
dialog: you continue in the scaring
dialog: program, good day.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
text: (laughing, then it dawns
dialog: on him)
dialog: Wait, what? But I’m a Sullivan.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Well then, I’m sure your family
dialog: will be very disappointed.
text: Sulley is incredulous, confused. He looks up into the
text: stands, just in time to see the door swing shut on Johnny and
text: the RORs as they exit.
text: Sulley can’t believe this is happening.
text: He turns to Mike and stares at him with pure hate and then
text: marches off.
text: Mike watches Sulley leave, concerned.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: And Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is
dialog: something that cannot be taught,
dialog: you're not scary.
text: Mike stands there, stunned.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You will not be continuing in the
dialog: scaring program.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Please, let me try the simulator,
dialog: I'll surprise you.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Surprise me? I doubt that very
dialog: much.

scene_heading: INT. CAN DESIGN CLASS - DAY
text: ON A BORING PROFESSOR, Professor Brandywine. REVEAL Mike
text: sitting in class, pained to be there. He stares out the
text: window at the School of Scaring in the distance.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR BRANDYWINE
dialog: Welcome back, I hope everyone had a
dialog: pleasant break. Some say that a
dialog: career as a scream can designer is
text: boring, unchallenging, a waste of a
dialog: monster's potential....
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR BRANDYWINE (CONT’D)
dialog: (inhale)
dialog: Open your textbooks to chapter
dialog: three. We will now plunge into the
dialog: rich history of scream can design.
text: Mike looks over to Sulley who is glaring at him. Sulley
text: squeezes his scream can in frustration at Mike, and Mike
text: glares back at him.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 49,
scene_heading: EXT. QUAD
text: Mike emerges from class, dejected. He heads toward his dorm.
text: We pull out and reveal that Sulley is walking next to him,

text: Sulley stops and watches Mike walk off ahead of him.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE’S DORM ROOM
text: Mike slowly walks into his room, depressed, shutting the
dialog: world out.
text: He stands by his bed and stares at his MU hat, then looks out
text: the window at the School of Scaring across the quad. His
text: heart breaks.
text: He looks down at his lame scream can tech book. His
text: frustration boils and he throws the book against the wall.
text: The book knocks down his calendar revealing the Scare Games
text: poster. Mike’s brow raises and a smile slowly grows across
text: his face. He quickly tears the poster off the wall.
scene_heading: INT. FRESHMEN DORM HALLWAY
text: Mike opens his door and Sulley is standing there, still
text: glaring. Mike smiles.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (excited breaths)

dialog: Good afternoon. As a student I
dialog: created these games as a friendly
dialog: competition. But be prepared: To

dialog: the most fearsome monsters on

text: Instantly posing, a student photographer snaps a picture of

speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: So good luck, and may the best

text: Hardscrabble leaves the stage.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm signing up.

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

dialog: What?!
text: ON PROFESSOR HARDSCRABBLE who narrows her eyes. What’s
dialog: Wazowski up to?
dialog: 51.
text: Sulley shows up, still angry, looking for Mike.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT

dialog: of the Scare Games... the brothers,
dialog: my brothers, of Oozma Kappa!
text: Mike points, revealing the members of the misfit fraternity:
text: Don, Terri and Terry, Squishy, and Art. They’re not used to
text: having so many eyes on them, but they stand proud.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Hi.
text: A balloon deflates on Squishy’s head. The crowd snickers.
text: Hardscrabble approaches Mike.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You just said the winners are the
text: most fearsome monsters on campus.
dialog: If I win, it means you kicked out
dialog: the best scarer in the whole

speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: That won’t happen.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How about a little wager?
speaker_heading: STUDENTS

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ON SULLEY
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: Pfft...
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: And what would that prove?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That you were wrong.
speaker_heading: STUDENTS
dialog: (shocked laughs)
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Very well, if you win I will let

dialog: leave Monsters University.
text: Mike struggles with this and then...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Deal.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Now all you need to do is find

text: Mike turns to the misfits.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We need six guys, right?
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: Sorry chief, we count bodies, not

dialog: (pointing to Terri and

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I'm finally in with the cool kids
dialog: Mike, DON’T blow this for me!
text: He crosses to stand near the RORs.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Do the thing.
text: With a pained smile - Randy’s thrilled to be a ROR, but isn’t

scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT

speaker_heading: CROWD MEMBER

speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: We call this room, “Party Central.”
text: It looks like an old lady’s house.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Technically, we haven’t actually

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: But when we do, we’ll be ready.

dialog: And turn....why didn’t you turn?
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (lowered voice)
dialog: Because we never agreed to do this.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: You said this was gonna be cool.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: No one said this was gonna be cool.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Now I’m embarrassed.
speaker_heading: TERRY

speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: SQUISHY (CONT'D)
dialog: My name’s Scott Squibbles. My

speaker_heading: SQUISHY

speaker_heading: DON

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SQUISHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you promise to look out for your

dialog: .-.-will you defend Oozma Kappa, no

dialog: choice for a fraternity. So it
dialog: means a lot to have you here with
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Can't wait to start scaring with
dialog: you, brothers!
text: Squishy offers them each an Oozma Kappa baseball hat.
text: Mike puts it on then looks to Sulley - is he in or out? A
text: beat, then Sulley reluctantly puts on the hat. It’s way
text: small for his giant head.
dialog: The fraternity brothers cheer!
dialog: 62.
text: Terry whacks Sulley on the butt again with the paddle.
text: Sulley snatches the paddle away and snaps it in half. Terri
text: and Terry scurry away.
text: The misfits head off.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Time for a celebration! Grab the

scene_heading: INT. OOZMA KAPPA, MIKE AND SULLEY’S ROOM - MORNING
text: The sun is just coming up as Mike sleeps in bed. He rolls
text: over, right into a blue furry hand. He cuddles into the hand
text: for a beat.
text: PANNING WIDE we see that Sulley’s arm is flopped out of his
text: top bunk. It’s so long it reaches down onto Mike’s bed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (snoring, murmuring)
dialog: I know you’re a princess and I’m
dialog: just a stable boy-
text: Mike cuddles TENDERLY with the hand for another moment, then
text: the alarm goes off. His eye opens, and he sees Sulley’s
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (cuddling noises, then)
speaker_heading: ACCHHHH!
text: He pushes the hand away, flipping a sleeping Sulley out of

dialog: angrily.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (impact effort)
dialog: What?! Mom!
dialog: (looking to Mike)
dialog: What are you doing?!
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Your grubby paw was in my bed!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Were you kissing my hand?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (big laugh)
dialog: No! And what about you with all

speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: I don’t shed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Really?
text: Mike punches the bottom of Sulley’s mattress, and blue hair
text: comes cascading down off the mattress.
text: Sulley tries pushing past Mike, as Mike gets out of bed.
text: Mike tries to go around Sulley.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SULLEY

speaker_heading: SQUISHY

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: We never get mail.

dialog: Oh sorry, it’s stuck....
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: us to meet?
scene_heading: INT. SEWER/DRAIN SYSTEM, ON CAMPUS - NIGHT
text: Mike, Sulley, and the misfits tentatively step into the

text: wall, spooky.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Of all the sewers on campus this
dialog: one has always been my favorite.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Art, you've been here before?
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I have a life outside of the house,
dialog: you know!
text: As they step forward and turn a corner, they hear voices...
dialog: and then they see:
text: The assembled throng for the first event of the Scare Games.
text: The Greek Council president and VP stand in the center of the
text: sewer, on a stage against a wall.
text: All the competing fraternities and sororities are there,
text: gathered around the stage.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: Welcome to your worst nightmare,
dialog: THE SCARE GAMES!
dialog: (enjoying the excitement)
dialog: Yeees, yes, I love it! I love this

text: ON THE HSS. A collection of creepy Goth coeds.
speaker_heading: HSS SISTER
dialog: Hiss...
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: And finally... Oozma Kappa...
text: ON THE OOZMAS. The guys look small and pathetic. The crowd
text: goes silent, a lone cheer accompanies the group. Mike looks
text: over to see Ms. Squibbles calling down from a sewer grate.
scene_heading: MS. SQUIBBLES
dialog: YAY! Woohoo!
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Hi Mom!
scene_heading: MS. SQUIBBLES
dialog: Smile!
text: She snaps a picture.
text: Back on the Oozmas, Mike sighs.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: Let’s begin the first competition:
dialog: the toxicity challenge!
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: Human children are TOXIC!
text: She makes her way across the stage now to point to a drawing
dialog: of children’s toys.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT (CONT’D)
dialog: And anything they touch is toxic.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: We don’t have any human toys but
text: thanks to MU’s biology department,
dialog: we've found a close second. The
dialog: stinging glow urchin!
text: Some students bring in a crate stamped with the words “MU
text: BIOLOGY DEPT.” The president reaches into the crate with a
text: metal claw and pulls out a beautiful, glowing, spikey orb.
text: The crowd recoils in fear.
text: The urchin glows and sparks menacingly.
speaker_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP (CONT’D)
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: Trust me when I say you are not
dialog: gonna wanna touch this bad boy!
text: ON Art in the crowd.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I wanna touch it.
dialog: ON president.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: And you certainly don’t wanna touch
dialog: any of its friends.
text: REVEAL an entrance to a tunnel... which is filled with
text: hundreds of the toxic glow urchins scattered along the floor.
text: The crowd is terrified.
dialog: ON Art.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Yeah, I wanna touch ‘em.
dialog: ON VP.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: (pointing to the tunnel)
dialog: This is the starting line. The

text: the finish line.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: And whoever comes in last is
text: eliminated from the games.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Mike?
text: Mike jumps.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ah! What is it?
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Does that mean if we lose we're

dialog: 67.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Don't worry, Smoothie.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Squishy.
speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: win this.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It’s an obstacle course - what are
dialog: you gonna do roar at it?!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: I can get through faster than you,
dialog: little guy.
text: ON Mike as he glares at Sulley and readies himself at the
dialog: starting line.

scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: Take your place at the starting

speaker_heading: ROSIE
dialog: This is all about teamwork.
speaker_heading: CARLA

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: line!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Get ready to eat my dust!
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Hey guys, should we huddle up?
dialog: ON president and VP.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: Attention teams, one last thing.
text: Scarers work in the dark.
text: With that, the floodlight is shut down, leaving the course
text: entirely dark. In the darkness, the glow urchins become
text: infinitely more terrifying, glowing and sparking dangerously.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: (scared)
dialog: I wanna go home.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: On your marks!
text: Squishy, Terri and Terry turn to the PNKs finishing their

scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP

dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP (CONT'D)
dialog: GOo!!
text: THE RACE BEGINS!
text: ART runs off, the Oozmas and all the other teams follow
text: behind Art who leads the charge with a war cry!
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I’m gonna TOUCH ‘EM!
text: He immediately hits a bunch of the glow urchins, which
text: illuminate, shocking him. He comes crashing down and looks
text: over at his leg, which immediately balloons right up.
speaker_heading: ART (CONT'D)
dialog: (vocs getting hit &
dialog: falling, then laughing)
dialog: AH! WHOA! Ah!
dialog: (ballooning up)
speaker_heading: AAAAAAH!
text: The crowd goes crazy.
text: The teams are off! Mike and Sulley carefully start

speaker_heading: CARLA

dialog: Is that as fast as you can go?
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (running)
dialog: Just getting started!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What the-
text: Urchins whiz past them fired by monsters standing above them
text: with slingshots.
text: Mike and Sulley try their best to avoid the flying urchins.
text: Sulley is hit by an urchin in the shoulder and instantly
text: swells up.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Ah!
text: He grabs the urchin on his shoulder and his hand swells up.
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: AHH!
text: Mike runs ahead but turns back to laugh at Sulley.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ooh, that’s gotta HURT!
text: Mike is hit by an urchin and falls. He looks at his foot and
dialog: it swells up!
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: AH!
dialog: The RORs with their awesome skills and their teamwork,
text: quickly leave them in the dust.
text: Sulley runs whizzing past Mike. Mike’s determination is
dialog: renewed.
text: He keeps his swollen leg lifted as he hops along in pain.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (getting up grunt)
text: Ow, OW, OW, OW, Ow, ooh!
text: ON THE MISFITS.
text: Terri and Terry duck to avoid an urchin.

speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Don’t worry, we'll be fine--
dialog: (hit in face by urchin)
dialog: Aaaah!
text: Terry’s face swells up and he screams!
text: Now not looking where they’re going, they step onto another
dialog: urchin.
speaker_heading: TERRI/TERRY
dialog: Ahhhh!
text: They trip and fall as their leg swells up.
text: Squishy sees them and screams.
text: He runs off in a panic and starts getting pummeled with
dialog: urchins.
text: BAM! An urchin flies into his mouth. He swells into a giant
text: pink ball.
text: The monster that threw it fist bumps another monster.
scene_heading: ON MIKE AND SULLEY
text: Mike and Sulley follow the RORs. Still hopping on one leg,
text: Mike smiles as he sees that Sulley is behind him. Turning
text: back, he ducks an urchin.
text: This throws him off balance and he loses control, landing on
text: an urchin with his good foot.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (landing on urchin)
dialog: Yikes!
dialog: (leg swells)
dialog: Ow!
text: They have entered part of the course where urchins hang all
text: around on strings at different heights. He maneuvers to
dialog: avoid them.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (yelling; avoiding
dialog: urchins)
dialog: Ow, Ow, Ow, ow!
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: ON SULLEY.
text: Sulley puts his head down and barrels through the urchins,
text: getting zapped along the way.
text: Sulley continues to push through and catches up with Mike.
text: They are neck and neck.

scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: OH! ROAR OMEGA ROAR wins!
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: (cheering)
text: Mike and Sulley race to the end.

speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (heavy breathing)
dialog: Take that, Wazowski.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Are you delirious? I beat you.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Get your eye checked--
text: The crowd sees them and starts laughing.
speaker_heading: CHET

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, second place ain't bad!
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP

dialog: 74.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: Fifth place HSS...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No...no...NO!
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: And in last place, Oozma Kappa!
text: Mike turns around in time to see the battered and bruised
text: Oozma Kappa cross the finish line. Don rolls Squishy out and
text: then collapses.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: I can’t feel my anything.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: Oh shocker, Oozma Kappa has been
dialog: eliminated!
text: ON THE LEADER BOARD, Oozma Kappa’s name is removed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No...
dialog: (gasp)
text: Mike backs up in a panic directly into Dean HARDSCRABBLE.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Don’t look so surprised, Mr.
dialog: Wazowski. It would have taken a
dialog: miracle for you to s--
text: Mike turns to Hardscrabble, it dawns on him, he’s done.
dialog: ON the VP.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: Attention everyone! We have an
dialog: announcement! Jaws Theta Chi has
dialog: been disqualified.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: (shocked WALLA)
dialog: What?
text: Mike looks up to the stage, “what?”
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: The use of illegal protective gel
dialog: is cause for elimination.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: (walla)
dialog: Boo!
speaker_heading: BIG RED
dialog: What?
text: A referee wipes goop off George Sanderson's leg and pokes him
text: with the urchin.
dialog: Zap! Swell.
speaker_heading: GEORGE SANDERSON
dialog: Ow!
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: Which means, Oozma Kappa is back in
dialog: the games! It’s a miracle!
text: Hardscrabble can’t believe it. She glares at Mike.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Your luck will run out eventually.
text: Mike looks worried. He glances at his team. The Oozma Kappa
text: wave at him looking friendly and pathetic.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: This is gonna be harder than I
dialog: thought.
text: The Oozma Kappa name is put back on the scoreboard.
scene_heading: EXT. QUAD
text: Mike has gathered the team together on the quad. He passes
text: before them like a drill sergeant as Sulley leans against the
text: tree behind him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, listen up Oozmas! Now we're
dialog: gonna have to start winning these
dialog: things together, so that means I’m
dialog: gonna need each of you guys to pull
dialog: your own weight.
text: Squishy appears behind Mike.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Mike.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Ah! What is it?
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: We've made a list of our strengths
dialog: and weaknesses.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: In high school I was the master of
dialog: the “silent scare.” Why I could
text: sneak up on a field mouse in a
dialog: pillow factory.
text: Don delicately creeps along the ground on his hands and
text: knees, but his tentacles stick to the sidewalk. He awkwardly
text: pulls them up each with a loud, grating, popping sound.
speaker_heading: DON (CONT'D)
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: Sorry, they get stickier when I’m
dialog: sweaty.
dialog: (keeps walking)
dialog: Oh my gosh, that’s terrible. Wait,
dialog: no, no...
text: Mike just stares at him....
text: Terry pulls out playing cards and begins to do a card trick.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: We're experts in the ancient craft
text: of close-up magic.
speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: (mysterious)
dialog: It’s all about misdirection.
text: Cards spill out of Terri’s sleeve and Terry sighs,
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I have an extra toe.
dialog: (laughing, sotto)
dialog: Not with me of course.
text: Mike calls out to quiet the team.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Guys, one slipup in the next event
dialog: and we’re goners. So for this to
dialog: work, I’m gonna need you to take
dialog: every instinct you have and bury it
text: deep, deep down.
text: Mike crumples up their list and throws it away.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: From now on we are of one mind, my
dialog: mind.
text: Sulley rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Oh please.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I will tell you exactly what to do
dialog: and how to do it.
speaker_heading: MISFITS
dialog: (unsure)
dialog: Okay Mike./That seems about
dialog: right./Sure.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Alright, give me scary steps!
text: Fifty, up and down. Right now,
dialog: let’s go!
text: Sulley walks over to Mike.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: You're wasting your time...we need
text: a new team.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: We can't just get a new team. I
dialog: checked this morning, it's against
dialog: the rules.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: What if we disguise the new team to
dialog: look like the old team?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh, no, no, no, no. We are not
dialog: cheating.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: It’s not cheating, I’m just, you
dialog: know, leveling the playing
dialog: field....
text: Mike stares at him.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, so it’s kind of cheating!
dialog: But what do you want me to do?
dialog: They're not exactly the scariest
dialog: group in the world.
text: Sulley points to the misfits now distracted from their
text: training, crowded around Squishy.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Oh, a ladybug! Make a wish! Make
dialog: a wish!
text: Art blows it off Squishy’s arm. They all laugh, enjoying it
text: fly away.
text: Hopelessness sets in.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: This is not gonna work.
text: Sulley leaves.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Where are you going? We're
dialog: training!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: I'm a Sullivan.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's not enough. You’re all over
dialog: the place, you’re charging ahead
dialog: when you need to--
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Eh, b-b-b-bep. You tell them what
dialog: to do, but not me. So long, coach.
text: Sulley passes by a group of girls in the quad and shoots them
text: finger pistols.
speaker_heading: GIRLS
dialog: (giggling)
text: Mike watches concerned as Sulley heads off.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay Oozmas-
text: He turns and jumps! Squishy is standing right behind him.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: AH! Boy, we need to get you a
dialog: bell.
text: Mike turns to the group and pulls out the open envelope from
text: the Scare Games and reads it.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen up! “If a kid hears you
dialog: coming, they'll call mom or dad.
dialog: Then you better run fast or things
dialog: will get bad.”
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: In the next event, if even one of
dialog: us gets caught, we’re all out. So
dialog: remember, do EXACTLY what I do.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: ON THE OOZMAs, as they sneak through the library, terrified

scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: (whispered to crowd)
dialog: We are at the halfway point of the
dialog: second event, and things are
dialog: getting interesting.
text: The misfits walk in line with Mike, revealing an annoyed
text: Sulley. Sulley looks ahead to see the HSS sisters as they
text: reach for their flag.
speaker_heading: HSS SISTER
dialog: Got it!
text: They quickly get out of the library, having passed the test.
text: The other two flags left hanging are green and purple for the

scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Only two teams left.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Who will make it out with their

text: REVEAL THE EEKs as they sneak along too.
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: In a real scare you do not wanna
dialog: get caught by a kid’s parent, and
dialog: in this event you DO NOT want to
dialog: get caught by...”The librarian.”
scene_heading: ON AN OLD MONSTER LIBRARIAN

dialog: Phhft, what’s so scary about a
dialog: little old librarian?
text: A student is studying and gets up from his chair and the
text: floor makes a small squeak.
text: Suddenly, the old librarian rises up, turning into a
text: terrifying creature.
text: She grabs hold of the student and lifts him up.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: I said, quiet....
scene_heading: LIBRARY STUDENT
dialog: AHHHHH!!!
text: She throws the student through the dome of the library.
scene_heading: EXT. LIBRARY

scene_heading: LIBRARY STUDENT

scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
text: ON Mike and the misfits shocked as the librarian soars over
text: them to the other end of the library.
text: Mike breaths deeply, turns around and starts to put his foot
dialog: down.
text: The board underneath squeaks so Mike quickly moves it to
dialog: another board.
text: The misfits begin a slow, steady pace through the library,
text: they literally walk exactly as Mike does.
dialog: Sulley can’t handle their pace.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (whispered)
speaker_heading: FASTER!

speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: (whispered)
text: Slow and steady.
text: The misfits relay the exact message down the line to Sulley
text: the exact way Mike did. They continue to move really slowly
text: as Sulley is increasingly frustrated.
text: Sulley can’t take it. He bolts forward, leaving his
text: teammates behind.
text: Mike’s eye goes wide.

text: The librarian turns around at Sulley’s noise but luckily she
dialog: can’t see very well.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: Hmmmm...
text: She goes about her business. Mike gives a sigh of relief.
text: But he gasps when he sees Sulley racing to the top of the
dialog: ladder.
text: Sulley reaches for the Oozmas flag and almost gets it -
text: But the ladder starts to come off the tracks under the
dialog: strain.
text: Sulley falls to the ground with a thunderous SLAM.
text: The librarian spins toward the sound, and quickly runs
text: toward Sulley.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Grrrr...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No...
text: Her tentacles poised to grab him - he cringes, waiting to be
dialog: yanked - but just then...
text: POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP!
text: The librarian whips around - who’s making that noise?
text: It’s DON! And he’s on his hands and knees crawling along the
text: floor. His tentacles are making a loud, sticky, suction cup
dialog: sound.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: Grrrr...
text: The librarian leaves Sulley behind and makes a beeline for
text: DON, her tentacles shooting toward him.
dialog: 84.
text: Now it’s Don’s turn to cringe, bracing for impact. Just
text: before the librarian reaches Don...
text: Terri and Terry start-up their crazy dance moves.

speaker_heading: TERRI
dialog: Da-da-da-da! Over here now....
text: The librarian stops in her tracks and now she turns towards
text: Terri and Terry.
text: Now it’s Terri and Terry’s turn to be scared. But just as
text: the librarian’s tentacle reaches for them--
text: Art is now standing on top of a table stomping his feet and
text: laughing hysterically.
text: ON VP and member of the crowd.
speaker_heading: CROWD MEMBER
dialog: Is that legal?
scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP
dialog: You better believe it, mop top!
dialog: The only rule is don’t get caught.
text: As the librarian guns for Art, he somersaults off the table
text: and rolls around in front of her, laughing like a mad man.
text: Mike looks on, horrified.
text: The EEKs are using a human rope to get to their flag.
text: Art continues rolling right past Sulley. Terri and Terry
text: shout at the librarian.
speaker_heading: TERRI/TERRY
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Over here!
text: As the librarian pursues Terri and Terry, one of her

dialog: Come and get me! Come get me!
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: MIKE

scene_heading: EXT. LIBRARY

scene_heading: GREEK COUNCIL VP

speaker_heading: MISFITS

speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Okay, look, that wasn’t real

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It was better then what you did.
dialog: You should have stuck to my
dialog: strategy.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Whatever, talk to me when we start
dialog: the real scaring--

speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: SQUISHY

speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Uh-uh. Bad idea.
speaker_heading: MIKE

scene_heading: EXT. ROR HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
text: The Oozmas head up the stairs to the ROR house. Sulley looks

speaker_heading: DON

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: -.-Say?
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: How are you so good at this?!
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: And in ya go!

scene_heading: PARTY MONSTER #2

speaker_heading: MISFITS
dialog: Thank you!/Thanks so much!
scene_heading: PARTY MONSTERS
dialog: Oozmas, yeah!

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oozma Kappa, tonight we party like
dialog: scarers!
speaker_heading: MISFITS
dialog: YEAH! /WOO!

speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: I've never stayed up this late in
dialog: my life.
speaker_heading: PNK SISTERS
dialog: (laughing)
text: Squishy is having a great time on the dance floor and spies
text: Sulley standing by himself. He decides to lasso him onto the
text: dance floor. Sulley is not amused. Squishy is undeterred
text: and begins “reeling” him in. Sulley gives into his
text: enthusiasm and reluctantly hops his way onto the dance floor
text: with the rest of the misfits.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: woo!
scene_heading: PARTY MONSTERS
dialog: Woo-woo! Woo-woo!
text: Mike wanders to a hallway at the side of the party where
text: portraits of the great Scare Game winners are located. He
text: sees the Scare Games trophy, set on a pedestal at the end of
text: the room. As he approaches, Mike sees his reflection in it.
text: Distorted by its shape, he looks big and impressive. Mike
text: raises his claws and makes a small growl face.
text: ON JOHNNY as he addresses the party crowd.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (whistle)
dialog: Hey, quiet! QUIET! Quiet down you

speaker_heading: CHET

dialog: paint.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wha--?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: The most adorable monsters on
dialog: campus.
dialog: 91.
text: A bug monster then presses a button and a machine shoots
text: glitter confetti at the Oozmas, sticking right to them.
text: Another ROR brother tosses a bucket of flowers at them. They
dialog: have become a laughing stock.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Release the stuffed animals!
text: Randy pulls on a rope, connected to a net full of stuffed
text: animals. They drop and Chet quickly snaps a picture.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (laugh)
dialog: Faced!
text: The screen goes white.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS, NEXT DAY
text: Pulling back from one of the photos of the team covered in
text: glitter and paint to reveal it’s printed on the cover of the
text: school’s newspaper: THE CAMPUS ROAR. Mike puts the papers in
dialog: the trash.
text: ON the misfits walking to class. Mike is furious but does
text: his best to boost the team’s morale.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Don’t worry. Nobody reads the
dialog: school paper.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Yeah, but I’m pretty sure they read
dialog: the quad.
text: Mike looks over, stunned. Trees, light posts, poster kiosks
text: all covered with the photo in every shape and size. The
text: entire quad is blanketed with the embarrassing image as
text: students look on and laugh.
text: A giant banner is unfurled on the clock tower.
text: Mike’s shock is broken by an offscreen voice.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Thank you very much, okay would you
dialog: like that with two sleeves or four?
text: He turns to see Johnny and the RORs selling shirts and other
text: merchandise featuring the photo.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Thanks! Tell your friends!
text: Furious, Mike marches over followed by the team.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, what do you think you’re
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Raising a little money for charity.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, well stop it!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You want us to stop raising money
dialog: for charity? That’s not cool.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: This guy hates charity!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I want you to stop making us look
dialog: like fools.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hey, you’re making yourselves look
dialog: like fools.
text: Johnny pulls out the paper.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s be honest boys, you’re never
dialog: gonna be REAL scarers, because real
dialog: scarers look like us.
text: He gestures to himself and his team.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: But hey, if you really want to work
dialog: for a scare company, they’re always
text: hiring in the mail room.
text: Johnny turns around the paper to reveal a help-wanted ad for
dialog: the Monsters, Inc. mail room.
text: The misfits take this in as everyone laughs at them.
text: With that Sulley fumes and heads off. The misfits follow,
text: dejected. Mike runs after them.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Guys, hold on! Hey, hey, hey, wait
dialog: a second! Don’t listen to him. We
dialog: just need to keep trying-
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: No, you need to stop trying! You
dialog: can train monsters like this all
dialog: you want, but you can’t change who
dialog: they are.
text: Sulley walks off.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Mike, we appreciate everything
dialog: you've done...but he’s right. No
dialog: matter how much we train, we’1l
dialog: never look like them. We’re built
dialog: for other things.
text: Don looks at his card.
text: The misfits follow after Sulley.
text: Mike watches them go, helpless. Chet approaches holding a
text: mug with the photo on it.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (slurp)
dialog: Sorry Squirt, some monsters just
dialog: aren’t cut out for the big leagues.
dialog: (laugh)
text: Mike stares out and suddenly something dawns on him. He
dialog: takes off--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: The big leagues.
scene_heading: INT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE - EVENING
text: Mike bursts through the door and catches up with the misfits

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Guys! We’re going on a little

dialog: 94.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Okay, I need to get out....
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Excuse me, my leg’s caught. There
dialog: we go, I got it.
speaker_heading: TERRI

speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Thanks, mom!
scene_heading: MS. SQUIBBLES
dialog: Have fun, kids! I’11 just be here,

text: Ms. Squibbles rolls up the window, and we hear muted heavy
text: metal thrasher music pounding from inside the car.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Hey, uh, where are we?
text: Mike walks up to a gate with the guys behind him. Mike looks
text: over the gate in awe, as we reveal... Monsters, Incorporated.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The big leagues.
text: Sulley is stunned.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Holy, rolly polly...
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Nice fence.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: This is amazing, Mike!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We're not stopping here.
dialog: 95.
text: Mike holds up a pair of wire cutters and does a chop-chop
dialog: action.
scene_heading: EXT. MONSTERS, INC.
text: We see a fence cut out and a “No Trespassing” sign on the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: (nervous voc)
text: We pan up and see the guys climbing a ladder that gets them
text: onto the roof of Monsters, Inc.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is crazy, we're gonna get

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Shh!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MONSTERS, INC.

speaker_heading: MISFITS
dialog: Oh, whoa! Wow.
dialog: (excited laugh)
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: We look down on a working scare floor. The floor is full of

text: several monsters go through their entire routine.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Look at them, they’re going into
dialog: the human world and they don’t even
dialog: look scared!
text: Mike and Sulley take it all in. They’re awestruck. The
text: fraternity brothers look down in amazement.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: Take a good look, fellas. See what
dialog: they all have in common?
text: Squishy strains, but then turns to Mike confused.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Ehhh...no, not really.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Exactly.
text: A sea of monsters of all shapes, sizes, ages, genders, fill
text: the floor, all scaring in their own way.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s no ONE type of scarer. The
dialog: best scarers use their differences
dialog: to their advantage.
text: The team smiles watching all the various types of monsters
text: using their varied appearances, sizes and shapes in unique,
dialog: skillful ways.
text: A tall skinny guy with long skinny arms flails them around
text: like wild hoses. Squishy watches a puff ball turn into a
dialog: spider.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Terri, look!
text: ON a three-headed monster as it comes out of a room.
text: Sulley is starting to see Mike in a new light. Huh. Mike
dialog: might actually be right about this. The misfits are
dialog: certainly inspired....
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Hey, look at that old fella rackin’
dialog: up the big numbers!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: Don, that “old fella” is Earl “The

speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: What! Where?! That’s really him?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He held the scare record for three
dialog: years!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Oh, third door from the end.
text: ON a female scarer.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Carla “Killer Claws” Benitez.
text: Sulley can’t believe what he’s seeing.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Look, it’s Screaming Bob Gunderson!
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I still have his rookie card.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Me too!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Doesn’t have the speed any more but
dialog: his--
speaker_heading: MIKE SULLEY
dialog: --technique is flawless. --technique is flawless.
dialog: The guys have never had this kind of interaction before.
dialog: They're not instant friends - it’s just a moment.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You collected scare cards, huh?
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Yep. Four hundred and fifty of
dialog: ‘em.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Impressive. I have 6,000, still in

text: ON THE MISFITS, inspired by what they’re seeing on the floor.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Hey, look at me, I’m Earl The

text: Squishy makes a scary face.
speaker_heading: MISFITS
dialog: Hey, that’s a pretty good one,
dialog: Squish!/Alright, Squishy! /Not
dialog: bad...you felt it.
dialog: (laughter)
text: ON SULLEY AND MIKE watching the guys, then Sulley looks at
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: I've been a real jerk....
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So have I.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But it’s not too late. We could be

speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (gasp)
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: What are you doing up there?!

speaker_heading: ART

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Hey...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP
text: Mike, Sulley, and the misfits take off!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Come on!
text: The gang hustles, pursued by guards. They climb a ladder.

speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (gasp)

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (gasp)
scene_heading: SECURITY GUARDS
dialog: Up there! Get ‘em!
text: But the guards are at the bottom so they change direction.
text: They start hopping over the rooftops.
dialog: 99.
text: Squishy is one of the last ones to jump and nearly falls but
text: Sulley catches him.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: (panic breaths)
dialog: Thanks brother.
text: Sulley puts Squishy on his shoulders.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Don’t mention it!
dialog: (running efforts)

speaker_heading: DON
dialog: (heavy breathing)
dialog: I'm fine, really, it’s just a
dialog: little heart attack.
text: Sulley picks him up as well.
text: Art catches up to Sulley-
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Oh, I want a piece of that action!

scene_heading: EXT. MONSTERS, INC. GATES
text: They round the bend and sprint to the car just ahead of the
dialog: guards.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Mom, start the car!
text: They duck through the hole in the fence.
text: Ms. Squibbles lowers her window.
scene_heading: MS. SQUIBBLES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: Start the car!
dialog: 100.
scene_heading: MS. SQUIBBLES
dialog: (confused)

speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: The CAR! Start the car!
scene_heading: MS. SQUIBBLES

speaker_heading: SULLEY

text: Sulley finds Mike standing alone in the Oozma’s simulator.
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Mike?
text: Mike is beaming, lost in his own little world.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I did it. I can’t believe it.
text: Sulley smiles....
text: Mike turns around.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m gonna be a scarer!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Yeah, yes, you are!
text: Mike turns to the sim kid one more time.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey, you hear that? Get plenty of
dialog: rest kidd-o....You haven’t seen the
dialog: last of Mike Wazowski. BOO!
text: Mike playfully throws his hands in the air toward the sim kid
text: --to his shock the sim kid shoots out of bed and lets out a
text: terrifying scream, reacting just as wildly as it did in the
dialog: competition.
text: Mike leaps back in shock.
text: Mike turns to see the can fill all the way to the top.
dialog: 126.
text: Sulley says nothing, he looks confused, slightly worried.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew I was scary, I didn’t know I
dialog: was that scary....
text: Mike chuckles awkwardly, clearly confused.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (covering)
dialog: Yeah, we’re so scary, I guess we
dialog: broke it. C’mon.
text: But Mike approaches the bed slowly, his smile fading. Mike
text: leans in and snaps his fingers right by the sim kid’s head.
text: The dummy shoots back into the air and screams.
text: Confused, Mike lifts the bed skirt to reveal a control panel.
text: We see a row of six gauges with a row down labeled “Easy,”
dialog: “Medium,” and “Hard.”
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It’s been tampered with.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Uh, I don’t think you should be
dialog: messing with that.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why are my settings...different?
text: Suddenly it dawns on Mike.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Mike, we should leave.
text: Mike looks at Sulley. Sulley looks cornered. Suddenly it
text: dawns on Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Did you do this?
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: DID YOU do this?
text: Sulley struggles then...
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (ashamed)
dialog: I...yes, I did, but you don’t
dialog: understand--
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why?! Why did you do this?
text: Mike’s face drops, his heart breaks.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: You know, just in case...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: In case of what?
text: Sulley lifts his head and looks at Mike. Suddenly
text: dawns on Mike.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t think I’m scary.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Mike...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: You said you believed in me....
dialog: (then, angry)
dialog: But you’re just like Hardscrabble.
dialog: You're just like everyone else.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Look, you'll get better and better-
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m as scary as you! I’m as scary
dialog: as anyone!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: I just wanted to help.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No, you just wanted to help
dialog: yourself!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Well, what was I supposed to do?
dialog: Let the whole team fail because you
dialog: don’t have it?!
dialog: 127.
dialog: it all
text: And just like that, Sulley’s said it. And Mike is thrown for
text: a second. Then his eye narrows, and he storms off.
text: As he does, REVEAL the misfits, who are standing just off the
text: stage. They saw the whole thing, and they look hurt/confused
dialog: /disappointed/angry.
dialog: 128.
text: While the others walk away, Squishy sets down the trophy and
text: shuffles off with them....
text: ON SULLEY as he tries to process how totally wrong
text: everything's gone. In what was supposed to be a triumphant
text: moment, he’s alone - confused, angry, frustrated....
scene_heading: INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB
text: Two door lab students walk by and reveal Mike leaning up

scene_heading: DOOR LAB STUDENT #1

text: As he passes students...
speaker_heading: STUDENTS
dialog: There he is! The big guy!/The
dialog: first of many trophies....
dialog: If this is everything Sulley wanted... he’s too out of it to
text: notice. He just moves past the students, numb, and glances
text: at his sad reflection in the trophy.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT
dialog: Sullivan!
text: Sulley looks up from the trophy to see Professor Knight.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR KNIGHT (CONT’D)
dialog: Nice work out there. I look

speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Hey, there he is!
text: REVEAL JOHNNY and the RORs, who walk up.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: You’re a ROR, buddy!
text: Sulley looks at Johnny, then past him... he sees Knight
text: talking to Dean Hardscrabble, at the entrance to the School
dialog: of Scaring.
text: A look of resolve comes over Sulley’s face - he knows what he
dialog: has to do.
text: He hands the jacket AND the trophy to Johnny and runs off....
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Hey! Where are you going-?
scene_heading: INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB
text: Mike stares at the door lab. Several students shut off the
text: light and come out of the lab.
text: Mike casually walks by them, grabbing one of their card keys.
text: Glancing around, he swipes the card. He waits for the green
text: light and opens the door, heading in.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL OF SCARING/QUAD
text: Sulley is in mid-confession to Hardscrabble and Knight.
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: You did what?
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: My team had nothing to do with it,
dialog: it was all me...I cheated.
text: Hardscrabble and Knight are stunned.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: I expect you off campus by
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Sulley hangs his head accepting his fate.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Yes ma‘am.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: You're a disgrace to this
dialog: University...and your family name.
text: Sulley is crushed.
text: Suddenly, an alarm sounds on campus.
text: A security guard is running by....
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Someone broke into the door lab!
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: What?!
text: Hardscrabble flies off immediately....
text: Sulley watches her fly towards the door tech building.
text: It dawns on Sulley...Mike.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Oh no...
scene_heading: INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB
text: Mike places a scream can in its station. He takes off his hat
text: and places it on a scream can as he faces off with the door.
dialog: 131.
text: He powers up the door.
text: In the background, we hear security guards trying to get in.
text: Mike has blocked the door with a cart full of scream cans.
scene_heading: SECURITY GUARDS
dialog: (walla)
dialog: Open the door!/Don’t go in
dialog: there!/It’s very dangerous!
text: He stands there, unflinching in front of the door. The light
text: turns on above the door and Mike turns the knob.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM —- NIGHT
text: In the human world, a closet door opens. Mike steps through
text: it and quietly shuts the door. He’s in the human world!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (big exhale)
text: He makes his silent, stealthy approach towards the bed,
text: building a scary mood.
text: The kid slowly sits up, sensing something....
text: Suddenly Mike leaps up and ROARS.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: ROAR! !
speaker_heading: KID #1
dialog: (gasp)
text: The kid stares at Mike. Mike roars again.
speaker_heading: MIKE
speaker_heading: ROAR!

speaker_heading: KID #1
dialog: You look funny.
text: ON MIKE, as he reacts, confused/disappointed/upset.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
text: Mike hears a COUGH offscreen.
dialog: 132.
text: The camera pulls out to reveal he’s in a cabin full of beds,
text: a kid bunked down in each one. A banner hangs on the wall,
dialog: reading, “Camp Teamwork.”
text: The other kids start to wake up. Groggily, they stare at
dialog: Mike.
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: (waking up walla)
dialog: What’s going on?/It’s the middle of
dialog: the night./He’s a little funny
dialog: green guy....
dialog: Mike is thrown - what should he do?
text: He takes a step back toward the closet door when he turns and
text: next to the closet is another kid. He freezes.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MIKE
speaker_heading: ROAR!
speaker_heading: KID #2
dialog: (playful, back at Mike)
speaker_heading: ROAR!
text: Mike gasps in disbelief.
text: The other kids in the cabin start to get closer. He's
dialog: trapped!
speaker_heading: CAMP KIDS
dialog: (walla)
dialog: What is that?/Hey, I was
dialog: sleeping./I wanna touch it./He’s so
dialog: cute!
scene_heading: INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB
text: Sulley runs through the hall and up to the door lab, where a
text: crowd of students is being held back by campus security.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: James!
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: No one goes near that door until
text: the authorities arrive.
dialog: 133.
text: Sulley moves to the front of the crowd near the misfits.
text: Inside the lab, Hardscrabble oversees additional security
text: personnel who are securing the door and investigating the
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: You don’t think that could be-
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: It’s Mike.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: But he could die out there!
text: Sulley tears down the “Caution Do Not Cross” tape.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY (CONT'D)
dialog: James, wait! We can help.
text: Don steps forward.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Leave it to the old, “Master of
dialog: Sales.”
text: ON Hardscrabble and the guards. They are talking in the door
text: tech lab when Don confidently strolls up to them.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: We've got a call in, but that’s the
dialog: best we can do---
text: Don taps one of them on the shoulder and they turn around
text: bewildered to see someone has crossed into the lab.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Ahem.
dialog: (turning on the charm)
dialog: Don Carton, sales. Folks, today is
dialog: your lucky day, how many times have
dialog: you asked yourself the following
dialog: question--
text: Hardscrabble stares at Don, not buying it.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: Arrest him.
text: Suddenly, two guards throttle Don against the wall.
dialog: 134.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Pardon?
dialog: (impact)
dialog: Ahhh!
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Spread ‘em, Pops!
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Do you mind?!
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Don’t move!
text: Sulley runs for the door.
text: When Sulley’s almost to the door, Hardscrabble spots him out
text: of the corner of her eye.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: What? Sullivan! Don't you dare!
text: He grabs the door handle....
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sullivan, don’t go in there!
text: Sulley quickly looks back toward Hardscrabble, ignores her
text: and slips through the door.
scene_heading: INT. CAMP TEAMWORK - NIGHT
text: Sulley creeps through the cabin, which is empty. Where is
dialog: Mike?
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Mike? Mike?
text: Sulley hears voices outside and crosses to a window. Some
text: camp counselors are gathered in front of one of the kids’
text: cabins, relating the events of the night to some park
text: rangers. The flashing lights of the ranger’s cruiser strobe
text: through the cabin.
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR
dialog: The kids are saying they saw
text: something in the cabin.
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR #2
dialog: They're calling it an alien.

speaker_heading: KID #1
dialog: It was!
speaker_heading: KID #2
dialog: I saw a little green guy!
text: Sulley hears a noise and looks over to see a broken screen.
text: He goes to the screen and whispers outside....
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Mike?
text: He climbs out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Sulley jumps down from the window.
text: A couple of rangers hear him and train their flashlights on
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (gasp)
dialog: Ah!
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: Bear! A bear in the camp!
text: Sulley takes off running, jumping down into a gully, evading
dialog: the lights.
text: Sulley sprints through the woods. He bursts through some
text: brush and comes to the edge of a lake.
text: He scans the lake but hears men yelling and ducks behind a
text: rack of canoes, seeing flashlights in the distance.
speaker_heading: RANGERS
dialog: (walla)
dialog: Down there, everybody over here...I
dialog: heard something over here.
text: Sulley hears a splash and turns to see Mike sitting at the
text: foot of the lake, staring at his reflection in the water.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (gasp then sigh of relief)
dialog: Mike!
text: Mike doesn’t look back.
dialog: 136.
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon buddy, let’s get you out of
dialog: here.
text: Mike still doesn’t look up.
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is all my fault...I’m sorry---
text: Mike continues to look down.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (depressed)
dialog: You were right, they weren’t scared
dialog: of me.
text: Sulley moves closer and looks down at Mike, silent.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I did everything right. I wanted
dialog: it more than anyone. And I
dialog: thought, I thought if I wanted it
dialog: enough, I could show everybody
dialog: that...
text: Mike stares at his reflection in the water.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: That Mike Wazowski is something
dialog: special, and I’m just...not.
text: He splashes it away.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Look Mike, I know how you feel---
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Don’t do that. Please don’t do
dialog: that. You DO NOT know how I feel.
text: Mike’s raises his voice, Sulley looks around cautiously.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Mike, calm down.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Monsters like you have everything.
dialog: You don’t have to be good, you can
dialog: mess up over and over again, and
dialog: the whole world loves you.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Mike-
dialog: 137.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You’1l never know what it’s like to
dialog: fail, because you were born a
dialog: Sullivan!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Yeah, I’m a Sullivan! I’m the
dialog: Sullivan who flunked every test,
dialog: the one who got kicked out of the
dialog: program. The one who was so afraid
dialog: to let everyone down, that I
dialog: cheated, and I lied.
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: Mike, I‘11 never know how you feel,
dialog: but you’re not the only failure
dialog: here.
text: Sulley’s shoulders drop, he sits down next to Mike.
speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I act scary Mike, but most of the
dialog: time...I’m terrified.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How come you never told me that
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Because...we weren’t friends
dialog: before.
text: Mike is stunned, at a loss for words.
text: Suddenly a flashlight grazes Sulley.
text: Sulley jumps back as the lights come toward him.
text: Mike hides behind a rock as he watches Sulley driven away.
text: Mike is in shock. Sulley looks back at Mike, they both don’t
text: know what to do. After a second, Sulley just takes off
dialog: running.
speaker_heading: RANGERS
dialog: (walla)
dialog: Over there...
text: Sulley runs through the darkness and right into an
scene_heading: EMBANKMENT.
text: He tries to climb the slippery side of the embankment but the
text: flashlights are getting closer.
dialog: 138.
text: Just as he is struggling, a tree limb is suddenly lowered
text: down next to him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sulley.
text: Sulley looks up - it’s Mike, at the top of the embankment.
dialog: Sulley’s surprised....
text: In the distance, the sound of humans is getting closer, and
text: we can make out flashlights in the trees.
text: Mike lowers the tree branch a little more, bracing his feet
text: against some rocks.
text: He pulls Sulley up over the edge. They take off back toward
dialog: the cabin.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: The rangers are surrounding the cabin.
text: Mike and Sulley see an opening and sprint toward the cabin.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: The guys burst into the cabin, run to the closet door and
dialog: throw it open!
text: REVEAL: Just a closet full of camping supplies. No monster
dialog: world.
text: ON MIKE AND SULLEY, who react, dismayed.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No...
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL OF DOOR TECHNOLOGY
text: The door powers down.
text: The door lab is crawling with campus security. Dean
text: Hardscrabble stands beside the door station, a finger on the

text: Oozma Kappa is being held back by security.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: They're still in there!
dialog: 139.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Until the authorities arrive, this

text: The misfits react. Hardscrabble has just delivered a death
dialog: sentence.
speaker_heading: SQUISHY
dialog: NO! You can’t do that!
text: Squishy breaks the line, tearfully charging for his friends,
text: but he’s held back with ease by security.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE

speaker_heading: MISFITS

text: The lab doors are slammed shut.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Mike and Sulley are panicked. Mike closes the door, then
text: quickly opens it, but again, nothing.
text: Mike and Sulley hear the humans outside getting closer.
text: They run to the cabin window and see that a group of rangers
text: has arrived. They approach the cabin, shining flashlights.
text: Sulley runs away.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: We've gotta get out of here.
text: Mike gets an idea.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Let them come!
dialog: 140.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: What?
text: Sulley looks at Mike, confused.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: If we scare them, I mean really
dialog: scare them...we could generate
text: enough scream to power the door
dialog: from this side.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: What are you talking about?!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I have read every book about
dialog: scaring ever written. This could
dialog: work!
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: They're ADULTS! I can’t do this!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yes you can, just follow my lead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ON THE DOOR to the cabin. The doorknob turns, then rangers
text: pour in, flashlights pointing into the darkness.
text: They jump as a fan turns on suddenly, then slows to a stop.
text: The window drapes flutter, as if someone has just touched
dialog: them.
text: The rangers proceed farther into the cabin.
text: Up in the rafters, Sulley and Mike nod at each other. Mike
text: counts down silently as they get ready for their next action.
text: BAM! The front door of the cabin slams shut behind the
dialog: rangers.
text: The rangers hear music. They spin around and see a record
text: player, playing a record backward.
text: They hear another sound and turn their flashlights on a doll
text: walking across the cabin.
speaker_heading: DOLL
dialog: Ma-ma. Ma-ma.
text: The doll walks into a bed post and falls down.

speaker_heading: DOLL (CONT'D)
dialog: (warbled)
dialog: Ma-ma. Ma-ma...
text: They see a dark shadow run across the floor behind them.
dialog: It’s Mike.
text: Sulley reaches down behind the rangers and scrapes the floor
text: with his claws. The rangers turn in time to see the claw
text: marks on the floor.
text: They hear something in the rafters. Shining their
text: flashlights in that direction they see more claw marks on the
text: walls all around them.
text: They hear a deep, low growl as something short and round
text: scurries across the floor.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (growl)
speaker_heading: RANGER
dialog: What the-
speaker_heading: RANGERS
dialog: (gasp)

scene_heading: INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB

text: Hardscrabble approaches Mike and Sulley.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE

speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: Mike, I don’t know a single scarer
dialog: who can do what you do. I know
dialog: everyone sees us together, they
dialog: think I’m the one running the show,
dialog: but the truth is I’ve been riding
dialog: YOUR coattails since day one. You
dialog: made the deal with Hardscrabble,
dialog: you took a hopeless team and made
dialog: them champions. All I did was
dialog: catch a pig.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Technically, I caught the pig.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: EXACTLY! And you think you’re just

speaker_heading: SULLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: And if Hardscrabble can’t see that,
dialog: then she can just--
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: I can just what?
text: Sulley turns around, shocked to see Dean Hardscrabble flying
text: down behind him.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Careful, Mr. Sullivan, I was just
dialog: warming up to you.
text: Sulley looks down awkwardly.
speaker_heading: SULLEY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE
dialog: Well gentlemen, it seems you made
dialog: the front page again....
text: Mike looks at the picture, smiles sheepishly.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: The two of you did something

dialog: “surprises” like you in my program.
text: It’s good to hear, but a little late.
speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
dialog: But as far as the two of you are

dialog: wish you luck.

speaker_heading: HARDSCRABBLE (CONT'D)
