scene_heading: EXT. WIDE AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: At first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an
text: endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums
text: beating in the distance coming from some unknown place.
dialog: 
text: The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly:
text: the white disc goes through a rapid series of color
text: transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible
text: BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT.
dialog: 
text: The sky echoes with THUNDER.
dialog: 
text: We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush
text: stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with
text: each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.
dialog: 
text: Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning
text: blood-red savanna.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: I's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It
text: buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's
text: almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY
dialog: 
text: There are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN,
text: a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and
text: reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A
text: Guide to Survival In The City." A few rows forward, near the
text: open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.
text: He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed
text: things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows
text: indicating the directions of movement.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks
text: the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with
text: sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture
text: that's habitual to her in moments of stress.
dialog: 
text: There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She
text: looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily,
text: leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
text: Clear-air turbulence, is all. Nothing
speaker_heading: SERIOUS
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: But nothing you'd want to toss a
dialog: third-down pass through either --
text: (Grinning back at
speaker_heading: FLASH)
dialog: Can I have an autograph for my kid,
dialog: Mr. Gordon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Sure -- my pleasure.
dialog: 
text: As FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane
text: takes another jolt, even more violent than the first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Wow. Call Westchester Approach, see
dialog: what they've got.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: I sure hope we don't have to turn
dialog: back. I mean this is first day of
dialog: training camp, I wouldn't want to be
speaker_heading: LATE --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Seat-belt time.
dialog: 
text: FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders
text: violently. He holds on, calls up front:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Maybe it'd be smoother if you went
speaker_heading: HIGHER --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Will you SHUT UP?
dialog: (as FLASH's head
speaker_heading: SWIVELS)
dialog: Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have
dialog: their hands full -- just let 'em
dialog: drive.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: (DALE, FLASH)
dialog: 
text: The plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of
text: the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to
text: her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it
dialog: to her.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: When you're nervous, it can help to
dialog: chew on something
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Thanks a lot -- I look dumb enough
dialog: to take candy from a stranger?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: I'm not a stranger exactly -- You
dialog: know my name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Who doesn't. Number one draft pick,
dialog: cover of PEOPLE mag -- what'd the
dialog: GIANTS sign you for, eighty-nine
dialog: million? Big deal!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: God, I hate flying -- I'm Dale Arden
dialog: it's crazy of me to hate flying --
dialog: I'm a travel agent, you see? -- I've
dialog: just been checking out a little hotel
dialog: in Vermont -- can I still have that
dialog: candy bar?
dialog: (and in the same breath)
dialog: Are we going backward?

speaker_heading: FLASH

speaker_heading: DALE (GASP)
dialog: Holy cow! Look at the clouds!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - POV FROM PLANE WINDOW - DAY
dialog: 
text: The pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to
text: surround the airplane. Over the engines we HEAR that same
text: ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening. Slowly
text: and terrifyingly, the sun starts turning BLOOD RED. The clouds
text: race faster, faster, until they are actually streaming past
text: the plane from behind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - DAY
dialog: 
text: FLASH and DALE -- faces bathed in the eerie light. Speechless-
text: DALE grasps the football player's hand with all her strength.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. A FANTASTIC GREENHOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: It is a huge and rambling, antique, standing in semiruinous
text: isolation in a pretty country landscape. The sun has turned
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
text: the SAME BLOOD RED we saw from the airplane, and clouds race
text: across it with unnatural velocity.
dialog: 
text: In the center of the greenhouse rises a glass-paned tower
text: through which we glimpse something MIRROR BRIGHT. Floating
text: high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium-
text: filled balloons, secured by wires. As we move closer, we
text: discern a MAN moving about actively on a platform inside the
text: central tower, about half-way up:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREENHOUSE TOWER - DAY
speaker_heading: (MUNSON, TV NEWSMAN, ZARKOV)
dialog: 
text: The man is DR. HANS ZARKOV: big, bearded, feverish looking
text: and seemingly half mad with exhaustion. In striking contrast
text: to the antique greenhouse exterior, here there are all kinds
text: of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash
text: fashion. Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and
text: dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view. As
text: Zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a
text: grim-voiced TV. NEWSMAN is appearing and speaking from a
text: good-sized television screen above the main control console:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TV NEWSMAN
dialog: The extraordinary weather disturbances
dialog: reported from Africa this morning
dialog: are now crossing the Atlantic, and
dialog: are expected to reach the East Coast
dialog: of the United States by noon.
dialog: According to scientists at NASA, the
text: Earth is being struck by an immense
dialog: stream of cosmic energy, apparently
dialog: the result of some catastrophic
dialog: stellar accident beyond the reaches
dialog: OF --
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV whirls, slams the TV SOUND OFF and yells at the
text: silently mouthing NEWSMAN on the screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Fools! Can't you understand? This
dialog: is no accident-- it's an ATTACK! An
dialog: attack planned by a MIND! This is
speaker_heading: ATTACK!
dialog: 
text: MUNSON, a scared looking assistant, comes running up the
text: stairs with a computer print-out sheet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNSON
dialog: Dr. Zarkov! Look at the report from
dialog: the last balloon!
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV grabs it, eyes it.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: I predicted it, didn't I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNSON
dialog: Yes, sir -- you sure did. And this
dialog: funny sun too ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
text: Ozone layer starting to crack up.
dialog: By tonight Carbon dioxide will be
dialog: combining with free nitrogen to form --
text: (breaks off, crumpling
speaker_heading: THE SHEET)
dialog: Well, this is it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNSON
text: Sir, the President is on the TV behind
dialog: YOU --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: What the hell do I care? I tried to
dialog: warn him -- he called me mad, like
dialog: all the others.
dialog: 
text: BOOM! The TV screen EXPLODES in a fine shower of glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV (CONT'D)
dialog: Time for us to go, Munson. Get your
dialog: toothbrush and whatever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNSON
dialog: Go where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
text: Up. Up and at him.
dialog: 
text: Stunned, MUNSON turns his head and glances at something big
text: and MIRROR BRIGHT gleaming behind foliage in center of tower.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNSON
dialog: You're crazy!
dialog: 
text: Perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes,
text: ZARKOV pulls out a revolver and points it at MUNSON.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: I can't handle the capsule alone get
dialog: your toothbrush.

scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT TO SKY - POV
speaker_heading: (CO-PILOT, PILOT)
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: What's ,e word from Westchester
dialog: Approach, Bill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
text: Zip. All chanels dead.
dialog: (Reacting to the panel)
dialog: Say, get a load of the VOR's....
dialog: 
text: The directional needles are going crazy. All the instruments
text: are going crazy. Displays flash impossible symbols. The
text: PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the
text: sky and swallows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT
text: On the left, about six o'clock
dialog: high......
dialog: 
text: The racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some
text: surreal painting. From the cortex LASER-like bolts of RED
text: LIGHTNING shoot out. Like a missile, one zaps right over the
text: plane's nose with a horrible crackling NOISE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on tight, let's put baby down
dialog: right here......
dialog: 
text: The CO-PILOT reaches up and hits the flap control. There is
text: a whooshing crackling ZAP! The whole cockpit FLARES OUT
text: with an intolerable blinding flash of RED LIGHT.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PASSENGER CABIN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The cockpit door flys off its hinges, admitting a gale of
text: wind that scatters FLASH'S play sheets like autumn leaves.
text: FLASH unsnaps his belt, leaps up and races forward.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: (DALE, FLASH)
dialog: 
text: The TWO PILOTS are gone, vanished without trace. Wind from
text: the shattered windows assaults FLASH as he charges in. He
text: stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. Recovering
text: he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the
text: bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals.
text: DALE lurches in against the tornado.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Can you fly it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: I can fly all right -- I've had a
dialog: couple of lessons! -- just don't if

speaker_heading: FLASH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (FIGHTING CONTROLS)
dialog: Grab that other wheel! Help me pull
dialog: her up!
dialog: 
text: DALE staggers into the co-pilot's seat, pulls back on the
text: wheel in front of her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Oh boy! Ever hear about the man who
dialog: fell ninety stories from a window
dialog: and didn't break a bone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: No but I'd sure like to! How'd The
dialog: man fall ninety stories didn't break

scene_heading: SHOOTING FORWARD - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDSHIELD
dialog: 
text: The Earth is approaching fast, wheeling and tilting. We get

scene_heading: EXT. ZARKOV'S GREENHOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: (ZARKOV'S VOICE)
dialog: 
text: Its thousands of panes reflect the RED SUN and the RED BOLTS
text: which rain down in intermittent bursts. One strikes an end
text: of a gallery, exploding glass and foliage. From inside, we
text: HEAR a furious echoing VOICE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV'S VOICE
dialog: I see you, Munson! Come out or I
dialog: shoot!
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: (MUNSON, ZARKOV)
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his
text: revolver. MUNSON emerges from some dry brown bush where he
dialog: was hiding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNSON
dialog: So what's it matter if I'm shot or
dialog: go up in that thing? I'm a goner
dialog: either way, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Of course -- I admit that! But this
dialog: way you'll be giving your life for a
dialog: chance of saving Earth! Haven't you
dialog: any spirit at all??
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNSON
dialog: Goodbye, Doctor -- they were all
dialog: right about you. Have a nice trip.
dialog: 
text: MUNSON starts walking away, toward the door at the end of
text: the long side wing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: I tell you I can't take it off alone!
dialog: If you won't come, who will I find?
dialog: 
dialog: If you woo't come, who will I find:
dialog: 
text: MUNSON ignores him totally, keeps walking away. ZARKOV lifts
text: his revolver and draws a bead on the man's back. Just as he
text: is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GREENHOUSE
dialog: 
text: Amazingly, a Twin Otter is gliding in to a horribly rough
text: landing in the field outside. The plane hits on one wheel,
text: bounces into the air, comes down again and keeps right on
text: rolling toward the greenhouse.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AS ABOVE - FEATURE MUNSON
dialog: 
text: SEEING the onrushing plane, freezing an instant then starting

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT - DAY
speaker_heading: (DALE, FLASH)
dialog: 
text: Crazily angled, filled with dust and smoke. Dazed, blood on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Dale! Are you all right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I'm terrific.
speaker_heading: (WEAK SMILE)
dialog: Flash Gordon, you have just made me
dialog: a Giant fan for life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Come on -- let's get out before she

dialog:

text: the emergency exit in the cockpit area.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)
dialog: 
text: FLASH lowers DALE to the ground, jumps down after her. ZARKOV
text: is there, smiling at them in a strange way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Hello. i'm Flash Gordon, this is
dialog: Miss Dale Arden --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
speaker_heading: (MEANS IT)
dialog: Delighted to see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: This crazy storm knocked us down
dialog: could we use a phone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Certainly. Just follow me -- up those
dialog: stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Some weather huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: It will get worse.
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the
text: tower stairs. SUddenly DALE stops short, staring at ZARKOV
text: with a funny expression.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You're Dr. Hans Zarkov!
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV hesitates just an instant, the nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: How did you know?
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I saw you in PEOPLE mag. After you
dialog: left NASA, remember? It said you

dialog: 
text: DALE breaks off, almost biting her tongue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Insane? Off my rocker?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: I forget what it said:
speaker_heading: (TURNING HASTILY)
dialog: Flash, let's find some other phone,
dialog: okay? I'm sure Dr. Zarkov is very
dialog: busy.......
dialog: 
text: FLASH is baffled, but he gets her urgent look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Well, all right -- but it seems to
dialog: me we ought to --
dialog: 
text: Now it's FLASH'S turn to break off. ZARKOV is pointing a
text: gun at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Up the stairs to the tower! Ahead
dialog: of me -- quick! --
text: (as they gape at him,
speaker_heading: FROZEN)
dialog: Quick I said: We haven't much time --
dialog: Earth is being attacked! -- there's
dialog: only one slim chance of saving it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Mister, you are insane!
dialog: 
text: HOWL of ether-wind increases. Storm of RED LASER BOLTS. Glass
text: showers them as parts of the green house EXPLODE and dry
text: foliage bursts into FLAME.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Up the stairs -- RUN!
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV jabs the revolver into DALE'S back. RED BOLTS zap
text: around. FLASH whispers to her as they start running up ahead
speaker_heading: of ZARKOV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Go with the flow -- wait for a chance!
dialog: 
text: Below them, bottom of staircase disintergrates in a RED FLASH.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TOP LEVEL OF GREENHOUSE TOWER
speaker_heading: (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV rips away a screen of foliage, revealing a MIRROR
text: BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door. He yanks that
dialog: open.
dialog: 
text: On every side things are blowing up and burning under the
text: merciless rain of bolts. One strikes the capsule head on,
text: but does not even leave a mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: I need your help to take off! Get
dialog: in or I shot you dead!
dialog: 
text: DALE gasps and shrinks back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Take off for where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: God only knows -- whatever black
dialog: corner of space this is coming from --
dialog: wherever HE is!. -- we'll plunge
dialog: into the devil's heart and destroy
dialog: him! We'll die ourselves, of course,
dialog: but our names will be honored till
dialog: the end of time!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Look, Doc -- I don't book kamikaze
dialog: tours -- never.
dialog: 
text: FLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off-
text: balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPSULE
speaker_heading: (DALE, ZARKOV)
dialog: 
text: It is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only
text: on the exterior. There are some controls and displays, but
dialog: in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed
text: from conventional spacecraft as ZARKOV's solitary genius is
dialog: from everyday science.
dialog: 
text: Immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity,
text: ZARKOV waves the gun at FLASH.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Sit down there! Foot on the red pedal!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Flash! Sack him!
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV wheels and pulls the door shut. FLASH jumps him. He
text: punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the
text: well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again.
text: Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch.
dialog: 
text: The capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out
text: through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself
text: was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's
text: left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those
text: LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy.
dialog: 
text: FLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms
text: around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly
text: increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster
text: and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back
text: against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh.
dialog: 
text: We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part
text: of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted
text: by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving
text: as he speaks with enormous effort:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV,
dialog: Friendship...Built this to send to
dialog: them in...Friendship...The end
dialog: now...End of the world....Unless we

dialog: 
text: An AMBER GLOW bathes them, and soon we see its source. A

dialog: 
text: It races through them. A shadow passes over MONGO as the
text: CAPSULE passes through a wall of PURPLE VAPOR and emerges
text: above a totally different landscape. A dozen VARIOUS COLORED
text: CLOUDS sweep past in silent majesty.
dialog: 
text: The CAPSULE slows, hovers starts straight down into a sea of
text: high grass.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MONGO -- GRASSY AREA - EVENING
dialog: 
text: In the distant B.G. against an extraordinary SUNSET SKY,
text: rises the shimmering CITY OF MONGO.... a place of many levels,
text: golden tiers and turrets, towers, flags and pennants. It is
text: like something dreamed.
dialog: 
text: Several STRANGELY ARMORED MEN watch the MIRROR-BRIGHT CAPSULE
text: descending slowly. The LEADER waves and they all start toward
text: the CAPSULE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAPSULE
speaker_heading: (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)
dialog: 
text: Gentle bump as the thing touches down.
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: By God, we did it! We made it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Made it where, Doctor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly DALE gasps, reacting to something she SEES through
text: the transparent-from-within wall. They all look around and
text: SEE those STRANGE MEN approaching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Don't. Suddenly I like it in here
dialog: just fine --
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRASSY AREA - DAY
scene_heading: (ARMORED MEN, FLASH, LEADER, ZARKOV)
dialog: 
text: The door of the CAPSULE is opened from the inside. ZARKOV
text: and DALE and FLASH get out. THE MEN stop. Long beat as the
text: two parties gaze at each other, the first human eye ever to
text: see an extraterrestrial being. FLASH walks up to the leader.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Hello -- my name's Flash Gordon --
dialog: can you understand me?
speaker_heading: (SILENCE)
dialog: We're from EARTH -- we come as
dialog: friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
speaker_heading: (URGENT)
dialog: Extend your hand! That's the gesture
dialog: of friendship known everywhere!
dialog: 
text: With a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Hi!
dialog: 
text: CLACK! With lightning speed a manacle is slammed on FLASH'S
text: wrist and he is thrown to ·the ground as other RED MEN advance
text: to handcuff DALE and ZARKOV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: You are prisoners. I will take you
dialog: now to Ming the Merciless, Ruler of
dialog: the universe!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARMORED MEN
speaker_heading: (CHORUS)
dialog: Hail, Ming!
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
text: Groggily, FLASH lifts his head towards ZARKOV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Thanks, Doctor -- next time I'll
dialog: call my own play.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRASSY AREA - POV THROUGH OPENING
speaker_heading: (DALE, FLASH)
dialog: 
text: Another strange glimpse through an opening. Some fierce
text: tethered BEAST is being goaded and tormented by MONGO MEN,
text: as in an Elizabethan bear-baiting. On the floor lies the
text: tor n body of one MAN who apparently got too close.
dialog: 
text: DALE has one brief horrified GLIMPSE of this, then turns her
text: head away and shuts her eyes as she's marched along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Just do what I'm doing. Flash --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Shutting my eyes -- dreaming I booked
dialog: us to Disneyland.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN PALACE HALL
speaker_heading: (ARMORED MEN)
dialog: 
text: A gigantic STATUE comes into view amidst topless columns at
text: the end. Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns. As
dialog: we come nearer, we SEE that this STATUE is cut out in the
text: middle to form a throne.
dialog: 
text: MING THE MERCILESS sits in the throne niche, silent, gazing
text: down on the PRISONERS as they are marched to a halt before
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARMORED MEN
dialog: Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without
dialog: Mercy!
dialog: 
text: A hundred reduplicated ECHOES of that shout ring through
text: unseen reaches of the palace. MING bends his head slightly
text: in acknowledgement, points idly at the ARMORED MEN at the
dialog: left of the group.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PALACE OF HALLS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES
scene_heading: (ARMORED MAN, AURA, DALE, FLASH, KLYTUS, LEADER, MING, VOICES,
speaker_heading: ZARKOV)
dialog: 
text: As FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED
text: MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
text: bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable
dialog: dimension.
dialog: 
text: We pass an archway opening into what seems to be an AMUSEME-
text: NT ARCADE. Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic
text: games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to
text: unearthly music.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Fantastic -- into a Black Hole and
dialog: out the other side -- to this. Who
dialog: said Hans Zarkov was mad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You're mad.
dialog: 
text: Look down over a balcony from a MOVING POV. A fencing glass
text: is in session. SIX PAIRS OF MEN go at each other with magic
text: swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the
text: blades clash. Thrust, parry, SLASH! The head of one duellist
text: EXPLODES in a bloodless fountain of fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: You got us into this -- HOW DO WE
dialog: GET OUT?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Get out? Why? We're being taken to
dialog: Ming -- getting at him is our only
dialog: hope of saving EARTH. It's perfect!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Dr. Zarkov, I'm about to show you
dialog: what it feels like to be clipped by
dialog: a New York Giant --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Flash, it's no use - he's too crazy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: Step forward, Soldier.
dialog: 
text: The designated one marches two paces forward, halts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you loyal to Ming? Would you
dialog: die for him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARMORED MAN
dialog: Gladly!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: Fall on your sword.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
text: Instantly the ARMORED MAN pulls his sword, rips open his
text: breast-plate, sets the sword hilt-down on the floor and
text: PLUNGES FORWARD on to the fatal point.
dialog: 
text: With a little cry of horror, DALE shrinks back into FLASH'S
dialog: arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: You inhuman fiend!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: Of course I'm "inhuman"! -- that's a
dialog: compliment!
dialog: (Dropping his voice)
text: Pathetic Earthlings, forever wondering
dialog: if you are alone in the universe --
dialog: beaming you plaintive messages into
dialog: to the void for anything that might
dialog: hear you -- even hurling your bodies
dialog: out into it -- and all without the
dialog: faintest inkling of who or what is
dialog: out here. If you had known anything --
dialog: anything at all about the true nature
dialog: of the universe, you would have hidden
dialog: from it, in terror!
dialog: 
text: There is a low throaty LAUGH from the shadows. FLASH and
text: DALE turn their eyes quickly in its direction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FEATURE PRINCESS AURA
dialog: 
text: Emerging half into the light beside a column, fondling the
text: head of an obscure BEAST slouching between her legs.
text: Voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, AURA looks
text: FLASH boldly up and down as the BEAST HISSES with the pleasure
dialog: of her touch.
dialog: 
text: FLASH can't take his eyes off her. No normal man could. FLASH
text: swallows with a dry throat as AURA'S gaze devours him. DALE
text: gets the electricity going on, gives him a poke and WHISPERS
speaker_heading: LOUDLY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Watch it, fella -- you came with me!
dialog: 
text: AURA laughs again, sidles up toward MING. We dimly SEE a
text: couple of MUTANT CREATURES dragging away the lifeless body
dialog: of the one who so vividly proved his loyalty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: You know who Ming is now -- who are
dialog: you and why do you come to Mongo?
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: I'm Flash Gordon of the New York
dialog: Giants this is Dale Arden -- Dr.Zarkov
dialog: hijacked us in an effort to save
speaker_heading: EARTH.
dialog: 
text: MING looks questioningly at KLYTUS
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KLYTUS
dialog: Sirs, Earth is the meaningless planet
dialog: you are in the process of
dialog: obliterating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: (pouncing on that)
dialog: In the process? You mean Earth still
dialog: exists?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: For the moment -- not for much longer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: But why? What in hell have we ever
dialog: done to hurt you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: You exist -- and yet you pay no homage
dialog: to Ming! What greater crime can be
dialog: committed?
dialog: 
text: The palace rings with an answering chorus: VOICES of all the
text: ARMORED MEN and numerous others presently UNSEEN, including
speaker_heading: many WOMEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without
dialog: Mercy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: Come closer, Dale Arden -- let me
dialog: see you.
dialog: 
text: DALE doesn't move. MING takes a step down, narrows his eyes
text: and gazes at her intensely. This guy's personal magnetism
text: is enormous. As if irresistibly drawn, DALE steps forward.
dialog: 
text: MING moves his hand in a gesture. A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT
text: bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard. DALE's lips
text: open slightly, her color heightens, her rate of breathing
text: increases. MING touches her flesh lightly.
dialog: 
text: FLASH tense, ready to spring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KLYTUS
dialog: This woman will amuse you.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
speaker_heading: (INTERESTED)
dialog: Klytus can see the future, eh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: He can foresee it -- but for a few
text: moments only. It gives him a unique
dialog: gift for survival, -- and treachery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Extraordinary. I'd like to study
dialog: his beta factors -- I wager I could
dialog: extend them with a course of
text: telekinetic exercise.
speaker_heading: (peering at KLYTUS)
dialog: Tell me -- when you use this fit
dialog: does your temporal lobe prickle?
dialog: Here?
dialog: 
text: MING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses
text: the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: Chain this one up. Preserve him for
dialog: further examination.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Hail, Ming!
dialog: 
text: ZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily
text: as they drag the scientist away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Oh no you don't! We came together
dialog: and we're STAYING together!
dialog: 
text: Languidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: That one is useless to us. Remove
dialog: him and kill him.
dialog: 
text: Shock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in
text: front of her friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: You dirty old bastard can kill me
dialog: too!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE ANGLE - AURA
dialog: 
text: Wetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING:
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him
dialog: to me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
speaker_heading: (EYEBROWS UP)
dialog: What would your Prince Barin say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: I can handle Barin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: Really, Aura -- your appetites are
dialog: too monstrous -- even for our family.
dialog: This could cause great trouble with
dialog: Barin -- I must forbid it.
dialog: 
text: AURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she
speaker_heading: WHISPERS AGAIN:

speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: But you adore me, Father -- you ca

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER SHOT
dialog:

text: and indicates DALE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: Take the Earth-woman to our quarters!
dialog: Bathe and annoint her for our
dialog: pleasure!
dialog: 
text: A HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE.
dialog: 
text: FLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it
text: DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she
text: flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city-
text: girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own
dialog: prowess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: My God -- and I thought that book
dialog: was another rip-off-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Watch out! Behind you!
dialog: 
text: Three more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards
speaker_heading: DALE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUICK ANGLES
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
text: FLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one.
text: He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it
text: quickly to knock cold the other two.
dialog: 
text: AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs
text: her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth.
dialog: 
text: Panting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised
dialog: mace.
dialog: 
text: Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the
text: Cavernous space above.
dialog: 
text: To its tempo MING'S PERSONAL GUARDS now starts· appearing.
text: They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing
dialog: thing is that they all have the SAME FACE.
dialog: 
text: From left to right, back and front, the AMAZONS advance 0n
text: FLASH and DALE. They do not attack, merely stun ad overwhelm
text: us with their massive, silent, answerable threat.
dialog: 
text: FLASH swallows, looks this way and that, stands as if
text: paralysed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: (low and tremulous)
dialog: What's the play, Flash?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: I can't -- I just can't --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Can't what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Clobber a woman, Dale --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
speaker_heading: (OUTBURST)
dialog: You damn fool, those aren't women
dialog: they're murderous AMAZON DYKES!
dialog: 
text: The AMAZONS are all around DALE now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Help!!
dialog: 
text: FLASH is paralyzed by indecision one beat more, then suddenly
text: makes up his mind. He flies into action, SLAMS the nearest
text: pair of AMAZONS.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PALACE - FIGHT SEQUENCE
speaker_heading: (DALE)
dialog: 
text: Fast and furious. Great havoc is wreaked by DALE and her
text: karate, by FLASH and his flailing fists, but the AMAZONS'
dialog: numerical superiority is of course decisive.
dialog: 
text: Soon FLASH is on the floor, pinioned by a dozen AMAZONS.
dialog: 
text: He looks up, with despairing eyes SEES poor DALE being dragged
text: up a flight of stairs that disappear mysteriously into upper
dialog: gloom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DALE
dialog: Flash!!
dialog: 
text: The pitiful shout sends FLASH'S adrenaline rushing. With a
text: superhuman effort, he fights free from the pile-up and dashes
text: after DALE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PALACE - ON THE STAIRCASE
dialog: 
text: FLASH struggles to get through to DALE.
dialog: 
text: DALE claws fiercely at the bare AMAZON arms and shoulders
text: that engulf her, reaches desperately back down for FLASH.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THEIR HANDS
dialog: 
text: Just touching their fingertips.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - A STEP OF THE STAIRS
dialog: 
text: Opens like a yawning trap door UNDER FLASH'S FEET.
dialog: 
text: FLASH drops away with a YELL, in the very instant that AURA
text: comes running INTO THE SHOT and boldly JUMPS after him.
text: AURA is swallowed up too, a split-second before the trap
text: door step CLOSES again after them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PALACE - CU-MING
speaker_heading: (KLYTUS, MING)
dialog:

speaker_heading: KLYTUS
dialog: She betrays you! She'll take him to
dialog: Aboria!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: So Prince Barin will kill Flash Gordon
dialog: for me -- I don't care.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KLYTUS
dialog: Don't be too sure!
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
text: MING glances at him, then back up the stairs at where DALE
text: has vanished. His face softens, his tone turns museful!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: I haven't taken a wife in centuries.
dialog: I could bring myself to marry this
dialog: Dale Arden --
speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: What do you see in her future, Klytus?
dialog: 
text: NO reply. MING turns his head and finds that KLYTUS is gone.
text: Vanished. Not particularly surprised or concerned, MING gazes
text: again toward the top of the stairs and answers his own
text: question with a licentious smile.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. A DARK METALLIC SHAFT - SHOOTING DOWN IT
speaker_heading: (AURA, FLASH)
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: Take a deep breath! Grab my ankle
dialog: after we hit the water -- I'll lead
dialog: you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Hit what water?
dialog: 
text: In answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER (TANK)
dialog: 
text: FLASH plummets down, AURA right after him. Recovering balance
text: in a universe of bubbles, FLASH finds himself confronting an
text: enormous savage LUMINOUS FISH. Wheeling himself away in
text: fear and revulsion, FLASH encounters AURA. He seizes her
text: ankle as directed. Holding his beat, FLASH swims after her
text: through a maze of stalagmites growing up from the cavern
text: floor. AURA dives down, leads him OUT OF SIGHT through a low
dialog: opening.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GROTTO
speaker_heading: (AURA, FLASH, PLASH)
dialog: 
text: FLASH and AURA emerge from a pool of water. FLASH staggers
text: across and collapses on a fringe of beach. For sure, AURA'S

text: stares at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: Catch your breath -- then I'll take
dialog: you up and find you a disguise.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: You're saving my life. How can I
dialog: Thank you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: I'll fly you to the forest of Arboria -
dialog: we'll find a way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Let's get one thing straight -- I've
dialog: got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov
dialog: too -- rescue them and try to save
dialog: Earth too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: Do you realize how foolish you are
dialog: to tell that to me -- Ming's daughter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: I'm no good at lying.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: WHAT HE SEES - PLASMA CAVERN
dialog: 
text: An infernal place, chief feature of which is a LAKE OF
text: SEETHING MAGMA that slowly rotates within a wide encircling

text: who toil in rythmic unison.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH (O.S.)
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA (O.S.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The slaves are Lizard Men. Once they

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: You can't reach him. If a soldier

speaker_heading: MING
dialog: I am forcing this plasma through the
dialog: successive nuclear phases of a star -

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZARKOV
dialog: Devil! Why don't you turn this science
dialog: to peaceful use? The name Ming would
dialog: be blessed instead of cursed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MING
dialog: Bring him up to the dome, Soldiers --
dialog: we wish to show him wonders.
dialog: 
text: At that instant a couple of worn-out SLAVES are pitched into

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Listen, where's he got Dale?
dialog: 
text: As she looks at him, she SEES a detachment of SOLDIERS

speaker_heading: AURA
dialog: Forget Dale Arden!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: I can't! I mean I hardly know her,
speaker_heading: BUT --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AURA

speaker_heading: FLASH

dialog: 
text: ZARKOV stands before MING in chains, mesmerized by fantastic

dialog: And as it will be in yet another
