scene_heading: INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: A billowy white screen. An alarm clock BLARES. As MAIN TITLES
text: BEGIN, the lovely sleeping face of RACHEL KELLY rolls into frame.
text: Then out of it. Alarm keeps BLASTING. Back she comes, pulling the
text: sheets OVER her head. Motionless now, as we hear...
text: ... the DEAFENING SILENCE of the alarm shutting off. A beat.
text: Rachel SITS BOLTS UPRIGHT. LEAPS out of the room. From the back
text: we see that she's dressed only in a pair of men's boxers.
text: She makes it halfway down the hall, does a U TURN back into the
text: bedroom, frantically YANKS a robe hanging from the door, taking the
text: wall hook WITH her. She FLINGS her robe on as she RUNS down the
text: hall, wall hook STICKING OUT of her back. BURSTING INTO...
scene_heading: INT. BEN'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ben! You overslept again damn it!
text: The room looks like a 6 (but I'm almost 7) year old exploded.
text: Posters of MAGICIANS on all the walls. Rachel darts about the room
text: mismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Get Up Get Up Get Up!
text: The LUMP under the cover doesn't move.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ben you're late. I'm serious. I'm
dialog: wearing a very serious face. Don't
dialog: make me start counting ONE...
text: No movement. Rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair,
text: and out comes a magician's bouquet of FLOWERS.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
speaker_heading: TWO.
text: She pulls a dirty handkerchief out of the pocket of the shirt --
text: it's an endless MAGICIAN'S HANDKERCHIEF.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't make me say three I'm about to
dialog: say three.
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: Three!
text: She RIPS the covers off and a blow-up DINOSAUR sleeps in Ben's
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ben I'm not kidding around. You make
dialog: yourself appear this instant!
text: A WHITE BUNNY saunters across her toes. Rachel SCREAMS -- then
text: gathers her wits and searches under the bed -- under the bureau --
text: she opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You might think this is funny but this
dialog: is actually NOT funny.
text: Unseen by Rachel, six-year-old BEN sits, perched on the highest
text: closet shelf, knees under his chin, holding his breath. His eyes
text: gleeful as Rachel frantically closes the closet door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING
text: Rachel hops over the Bunny, navigates through strewn toys and books
text: STUBBING her baby toe. She limps in agony past a big picture of
text: the kids with their daddy and heads towards a door with a KEEP OUT
text: EVERYONE! sign.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: ANNABELLE! WAKE UP!
scene_heading: ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: ANNABELLE, 10 years old, sits on the edge of her bed, fuming, all
text: of her limbs crossed. She holds up a filthy purple tee shirt.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You forgot to wash my purple shirt. I
dialog: told you a hundred times it was Purple
dialog: Day at school today.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I didn't forget. I was up all night
dialog: thinking about it and I concluded you're
dialog: too special to look like everyone else.
text: (she grabs an orangey
dialog: red tee shirt)
dialog: Orange Red. That's your color. Few
dialog: can carry it off. Now please. Help
dialog: me find your brother.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You lost Ben?!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Of course not. Does he look lost to
dialog: you?
dialog: (big breath)
speaker_heading: BENNNNN!!!
scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN EXTREMELY WELL-STOCKED KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
text: Rachel, smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke, FLINGS open
text: pantry doors, closet doors -- looking for Ben -- attempting to put
text: stone hard butter on toast at the same time. She glances at the
text: clock -- 7:55. Oh dear. Annabelle sits at the table, in a grumpy
text: orangey red mood. Rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: No. I told you. I like apple butter
dialog: not butter butter.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (hands her an apple)
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Never mind. I'll just eat my lunch.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (forgot)
dialog: I'm almost done making it.
dialog: (to the non-existent Ben)
dialog: Alright Ben -- you deal with the tardy,
dialog: you write yourself a note, your daddy
dialog: told you he had an important case this
dialog: morning and he had to leave early and
dialog: we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
text: She has opened a cupboard with a Lazy Susan that turns revealing
text: BEN sitting there. Rachel screams AGAIN!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh my God. That is so not funny. You're
dialog: late. You're really late. Now get out
dialog: here and have some cereal.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Fine! Eat in the cupboard.
text: She hands him a bowl of sugared cereal -- puts two spoonfuls of
text: instant coffee in Barney cup, and sticks it under the faucet.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No! Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops
text: on the bottom.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Fine.
text: Rachel grabs the bowl, turn it UPSIDE DOWN on the table reversing
text: the order of the cereal. She SWEEPS it back in the bowl and
text: quickly hands it back to him, the phone RINGS THROUGHOUT...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You touched it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Then have a donut --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Alright starve.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: He's badgering a witness. Eat.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But you told us to starve.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (picking up phone)
dialog: Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's
dialog: already there?...I'm out the door...
text: (Ben flings a fruit loop
dialog: at her)
dialog: Ben! Knock it off!
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: It's gonna go beautifully...
dialog: (another fruit loop)
dialog: Damn it Ben --
text: Rachel runs around absentmindedly loading out leftover pizza,
text: Hoho's, and Chips. She glances at the clock again -- 8:00.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You swore. You owe me a quarter. Did
dialog: you remember my egg carton? I told
dialog: you I needed my egg carton for seed
dialog: planting today.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of
dialog: everything.
text: Rachel takes the eggs from the fridge, and dumps them -- accidentally
text: missing the sink. They SHATTER onto the floor. She hands the empty
text: carton to Annabelle.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...EGGzactly. I'm putting on my coat --
dialog: (she hangs up, panicked)
dialog: We are late. We are seriously late. Which
dialog: means Mister Ben we've got to get you
dialog: dressed --
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No!
text: Ben races away but Rachel LUNGES And CATCHES him. He wiggles in
text: her arms as she struggles to change his clothes. Just as she gets
text: his bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs
text: when we hear a loud KNOCKING at the kitchen door. Holding a half
text: naked Ben in her arms, Rachel looks up at...
text: JACKIE HARRISON. An immaculately dressed, intimidatingly intel-
text: ligent, utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme
dialog: disapproval.
scene_heading: ANNABELLE AND BEN
dialog: Mommy!
text: Annabelle and Ben RACE into their mother's arms like little angels.
text: Jackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at Rachel. They LOCK
text: eyes. Enough wattage to light up all of Manhattan.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL'S LOFT, SOHO - MORNING
text: Jackie and the kids exit Rachel's building, onto a bustling Soho
text: street. The kids clamber into the double-parked Volvo wagon.
text: Jackie, still pissed, climbs behind the wheel. Drives off.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S VOLVO STATION WAGON - EARLY MORNING
text: Jackie drives the children down a tree-lined street in Englewood,
text: New Jersey. Ben is banging Jackie's sunglasses case against the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red
dialog: and Blue make purple.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (yes she does)
dialog: I don't care.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I know you don't, but if you had, chrom-
dialog: atically you are in the purple family.
text: Jackie fishes through her purse. Finds a toy airplane for Ben. He
text: stops banging her glasses case, starts banging the plane.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants?
dialog: Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: I noticed a whopping pile of laundry
text: sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's
dialog: underpants are in there -- Now where are
dialog: your lunches?
text: As if by rote, they hold out their lunches. One is a plastic Vons
text: bag and the other a crumpled Macy's bag. She collects them and
text: hands Ben and Annabelle two brightly colored lunch bags.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
dialog: And SLUGS him.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Never say 'never' -- it's not fair to
dialog: say 'always' -- and no name calling.
dialog: Use your words.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I hate when you say that.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Thank you. Those were all words. I
dialog: hate the planet Uranus. Terrible name
dialog: for a planet.
text: Annabelle and Ben look up at her curiously.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I hate snails and blue cheese.
dialog: Especially together. Hate.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I have lava.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (reflects)
dialog: Lava's hateable. I never thought of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make
dialog: me want to throw up.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Excellent point.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I hate wax lips and red ants and
dialog: pretzels without salt...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and
dialog: people who spit when they walk.
text: Jackie nods sagely. Pulls up next to a school playground.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I hate to say goodbye. Eskimo Kiss.
dialog: (they rub noses)
dialog: Russian Orthodox Wedding Kiss.
text: They bump foreheads and elbows. Ben runs toward the kindergarten
text: playground; Jackie watches concerned as Annabelle climbs the steps.
text: The only orangey red dot in a sea of purple.
scene_heading: EXT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, TRIBECA - MORNING
text: Taxi pulls up to a converted warehouse. Rachel BOLTS out,
text: SPRINTING for the door.
scene_heading: INT. PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO - DAY
text: Black and white FILLS the frame. Like a checkerboard. We PULL
text: BACK and realize we are seeing a group of PENGUINS waddling against
text: a black and white backdrop. We see a WHITE WAITRE'D in a BLACK
text: TUXEDO holding glasses on a tray. A BLACK MODEL, IMAN, in a WHITE
text: DRESS glides through it all.
text: In the center the only dash of color is Rachel -- who has just
text: entered and starts expertly directing the action. She calls out to
text: her assistant, COOPER. Perpetually hip. Perpetually young.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Cooper, back the fill off I don't have
dialog: enough shadow...
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You say that like I don't know that.
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I once threw an entire bowl of jello
dialog: on my stepmother's head --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And when did that pass?
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Actually, never. They'll always hate
dialog: you. There's a gene for it.
text: DUNCAN SAMUELS -- Rachel's boss, an elegant, edgy, Englishman
text: interrupts them.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Congratulations. Only forty minutes
dialog: late. You're handling this promotion
dialog: really well Rachel.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Duncan. My work is everything to me.
dialog: This'll never happen again. Now stand
dialog: back -- this session's gonna make you
dialog: remember why you hired me even though
dialog: I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper
dialog: let's get these penguins dancing --
text: Duncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness. The music BLARES just
text: then, and a penguin JUTS forward and NIPS the model. The FLASH of
text: the camera. We FREEZE for a second, seeing the photo Rachel just
text: took. An Avedonesque portrait of a model being GOOSED by a penguin
text: COLLIDING with a maitre'd who SPILLS his tray and the penguins seem
text: to be POINTING and LAUGHING uproariously. It's an inspired photo.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - 2:30 THAT DAY
text: Jackie and LUKE HARRISON -- ruggedly handsome man, mid-forties,
text: charming, disarming, and smart as they come. They sit side by side
text: on a couch across from RUTH FRANKLIN, an Elementary School Counselor
scene_heading: MRS. FRANKLIN
text: Mr. and Mrs. Harrison, while change is
dialog: exhilarating for adults, it can be
text: quite challenging for a child.
text: Luke's beeper beeps. He ignores it; focuses on Mr. Franklin.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I won't get that...It's fine. Change.
dialog: we were talking about change.
scene_heading: MRS. FRANKLIN
dialog: The fact that you two are remarrying
text: obviously has Annabelle overjoyed...
text: (they look at her,
dialog: dumbfounded)
dialog: And she's very excited about your move to
dialog: Switzerland.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: She said we're getting remarried?
text: Suddenly -- a long bell rings -- Jackie STANDS UP, startled.
scene_heading: MRS. FRANKLIN
dialog: Only a fire drill. My concern is that
text: Annabelle seems apathetic towards her
dialog: work knowing she's leaving before the
dialog: end of the semester.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Mrs. Franklin we're not --
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Planning on getting --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: Remarried. There is no move.
scene_heading: MRS. FRANKLIN
dialog: (trying to appear unfazed)
dialog: Really? Well then my concern for --
text: Luke's beeper BEEPS again. They talk right over Mrs. Franklin...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Are you here?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm here.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Because you don't really seem here.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm here. I've got a case where they're
text: this close to sequestering the jury but
dialog: have I answered the goddamn thing?!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Something's up wi...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You think I didn't get that?
text: She cuts a look at Mrs. Franklin.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Excuse him. He never learned how
dialog: to turn the darn thing off.
text: And reaches. Does it for him.
scene_heading: MRS. FRANKLIN
dialog: I'm wondering if there's anything going
dialog: on at home that could be intensifying
dialog: Annabelle's need to create this fantasy?
text: Long pause. Then suddenly they both start speaking AT ONCE.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I've been with someone for quite some
dialog: time, and didn't feel it was appropriate
dialog: for her to move in too quickly. But
dialog: after a lot of thought and careful
dialog: discussion with her -- and the kids I
dialog: might add -- she moved in last month.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Since our divorce Luke has seen a
dialog: number of different women in three
dialog: short years and without a lot of
dialog: warning for the kids, he's now living
dialog: with a woman half his age --
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Rachel's not half my age.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We're not discussing your age.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well, we're not discussing Rachel's
dialog: age either.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: They want to be with you Luke, they go
dialog: to your house to be with their father.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Jackie, they come to be part of my
dialog: life. Rachel is part of that life.
scene_heading: MRS. FRANKLIN
dialog: Mr. Harrison, I hear you talking about
dialog: your life, your needs, but are you
dialog: really in touch with what Annabelle
dialog: needs?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (suddenly fierce)
dialog: This man would walk thru fire for
dialog: Annabelle, gladly, any day of the week.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Napalm.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Except for last Thursday when Rachel
dialog: forgot to pick them up --
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Jackie, she was five minutes late --
scene_heading: MRS. FRANKLIN
dialog: I'm wondering if Annabelle is responding
dialog: to the underlying hostility that exists
dialog: between Rachel and Mrs. Harrison...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Of course she's responding to it. You
dialog: think it's easy for any of us? You think
dialog: it's easy for Jackie to watch her kids
dialog: being looked after by someone who has
dialog: half the experience she does? Of course
dialog: she's going to be hostile, irrational,
dialog: and defensive.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Thank you Luke.
text: Mrs. Franklin doesn't quite know what to say. The bell RINGS.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Thank you Mrs. Franklin. Jackie?
dialog: (they get up)
dialog: This has been very valuable for us. And
dialog: I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's Wednesday night. She's at my
dialog: house. I'll talk to her.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'll call from work. We can have a
dialog: conference call.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You tried that last week and we were
text: on hold forty-five minutes...
text: And they're out the door. You can hear the fight as it echoes down
text: the elementary school hallway.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL, ENGLEWOOD, NEW JERSEY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jackie and Luke exit the pleasant suburban school. Head for the
dialog: parking area...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You ask me that counselor's making
text: a mountain out of a molehill...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm worried.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Luke, I need to switch next Friday for
dialog: Thursday, so why don't you take the
dialog: weekend...
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: ...that way you'll be there, and I'll
dialog: pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Fine. But I wanted to take the kids
dialog: to work with me on Wednesday so I'll
dialog: take Wednesday, and you can pick up
dialog: that Thursday, Friday after soccer,
dialog: and Saturday before riding.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Easy enough.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Good...Well...Take care.
text: As if on automatic pilot they move in to kiss each other goodbye
text: then stop. Each takes a step back. 15 years of hellos and
text: goodbyes. A beat. A wave. They head their separate ways.
scene_heading: EXT. JACKIE'S HOME - NIGHT
text: Establishing shot of Jackie's lovely home on its lovely street.
text: Old trees. Comfortable front lawns. Safe and happy. A place to
text: grow kids, dogs, probably walruses, even. We PUSH toward the warm
dialog: glow from within this home...
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S HOME - NIGHT
text: Jackie setting the table. Annabelle recording the moment with her
text: omnipresent VIDEO CAMERA...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I didn't say that. Why would I say
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well Daddy and I were thinking that
dialog: sometimes people tell a story about
dialog: what they wish would happen.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I don't want that to happen. Why
dialog: would I want that to happen?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well you're telling your teachers and
dialog: your friends --
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
text: Mass hysteria.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Look if the truth is you don't feel like
dialog: talking about this right now that's fine.
dialog: But don't look me in the eye with a big
dialog: smile on your face and lie to me.
dialog: Cause there are only so many lies you're
dialog: allowed to tell before it starts showing
dialog: on your face. You wind up looking like...
text: She stops. It's just too horrible.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Like who?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, he's not president anymore, so
dialog: why be petty.
text: Ben enters in white gloves and Jackie's scarf.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Pick a card. Any card.
text: Jackie picks a card.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: It just slipped out.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It happens.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What happens when he loves Rachel more
dialog: than us?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That will never happen.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Never say never you always say that.
dialog: I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Queen of diamonds.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Seven of clubs. Nobody's mad we just
dialog: want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I'm gonna call him.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there.
dialog: That's one time always is always. You
dialog: can call him after dinner but...
text: Annabelle RUNS out of the room. Jackie watches her sadly. Ben
text: hits Jackie hard with his magic wand.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Poof! You're happy now.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Thank you Ben.
dialog: (unhappily)
dialog: Annabelle!
text: Ben finds himself alone in the kitchen. He hits himself on the
text: head, hard. Poof! He begins to serve himself dinner. Alone.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT, SOHO - NIGHT
text: Rachel and Luke exit a neighborhood bistro. Stroll down the
dialog: street...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Okay, if they're going to have a
dialog: sauce, put something in it besides
dialog: flour and chicken broth...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It was a veal stock, I thi...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, it wasn't a reduction like
dialog: you do it! Boiling down half a
dialog: ton of bones...
text: Luke is thinking of something. She's watching that.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The way you cook. If you could
dialog: make love, I'd marry you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: We have to talk.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (happy)
dialog: Uh-oh. I mention marriage, all
dialog: of a sudden...
dialog: (ominous Nazi Baritone)
dialog: Ve haff to ta...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I didn't want to spoil our supper...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You'd rather spoil our walk home.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeh, it's cheaper.
dialog: Okay, what?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I just found out I have to go to
dialog: Boston to get a deposition. I might
dialog: not be back until Saturday.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (mock horror)
dialog: So I'll have to order in?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (dropping the other shoe)
dialog: We have the kids this weekend, so...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Jesus.
text: He glances over...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I thought it was her weekend. Do I
dialog: ever see you alone?
text: He draws a breath. The concern is behind his eyes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Anyway, I thought...while I'm
dialog: gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're
dialog: working...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I can take them to work with me -- I
dialog: can shift things around --
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You don't need to. I don't expect you
dialog: to handle them yourself.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Can't handle them myself is what you
dialog: mean. Can't.
text: Maybe she's right. Because he doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You don't trust me to be alone with
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I trust you of course I do but --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But? But what?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But you're not good at this. Not yet.
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I know how responsible, caring adults
dialog: parent children. I'm bribe 'em. But
dialog: 'em a dog or something. Maybe a Doberman.
dialog: He loves her. But this problem is real.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Look. I know they hate me.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: They don't hate you --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And what you're telling them is keep
dialog: hating her -- keep up the good work --
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Nobody's telling them to hate you --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Really? Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It's complicated for Jackie. It's
dialog: complicated for me...You don't have
dialog: kids -- you don't understand --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (angry now)
dialog: Oh right...So it's just complicated for
dialog: you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty
dialog: simple cause I just don't understand...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No you don't. And I'm not gonna
dialog: screw with my kids heads right now --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You know I don't need another person in
dialog: this family making me feel like an
dialog: idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up
dialog: job and I have to face it every Tuesday
dialog: and Thursday and every other goddamn
dialog: weekend and I just don't know how the
dialog: hell you were married to her for so
dialog: goddamn long! Jesus what did you see in
dialog: her? I don't get it -- I just don't get
dialog: it.
text: They've reached their building. As they enter...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She's a great mother.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S LOFT - NIGHT
text: The door of the freight elevator CLANGS open. As Rachel and Luke

scene_heading: INTERCUT: INT. ANNABELLE'S CLOSET - JACKIE'S HOUSE
text: Annabelle with a phone in her closet. Hearing Rachel, she hangs

scene_heading: DESSERT IN THE CLOSET? VANILLA OR CHOCOLATE YOGURT. PLEASE CHECK
dialog: ONE.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S LOFT - FRIDAY NIGHT
text: The most beautiful little puppy in the world -- sitting in a puddle
text: of pee on a hardwood floor.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Aw George...not again... who wants to
dialog: help clean up this time?
dialog: (overly zealous)
dialog: Annabelle?
text: She looks around -- completely exhausted. It's late. Annabelle is
text: video taping the dog pee. Ben's in the kitchen talking to himself.
text: He pours and sprinkles, working intently on a MAGIC POTION.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Why do you make that face when you talk
dialog: to me?
dialog: (she imitates Rachel)
dialog: And that voice you use...you think I'm
dialog: deaf or something?
text: Ben ZAPS the magic potion theatrically with his fingertips.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (reaching for her)
dialog: I'm sorry, okay? Let's not fi...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Don't touch me! I'm allergic to you!
text: She starts sneezing furiously and scratching. Ben comes out of the
text: kitchen carrying a steaming cup of potion.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: "Those who travel far and near this
dialog: will make you DISAPPEAR!"
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I have to work on my video project!
dialog: Don't follow me! I can put myself to
dialog: bed.
text: She races upstairs. Rachel follows. So does Ben. And George.
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (following into
dialog: Annabelle's room)
dialog: Annabelle let's get something clear.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I don't have to listen to you! You're
dialog: not my mother.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank God for that!
text: She leaves the room SLAMMING the door behind her. Takes a breath,
text: turns, and walks back in.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What I meant and perhaps I didn't say
dialog: it well was you have a great mom. You
dialog: don't need another one. But when
dialog: you're at this house --
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: This is my daddy's house --
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: This is my house too!
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: And this is my room so get out!
speaker_heading: BEN (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Rachel throws open the door. Ben stands there innocently.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I made you some cocoa. See?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank you Ben. That was so sweet of
dialog: you.
dialog: (pointedly to Annabelle)
dialog: Goodnight Annabelle. Sweet dreams.
text: Rachel leads Ben to his room. With Rachel safe out of sight,
text: Annabelle takes the puppy into her arms and cuddles it.
scene_heading: INT. BEN'S ROOM - RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Rachel, dead on his feet, reads "Goodnight Moon" to Ben.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: "In the great green room there was a
dialog: telephone and a red balloon..."
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Aren't you going to drink your cocoa?
dialog: It's the good kind.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (faking a big sip)
dialog: Mmmm! Tasty. You're a master chef Ben.
dialog: Just like your dad.
text: Ben points to the book -- she 'reads' skipping pages, a hundred
text: miles an hour desperate to get to the end of the book.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: "Goodnight moon, goodnight hush,
dialog: goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight
dialog: goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No! You're cheating -- you have to start
dialog: from the beginning and you have to read
dialog: the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
text: Ben's eyes are glued to her. She lays down next to him, yawns.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: "In the great green room there was a
dialog: telephone and a red balloon..."
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: "And a picture of the cow jumping over
dialog: the moon..."
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (laying head down)
dialog: That's nice Ben.
text: Ben reads until Rachel's asleep. He looks at her in AWE.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Rachel! Rachel!
text: No response. Rachel's really asleep. He lifts her head. It flops
text: down! In HORROR he jumps off the bed and with a quick look back,
text: races from the room, and...
text: ...DARTS down the hallway, BUMPING into walls -- He LEAPS inside
text: Annabelle's room, SLAMMING the door behind him.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Ben! What's wrong?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (triumphantly)
dialog: I killed her!
text: Ben and Annabelle gape at one another, stunned.
scene_heading: EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Rachel pulls up FAST in Luke's Grand Cherokee. As she SCREECHES to
text: a stop, the kids pile out with their gear.
text: Rachel takes an anxious look toward Jackie's place. Here we go.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - MORNING
text: The clock reads 8:10. Rachel and the kids enter. Annabelle's hair
text: is brushed forward, hiding her face. Ben is ebullient. Jackie's
text: edgy, ready to snap.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: How do you hold down a job? It's 8:10.
dialog: You were supposed to be here at 7:00.
text: She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: This is Friday, her riding lesson is
dialog: on Tuesdays.
dialog: (pulls out post it)
dialog: I got it right here...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of
dialog: the month when it's switched to Friday
dialog: except in April when she rides on
dialog: Thursday. It's not that hard. Didn't
dialog: you have a mother?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (flinching)
dialog: Can I please have a cup of coffee?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We don't have any coffee.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What is this? The Betty Ford Center?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Annabelle, how's your video rep...
text: Annabelle RUSHES past her. Ben saunters off after his sister.
text: Jackie turns to Rachel, accusingly.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What happened with Annabelle? Has
dialog: nothing I said gotten through to you?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Maybe you could back off just a little
dialog: bit --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Nothing. Look, I want to talk to you
dialog: about...well...Luke said to ask you...
text: Jackie's edge sharpened by Rachel's unease.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: See, the place where I can connect
dialog: with Annabelle is my photography.
dialog: Because she loves video and all...
dialog: And...?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She's been talking about this little
dialog: editing machine, it's only...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...a ridiculously expensive and
dialog: inappropriate item, which her father
dialog: and I have already told her she is far
dialog: too young to own. But you apparently
dialog: want to buy her forgiveness, with...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (had enough)
dialog: Forgiveness? For what, exactly?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: How much time have you got? Let's
dialog: start with this morning. Why did she
dialog: run from this room?
text: Long beat. Then, Rachel looks dead on at Jackie.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Luke was in the shower this morning and
dialog: Annabelle sort of walked in without
dialog: knocking.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm sure that didn't upset her.
dialog: Everyone in our family takes showers.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I was in there in him.
text: The air is thick with tension.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Did you or Luke talk to her about it
dialog: afterwards?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No. I thought it might be uncomfortable
dialog: for her --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You mean for you. A 10-year-old girl is
text: coping with the fact that her father is
dialog: never coming back to live with his
text: family. She sees her father naked with
text: another woman for the first time.
dialog: And you think it's best for her if every-
dialog: one pretends it didn't happen?
dialog: (turning away)
dialog: This isn't going to work out.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're damn right. I'm gonna sick of
dialog: your imperious bullshit. I never said I
dialog: was Betty Fucking Crocker. If every time
dialog: life hits her in the face you want to
dialog: have a 12 hour talk every third Friday
dialog: or the month -- go ahead! I have a life!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh and I don't because I have a children?!
dialog: The problem is you're too self-involved
dialog: to ever be a mother.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Maybe the problem is your kids. Maybe
dialog: they're spoiled, coddled brats!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Get out!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (holding up Post Its)
dialog: But it's not on the schedule!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You got to hell!

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ah Ah Ah! You owe me a quarter --
scene_heading: INT. YMCA KITCHEN - DAY
text: Luke stands in an apron before Annabelle's Girl Scout Troop,
text: rolling out a large pie dough. They imitate his every move.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie
dialog: is the crust. And the secret to a
dialog: great flaky pie crust comes from less
dialog: flour and more...what?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Ice cold water.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (adoringly)
dialog: That's my girl...

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Blueberry pie must be topped with vanilla
dialog: Haagan Daz and/or creme fraiche...now the
dialog: secret to a great creme fraiche is...
speaker_heading: ALL THE GIRLS
dialog: Orange peel!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: ...which also is the secret to...
speaker_heading: ALL THE GIRLS
dialog: French toast!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Now don't forget to teach your fathers
dialog: that. Next week...apple brown betty!
text: He takes off his apron and walks toward Rachel as the girls file
dialog: out...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She said no.
text: He doesn't even know what she's talking about.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The editing machine. I mean,
dialog: Annabelle would have really loved it.
text: She looks down.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It would have been great for us,
dialog: so obviously, Jackie just...
text: Eyes down. Choosing her words.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She's really a difficult person...
text: Looks up.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Best thing ever happened to you was
dialog: her throwing you out on your butt.
dialog: An afterthought...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Not that I have a personal stake
dialog: in it.
text: He comes and kisses her.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Get ready. To get really mad.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Uh. Annabelle's video report has been
dialog: switched again.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear

speaker_heading: LUKE

dialog: WHAT???
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And it's my call. I promised them
dialog: water-skiing, instead o...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (quiet pain)
dialog: Our weekend. At that sweet little
dialog: B & B.
text: He puts his arms around her.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And the evil part is. I am so stoked
dialog: about the water-skiing. I can't wait.
text: He tastes her mouth. And again. A sweet, hot moment. Her fingers
text: trace up his neck. To his hair.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, this is good. Celibacy is
dialog: healthy. For a guy your age. You'll
dialog: get used to it.
text: From the kiss that follows. He won't have to.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: CLOSE ON an ANSWERING MACHINE. IT CLICKS, WHIRLS, and...
speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
dialog: Hi, it's the trophy bimbo. Annabelle's
dialog: teacher called, and her video report
text: is being moved up to 8:30 tomorrow.
dialog: Sorry to deprive your step aerobics
dialog: class of their role model.
dialog: Pause. PULL BACK to see...
speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
dialog: Anyway. I'm sorry I lost my temper
dialog: the other day. And I'm sure you are,
dialog: too, so...
text: ...BEN, looming over the hardware. Fingers poised above the

speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
dialog: ...no, apology necessa...

dialog: grand.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - MORNING
text: CLOSE on a small TV MONITOR, the angelic face of 10-year-old TAMARA,

speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Well, I I had a million dollars...
dialog: I would use it to...feed all the
dialog: precious hungry children of the world.
dialog: And bring about total world peace.
text: PULL BACK to see the class and teacher watching raptly. Filmmaker
text: Annabelle in the seat of honor next to her proud father. Rachel in
text: the back of the room, anxiously looking at the back door. While on
dialog: screen...
dialog: ...another face. JARED, bad as he wanna be...
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: A million big ones. Oh. I'd buy
dialog: about a thousand babes. Not to do
dialog: anything bad, I mean. Just to hang
dialog: with.
text: Near the monitor, Annabelle's eyes are also furtively cutting to
text: the classroom's back door. On screen now...
text: ...the handsomest 10-year-old since DiCaprio. BRAD the Dreamboat.
text: Stares soulfully at the camera. Murmurs...
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Well, first off, Annabelle. I'd
dialog: give half of it. To you.
text: The class OOOOOS, WHISTLES. Annabelle flushes, but she clearly
text: likes it. Brad grins a Redford grin her way. And through the back
text: door BURSTS...
text: ...a harried, disheveled JACKIE. Still in workout clothes. As on
dialog: screen...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: There you have it. Now ask yourself
dialog: ...what would YOU do?
text: The screen goes BLACK. The class, teacher and especially Luke
text: ERUPT with APPLAUSE. So does Jackie, who has locked eyes across
text: the room with her mortally-wounded abandoned daughter. Then
text: Jackie's eyes CUT TO...
dialog: ...Rachel, a deer in headlights. Death by Army ants would be too
dialog: kind.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY
text: Annabelle, Luke and Jackie GLARING at Rachel, who looks awkwardly at
text: her feet. KIDS stream past, unaware of the gravity of the moment.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: Machines do not EAT message.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Look, I...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Of all the cheap excuses. To break a
dialog: child's heart.
text: The jury is in. There is no appeal. Jackie takes her daughter's
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Don't worry, sweetie, there's still
dialog: the Harvest Pageant. And you are
dialog: the lead vegetable...
text: Said with bottomless pride.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And nothing. And no one. Can
dialog: keep me away.
dialog: One laser look at Luke. This bitch is your responsibility. And

scene_heading: EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: A parked VAN, packed with SNOWBOARDS and ski gear. No people. PAN
text: across the suburban lawn to...
text: ...Luke, dejected, at Jackie's door. Rachel nearby, still peers
text: into the window of an unlit, empty house. A cellular phone RINGS.
text: Luke WHIPS it out, like the Governor's pardon hangs in the
dialog: balance...
speaker_heading: JACKIE (O.S., from carphone)
dialog: You paged us?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (distraught)

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You're WHERE?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: At the Big Apple Circus, it's the
dialog: only big top I know. I said I'd
dialog: get 'em back tonight...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Jackie, we were taking them water-
dialog: skiing for the whole weekend!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (innocent)
dialog: ...until the plan changed, when
dialog: Jessie's mom gave us these tickets.
dialog: What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
text: Luke's eyes DART to an uncomprehended Rachel. She's never seen
dialog: him this angry.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Don't tell me. Another machine ate
dialog: another message? Boy, there's a lot
dialog: of that going around! Put her on, huh?
text: A beat. He hands the phone to Rachel. She brings it to her ear...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yeh?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Think twice. Before you ever pull
dialog: that again.
text: CLICK. The line is dead. And so is Rachel.

text: of yellow -- as a hundred YELLOW CANARIES fly out from her mane! A

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Lunch time Sleeping Beauty. Where's

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna

scene_heading: EXT. PARK MEN'S ROOM

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just

text: Panicked, she grabs Annabelle's hand.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Don't touch me! You bring bad luck!
text: Rachel. Starting to believe it.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ben! Ben we're here! BEN!
text: In the corner of the tower we see GEORGE staring up at her. But

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: He's gone forever and I'm gonna miss

scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION, CENTRAL PARK - LATER

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: Jackie RUNS through the police station moving down corridors past

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ben! Oh my Ben! Are you alright?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I knew where I was all the time.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - THAT EVENING
text: Ben sits between Jackie and Luke holding each of their hands.

text: Pageant to begin. It's horribly tense.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: Jackie? I am so sorry about today I
dialog: really fucked up royalty. When you
dialog: called Luke I was so goddamn relieved --
text: Luke elbows her with an "We're in an Elementary School" elbow.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No I did -- I know I did -- I screwed
dialog: up. I feel like such an asshole...
text: Jackie lifts Ben onto her lap, holding him tightly. She turns and
text: faces Rachel, claws bared.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Shhhhhh!
text: The lights go down. They sit pretending the other is not there.
text: On stage -- The class is dressed as the harvest PRODUCE. Annabelle
text: is the CORN. Each FOOD DISH steps forward and introduces itself.
text: Annabelle rehearing her line over and over.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: "Hello! I am Maze. But you can call
dialog: me Corn. Hello! I am..."
text: Inside her costume, her breathing is sharp. She stands very
text: straight, very bold. A brazen ear of corn. She steps forward.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: "Hello! I am...
text: Rachel POPS UP next to the stage with her huge PROFESSIONAL CAMERA
text: and giant flash. Her camera FLASHES three times, quickly. After
text: each flash, we see the picture for a split second, Annabelle. A
text: TERRIFIED ear of corn. A LOST ear of corn.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (blinks, disoriented)
dialog: Um...I'm...I'm...Oh...
text: In the audience, Jackie is willing her daughter a recovery. Sees
text: instead, a completely DEVASTATED ear of corn.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (exploding in tears)
dialog: Oh forget it!
text: She runs offstage amidst laughter and applause. Luke looks over at
text: Jackie but she and Ben have already left their seats.
scene_heading: EXT. AUDITORIUM FOYER - NIGHT
text: Jackie comforts Annabelle. Ben watches closely, getting caught up
text: in his sister's sadness. Luke and Rachel approach.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I hate her. I really hate her.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: There you are!
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (covering her face)
dialog: Don't take my picture!
text: She starts to cry. Ben's lip quivers, his eyes well up.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Annabelle doesn't really want to talk
dialog: to you right now.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

speaker_heading: TURKEY
dialog: They're taking a picture of the

dialog: Annabelle.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: See? No one's laughing at you. Your
dialog: friends want you to join them, Anna-
dialog: belle. Corn is a very important part
dialog: of the Harvest Produce. Now Ben, walk
dialog: your sister over to the Yams.
text: Ben takes Annabelle's hand. When they are gone...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (lighting into Luke)
dialog: You listen carefully because I am only
dialog: going to say this once. That woman has
dialog: nothing more to do with my children.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Our children.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Do you realize what could have hap-
dialog: pened to your son today? How lucky we
dialog: are the police found him before some
dialog: lunatic did? He could have been...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But he hasn't. He wandered off. I
dialog: know it's terrifying. I can imagine
dialog: how you felt when that call came -- But
dialog: it happens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Not to me.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (soft, reasonable)
dialog: Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all
dialog: make mistakes --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm not gonna wait around to see the
dialog: next one. I'm not gonna watch my kids
dialog: fall through the cracks of this
dialog: arrangement. I'm seeing a lawyer.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Jackie stop. We promised we never go
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We've broken a lot of promises,

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I am not here to make it easier for

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, maybe they would if they thought

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (poking Luke's chest)
dialog: A court order is gonna say that woman
dialog: is never alone with my children! Ever

text: All of New Jersey heard that. On the silence that follows, she

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mommy? It's not Rachel's fault I ran
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (doesn't turn)
dialog: No, that's your fault. It's her fault
dialog: for not watching over my precious son,

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (thinks about this)

dialog: Ben, mommies work too. They work very
dialog: hard. Mommy works harder as a mom
dialog: than she did when she was working. I
dialog: just don't get paid.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Does Rachel make a lot of money?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: People like Rachel who only think about
dialog: themselves often do make a lot of money.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I think she's pretty, Mommy.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yes...if you like big hair...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mommy?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What honey?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: If you want me to hate her I will.

scene_heading: EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Luke pacing around on the path through Jackie's front lawn. Jackie

dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You know, you can come inside the
dialog: house.
text: He looks at the end of his rope. She walks down to him.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Did you see the lawyer?
dialog: Oh. Well...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Called him. We set an ap...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (almost a whisper)
dialog: Don't do this.
text: So vulnerable. The air comes out of her. We see how much she
dialog: still cares for this man.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're saying, don't make the kids
dialog: a football, don't put them through a
dialog: war. But I'm doing this for their
dialog: well-being.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Partly. But partly, you're mad.
text: Staring. At each other.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You know the kids aren't really in
dialog: danger. This is about Rachel, and
dialog: you're right, I'm disappointed in her
dialog: learning curve, and...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Slugs. Have faster learning curves.
dialog: Trees, even.
text: He takes a breath.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (here it is)
dialog: I'm afraid she's going to walk.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And I'm supposed to care.
text: He reaches out. Takes her hands.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: About me, yeh. Like I care about you.
text: She looks in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Like you cared about me three
dialog: years ago?
text: He shrugs. Looks saddened by that.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Hey. You kicked me out.
dialog: And just this once. With all that's happened. Jackie needs to
dialog: say...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Maybe you should talk to your
dialog: daughter, about why. She seems to
dialog: have missed that part.
text: Now he looks ashamed. And sorry from his heart.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Forget I said that.
dialog: He has to tell her...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: This thing with Rache. I need this.
dialog: I don't want to lose her. And I will
dialog: see to it that the kids don't suffer.
dialog: Help me, huh?
dialog: Help me.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'd do it for you.
text: Yes, he would. Despite everything, she knows that.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: One last chance, don't make me
dialog: regret it...
text: Her voice tried to be tough. But the tension showed through.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...or you will, too.
text: A last look. She walks slowly. Back toward the house.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR POOL LINE, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. RACHEL'S STUDIO - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. RADIOLOGY LAB - AFTERNOON
text: A cavernous sterile room. A horrible METALLIC HAMMERING sound.
dialog: PAN to see that it comes from...
text: ...a white cylindrical TUBE. Bare feet protrude. An MRI is in
text: progress. The sound stops. The body SLIDES from the tube, a woman
text: in a hospital gown. She is Jackie.
text: She blinks at the light. Her eyes are drawn, a million miles away.
text: A lot on her mind. A TECHNICIAN enters the room...
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Your paper went off during the
dialog: procedure. Do you want the number?
text: Jackie turns, suddenly focusing...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Wait...what time is it?
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: Annabelle sits glumly, refusing to eat some chips from the bag in

dialog: maternal...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey, sea salt and vinegar, I know
dialog: this is your fave.
text: Annabelle keeps her eyes down. This is more than a sulk. She

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Now could she just...forget me!
text: Looks up. Eyes desperate.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I mean, that's something you would do!
text: Rachel stares back. Eats a chip. Decides...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Tell ya the truth? I did.
text: The kid blinks. A non-compute.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Your mom had to...help a friend with

dialog: And we switched days. Then, I got
dialog: stuck on my shoot, and...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
speaker_heading: MOMMY!
text: Rachel WHIRLS to see JACKIE filling the doorway, Annabelle flying

dialog: hear?
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Jackie brushing out Annabelle's hair. Jackie's eyes are distant.
text: Annabelle watching in the mirror.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Are you worried about your friend?
dialog: With the emergency?
text: Jackie's eyes come back to focus. Hmmn?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh, I'm waiting on some news, that's
dialog: all. Say. Can I ask you why you
dialog: never asked me something you probably
dialog: asked Daddy anyway?
text: And she smiles. Real carefree. So Annabelle smiles back.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You can try.
text: More brushing. Gentler, slower strokes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Daddy was washing Rachel. In the
dialog: shower. What did you think that was
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Sex. Of course.
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

dialog: Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...why do you think?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Because it feels really incredibly
dialog: good.
text: Jackie moves around. Leans to stare in her eyes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: So why are you asking me?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I like talking about it. At least,
dialog: to you.
text: The look holds. Almost a bittersweet smile plays on Jackie's lips.
text: She leans to kiss her daughter's head.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (a murmur)
dialog: Same here, huh?
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL'S DARKROOM - MORNING
text: TOTAL DARKNESS -- Slowly an IMAGE APPEARS -- Floating in a pool of

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hold on! Don't let the light...
text: Jackie enters, leaving the door wide OPEN.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real
dialog: comfortable being here, but...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don't recall inviting you.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I overhead what you told Annabelle.
dialog: The lie.
text: Unreadable faces. What are they feeling?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I have a snoop.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I didn't need you to take the blame

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (simply)
dialog: I didn't do it for you. Believe me.
dialog: And Jackie. Finds that interesting.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: More silence.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: So why did y...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I did it for her.
text: Straight to her eyes.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Poor kid has to believe in someone.
dialog: Even if it's you.
dialog: Nothing friendly about it. But Jackie hasn't come seeking
dialog: friendship.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I have an appointment this after-
dialog: noon. I need someone to take them
dialog: to the park.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What? And have Federal agents jump
dialog: out of the bushes with court orders?
dialog: How many years do you get in this

dialog: minors?
text: Hard looks. All around.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: However many. It's not enough.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm already on thin ice. Yesterday,
dialog: I actually thought my boss was going
dialog: to fire me.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Fine, forget it.
text: But neither of them wants her to. A Mexican Standoff. Until
text: Jackie empties her huge purse on the counter.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Bandaids for cuts. Bandaids for new
text: shoe blisters. Packet of Wash n Dri's.
dialog: Kleenex. Sugar free lollipops, potty
dialog: seat covers for public restrooms...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Why not just bring the whole toilet?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ben likes to be read to. Do you know
dialog: Dr. Seuss...?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Not personally.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Do you have a word limit you need to
dialog: hit every day or can I finish?
text: This silences Rachel. Jackie hands her a Post It.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Here's their schedule for this after-
dialog: noon. I'll meet you at the park at
dialog: five. All I ask is that they're alive
dialog: when I get there.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (dry)
dialog: Thank you.
text: And scoops up the parenting paraphernalia.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (drier)
dialog: Thank you.
text: And walks out the door.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO CORRIDOR - MORNING
text: Jackie stands outside a door. Deciding. She knocks and enters...

text: Both men looking up at this stranger.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Mr. Samuels? Forgive the intrusion,
dialog: I'm Jacqueline Harrison, and...
text: The sweetest smile she's got. Which is pretty good.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...well, I just wanted to thank you.
dialog: For your generosity.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Gener...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...my daughter had a terrible

dialog: Confides...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'd hate to think what might have
dialog: happened.
text: Shakes her hand.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: She told me that you were so suppor-
dialog: tive, even at great inconvenience to
dialog: your business, and...
text: An amazing smile.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's wonderful to see a successful
dialog: man. With that sense of priorities.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (longer beat)
dialog: Well...under the circumstances...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: If I can ever repay your kindness. It
dialog: would be my great pleasure.
text: Backing out the door...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...and your Ms. Kelly? A remarkable
text: young woman.
text: The client is beaming.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (clearing his throat)
dialog: We think so.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: CLOSE on Jackie, looking down. She seems to be staring at
text: something in her lap...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (quiet anger)
dialog: I don't even know what that means.
dialog: Spread. That is very unclear.
text: ...but there is nothing there. Her lap is empty. Except for her
text: unnaturally still hands.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S., gently)
dialog: I means we found some cells. In your
text: lymph nodes. In three of them.
text: The hands come together. Slowly, deliberately. Stating to anyone
dialog: who would watch that there is no panic here.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: But the other time. You said you got
dialog: it all. So you could be wrong again.
dialog: One time, you say one thing, then...
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: The other time. Was a year ago.
text: The air comes out of Jackie. In a thin, slow, precise stream.
text: Everything, her very breath. Under complete control.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
text: That was a tiny lump in the breast.
dialog: We radiated, we thought we had it
dialog: all. We were hopeful. But there
dialog: were no guarantees.
text: Silence. Jackie's eyes stay on her folded, still, hands.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: But we can beat it.
text: PULL BACK to see the small, neatly kept office. DR. SWEIKERT is
dialog: 50, slender, elegant, kind. The doctor you want when you're dying.
text: Jackie looks up to her.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: People beat it, don't they? All
dialog: the time.
scene_heading: DR. SWEIKERT
dialog: (straight)
dialog: Every day. More and more.
text: Jackie swallows. The confirmation of hope has allowed some of the
dialog: fear to show.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: So we'll...radiate some more?
scene_heading: DR. SWEIKERT
text: At first. Then, after awhile, some
dialog: chemo.
text: A blow. Jackie absorbs this.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's necessary, huh?
scene_heading: DR. SWEIKERT
dialog: Let's take our best shot.
text: Jackie nods. Staring at the woman. Then, to break the spell...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I guess a no-hair day beats a
dialog: bad-hair day.
text: The doctor smiles. Jackie looks at her watch...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I have to get dressed. My ex-husband
dialog: has asked me to dinner. God knows
dialog: why, he was very mysteri...
scene_heading: DR. SWEIKERT
dialog: Have you still never told him?
text: A flash of the anger flickers.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Why would his worry? Or my children's
dialog: worry. Or anyone's worry. Help the
dialog: sit...
scene_heading: DR. SWEIKERT
dialog: (very soft)
dialog: Sooner than later. You really need
dialog: to.
text: That brings a silence. A shading of defiance to Jackie's features.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You don't burden others needlessly.
dialog: That's how I was raised, Doctor.
dialog: Hold the look.
scene_heading: MR. SWEIKERT
dialog: Maybe at dinner tonight. Think
dialog: about it.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BATHROOM - DUSK
text: Jackie is getting dressed in front of the mirror, her eyes distant,
text: in spite of her attempts at control. Annabelle is watching her
text: like a hawk. We see Ben in the BACKGROUND -- sawing the BABYSITTER
text: ALISE in half.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Why are you going to a French
dialog: restaurant?
text: Throughout, Annabelle is trying on Jackie's jewelry, making a pest
text: of herself. Jackie fights against rising irritation.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Because it's quiet. And he wants to
dialog: talk. Alise -- Once he saws you in
dialog: half, it's bedtime...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: What are you gonna talk about?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (applying mascara)
dialog: Probably you -- your brother -- school --
dialog: The solar system...The usual...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Then why are you putting on mascara?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I'm a little tired and it's just a
dialog: pick-me-up.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: But you only wore mascara when you and
dialog: Daddy went on romantic dates...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well Daddy and I are just friends
dialog: now, and that's no reason not to
dialog: wear mascara...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Or blush. You look pale.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: ...Maybe you don't think three years
dialog: is enough for a person to change
dialog: but...things are different now Jackie.
dialog: I'm different.
text: Jackie feels her heart beginning to race. They lock eyes for a
text: moment. He unconsciously begins to eat off her plate. He eats
dialog: her chicken, and in the dance they've done a thousand times -- she
text: reaches for his uneaten vegetables. The WAITER approaches.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Would you and your wife prefer
dialog: still or sparkling water?
text: He doesn't correct the waiter.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Still, please.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (when the waiter leaves)
dialog: Annabelle showed me the new dress.
dialog: She's amazing in it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Getting so beautiful...she looks more
dialog: like you every day.
dialog: (Luke downs Jackie's wine)
dialog: Jackie...I've really given this a lot
dialog: of thought. A great deal of thought...
text: Their eyes lock for a moment. Here it comes...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm gonna marry Rachel. I know you don't
dialog: think much of her but she's a special
dialog: person -- she really is. And I love her.
dialog: This is a bridge we never wanted to cross
dialog: but it's not helping her or the kids if I
dialog: don't really commit to that.
text: Jackie stares at him stonefaced.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I didn't think a phone call was
dialog: appropriate...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Tell me exactly how you're different
dialog: from three years ago? The music
dialog: sounds kind of the same from where
dialog: I'm sitting.
text: He shifts in his chair. Wants this to sound as authentic as he
dialog: feels it...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I grew up, a little. I'm ready for a
dialog: life that's built around commitm...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Just not to me.
text: The waiter returns with a bottle of red wine. It's horribly quiet
text: as he pours. Waits, obtrusively.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Thank you, it's fine...
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Would you like to taste it?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Can we please have less service, here?
text: The waiter leaves, taking his attitude with him. Luke sighs...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It's going to be hard for the kids
dialog: when I tell them...I'd like you to
dialog: be there.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: To make it easier for them or you?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It's a huge moment in their life --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You can't be an 'us' just when you
dialog: want to. You can't play that card
dialog: when it's convenient.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: We...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: WE are over.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: WE'RE still their parents for the next
dialog: hundred years.
text: On this, Jackie looks down at her hands.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You're still going to have to be
dialog: dealing with me -- with us. We should
dialog: tell them together.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No. You think this is going to help
dialog: the kids then you do it. You're on
dialog: your own.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: Jackie sits next to Luke on the couch -- looking lovingly towards the

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The great thing about life is that
dialog: things keep changing.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Remember when Mommy and Daddy got
dialog: divorced?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And we all went through that together?
dialog: ON Ben. OH MY GOD. He knew it!
text: ON ANNABELLE -- Behind the video camera -- Where's this headed?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well things are going to change

text: Ben LEAPS up from the couch and FLIES into Jackie's arms.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I knew it! I knew it! I knew you
dialog: guys were getting back together!
text: Jackie looks at Luke. Annabelle ZOOMS IN on their faces.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: No they're not.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Annabelle put down that camera.
text: She ZOOMS in on his face.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Put down that goddamn camera!
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You owe me a quarter.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Look she's upset --
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: No I'm not. I don't care. Why should
dialog: I care? I mean nobody asked me when
dialog: you got divorced. Nobody asked me if
dialog: I wanted a new mother. Nobody even
dialog: asked me if I like her. If you guys
dialog: don't care about our family staying
dialog: together, why sh...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Daddy and I tried hard. We really did.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No you didn't! All you guys did was
dialog: name call! I heard you! You didn't

scene_heading: INT. BEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Ben pulls his cape over his head and hides in a bundle in the

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I'm disappearing. I'm almost

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (holding him)
dialog: I'll find you wherever you go...my

dialog: nothing will ever change that.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jackie moves to Annabelle who won't put down the camera.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Annabelle...Rachel's not taking my place
dialog: as your mother -- it's just Daddy's chance
dialog: to be happy again. Isn't that what we
dialog: all want for each other?
text: No answers. Jackie looks at this daughter she loves so much. Pats
text: the seat beside her...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Come. Sit.
text: Something in the softening of the tone changes the atmosphere in
text: the room. More real. More like equals.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Life is full of hard things. And we
dialog: can't always have what we want, you
dialog: know that.
text: Don't you? Annabelle nods, cautiously.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: But we do have a choice. To make it
dialog: better. Instead of worse.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Like how?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Like seeing the good side of Rachel.
dialog: So she'll see the good side of us.
text: Annabelle's stare is hard and questioning. She didn't expect this.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Because I'm looking ahead. And you
dialog: know what I see...?
text: Annabelle doesn't. But she sure is listening.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Time will come. When we all need to
dialog: be there. For each other.
text: Strokes her baby's hair.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That happens. To families.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (straight back)
dialog: I'll be there for you.

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm counting on it.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL'S AND LUKE'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Barely any light in the empty kitchen. PAN to see Ben, alone, in

text: that lies across the butcher block table.
text: He GRASPS the corners of the napkin. He looks scared. We get
dialog: what's about to happen. As he...
text: ...YANKS the napkin, as FAST as he can, the cup and saucer, RATTLE
dialog: and...

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: LUKE

text: He does. She hugs him tight.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Everything's gonna work out. The
dialog: kids and I...we're going to love
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Rache, it may take time.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What's eight, ten years? Hell, you'll
dialog: still be ambulatory. I think.
text: She's counting on her fingers. He kisses her.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's inevitable. Look, I was
dialog: defensive, I was insecure. I was
dialog: afraid to love first.
text: Her incredible smile. Filling even Luke with confidence.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But I'm not anymore.
text: A sudden horrific CRASHING sound. The breakage of the breakable.
text: Their look holds.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'll get this.
text: A quick kiss. And she's gone.
text: HOLD on Luke's light smile. Maybe this will all work out.
scene_heading: INT. BEN'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: Ben is cuddled up in his coverlet. Almost as if he's hiding. She
text: picks up some stray underpants. Actually, three of them.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Are you real mad?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: How could I be? We learned some
dialog: magic...
text: She goes to his bed. Sits down.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I made all the pieces disappear.
text: Oh. She leans toward him...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And you learned...
text: She kisses his forehead. Very sweetly.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...to make that trick disappear,
dialog: huh?
text: He nods. Big time. She stands, smiles...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: A night. Of learning.
text: They share the smile. And Rachel leaves, into the darkened hall.
dialog: Down it now, only to...
text: ...stop. Open a door, so quietly. Silently enter...
scene_heading: INT. ANNABELLE'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: ...the room of a sleeping child. Rachel moves soundlessly to
text: Annabelle's side. Stares down. Listens to the soft breathing.
text: She straightens the covers slightly, in a maternal way. Then, on
text: impulse, reaches down...
text: ...tenderly smooths back a strand of hair. One last look. And
dialog: she...
text: ...leaves frame. HOLD on Annabelle, as we hear the knob turn. The
text: door close. Alone, now...
text: Annabelle opens her eyes. She is thinking.
scene_heading: EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Rachel dropping off Annabelle at Jackie's door. They must be late,
text: because Rachel is looking anxiously at her watch. Not even
text: noticing that Annabelle has pulled out a tube of LIP GLOSS, turning
text: the shaft to reveal a glittering golden-colored gloss. Then...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Uh. Put that away, hon, your mom w...
text: The door OPENS. Jackie is dressed for riding.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping
text: Ben off at Kevin's.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's okay, it's twenty minutes. The
dialog: horse'll be there.
text: Rachel blinks. Is she on the right planet?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Mom, look what Rache got me!
text: Uh-oh. The kid holds it up.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: It's not to wear around, or any-
dialog: thing, I'm way too young. It's
dialog: just for play.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: See, I...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (taking it)
dialog: That is so pretty. You usually only
dialog: see that color in people's teeth.
text: Annabelle has entered the house, to see on a table by the door a
text: huge, brightly-wrapped PACKAGE.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Wow. Who's that for?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Well. It's for you.
dialog: The kid WHIRLS around. Really?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Just because. Just because I love
dialog: you. Go ahead...
text: Annabelle starts to unwrap the present with Christmas-morning-care.
text: Jackie looks at the glitter gloss...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm sorry, I just...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Hey. At least it's not an editing
dialog: machine.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No way. I told her two, three years,
dialog: maybe, for such an expens...
text: And stops. Because the paper has come off. A giant deluxe model
text: beginner's VIDEO EDITOR. Annabelle is STUNNED silent. So's Rachel.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (tears in her eyes)
dialog: Oh, Mommy...
text: And JUMPS into Jackie's arms, CRUSHING her with the hug mothers
dialog: live for.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I hope it's the right kind.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Are you kidding? It is so much better
dialog: than the one Rachel showed me!
text: Jackie strokes her baby's head.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, I thought. You know, why wait?
text: The child turns to Rachel, frozen in the doorwary.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I told you I was big enough! Is my
dialog: mom the greatest, or what?
text: Rachel swallows.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The greatest.
text: HOLD on the look. The women share.
scene_heading: EXT. NORTH VALE STABLES - DAY
text: Jackie and Annabelle riding. The kid is still on Cloud Nine.
text: Jackie's eyes are on her.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: ...I mean, she knows all the music,
dialog: and pop stars, and clothes and stuff.
dialog: She's like still a kid, herself.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Like a big sister.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: She knows every neat junk food place.
text: Looks to see if her mom is okay hearing...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Actually. She's kind of cool,
dialog: when you get to know her.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I bet.
text: Annabelle studies her mom's profile.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: And don't tell her I told you.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Secret's safe with me.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT
text: Rachel sits cross-legged on the floor of the walk-in closet. Next
text: to her, a glass and a botle of Stolie, getting toward the bottom.
text: An ashtray filled with butts, and...
text: ...a card board box. Dragged out of somewhere. Photo albums, loose
text: snapshots. Vintage stuff. From her face, this is not a carefree
text: romp down Memory Lane. She takes another hit on the Stolie. More
text: than slightly intoxicated, weaving, squinting at...
text: ...the next photo. Luke, young, straddling a Kawasaki. Jackie,
text: just as young, holding him from behind. She wears a halter and
text: shorts, and looks simply terrific.
text: Rachel looks drunk and jealous. With an overlay of self-pity.
text: Brings the photo closer. Squints harder.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What the fuck is that?
dialog: Her worst fears confirmed...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...a tattoo?
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NEW YORK - DUSK
text: The lights are coming on in The City. Jackie sits staring out the
text: window, as an IV drips into her arm. She is alone, and down. And
text: fighting the fear of what may come to pass. Her pager goes OFF.
text: Jesus. She pulls a cell phone from her purse. Works it with one
dialog: hand. Brings up...the smile. Showtime.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Hey, good-lookin', I was just
dialog: thinking about calling y...
text: INTERCUT throughout: Ben on the phone in Rachel's and Luke's
text: kitchen. He is alone. Staring through the glass window of the
dialog: oven...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Rache says I have to eat lamb. I
dialog: told her you're making me spaghetti!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Honey, this is Thursday. I pick you
dialog: up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: And many meatballs.
text: A nurse enters, and Jackie shoots her with a wave of her fingers.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You'll be up to your armpits in
dialog: meatballs, I'm flying them in
dialog: from Sweden.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Is that like Luigi's?
dialog: She loves this kid so much.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country.
dialog: Like Canada. Only smaller.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Where are you, anyway?
text: And the feeling comes straight to her eyes. She can't fight it.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And
dialog: meatballs. And you know what?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Of course, you do. Being magic.
dialog: Then you know I've got a flu bug,
text: and I turn green and barf profusely
dialog: when I even think about food. So,
dialog: all the more meatballs for you. But
dialog: you know what.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I did. Do I have to eat lamb?
dialog: Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Do me a favor? Eat it, and then
dialog: give me a secret report, okay? Pay
dialog: particular attention to whether it's
dialog: chewy and if it tastes more like
dialog: chocolate or soup.
text: He laughs. And she can hear that. And her eyes fill. And she
dialog: murmurs...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Hey, that's a world-class laugh
dialog: you got there. Can I all you
dialog: sometime? If I fell blue.
text: A silence. And for a heartbeat, the fear. Did he hear it in my
dialog: voice? But no...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Sure. You got my number.
text: And now she's crying. But she can't. She can't. Gains control
dialog: for a whispered...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That I do. Always will.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mom...?
text: She sniffles...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm fine, ba...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Tomorrow? Can I have one
dialog: butterscotch pudding for dessert?
text: See her relief. Secret still safe.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Nope.
text: He's crestfallen.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We can only have two.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
text: Jackie is pushing her cart. Ben sits in it, pulling things off the
text: shelves. On automatic she's putting them back.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and
dialog: I call you mommy; and Rachel's real
dialog: name's Rachel...Then when I see her do
dialog: I say hi Stepmommy? And if my name's
dialog: Ben, how come you don't call me son?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (lost in thought)
dialog: Thursday's fine...
text: Frustrated, Ben CLIMBS OUT of the cart and trails behind Jackie.
text: He reaches for an apple off the BOTTOM of a huge display of Red
text: Delicious, and the whole thing comes TUMBLING DOWN. Shaken, she
text: looks around for Ben. He's gone.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET MANAGER'S STATION - DAY
text: Jackie with a Store Manager and a Policeman stand at the front of
text: the store near the Bakery. Jackie is totally distraught.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I looked away for one second...
dialog: Just one second...he's...he's...
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: How would you describe him?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He's my son! He looks like his
dialog: father! His name is Ben -- he
dialog: answers to Harry --
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Is he wearing a red shirt?
text: The manager POINTS to the frozen food bin. There, lying on his
text: back atop dwindling stores of Breyer's ice cream...is Ben. Hands
text: and beaming face PRESSED to the underside of the glass. Jackie
dialog: does the only reasonable thing...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: YYYAAAAAAAHHH!
text: ...and FLINGS OPEN Snow White's glass coffin.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD SUFFOCATE
dialog: IN THERE!!!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Nope. I got my warm t-shirt.
text: Enough of a non-sequitur to make everybody blink, before Jackie
text: YANKS him, roughly and tenderly, from the bin. She CRUSHES him in
text: a violent, desperate hug...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You found me cause I'm your
dialog: priority, huh?
text: She kisses him fiercely. At the edge of tears. Whispers...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You got that right.
scene_heading: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - 3 O'CLOCK PRACTICE

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Alright my Little Warriors, remain
dialog: calm; trust that the ball will find
dialog: you; remember they're your opponent
dialog: not your enemies -- Not kick MAJOR
dialog: butt!
text: In the bleachers, Jackie sits alone with Rachel. They are having a
text: coaching session of their own. Rachel points down to the field,
dialog: where...
text: ...Annabelle pushes her hair over her eyes.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She's gonna trip over her own feet,
dialog: if she doesn't get her hair out of
text: her eyes.
text: Jackie casts a sidelong glance at Rachel. Decides to tell her...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: Pushing her hair over her eyes.
text: Means she's avoiding a confrontation.
text: Rachel looks over. Really? Jackie decides to share more. Reading
dialog: Rachel's reaction to...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: If she's twirling it, she's playing
dialog: something out in her mind. If she's
dialog: stopped combing it, she might be
dialog: depressed...
text: As Rachel listens she's unconsciously twisting her hair.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What about obsessively picking her
dialog: split ends?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Anxiety.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Last week when she chopped her
dialog: Barbie's bangs all to hell --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: She was angry at herself.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Jackie?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: When I twisted hair like this it
dialog: means I'm intimidated by you...
text: Jackie gives her the trace of a smile.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'll keep it in mind, and use it
dialog: against you.
text: She looks back down at the game. Rachel watching her profile.
dialog: Finally...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You feeling all right?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (doesn't turn)
dialog: Not great. Plus, I've got things on
dialog: my mind. You know.
text: Things. Rachel doesn't know. Blurts...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Are you...seeing someone?
text: Jackie snorts a laugh. In spite of herself.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yeh, that does tend to make me sick
dialog: to my stomach. Actually, I'm, uh...
dialog: Thinking. Deciding if this is the time to say...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...thinking of going back to Random
dialog: House. On a part-time basis.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Wowie. How wonderful!
text: But Jackie still hasn't turned. Eyes glued to Annabelle, racing
text: around with determination.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, I could do most of it from
dialog: home. But, while I'm working it out
dialog: with the head editor, I'd need to...
dialog: Sighs. Boy, this is tough. Tries for matter-of-fact...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...make some trips into the city.
dialog: Sometimes, overnight.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
text: Jackie nods. Appreciates that. But she still hasn't turned to
text: look Rachel in the eye.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Uh. Have you told Luke and the ki...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Let's...hold up for a bit. It may
dialog: not happen. Our secret, okay?
text: A little strange. Particularly the hardness of Jackie's eyes.
text: Rachel watching her. Something's up.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Sure, if you like.
text: Jackie looks away now. To the playground just beyond the
text: bleachers. Kids rise swings, clamber over a jungle gym. But her
text: eyes are routinely, automatically, zeroing in on one single kid...
text: ...who is climbing his way UP a tall SLIDE. Crouched over as he
text: inches up the shiny metal surface, using the side rails. Rachel
text: follows Jackie's eyes, just as...
text: ...Ben reaches the top and STANDS UP, hands OVER his head, Jackie's
text: breath catching, Ben totters once and...
text: ...FALLS fast, hitting the grass with a thump we can hear, lying
text: crumpled, motionless, as our two women...
text: ...SPRING up as one, SCRAMBLING down the bleachers, RUNNING toward
text: the playground, Jackie initially in the lead, but Rachel out-
text: sprints her, CLOSING on the child, as he rolls over grasping his
text: leg, and reaching him first...
text: ...some instinct makes her hold back, let Jackie RUSH past her, to
text: kneel at Ben's side. She lifts her baby in her arms. His pants
text: are torn, his leg is bleeding. His own concern...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I can still go to Tucker's party,
dialog: right?
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
text: A full house of walk-ins with assorted needs, none of which appear
text: to require George Clooney on an urgent basis. Across the room, an
text: irritated Jackie finishes the last of the paperwork at the nurses
text: station. Exchanges a less-than-pleasantry with the less-than-
dialog: helpful duty nurse, and...
text: ...heads off through the crowd, DOWN a hallway, TURNS a corner, to
dialog: see...
text: LUKE stands by a doorway. Smiling, as he gazes into a hospital
text: room. Jackie comes to his side, looks in...
text: Ben doesn't see them. His back is turned, as he talks to Rachel,
text: who sits on the side of his bed, feeding him the pudding she got
text: from a vending machine.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: ...for Christmas, okay? Every
dialog: magician needs a white dove, a
dialog: real one, they do!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, that's a long way off, sweetie.
dialog: We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Dad! You can talk him into anything!
text: Unseen by the two, Luke grins. Then, Ben snuggles into Rachel's
text: arms and kisses her. Jackie stares.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (singing softly)
dialog: 'In the still...still of the
dialog: ni-ight...I held you... held you
dialog: so ti-ight'...take it, man...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (singing softly)
text: Doo-wop-doo-doo, doo-wop-doo-doo...
text: Jackie stands there. Her eyes are difficult to read. But she sure
text: is watching.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Nice, huh?
text: She steps back. Looks him in the eye.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It is. It's about time.
text: He give her a goofy give-me-a-break FACE. She twists the corner
text: of a smile.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She's a charmer, you'll see. In
dialog: fifty years, the kids'll love her
dialog: ten percent as much as they love you.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Stop. You're making me insecure.
text: Now they're smiling at each other. In the old way. A nice moment
dialog: for them.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You changed your hair.
dialog: And we notice. It does look different.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's temporary.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (grins)
dialog: It's good. You're not pulling a
dialog: mid-life crisis on us, are you?
text: Her look holds. An odd extra beat.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Not the term I'd use.
text: He glances back through the doorway...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You want us to take him tonight?
dialog: Give you some private time with
dialog: Annab....
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Never stand between that kid and
text: a meatball.
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: Yet another spaghetti night.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yeh, better I should forcefeed
dialog: him burnt lamb and...couscous,
dialog: was it she made him? Boy, kids
dialog: go wild for that.
text: She pats him on the shoulder...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'll drop him at Tucker's party
dialog: Saturday, if one of you guys can
dialog: pick him up. I have to go into
dialog: the City.
text: And breezes by him into the room. Ben wheels to see her...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You know what happens to spaghetti
dialog: when it waits around for you too
dialog: long?
dialog: He really thinks. Actually...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Pray. We never find out.

speaker_heading: RACHEL

text: A piece of CAKE FLIES through the air and LANDS on Rachel.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Now Ben, let Tucker play with his
dialog: Batcave...
text: Ben won't let go of Tucker's presents. Tucker tries to take it.
text: Ben is adamant. Rachel reaches for him, tousling his hair.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey Benjy boy -- chill.
text: (he shimmies away from her)
dialog: He's there already? No I don't want to
dialog: talk to him -- Duncan? How are you...
text: The mothers are all too aware of Rachel on the phone. Two kids
text: shoot water guns -- Rachel gets drenched. Ben pulls at the toys...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I want it!
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Ben I know you're angry and confused
text: but it's Tucker's birthday party.
text: Ben and Tucker fight for it -- the mothers all LOOK TO RACHEL.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ben --

dialog: Duncan I'm aware of that - Goddamn it
dialog: Ben! Let go of it. NOW!
text: He stares at her. It looks like he's gonna let go --
text: On the mothers -- impressed, not to mention surprised. When Ben
text: suddenly HURLS the toy onto the floor SHATTERING IT! A horrible
text: SILENCE falls over the room. Broken only by the sound of Duncan
text: SCREAMING from inside the phone.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN IN PHONE
dialog: Rachel...This is a big bloody account --
dialog: If you don't show up in five minutes...
text: Rachel takes Ben and leads him into another room.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

dialog: Now would you do us both a favor and
dialog: take this phone and...
text: She SLAMS the phone SHUT. Hands it to Ben.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...make it disappear.
text: Okay. He SHOVES it down the front of his pants. The peach moms
text: are taken aback. Rachel nods, you got it. Delighted, Ben turns,
text: scampers off, as...
text: ...his pants start RINGING. He stops dead. Looks down at them.
text: Still RINGING. He turns around and waddles delicately back to
text: Rachel, as if he's carrying nitro in his shorts. She holds out her
dialog: hand...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Breaks out the geiger counter, the
dialog: man is radio-active!
text: He pulls the ringing phone from his pants. She grasps it without

speaker_heading: RACHEL

scene_heading: NORTH POINT PRESS, 134 Sutter Street, San Francisco, California.
scene_heading: CHARLENE DRUMMOND, Editor.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (reads)
dialog: Jackie. Can't wait to see you here.
dialog: I know you're anxious. But it's going
dialog: to work out wonderfully, I promise.
text: Til then. Charlie.
text: HOLD on Rachel. Trying to put this together.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Jackie takes a kettle from the stove. Pours the water into a tea
text: cup. Then, fills a second cup. Drops a tea bag into each.
text: Carries both cups to...
text: ...the kitchen table. Where Rachel is waiting. She looks more
text: than tense. Actually, scared. Jackie taking this in, as she sets
dialog: down the tea.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Okay, what is this? If you want to
dialog: dump Luke on me, no sale. You're
text: stuck with him.
text: And before she can sit...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I know your secret.
text: Jackie FREEZES. To stone. No one says anything. Two hearts
text: beating at red-line.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I don't know wh...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I was looking for Annabelle's book,
dialog: and I found your tickets. And the
dialog: note. From your new boss.
text: My what? Jackie leans forward. Her hands resting on the back of
text: the chair she never sat in.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: My boss.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're not working at Random House,
dialog: I talked to them.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You WHAT?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're taking the kids. And moving
dialog: to San Francisco.
text: And Jackie has to laugh. Cold. Bitter.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Look, you've never liked me...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Don't flatter yourself.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And I know checking into your life
dialog: was inexcusable...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Nobody likes a snoop.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But I came here to...
text: All the air comes out of this young woman. so vulnerable, so real.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...to beg you. Not to do it.
text: And at this. A look of intense interest crosses Jackie's face.
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'd have thought this was the
dialog: answer to your prayers. Lose the
text: witch, and her two brats, in one
text: swoop. Problems solved.
text: Rachel is clearly distraught. This is no act.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You can't take Luke's children
text: away from him.
text: Jackie thinking. Reading this girl's face.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Bi-coastal parenting. Happens every
dialog: day. Luke gets the kids every other
dialog: summer, every other holiday, it's not
dialog: ideal, but people make it work, and...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (blurts)
dialog: We can't live like that.
text: And Jackie straightens. Cocks her head.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Did I hear the word...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Luke. Can't live like that.
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Then let him talks to me. We don't
dialog: need you to solve our prob...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: ...it's my problem, too.
text: And Rachel's eyes. Fill with tears. She hates that. Jackie won't
dialog: take her off the hook. Stands waiting, until...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I got used to...thinking of them.
dialog: As...my kids too.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Really. By what right? Six months
dialog: of part-time screw-ups?
text: Rachel lifts her chin. Defiant and tender at once.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No right at all. I just love them.
text: Now it's Jackie's eyes. That begin to fill. And she hates that
dialog: even more.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: There's so many publishing houses
dialog: in New York. Surely, you could find
dialog: a good one?
text: Jackie takes a step back. Shakes her head. Goddammit, life is
text: full of surprises. She walks around in a little circle. Turns
dialog: back...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Sure, I could. If I was looking
dialog: for one.
text: Rachel's turn to be surprised. Confused.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're a moron, kid. You guessed
dialog: the wrong secret.
text: An odd, almost defiant look. Jackie reaches up to her own head,
dialog: and...
text: ...slowly, holding eye contact all the way, she slips the wig from
text: her head. Her scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo-
text: therapy has left her. You can hear Rachel's GASP clear to Kansas.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Charlie Drummond used to be a
dialog: colleague at Random House. I'm
dialog: crashing at her place, while I take
dialog: some new protein injections my
dialog: oncologist recommended. I can only
dialog: get them in San Francisco.
text: Rachel's lips part. But no sound comes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Life's a trade-off. You get cancer,
dialog: your hair falls out, but you do get
dialog: to smoke dope.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (please)
dialog: You're not dying.
text: The kid so painfully sincere.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No such luck. I'm beating the shit
dialog: out of this. Pardon my French.
text: Rachel can't find her breath. She is clearly the worse off of the
text: two, in this moment. Then she starts to nod...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You bet you are.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: How the hell would you know?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don't, but...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: How would you know anything?
text: That was sharp. Rachel startles slightly.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I exercise, I eat the healthiest
dialog: foods, you live on pork rinds and
dialog: Ho-Ho's, and I've got cancer!
text: That leaves a silence.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And cigarettes. I smoke, too.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You are marrying the greatest guy
dialog: who walks this earth. Who I have
dialog: loved from my heart for twelveyears!
dialog: Listening?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And you walk in. You smile that
dialog: smile. You move that boy. And
dialog: he's yours for free.
text: She sags back against the counter.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And you. Love my kids. How fucking
dialog: touching.
text: Comes forward. Stalks her.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: They came out of my body!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: See, I know that.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I have given them morelove and
dialog: more care every fifteen minutes of
dialog: their lives, than you could manage
dialog: in the next fifty years!
text: Leans over the table. Rachel looks scared to death.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Okay, I'm undeserving.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ironic, huh?
text: And staring in Rachel's eyes, Jackie's fierceness fades.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ironic, that I'm gonna need you.
text: All the air comes out. Her heart as naked as her skull.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: To be a little less. Undeserving.
text: The look holds. And holds.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Drink your tea while I go vomit.
text: And turns, goes to the door. Turns back.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You love my kids, that's a start.
dialog: (nods)
dialog: We'll work on it.
text: And gone. Hear her footsteps. Climbing stairs. Rachel lifts her
text: cup. Looks at it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: This is very good tea!
text: Then tastes it. Makes a face.
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - EVENING

text: on those who enter the heavy, bright red wooden door.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - EVENING
text: Drinks hour. Upscale crowd. Dim lights, clink of glasses, the hum
text: of private conversations side-by-side. Civilized as hell. And at
dialog: the deuce by the window...
text: ...the man's head is down. We can't see Luke's expression, as he
text: stares at his clenched hands. We don't need to.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I thought a phone call was
dialog: inappropriate.
text: No one smiles at the irony. Not much to smile about.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I could have taken you to that
dialog: restaurant, but it would have
dialog: been a waste of money.
text: He loos up. She studies the pain.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I know. I wouldn't know what to
dialog: say. If it were you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: We're going to win this.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (straight back)
dialog: Walk in the park. And thanks for
dialog: the 'we'.
text: Tears fill his eyes. None in hers.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You're not alone in this. You're
dialog: not alone. Jesus, you're not alone,
dialog: okay?
text: Jackie swallows. Tries a smile that doesn't get halfway there.
text: Looks down.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What happens next?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I live or I die.
text: Looks straight in his eyes. We don't need the bullshit. Not us.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Tell the kids together?
text: She thinks. A barely perceptible nod.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Want Rache someplace else?
text: On that one. She has to smile.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: My compliments. On your learning
dialog: curve.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Jackie carrying two steaming MUGS from her stove. These have
text: marshmallows floating in them. She sets them down in front of her
text: children. Ben starts plucking the marshmallows out of Annabelle's
text: mug. Annabelle doesn't care, too busy video taping...
text: ...her father. Who sits with this tender, compassionate, and
dialog: therefore rather ominous smile. Doesn't take a smart kid like his
dialog: daughter to guess...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: So what's up? Who's marrying who
dialog: this time?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Mommy's marrying Rache!
text: He's happy. Jackie reaches and shuts OFF Annabelle's camera. And
text: the directness in her gaze keeps the child from complaining.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (simply)
dialog: Mommy's sick, guys.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You have the WORST flu since...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I have cancer. Do you know what
dialog: that is?
text: He doesn't. Someone else does.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (real quiet)
dialog: It's what Grammy Lil died from.
text: Ben's eyes WHIP OVER to his sister. He sees the cold fear in her
text: face. BACK to Mom. She seems fine, calm, smiling even.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Grammy had a different kind.
dialog: There are lots of kinds. Hers
dialog: was very bad.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Is your bad?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Shut up. She's going to die.
text: But the anger in her eyes isn't for Ben. She is glaring. At her
dialog: mom.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Actually, I'm getting better already.
text: Straight. As if to an equal, an adult.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I had a lot of treatments, and
dialog: they weren't any fun, but the
dialog: tests show the cancer got smaller.
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: A lot smaller.
text: Annabelle cuts him an angry look. He's on her shit list, too.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So you're okay.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm still sick, but I'm better.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You lied to us when you nevertold us!
dialog: Ben hadn't thought of that. Nods now, yeh.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's right. And you're mad.
text: Annabelle just glares with all the hatred she can turn her fear
dialog: into.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I know how scared I get when
dialog: you're sick. So I waited to tell
dialog: you. Until it was getting smaller.
dialog: I thought that was best, maybe I
dialog: was wr...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You lied. If you lied then,
dialog: maybe you're lying now. I can
dialog: never belive you again!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Annabelle, never say 'nev...'
text: But Jackie's raised her hand. Jump back, Jack. The eye contact
text: with her daughter never breaks.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We make mistakes. And we forgive

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Where's Rache? It's Thursday,
dialog: we get to be with Rache!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (the diplomat)
dialog: I'd rather be with Mommy.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: She's dying and Rache is your
dialog: mother now!
text: She jumps up from the table. HISSES at her brother...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You are so STUPID!
text: And she RUNS, halfway to the door...
speaker_heading: LUKE
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE!
text: She turns, STARTLED at the anger in that.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You do NOT run out on your moth...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: YOU'RE WORSE THAN SHE IS! WHY
dialog: DON'T YOU JUST DIE, TOO?
text: And BOLTS from the room. In the silence she's left behind.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Annabelle's worse than everybody.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Rachel and Luke cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkness.

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well, I think you should tell him
dialog: you changed your mi...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: It's no biggie.
text: She's still watching. It's a French-language comedy. She can feel
text: his eyes on her. Never turns...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's just an assignment.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It's Anna Sui, you should be
dialog: doing it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Are you hungry? You could make
dialog: us something?
text: She's still never looked at him. He can see she's getting irritat-
text: ed. He says nothing.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's two solid months, around the
dialog: clock, Jackie needs some cover-
dialog: age, you're in a trial, what are
dialog: we talking about? There'll be
dialog: other assignments.
text: He kisses her hair and flinches slightly. Tries to pretend it's
text: because she's concentrating on the movie.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: They're my kids.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Great, wallow in guilt, you sure
dialog: you're not Jewish?
text: A long beat. He snuggles closer. They watch together.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She's not gonna die.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I know that.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jackie and Ben cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkened
text: room. It is not a French Comedy. They are, however, eating
dialog: popcorn.
text: The door opens. Annabelle stands motionless, composed. Her face
text: looks like she's been crying. She clears her throat...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I'm sorry you're sick.
text: From across the room. Jackie stares at her.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I can't hear you.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
text: THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
text: Jackie cups her hand to her ear. Shakes her head, can't hear a
text: thing. Waves, come on over. And slowly...
text: ...Annabelle does. Crawls up into the bed, on the opposite side
text: from Ben. Into her mother's arms. Jackie kisses her head, strong.
dialog: Big smile.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I said...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...I'm not deaf, y'know.
text: They grin at each other. Like equals. Jackie picks up the remote,
text: cuts OFF the sound. And when Ben turns to her...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: In the still...still of the
dialog: ni-ight...I held you...held
dialog: you so ti-ight...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's Rache's song!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Sugar. I was slow dancing to that
dialog: song before Rachel was even born.
text: Wow? Really? You bet. Annabelle chuckles.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You think she's the Queen of Cool?
text: Jackie shakes her head. Pulls down the covers, pulls up her
dialog: t-shirt...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Does she have a tattoo?
text: The butterfly. Just below her navel. Ben has seen this before, of
text: course. Touches it, with his small hand.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: He wouldn't know. I saw her
dialog: in the shower!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And...?
text: Ben looks to his sister. For the verdict. Annabelle shakes her
dialog: head. Nope.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: She is only the Princess of Cool.
dialog: Mommy is the Queen!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: She is but an arriviste.
text: A new word, apparently.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: A newcomer. She's still got a
dialog: thing or two to learn.
dialog: Annabelle nods. You betcha.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (resumes singing)
dialog: I held you...held you so ti-ight...
dialog: (to Annabelle)
dialog: You sing lead, you've got the voice...
text: She bumps head gently with Ben.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The stud and I will doo-wop.

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT
text: Parents streaming slowly in for a PTA night. They are chatty,

scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
text: Folding chairs set in rows. Parents taking their seats with coffee
text: and cookies. Up front, a table where a panel of speakers are
text: beginning to gather. A faded banner says PTA -- TENAFLY DAY SCHOOL.
text: Jackie is nibbling at a single cookie, when...
text: ...a figure slips into the seat beside her. Rachel is juggling a
text: coffee and maybe nine cookies. Drops one. Picks it up. Dusts it
text: off. Jackie is repelled, but has to smile.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Small world.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Luke's depo ran late. I promised
dialog: I'd take notes.
text: To prove it, she balances the cookies on her thighs, and produces a
text: notebook. Looks around, and in a conspiratorial near-whisper...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So I have to tell you something
dialog: in confidence...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're a cross-dresser.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That. And. Annabelle is over
dialog: her head. With Brad 'The Dreamboat'
dialog: Kovitsky.
text: Does a Groucho eyebrow move.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: She hasn't mentioned this.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She was afraid you'd make a big
dialog: deal out of it.
text: Jackie is hurt. Covers...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Moi?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Toi. They've been 'going out'
dialog: for two weeks.
text: Rachel breathless and happy. Jackie attentive.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: As you may know, 'going out' in the
dialog: six grade doesn't mean shit. They
dialog: don't actually go to a movie or
dialog: anywhere, they don't even eat lunch
dialog: together, it's just a declaration to
dialog: the world that they're...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...going out, yeh. I had kids of
dialog: my own, once.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Anyway. He walks up to her on
dialog: lunch yard today. And tells her...
dialog: publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
text: Jackie's mouth drops.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh, my God.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Right. Which is the whole point of
dialog: this 'going out' thing, so one of them
dialog: can dump the other one, and they can
dialog: imitate the whole passionate adult
dialog: soap opera tragedy, without ever
dialog: having to actually date.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: She's devastated.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Doesn't begin to describe it.
dialog: I mean, you've got cancer, this
dialog: is serious.
text: Rachel GRIPS Jackie's arm.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: She spent an hour in the girls' bath-
text: room, crying with eight of her closest
text: friends, who are sending the message
dialog: to every boy in the grade that Brad
text: Kovitsky is yesterday's toast.
text: Devours an entire cookie in one gulp.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So here's the point. I pick her up
dialog: from soccer, she tells me the whole
dialog: mess, and asks me what to do.
dialog: How about that?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And you said...?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Beats me. Ask your mom.
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: JACKIE

dialog: spend the rest of your life with?
text: Annabelle keeps her eyes on her eggs. A craftswoman.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: No, but I thought till Thursday.
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: A debate. Man's inhumanity to

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I could help with the debate.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (glum)
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (thinking it over)
dialog: Actually. I could only help him.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Every time I'm on the lunch
dialog: yard, and he's with twelve of
dialog: his retarded dorkface little

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You don't like his friends.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: ...they all yell 'There goes the

dialog: or some really clever cut like that.
dialog: Like it hurts my feelings.

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Not with my mouth open.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (softly)

speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And what do you do wh...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I call him a fartface or a pervert,
dialog: or something equally lame.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You have to ignore him.
text: And on this. Annabelle looks up.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He's not even there. You don't
dialog: see him, you don't hear him, you're
dialog: just too much of a woman to bother
dialog: with little boys.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: This is a joke, right?
text: Jackie shakes her head. Nope.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: All he wants is the attention.
dialog: When he can't get to you, he'll try
dialog: harder for a little while. Then,
dialog: he'll give up. It'll be no fun.
text: The kid blinks.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You think Rache would do that?
text: Takes Mom back a bit. Enough for her daughter to notice.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: It's just she's younger. Maybe
dialog: she remembers how to do this.
text: Jackie shrugs. Maybe. Annabelle studies her.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: This'll work, huh?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh, yeh.
text: Annabelle takes heart from her mom's confidence. Nods, with her

speaker_heading: JACKIE

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

scene_heading: EXT. YARD - DAY

text: We see a patch of red. And now a blue stripe. The wind reveals
text: more -- It's BEN CLIMBING to the very top of the tree. The calling

text: MISSES a branch -- causing a cluster of PINE CONES to FALL in front
text: of Jackie -- she looks up screaming --
speaker_heading: JACKIE
speaker_heading: BEEEENNNNNN!

dialog: Ma'am, my arm's going numb, maybe
dialog: you could loosen your grip just a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's absolutely out of the question.
dialog: BEN! I'M HERE!
text: The crane STOPS. Ben has climbed to the top branches of the trees;
text: they SWAY from side to side like a METRONOME.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Hello Ben. Your mother says you're
dialog: real good at disappearing --
text: Ben tries to climb a little higher -- Branches SNAP.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ben! Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now
dialog: stop climbing!
dialog: (He keeps climbing)
dialog: Ben listen to me...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No! I have to get there.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Where Ben?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Before you.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ben where do you have to get to?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Heaven. I have to tell him he's made
dialog: a mistake. He should take Grammy
dialog: Martha first. Or Grandpa Norman.
text: Jackie's heart breaks, unable to speak.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ben. God doesn't like visitors.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson.
dialog: She does this twenty times a day.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Oh.
text: Jessica begins to crawl out to him on the limb.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Oh yeh. It's in our official manual.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's right, Ben. That's why Firemen
text: have giant ladders and climb up
dialog: and down poles. They're like...
text: messengers... carrier pigeons...
dialog: between heaven and earth.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's good cause we need to hurry.
dialog: My mom doesn't have very much time
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Then you know what we should do?
dialog: We should go to the Fire Station
text: together and ring the firebell to
dialog: get God's attention.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Cause it's an emergency.
text: Ben opens his arms, teeters, and Jessica HAS him. She reaches him
dialog: out, and...
text: ...HANDS him to Jackie, alone in the cherry-picker. Jackie GRASPS
text: Ben, pulling him FIERCELY to her arms in a death grip.
text: From down below, the kids CHEER. The worst is over.
text: HOLD on Jackie, clutching her baby for dear life. Knowing it isn't.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jackie stands in the doorway watching her son -- her baby boy --
text: sleeping. She looks drawn, but even if her body would let her
dialog: sleep she couldn't.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: God...I will do anything...I will
dialog: go through any amount of pain you
dialog: give me. If you'll just let me
dialog: see them grow up.
text: A slow ragged breath.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Is that asking so damn much?
text: She leaves the room soundlessly. Ben stirs.
scene_heading: ANNABELLE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Annabelle sleeps soundly in the glow of a night light. Jackie
text: appears, leaning down to rouse her gently.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Annabelle...wake up honey...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (sleepy)
dialog: Mom? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Nothing sweetheart.
text: Jackie sits on the edge of the bed, stroking Annabelle's head.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I got Ginny Weintraub to come stay
dialog: with Ben.
dialog: Annabelle's puzzled look. Why would you do that?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: How'd you like to go someplace
dialog: special with me? Right now.
scene_heading: EXT. NORTH VALE STABLES - NIGHT
text: The light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see Jackie
text: and Annabelle sitting on a horse. Annabelle in front, Jackie with
text: a strong hold on her. Both have their nightgowns tucked into their
text: jeans, coats over them.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Hold tight, sweetheart.
text: She KICKS the horse forward and they HEAD OFF toward the rolling
text: hills in the distance. Jackie and Annabelle ride faster and faster
text: along the trail. Jackie has one arm firmly around Annabelle's
text: waist and controls the horse with the other. Jackie closes her
text: eyes for a moment, allowing the wind to wash over her. The smells
text: and sounds of the night seem to free her, give her strength.
text: Annabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight.
text: Jackie soon joins her, and the sounds of their laughter break the
text: silence of the night.
text: They come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the
text: tears on Jackie's face. Annabelle can't see, and stares out at the
text: moonlit valley before them.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm never, never going to forget this.
text: Annabelle snuggles back. Happy.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Never say never.
text: Jackie kisses the top of her baby's head.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're old enough to learn the
dialog: loophole. You can say 'never,
dialog: never'. If you mean it enough.
dialog: To say it twice.
text: Annabelle yawns. So content in her mother's arms.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I'll remember. Always, always.
text: So Jackie grips a little tighter. Breathes a single word, just
dialog: loud enough to hear...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Promise.
scene_heading: EXT. JACKIE'S HOUSE - DUSK
text: Rachel and Luke heading up the path to Jackie's door. It is early
text: winter. Stark trees, a light snow on the ground. Rachel pulls her
text: coat tighter around her.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S FRONT DOOR - DUSK
text: Ben rumbling down the hall to the door. Stands in front of it, as
text: the bell RINGS again.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: IS THAT YOU?
speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
text: IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY,
speaker_heading: OPEN UP.
text: So he does. Gives her a sweet hug.
speaker_heading: LUKE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey. Remember me?
text: He enters behind her. SCOOPS his body in the air.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (John Wayne)
dialog: Listen up. That's a pretty big love
dialog: you're givin' my best girl, pard.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (Clint)
dialog: Listen sideways. I love her and
dialog: you love her. Now what are we
dialog: gonna do about it?
text: They follow Rachel down the hall...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (Mister Rogers)
dialog: We'll share. Like good neighbors.
text: They enter the living room. Annabelle sits sullenly in front of
text: the TV. Her overnight duffle and book bag and coat piled beside
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey, gorgeous, where's Big Mama?
text: No answer. Annabelle worried about something.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She still packing for her trip?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I killed my math quiz, A-minus.
text: They slap FIVE. Go through the ritual of a three-step black guy
text: handshake.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And...other things? At school?
text: Annabelle cuts a look in Luke and Ben's direction. Please not in
text: front of the menfolk.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We'll talk. I'll go check
dialog: on Mom.
text: Annabelle frowns at Mom's name. Rachel strokes her. Heads down
dialog: the hall...
text: Knocks at the open door to Jackie's bedroom, where Jackie is
text: calmly, meticulously, laying out things beside her large open
text: suitcase. She waves Rachel in, and keeps working.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (checking out the
dialog: stuff)
dialog: It's gonna be cool, huh?
text: Bulky sweaters. Wool things.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I can never figure weather. Last
dialog: trip, I made all the wrong choices.
text: Rachel and we have a better angle now. Jackie looks awful. Drawn,
text: weak, masking pain with obvious courage.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Bad day?
text: Rachel sits on the edge of the bed. Jackie turns away, goes to her
text: open chest of drawers.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Can't complain.
text: Even her voice is carefully under control. Awkward, Rachel looks
text: around the room. A stack of photo albums, scrapbooks, open. Works
dialog: in progress.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Can I look at the pictures?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's a mess, right now. That's
dialog: my project when I get back.
text: So quiet, we can hear a clock TICKING nearby. Rachel's gaze
text: returns to the bulky sweaters. Holds there.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: See, I'm not going to Houston,
dialog: after all.
dialog: Like you obviously figured out.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: There's this clinic in Montreal.
dialog: We've studied their process, we
dialog: like their success rate...
text: Two women nodding, in a calm, matter-of-fact way. As if discussing
dialog: recipes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: They combine some compounds that
dialog: have been getting results in France,
dialog: with vitamin injections. Seems to
dialog: activate the chemo...
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So. Hopeful.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's promising, this one. We're
text: upbeat.
text: Rachel swallows. She's out of words.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I really look like shit.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You look sick. But you look...
text: together. Mentally tough.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yeh, that's bull. I'm going for
dialog: serene, they say some actually get
dialog: there.
text: A shrug. The first bitterness to seep through.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Prob'ly low percentage on mothers.
text: She sits, unceremoniously, right on the floor. Pantomimes a smoke.
text: Rachel goes into her bag.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You try to center on the big issues,
dialog: y'know. What it's all about. What
dialog: this whole trip has meant. But then,
dialog: the really big issues keep swamping y...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Brad Kovitsky.
text: Tosses Jackie a pack. Matches next.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You don't have any pot, I s'pose?
text: Rachel's eyebrows head north.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The primo stuff is great for pain.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I think my 'primo shit' got left
dialog: in my 'bellbottoms.'
text: Jackie lighting up. Deep soulful drag.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: So. She ignores this little Kovitsky
dialog: punk, takes the high moral ground...
text: Reading Rachel's face. Who is already wincing.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (yeh)
dialog: He's relentless. A major asshole.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: And you said...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What else? Keep on keepin' on.
text: Oh. Rachel tries to hide her disappointment.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: She has to stick with it. Have
dialog: the patience, the guts, to ignore
dialog: the pain. You disagree?
text: Half a beat. Rachel shakes her head, nope.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Hey. You oughta know.
scene_heading: INT. LUKE AND RACHEL'S DEN - NIGHT
text: Luke sits with Ben, building a gigantic magic castle from a million
dialog: Leggos. I's architecturally interesting. Through the window
text: behind them, a cold winter rain.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (O.S.)
dialog: God, sorry I'm so late...
text: She is entering, peeling off her jacket. Tired as hell.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Duncan is doing his Himmler
dialog: imitation on this gig. I got
dialog: yelled at for quitting at eight.
text: Under Luke's patient exterior, the stress is showing. As Ben
text: watches, he replaces a key piece of the turret...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeh, well, I'll be up all night
dialog: on this brief. And then...
text: He shoots her a really sorry look...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I've got a morning plane to Boston
dialog: for the depo. Back Sunday night.
text: Wow. They lock eyes in the bond of 'what are we gonna do?'
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I made that paella you liked.
text: It's on the stove.
text: She kisses Ben's head, Luke's mouth, that one lingering a little.
dialog: Then, down the hall to...
text: ...the kitchen. Annabelle sits with her homework stacked,
text: untouched. Staring out the dark window. Clearly, this is worse
dialog: than death.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Lemme guess. A bad hair day.
text: Annabelle TURNS like a hunted animal...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: She told me to keep ignoring him!
dialog: So I did it!
dialog: Not a good result, huh?
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You know what that creep and his
dialog: frogfaced footmen are calling me
dialog: now? In front of the whole world?
dialog: Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's so weak.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Here's weak...Mom said she was

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Honey, she won't d...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I told her if she pulled that,
dialog: I'd kill myself, and she could
dialog: go to my funeral for a change!
dialog: For a change. That's where this is coming from. Rachel reaches
text: her arms around her...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: Hey. Hey. I've personally never
dialog: gone to a funeral. And I'm not
dialog: starting anytime soon.
text: The phone begins to RING...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Specially not in this family.
text: Keep RINGING. Rachel checks her watch. Shit.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Nine o'clock. That could be your

dialog: And real quiet...
speaker_heading: RACHEL

scene_heading: INT. ANNABELLE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Annabelle lies on her bed in darkness. Clutching her pillow.
text: Lights streams in as Rachel enters. Sits on the bed, next to this
text: furious child. Puts the cordless phone by the pillow.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Annabelle, I know you miss your
dialog: mother. So why don't you say hello.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Why don't you say hello?

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: You think this is funny?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No. I think it's ugly.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

text: Rachel cooks her head to one side, like she's seen Jackie do.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Stepmother. You think that means
dialog: you can step on me? Over me? That
dialog: you're one step ahead of me? Well,
dialog: you're not.
text: Strong voice. No smile at all.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You know when girls grow into women?
dialog: When they have to. And this is your
dialog: moment, kid. Ready or not.
text: Picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (low)
dialog: Your mama is in a hospital, far away.

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

dialog: it was the worst instant of my
dialog: total life on Earth!!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I know. I know how rough life can be.
dialog: And how unfair. So here's what we do.
dialog: Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk
dialog: straight up to that little jerk...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: And bring my knees up, real hard, yeh?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No, that never solves anything. You
dialog: talk like the big girl you are. About
dialog: what you feel. And how he's hurt you.
dialog: You know? You tell the truth.
dialog: Nodding to herself. Knows this is right.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You use your words.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

text: Duncan and his client watch as Cooper assists Rachel, who SHOOTS
text: the menagerie from low ANGLES. At last, she lowers her camera.
text: Check her watch. Shoots Cooper a knowing look. And HANDS HIM the
text: camera. WAVES to her subjects...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I love you guys. You're animals!
text: And starts WALKING OFF down the tunnel. Duncan looks at his

dialog: idea...
text: She leans forward. In his face. So she barely has to murmur.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I. Quit.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You can't do that, I won't let you!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, no, no, this is a job that's
dialog: hard to keep, not a job that's
dialog: hard to lose, can't be both.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Rachel, don't do this, you will

text: She thinks that over. For half a second.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Actually. I just did.
dialog: And without further fond farewell...
text: She is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR POOL LINE, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (looking around)

dialog: fucking heart out!
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: No, his mother's always on time.
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: And Mom says anger never, never
dialog: solves anything. It makes every-
dialog: thing worse.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's because your mother is a
dialog: fine person, finer than I will
dialog: ever be. Now, just this once...
dialog: Just this once.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: If I tell you what to do. Can we
dialog: cut a deal?
text: Annabelle stops crying. This is what she has prayed for.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

dialog: my words.
text: The sun dawns. On a child's face. Rachel brushes the tears away.
dialog: They won't need them anymore.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Okay, let's start with looks. I
dialog: know he's handsome, but the best-

dialog: always something they're insecure
dialog: about.
text: Annabelle shakes her head. Nothing.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Does he have zitz? We can call

dialog: Nope. None.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Help me here...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Uh. He thinks his nose is too
dialog: big. But it's not.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: In high school.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: He'll be impressed. The clincher is,

text: And Jackie LEAPS out of the wheelchair, RUNS across the distance,
text: runs to SCOOP her babies in her arms...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's a miracle! I can walk!
text: Annabelle laughs. Ben covers Jackie with kisses. Rachel watches.
text: From the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S HOME - DAY
text: Rachel carrying the suitcase, Jackie has each kid by the hand, as
text: they troop through the house to arrive at...
text: ...Jackie's bedroom. Where Jackie freezes. Her mouth OPEN. For
dialog: Rachel has...
text: ...HUNG striking black and white PHOTOS of the children all OVER
text: the room. One is of Ben's FEET, left shoe on right foot and vice-
text: versa. Another glimpses Annabelle's beautiful FACE hidden in her
text: hair. Ben sitting in a cupboard. Annabelle a bold ear of corn.
text: Ben sitting on the bottom limb of the huge evergreen. Annabelle
text: kissing her horse's muzzle.
text: Jackie just stands. Trying not to cry.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Okay. These are good.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I helped.
text: She know he did. Looks across the room at Rachel. No more words.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Let's go to the park!
text: Jackie sighs. Smiles down at him.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I've got a lot of medicine in me,
dialog: sweetie. And I'm a little wobbly for
dialog: driving or running ar...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Rache can do that part.
text: Jackie absorbs that. And all it portends.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: ...go to the park. In the worst way.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Well, with Rachel driving. That's
dialog: how we'll go.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY
text: LONG ANGLE...five swings in use. In four, the kids are pushed by
text: moms or nannies. In the fifth, Ben is pushed by Annabelle. Guess
text: who's going the highest. PULL BACK to...
text: ...two women on a bench. Under a starkly bare tree. Jackie is
text: drinking in the air, the cold, the day. Rachel watching that.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Serene. You're getting the hang
dialog: of it.
text: Jackie doesn't answer for a beat. Almost as if she hasn't heard.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Serene means you accept.
text: Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Part of me hasn't quit yet. And
dialog: the other part is still pretty
text: outraged.
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: When it's not terrified.
text: Watching the world of moms and kids. Who are not terrified.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I'm thinking. Do I know you well
dialog: enough to really chew you out?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No.
text: Jackie turns to her. Diamond laser glare...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Have you lost your mind?! You fought
dialog: years for that job! And you quit??
dialog: Oh. That.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's just not the right time t...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Do what you've worked your whole
dialog: life to do?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It was just a job, there'll be plenty
dialog: of others.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You mean, after I'm dead?
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm
dialog: sure as hell not gonna. I just
dialog: mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Juggle it! Move the darkroom into
dialog: your house. You've got that room
text: downstairs with the treadmill Luke
dialog: never uses anyway. Don't lose your
dialog: confidence. Don't lose your edge.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's the same choice you made.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Yes. I made the choice that was
dialog: right for me. And I don't regret
dialog: it. But even for me, there were
dialog: days when I felt so lost, so invis-
dialog: ible. And then I'd hate myself for
dialog: the kids not being enough.
text: Reading Rachel's face.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (softer)
dialog: I know you, huh? The car pools,
dialog: he measles, the PTA. It's not
dialog: gonna be enough for you in the long
dialog: run. You have to think long term.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I just want to spend time with
dialog: them when I'm not rushing or on
dialog: the phone or tired or...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's motherhood. That's the
dialog: job, with or without a career.
dialog: I'm telling you the biggest gift
dialog: you can give them is your happiness.
dialog: They need you to be happy.
dialog: Can you hear me?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Cause if you're not, the easiest
dialog: person to blame is the guy sleeping
dialog: next to you. And you'll push him
text: away, and then hate him even more
dialog: when he goes, until finally you have
dialog: no choice but to leave. And that
dialog: can't happen.
text: Rachel's turn to wonder. She starts to say something, thinks
dialog: better of it. Asks instead...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's the bottom line, isn't it?
dialog: I can't make a mistake. Because
dialog: it'll screw your kids.
text: Glances over.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: My advice to you? Don't die.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Feeling the pressure?
text: Rachel's eyes move across Jackie's face. Then, out to Ben, on the
text: distant swings.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Last time I pushed him? He said,
dialog: 'Higher, Rache. It makes my penis
dialog: sting.'
text: Thin smile. Now it's Jackie watching Rachel's profile.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm gonna buy him that white dove
dialog: for Christmas. If I don't, you'll
dialog: get him a fucking eagle!
text: Jackie keeps watching her. And in a quiet voice...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Ben was born in two hours, went
dialog: right to my breast and camped
dialog: there for three days. Always with
dialog: this...mischievous look...
text: Watches Rachel nodding, absorbing.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Somehow, his blanket always looked
dialog: like a cape, even the nurse said
dialog: that. He loves to hear that story,
dialog: over and over. How he was born a
dialog: magician.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly, never turning)
dialog: And her...?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Took 28 hours. She just wasn't
dialog: sure about entering this world.
text: Watches the feeling well in Rachel's eyes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The doctor wanted to go in and get
dialog: her, but I knew she'd come in her
dialog: own time.
text: Rachel nods. It fits.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's who she is. Don't let
dialog: anybody rush her.
text: Silence. A murmur...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'll keep that in mind.
text: Rachel settles back. Her eyes now locked away somewhere private.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What?
text: Rache smiles. That Jackie sensed something.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's not about the kids.
text: Looks over. Decides whether to ask...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That thing you said before. Pushing
dialog: the guy sleeping next to you away.
dialog: Because of what you gave up for
dialog: motherhood...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Is that what he told you?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: He won't discuss it. Just calls it
dialog: history.
text: A trace of edge to Jackie's smile. But no real anger.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, he got that part right.
dialog: Looking. Looking.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So what's the part he got wrong?
text: An urgency in that.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I got all day.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - TWILIGHT
text: Luke and his bulky briefcase, coming down the stone steps two at a
dialog: time, until...
text: ...he sees her. In her winter coat. Smoking as if it could keep
text: her warm. And despite her tension, he grins, heads over.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What a great surpri...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hold your applause. We're not
dialog: having fun, here.
text: And from her face. She means every word.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Is Jack okay?
dialog: Great. Just what she wants to hear.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh yeh, she was cracking me up.
text: Dishing details of her sordid
dialog: little divorce.
text: Ah. A beat. To assess the damage.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And you freaked. A little.
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Just like to make sure. That your
dialog: past. And my future. Are real
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Well, they will be.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (hard and low)
dialog: Imagine my relief. So what's for
dialog: dinner?
text: He sighs. Jesus.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Why in the world would she t...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You took a fishing trip with the boys.
dialog: Liked it so much, you took another.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I needed some time away.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...while she watched the kids. Then,
dialog: you booked this flat in Paris for your
dialog: family's summer. But she said...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (weary)
dialog: '...the kids have camp. Their friends
dialog: are here. Over there, I'll just be
dialog: shopping in a language I don't even
dialog: know. My life, and the kids' lives,
dialog: aren't here to service your mid-life
dialog: crisis.' Did it go like that?
text: It did. People are passing them. They do not notice.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She called it a fight. The fight.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What do you call it? You told her
dialog: you had doubts.
text: He looks around. People are moving on. Toward their drinks, their
dialog: dinners, their lives.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Can we go sit somewhere?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Let me put it this way. Hell, no.
text: And takes out her cigarettes. Her fingers fumble slightly. It
dialog: isn't the cold.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I told her I loved her.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: By way of saying you were unhappy.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Restless.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Excuse me. 'Things are so confusing
dialog: for me, Jack. Our life feels too
dialog: comfortable, too safe, too predict-
dialog: able. It's a partnership, it's
dialog: juggling schedules. When I think of
dialog: playing that out, every day, for the
dialog: rest of my life...'
text: Dead at his eyes. And he nods. Once.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: '...I don't know if I can make it.'
dialog: That's what I said. But I didn't
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, she threw you out. What a
dialog: difficult woman.
text: Pulls out her box of matches.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So now I get to wait...
dialog: A single match...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: For the first sign. The first
dialog: fishing trip...
text: STRIKES it. Shields it from the wind.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: What do you figure, Luke? When
dialog: am I too old to be exciting? When
dialog: your daughter brings home her college
dialog: roommate?
text: Lights her cigarette. As he watches.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: That's a pretty ugly thing you
dialog: just said.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No, here's ugly. 'I love you, babe.
dialog: It's just our life together I'm not
dialog: so sure about...'
text: Big draw. Never wavering from his eyes.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: 'But keep dancing, and if you're
dialog: lucky, I might just never leave,
dialog: who knows?'
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That's not us.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Because you've changed so much.
text: He puts his hands on her, gently. But she flinches. So the hands
dialog: come away.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You want me to show you the future.
dialog: Well, I can't darlin'.
text: I can't. She searches the lovelight in his eyes. As if she could
dialog: weigh it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: We make our lives, one step at a
dialog: time. We do the best we can. The
dialog: truth about the future? A promise.
dialog: Is only a hope.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: How about the promises we make to
dialog: our kids? About their future. Do
dialog: we shrug those off, just that easily?
text: That slows him down.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Maybe Annabelle deserves to find
dialog: out who really broke up her family.
text: While her mom is still around.
text: Stops him. Cold.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Hey. Just a thought.
text: Flips her cigarette to the gutter. Shrugs...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You got one less for dinner.
text: Takes a step back. Only one. But it registers.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Where you goin'?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm gonna get me a drink.
dialog: Nods, to herself.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And I'm gonna drink it alone.
text: And she walks off. Slow.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR POOL LINE, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
text: Ben alone in the back seat. Reading his beloved Garfield book.
dialog: Shift ANGLE to see...
text: ...the women standing by the car. Rachel looks a little anxious...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You really didn't have to come,
dialog: you know. I'd have brought them
dialog: straight t...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (staring at something)
dialog: Who in the world is he?
text: See now, across the way. A gorgeous BOY, dressed cool, stands
text: holding an expensive bike. And chatting happily with Annabelle.
text: In the distance, other kids pretend they aren't watching.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Looks nice enough to m...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
text: He looks familiar. Did he do a
dialog: Calvin Klein ad?
text: Across the way, the boy leans, kisses Annabelle sweetly on the
text: cheek. Waves to her. Peddles off. In distance, kids are dying.
text: Annabelle pretends not to know that. Just walks casually toward
text: us, but as she approaches, she can't help breaking into a RUN,
dialog: straight...
text: ...into RACHEL'S ARMS.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: It workeditworkeditworked! Omigod,
dialog: you can't believe the look on his
dialog: face!!!
text: SQUEEZING Rachel tight enough to crush her bones. And although
text: Rachel hugs back, although she kisses Annabelle's hair...
text: Her eyes are locked to Jackie's.
dialog: Houston. We have a problem.
scene_heading: EXT. JACKIE'S YARD - DAY
text: Rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set. She
text: is pacing in a circle, looking like a kid waiting to see the
text: principal. Sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen. She picks
text: a bottle of beer off the grass. Twists the top. Settles awkwardly
text: on the seat of the taller swing.
text: HEAR the screen door open. Bang shut. Rachel takes a sip. Before
text: she looks up...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (low, calm)
dialog: Now we're going to have a fight,
dialog: you and I.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Are we.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And I'm going to win.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (straight to her eyes)
dialog: Don't be too sure.
text: No anger in Jackie at this moment. The ferocity of that mother
dialog: lion. The strongest face we'll ever see.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Now, 'limp dick', I know. What.
dialog: Is 'snowballing'?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Because there'll be, oh, 20 or
dialog: 30 mothers phoning me in the
dialog: next hour or so. And they'll b...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Give 'em my number.
text: Jackie on the prowl around this swing. Stalking her prey.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Actually. They'll want Annabelle's
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is that what you're worried about?
dialog: Looking bad at the PTA?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You are defending what you did?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Right down to the ground. Let's
dialog: get to it.
dialog: Not quite what Jackie expected.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You put filth in my child's mouth.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Aw.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You had her lie about that...
dialog: that fancy-boy model!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Worked. Like a charm.
text: Jackie cannot even believe this.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: She was beaten, and bloodied, and
dialog: it was going to go on, uni...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: So you became the hero. And I
dialog: became the schmuck.
text: Straightening her spine...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You taught my child that I am some
dialog: limp dick loser. Who didn't care
dialog: about her pain.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's not wh...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You think I didn't have some dirty
dialog: words for that little putz? You think
dialog: I couldn't figure out some low blows?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You weren't passing 'em out.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, maybe your version of growing
dialog: up is 'Just win, baby'.
text: Stalking. Closer. Fierce.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Mine. Is a little different.
text: Right there. At the swing. In her face.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: See, in that crisis, I saw an
dialog: opportunity. For some real growth.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh please.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Shut the fuck up. I didn't go
dialog: behind your back.
text: The one scored. Rachel sips her beer.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Doing the right thing. Knowing who
dialog: you are, inside. Not caving to peer
dialog: pressure, or lowering yourself to that
dialog: level, steering your own course...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: She wasn't steering her own course,
dialog: she was steering yours.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, that's what parenting is about,
text: little girl. They are pleading to
dialog: know how they are supposed to do it.
dialog: And you sure as hell showed her.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And there will come another moment.
dialog: When the stakes are really there.
dialog: And she will look back on this. And
dialog: remember how good it felt. How easy
dialog: it was.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And she'll fight back again. God help
dialog: me, what have I done.
text: Jackie's voice drops. The softness makes it somehow more
dialog: menacing...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You've turned her into you. And
dialog: I may not get another chance. To
dialog: turn her back.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (suddenly fierce)
dialog: That's what it is. And that's all
dialog: it is.
text: The hand with its cigarette STABS out...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You won't get the chance.
text: Jackie back on her heels. Thinking. A mile a minute.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You've got a point there, for a
dialog: change. Oh, yes you do.
text: HER finger stabbing out.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You didn't get morning sickness for
dialog: seven months, you didn't breast feed
dialog: till your nipples fell off, you didn't
dialog: spend every minute of every day
dialog: thinking and planning and knowing that
dialog: your decisions were shaping the people
dialog: they were going to be...
dialog: And now Rachel. Has nothing to say.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You are gonna be taking Ben's training
dialog: wheels off. You are the one my little
dialog: girl will confess her first love to.
dialog: You will see them married, you will
dialog: play with their babies, you fucking
dialog: BITCH, I hate your GUTS!
text: The blast washes over Rachel. And in the silence...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Now you're talking sense.
text: She looks down at her beer.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: All year long, I've been watching how
dialog: you do this. The worries, the sacri-
dialog: fices, the signals you give them...
dialog: Thinks. Really thinks. Wants so much to say this right.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And I admire you. More than you'll
dialog: ever believe. And yet...this...
dialog: thing...has been growing. Inside me.
text: Looks up. Straight to her eyes.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: For better or worse. I'm not you.
text: And so she stands up. The swing shimmies in her wake.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I can't live my life channeling the
dialog: One True Mom after you're gone. I
dialog: can't do it. I can't do it. I can't.
dialog: Do it.
text: Sets the beer down. Stabs out her smoke.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We have to deal with that.
text: And walks off, slowly. Across the yard.
scene_heading: INT. INDOOR RIDING RING - TWILIGHT
text: Huge indoor space. Wood-sided walls, dirt floor. High corrugated
text: metal roof, with birds flying, roosting in rafters. A little GIRL,
text: under the keen eye of her TRAINER, puts her mount through its
text: paces. In the cold air, steam rises from the horse's body. It's
text: late, no one else around. TRACK now...
text: ...down a walkway. Toward the stables. A barn cat is crouched,
text: stalking prey. We hear a soft voice, speaking. One we know...
speaker_heading: LUKE (O.S.)
dialog: It was like telling her...
text: See him now. Standing awkwardly, against the side of a stall.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: ...that I didn't love her anymore...
text: See the horse, still steaming. Standing patiently.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: ...if I could be sure I'd always
dialog: stay.
text: Circling the horse now, we see Annabelle's back. She is slowly
text: brushing out the sweat mark. Where the saddle used to be. Her
text: movements are stiff, mechanical. The soft voice continues...
speaker_heading: LUKE (O.S.)
dialog: She said, 'This thing you call a
dialog: partnership. The schedules, the
dialog: chores, all the things we have to
dialog: work out...'
text: Our ANGLE CIRCLING to see at last Annabelle's face...
speaker_heading: LUKE (O.S.)
dialog: (softer)
dialog: '...for the kids.'
text: The tears that stand in her eyes. The set line of her small mouth.
speaker_heading: LUKE (O.S.)
dialog: '...that's the life I dreamed of.
dialog: And it's all I ever wanted it to be.'
text: She swallows. Because she will not cry.
speaker_heading: LUKE (O.S.)
dialog: That's the kind of person your mom is.
dialog: She's the best.
text: Annabelle says nothing. She drops to her knees. Begins to clean
text: out one of her horse's hooves with a metal pick. The only sound
text: against the stillness.
text: And her father watches. His heart pounding.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I complained a lot, baby. We couldn't
dialog: travel, we'd lost our privacy, our
dialog: chance to do things on the spur of the
dialog: moment. To live for...ourselves. The
dialog: way we'd started out.
text: He goes to her. The sound of his feet on the straw.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And she said. Sounds like you'd be
dialog: happier. If the kids weren't around.
text: Crouches down. Very close to his child.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I said. I love them more than
dialog: anything. But sometimes... I do
dialog: miss what I've lost.
text: Annabelle stops working. Turns her faces away.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She said she could never feel that
dialog: way, not for one single second.
text: So he leans closer.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She didn't want to be with someone.
dialog: Who could.
text: Silence. He's staring at the back of her head.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You know, this horse smells
dialog: really bad.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: There's worse things.
text: At least she can talk. If only just above a whisper.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Do you know why I never told
dialog: you all this before?
text: A beat. She doesn't look at him.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Sure. You wanted me to blame her.
dialog: Instead of you.
dialog: Waiting to hear...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (very softly)
dialog: That's right.
text: She hears honesty. And heartbreak. It makes her turn...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: How come you're telling me now?
text: He gets lost. Looking in those eyes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don't want to be wrong anymore.
dialog: I don't.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I want to say I'm sorry, because I am.
dialog: And let you hate me. If you have to.
text: She swallows hard. Her eyes moving over his face.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: See that feeling? Where you feel
dialog: two different things at once?
dialog: That's a grown-up thing. It's
dialog: not a lot of fun.
text: She shakes her head very slightly. And her eyes water.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Know why your mom never told you?
text: She doesn't.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She knew that you and her were
dialog: so...solid. Nothing could rock that.
dialog: But she didn't want to risk...
dialog: The hardest thing. He's ever had to say...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: ...your hating me.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Cos she loves you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Cos she loves you. She wanted you
dialog: to have a daddy to love. Even if
dialog: he didn't...completely...deserve it.
text: Now the tears in his eyes. And she's watching that.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You know how much love that is?
dialog: That she has for you.
dialog: Do you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: There's going to come a moment.
dialog: When she'll really need you to
dialog: give that back. And you're just
dialog: the girl that can do it.
dialog: The way he says this. Makes her ask...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Now do I know when?
text: He reaches. First time. Strokes her hair.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That moment will come. And your
dialog: heart is going to whisper, 'here
dialog: it is'
text: Winds his fingers. Around her hand.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And you'll come through.
text: She stares in his eyes. And dead straight.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: If I miss it, daddy? You clue
dialog: me in.
dialog: Okay, he nods. That's a plan.

text: The dimly chic bar. With its soft upscale buzz. Where Jackie
text: told Luke she had cancer. Tonight, she waits alone. Watching the
text: entrance. Nursing her drink. And then...
text: ...Rachel comes into the place. Spots Jackie across the room.
text: Weaves her way through the tables.
text: And she is there. Slipping into her seat. Not knowing what to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Thanks for coming out.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Neutral ground. What's up?
text: Jackie stares evenly. Her chin rests across the back of her
text: knuckles. She looks tired, but okay. Fueled by adrenaline.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Luke called. He says you're
dialog: checking out. Of the Heartbreak
dialog: Hotel.
text: The waitress appears. Rachel too locked into the moment to notice.
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: She likes a Stolie, no ice.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Double.
text: As the woman leaves...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What's this about? Because
dialog: we fought?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't flatter yourself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I always liked that line.
text: Signs.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I love Luke, I love the children.
dialog: But there is more to life than
dialog: even love...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No, there isn't.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And I have looked down the road.
dialog: At what my life will be. And I
dialog: can't handle it.
text: Jackie unblinking. Focused, strong.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What do you see? Down that road.
dialog: No answer. Then...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I never wanted to be a mom. Then,
dialog: sharing it with you was one thing.
dialog: Carrying it alone, the rest of my
dialog: life...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Is scary. But you want it. Gimme
dialog: some truth here.
text: The Stolie arrives. They wait a beat. The waitress disappears.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome,
dialog: huh? You die young, you always look
dialog: golden. Perfect. The memory kind of
text: burnishes the image, and...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff
dialog: who wouldn't help her own daughter
dialog: fight back?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Maybe I was wrong on that one.
text: That sits there. In its sincerity.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, maybe you weren't.
text: And so does that. Tears are forming in Rachel's eyes. Here, in
dialog: this public place.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Look, when I said I couldn't channel
dialog: you. That didn't mean I wouldn't give
dialog: my right arm to do just that.
text: Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Maybe I don't want to be looking over
dialog: my shoulder. Every day for twenty
dialog: years. Knowing someone else would
dialog: have done it right. The way I can't.
text: Jackie waits. Thinks.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Trade you a smoke. For a secret.
dialog: The way she said that. Something weighty behind it. So Rachel
text: reaches into her purse.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You know, I lost Ben awhile back?
text: In a supermarket.
text: Rachel's hand freezes. In mid-course.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're lying.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I lost him. I was panicked.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You are lying, you never lost that
dialog: kid for 4 seconds, you could find him
dialog: from a coma, there is no WAY!
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I was running around like a chicken
text: with my head chopped off. Doing my
dialog: imitation of you.
dialog: Rachel still not buying...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ben never mentioned it.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: He only remembers I found him. My
dialog: point is, telling you this story would
dialog: have been the kindest, most helpful
dialog: thing I could ever have done for you.
text: The smile fades.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Why didn't I?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Uh. You hate my guts?
text: Passing the cigarettes over.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We were competing. Even then.
dialog: Yes we were.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Instead of being partners. Watch-
dialog: ing each other's back. Seeing things
dialog: were covered.
text: Pulls out a smoke. Offers the pack...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're not scared you'll think you
dialog: don't measure up. You're scared
dialog: they'll think it. That's the JFK
dialog: thing, yeh?
text: Rachel takes one. Eye contact holding.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: With good reason. They fucking
dialog: worship you as it is.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What do I have that you don't?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Everything. You're...the Earth
dialog: Mother incarnate...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You're the hip and fresh.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You ride with Annabelle...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You'll learn.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You know every story, every wound,
dialog: every memory, their whole life's
dialog: happiness has been wrapped up in
dialog: you, every moment...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I have their past.
text: STRIKES the match.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You. Have their future.
text: Rachel stunned. By the simplicity of it all. Slowly, she leans to
dialog: accept Jackie's flame.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Don't you get it? You look down the
dialog: road to her wedding. You're in the
text: room alone with her, fitting her veil,
text: fluffing her dress. Telling her no
dialog: woman was ever that beautiful.
text: Tears now. Standing in two pairs of eyes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And your fear is. She'll be
dialog: thinking. I wish Mom were here.
text: Jackie lights her own.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: And mine is. She won't.
text: Her hand trembles as she takes a drag.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Now that's enough fear for either
dialog: one of us to kill the other. And
dialog: no jury in the world would convict.
text: Jackie raises her glass.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: We're guilty, girl. Of being human.
dialog: And we can't forgive ourselves.
text: Holds it forward. In a toast.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: But I forgive you.
text: And slowly, Rachel lifts her own glass. CLICKS it with Jackie's.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't rush me. I'm deciding.
text: SLOW DISSOLVE TO...
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING
text: White Christmas outside the window. Richly trimmed tree, presents
text: everywhere, carols softly playing. The whole nine yards. Luke and
text: Ben standing at a wrapped bird cage, where a dove is cooing inside.
text: Annabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed NURSE.
text: Rachel enters. Kisses Annabelle's head.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm gonna check on Mom.
text: Goes down the hall, every emotion in the world is playing across
text: her face. Into...
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM
text: Jackie lies on her death bed. She is beautiful and near the end.
text: Despite the IV tube, the monitor, she's gotten to serenity after
dialog: all. As close as any of us will ever get.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey, gorgeous. Time for the
dialog: presents?
text: Jackie licks her lips. Pretty dry. Rachel takes a cotton lemon
text: swab from the nightstand. Tenderly, cleans Jackie's mouth.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Now Edna says you short-changed your
dialog: last meds. You can do presents and be
dialog: comfortable at the same time, y'know.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (clears her throat)
dialog: Just want to be a little sharper.
text: For a few minutes.
text: A few minutes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Some things to say. To the kids,
dialog: huh?
text: Smiles.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Then, bring in the presents. We'll
dialog: have big fun.
dialog: Rachel can't really bear this.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You know, there's nothing you
dialog: have to say. Because they know
dialog: your heart. You don't have t...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Just sit me up. Nice and tall.
dialog: Bring Benjamin first.
text: Staring at each other. Then Rachel reaches her arms around
text: Jackie, and as gently as she can manage, lifts her to a full
text: sitting position.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Scrapbook.
text: Rachel brings the big book. Lays it on the bed. And goes.
text: Jackie begins to turn the pages. Her life with these children
text: passing before her eyes. No tears. No smile. Just full
text: attention. Fingertips touch the one she was looking for, as...
text: The door OPENS. Ben, hesitant, enters alone. His mother's face is
text: fine and strong and smiling.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Find the bird cage?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (standing there)
dialog: Rache says it's from you.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Well, don't make him disappear
dialog: before I see him.
text: Ben nods. Okay, I won't. She glances to the scrapbook...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Oh, look at this.
text: And forgetting his uneasiness, he runs over, climbs ONTO the bed.
text: Jackie doesn't wince, doesn't even blink. Nothing for his memory
text: bank but smiles. He looks at the photo...
text: ...Jackie holding a spunky newborn.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's you and me. Our first photo
dialog: as a couple.
text: He nods. Really staring at it.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Did you know I was good-looking
dialog: right away?
text: She reaches to hold his face in her hand. Stares in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: This good-looking. Was beyond
dialog: my imagination.
text: She leans. Kisses his lips lightly. How many more times will she
dialog: get to do this?
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (a murmur)
dialog: So what do you think we're gonna
dialog: talk about?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (straight back)
dialog: You dying.
text: She nods. Her smile is right there.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The secret of it. That only
dialog: magicians. Can ever understand.
text: His eyes brighten. The sadness pushed aside.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: See, when we die. Our body goes
dialog: away. Our body. But we...we are
dialog: not our body, are we?
dialog: He doesn't know. Maybe he thought we were.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: If a soldier loses his legs in a
dialog: war. Is he the same guy? Sure
dialog: he is.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But you can still see him.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Half. Of him.
text: This is so fucking hard. But her eyes stay dry.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Dying. Is where the whole body
dialog: goes away. So you can't see any
dialog: of it. But...
text: Rests her hand tenderly. On his hair.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What do magicians know?
dialog: Leans forward. Here's the secret...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Just because you can't see it.
text: Doesn't. Mean. It's gone.
text: Does it? And Ben smiles. He is inside the secret.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: The world. Thinks I'm gone. But
dialog: only the magician. Knows better.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So where are you?
text: She was waiting for this. For a long time. She wraps her hand
text: around his fist. And puts their hands against his heart.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Right here. Right here. Inside
dialog: the magician. Shhhh.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Can I talk to you? When you're
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Always. Always. And you won't
dialog: hear a voice. But in here. You'll
dialog: know. What I'm saying.
dialog: Yes, you will.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It's not good enough.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: No, it isn't. Because it isn't
dialog: everything. And we want every-
dialog: thing, don't we?
text: He nods. They do.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: But God does let us keep the one
dialog: best thing we have together. The
dialog: one best thing we've always had.
dialog: Know what it is?
text: He doesn't. But he wants to.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I love you. And you love me.
text: Comes closer. Nose to nose.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: It's worth a lot. Will you keep it?
text: He answers. With a kiss.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Luke and Annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle. Ben
text: runs in, falls on his knees by the puzzle. Without looking at
dialog: Annabelle, he tells her...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Your turn. It wasn't bad.
text: Annabelle looks straight to her dad. There is a moment, a silence,
text: that no one else could ever understand. She leans to him and
dialog: whispers...
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Here it is?
text: His eyes water. He takes her in his arms. Whispers close to her
dialog: ear, only the words...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Here it is.
text: She smiles at hi. Fear gone, filled with resolve. Gives him a
dialog: kiss. Rises, to...
text: ...follow Rachel down the hall. Rache wraps an arm around her big
text: girl. No words, except a murmured...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You can do this.
text: Voice cracking. She's not as good at it as this girl's mother.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You can do anything.
dialog: At the door. Open it, and...
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM
text: ...Annabelle enters alone. The door closes behind her. Her eyes
text: lock with her mother's. No words. Annabelle's eyes filled with
text: tears, and Jackie's arms...
text: ... REACH out, and Annabelle RUNS to them.
text: They hold each other. For a forever moment.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I don't want to say goodbye.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Don't. Take me with you.
text: And Annabelle looks up. Tears on her face.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Thank God. I got to see you.
text: Grown up.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I'm not.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: (very softly)
dialog: Let me be the judge of that.
text: And Annabelle climbs onto the bed. Their hands never stop touching
dialog: each other. Saying I love you.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: There's an amazing thing when a
dialog: woman has a daughter. One day you
dialog: look up, and you see...a sister.
dialog: Someone. You can say. Anything to.
dialog: Anything.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: I wrote a whole lot of letters. To
dialog: each of you. And the envelope says
dialog: when to open it. Like, which
dialog: birthday. Or...when you get your
dialog: driver's permit. First time you see
dialog: Rome. Things like that.
text: Things like that. Annabelle is beginning to lose it now. So
dialog: Jackie says only...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Keep Ben's for awhile, okay? Until
dialog: he's old enough to not open them all
dialog: at once.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
text: Until he's old enough to read.
text: Tears on Annabelle's face. Her mom wonders...
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Are you afraid for me? Where
dialog: I'm going.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Don't be. I'm going. Where we
dialog: all go. Now how can that be bad.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: I'll miss you so much.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Good. That's very good.
dialog: She nods, yes it is.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: What you're grown-up enough to
dialog: know. Is that people. Can do
dialog: two things at once. Okay?
text: She brushes at her baby's tears. Then tastes her wet fingertips.
text: Mmmn, surprisingly good. Annabelle sort of smiles.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You can miss me. And. Take me
dialog: with you.
text: Hold the child's face. In her hands.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: When you're in trouble. Have me
dialog: there. When you fall in love.
dialog: Have me there. You can.
dialog: Said with such absolute assurance.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: That's how we go on, you know.
dialog: Forever. Because someone takes
dialog: us along.
text: Annabelle swallows hard.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: On your wedding night. When your
dialog: babies are born. I want to be
dialog: there. Will you take me?
dialog: A straight question. It needs an answer.
speaker_heading: ANNABELLE
dialog: Always, always. Always.
text: A sigh. A shared smile.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: You made my life wonderful.
dialog: You.
speaker_heading: JACKIE
dialog: Take that with you, too.
dialog: Hold. On Annabelle.
scene_heading: INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT MORNING
text: The presents are here now, they fill up the room, spill over the
text: bed, where both children sprawl.
text: ...Ben RIPPING the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine,
text: Annabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to
text: hang it in the Louvre. She holds a tank top up to her chest, for
text: her Mom's approval. Jackie's not sure. Rachel handing up more
text: boxes, Luke in charge of bagging trash...
text: Ben's white dove, flying free around the room, zipping and diving.
dialog: No one cares. It's Christmas.
text: HOLD. Hold. And CROSSFADE TO...
scene_heading: EXT. CHAPEL - NIGHT
text: Family and friends are leaving the wake, exiting the softly-lit
text: chapel into a snowy night. They are saying goodbyes, kissing one
text: another, going to their cars. And saying her last goodbye...
text: ...Rachel turns to Luke. Whispers, close to his ear. He looks at
text: her for a beat, then leads Annabelle and Ben toward the car, as...
text: Rachel goes back into the chapel. Alone.
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL PARLOR
text: The room is nearly dark. One soft spot plays on a simple CASKET.
text: No canned organ music, no sound at all. As Rachel enters.
text: She goes to the casket. Stares down at it for a beat. And just
text: above a whisper...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: See, I told you I'd do this.
dialog: Only...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Only. Now I don't know what to say.
text: Her hand reaches out. A finger absently traces the edge of the
text: wood. It seems a gesture of unconscious affection.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You'd have written it down, so you
dialog: wouldn't blow it.
text: A slight smile. Here's where the love shows.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Maybe we should change places.
text: Nods slightly. Maybe we should. She takes a step back now, to a
text: waiting chair.
text: Sits. Her hands folded in her lap. Thinks.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well. We were less than friends, I
dialog: guess. And more.
dialog: More.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We were never...girlfriends, we
dialog: never dished. That wasn't. What
dialog: we had.
dialog: No apology there. It's just the truth.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We had some battles, man, they
dialog: were...world class, huh?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I don't regret a one of them.
text: Sad little shrug.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I miss them.
dialog: Thinking. Of how much more she'll miss.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: We've got our secrets, we have.
dialog: And I'll keep 'em if you will.
text: Crosses her arms. Lost in the moment.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But I wish we had one more night.
dialog: In that little bar, remember?
dialog: Remember that toast? Sure, you do.
text: Her voice wavers. But the eyes are dry.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Know what? I forgive me, too.
dialog: See? You're the magician.
dialog: A murmur...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't worry, partner, I've got
dialog: your back. We're covered.
text: It's what she came to say. CROSSFADE TO...
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: Lights and music and laughter. They're in black tie tonight. It's
text: a wedding party. Up on the stage, at the head table, some guy is
text: finishing a toast, and as everyone ROARS and CLAPS...
speaker_heading: BEST MAN
dialog: ...so TO THE BRIDE! Thank GOD
dialog: she's more than he deserves!
text: Everybody shouts THE BRIDE. Everybody drinks champagne.
text: And the bride stands up. In her white gown. In her hand, an
text: envelope. She goes to the mike, and waits for the raucous cheers,
text: the calls of SPEECH!, to die down.
text: Leans to the mike. Flushed and happy. And, oddly, nervous.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Now I know the tradition, so
dialog: this isn't a toast. At least...
dialog: not for me.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: The guest list is 114. But we
dialog: all know there's one more here,
dialog: tonight. Because...
text: Looks down the table at her children. Dressed to kill. Enjoying
dialog: the party.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...my two sidekicks there always
dialog: bring her along. Wherever they go.
dialog: Right? Right.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So Jackie and I were sitting
dialog: around. On New Year's Eve. And
dialog: she said, 'You're not gonna talk
dialog: at my funeral, are you?'
text: And now. It is quiet indeed.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: And I said, 'I've never been to
dialog: a funeral. I'm not sure I'll know
dialog: how to act...'
text: Her sweet smile. Keeps the mood right.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: '...but I'll prob'ly sneak into
dialog: where you are. Just before it's
dialog: over...'
text: Nods to herself. Fights back the feeling of that moment.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: '...say something. Just to you.
dialog: Get the last word in, when you
dialog: can't talk back.'
text: There is laughter in this room. Gentle, loving.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So she says, 'No way.'
text: Holds up the envelope. Holds it tight.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She wrote this. She sealed it
dialog: up, I didn't see it. She made
dialog: me promise to read it. At the
dialog: wedding.
text: And slowly, Luke begins to CLAP. And others join. And when it
dialog: stops...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I told her she'd better make it
dialog: dirty, or make it funny. Because...
dialog: no way...on my wedding...
dialog: No way in hell.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...could she make me cry.
text: APPLAUSE. They are loving it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She says, 'It's a deal'.
text: The band plays an impromptu FLOURISH. Rachel begins to carefully
dialog: tear open the envelope...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Now, if it's too raunchy, we may
dialog: have to excuse the kids...
text: SHOUTS from everyone, ESPECIALLY the children.
text: She has it open. She looks at it.
text: And everything. Stops.
text: The world watches her sway, watches her eyes fill as she stares at
text: the small card in her hand. She can't believe this...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (mouths to herself)
dialog: You promised.
text: The tears are welling. Everyone SCREAMS for her to read it. She
text: leans to the mike, shaking her head...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's...no big thing, really...
dialog: it's just...five words, it's...
text: The place goes happily UP FOR GRABS. A joyful RIOT of demand.
text: Tears STREAMING now, Rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded
text: bag. As she puts the card inside, we alone can read the words...
dialog: MY BABIES. ARE SO LUCKY.
dialog: HOLD on this. And...
text: FADE TO BLACK. ROLL END CREDITS.
dialog:
