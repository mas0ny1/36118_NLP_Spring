scene_heading: CASTLE - NIGHT
text: Now comes the moon riding over the horizon. Upon a hill at
text: the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework
text: bathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes
text: decorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the
text: walls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to
text: an ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light
text: dances ona leaded windowpane.
text: Inside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched
text: ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks.
text: Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with
text: strange animal heads.
speaker_heading: HODGE
text: Asleep ona straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables
text: and crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering
text: candle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently.
speaker_heading: CONJURING ROOM
text: This circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed
text: with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass
text: retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An
text: iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In
text: the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no,
text: moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for
text: a magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a
text: pentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up
text: comes an arm and a voice blurts out:

dialog: Come on, candles, out!
text: But the little flames stand at attention without so much as
text: a tremble.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi:
dialog: Lux! Exstinguat!
text: It's no use. There is a sigh and the figure moves forward
text: into the light. Revealed in the glow is the discouraged face
text: of Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.
speaker_heading: TOWER
text: Carrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular
dialog: staircase.
speaker_heading: TURRET
text: The highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the
text: stars and the night air. Here, more magic is afoot. An old
text: enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a
text: silver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples
text: disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at
text: once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and
text: thunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from
text: within the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as
text: the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in
text: the water — Draco draconis — suddenly squelched by the
text: roar of flame and an ugly snarl.
text: At that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds
text: up the candelabra.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Vide, Magister. There's something
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: wrong.
text: Ulrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the
text: basin and turns to confront his student. Galen is taken aback
text: by the old man's grim countenance.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: What's the matter? What's happened?
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: I've just seen something. Something
dialog: of consequence to you.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: To me?
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (calm)
dialog: Yes. My own death.
text: With a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Perhaps we had better hasten your

scene_heading: BARNYARD - DAY
text: Outside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens and
text: ducks. He straightens up and squints through the early morning
text: mists. On a distant hillock two figures are moving toward
dialog: the woods.
speaker_heading: ULRICH AND GALEN
text: Hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, Ulrich guides
text: his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the
dialog: forest.

dialog: transmutation?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: You have?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Well, almost.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: It's very difficult. Have you
dialog: committed to memory undying the Codex
dialog: de Profundis?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: (a shrug)
dialog: The first two chapters.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: It's long. And what about the Ritual
dialog: of Banishment as prescribed by my
dialog: late master Balisarius?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: To tell the truth, | haven't dared
dialog: try it. What's the point, anyway?
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: The point? The point is you don't
dialog: know it, and you're no magician
dialog: without it. It was my hope to school
dialog: you, to mold your faculties and
dialog: wits... | still believe you have
text: some talent. Somewhere.

speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: There's no time now. When I'm gone,
dialog: half the powers in the universe will

dialog: of a few lingering skills if they're
dialog: left in the hands of a child?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Listen!
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: | don't hear anything.
text: Ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a
text: decision. Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver
text: chain with an amulet dangling from it. He drapes it around
text: Galen's neck.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Here, wear this.
text: Galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. He cocks
text: an ear.
speaker_heading: GALEN
text: Voices, singing on the road.
text: He hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look.
text: Ulrich does not follow. Instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls
text: it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the
text: ground. Awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: | don't see anything.
text: He turns back, but the wizard is gone. A shadow falls over
text: him. He looks up. There, two hundred feet above the tree
text: tops his master is soaring on the wind.
speaker_heading: AIRBORNE
text: The old conjurer squints into the distance. Miles away and
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins
text: of the forest. They are singing a mournful round.
speaker_heading: GALEN
text: He gawks skyward. Suddenly, the old man leans down and
text: addresses him.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (a shout)
dialog: We have visitors!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ROTUNDA - NIGHT
text: Clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall
text: is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty
text: rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. Their leader is a fineboned
text: youth, not yet twenty. Like the others, he is uneasy; his
text: name is Valerian. Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before
text: them. He leaves without a word. The visitors stare glumly at
text: the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it.
speaker_heading: CONJURING ROOM
text: Galen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience. The sorcerer
text: peers at himself in a full4ength mirror, adjusting the hem
text: of a black robe.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Looks forbidding enough, don't you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Here are your sticks.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: No — they'll think me infirm. You
dialog: know, Balisarius wore this whenever
dialog: he changed lead into gold. He could
dialog: really do that, you know. | never
dialog: could. Too bad — you'd stand to
dialog: inherit some real wealth.

dialog: You're in a morbid frame of mind.
dialog: What's all this about dying? You
dialog: don't even look sick.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (tying on a sash)
dialog: You still wearing that amulet?
dialog: (Galen nods)
dialog: Good. Don't lose it. It still belongs
dialog: to me.
text: He backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto
text: his head.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Now, adeptus minor, get yourself a
text: handful of that sulphurous ash over
dialog: there...
text: The sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase.
speaker_heading: THE ROTUNDA
text: The visitors watch warily as a door swings open and Galen
text: makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed
text: together. He looks rather young to be the famous Ulrich.
text: Galen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide.
text: Ka-whump! and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky
text: fireball. Alarmed, the visitors retreat.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Nunc habeus lux!
text: Pffst! around the room candles flare in their niches.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Et calor!
text: In the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. Ulrich
text: totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward
dialog: the warmth.

scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: Welcome to Cragganmore. | am Ulrich.
dialog: Which one of you calls himself
dialog: Valerian?
text: The travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's
text: performance. The young leader of the party screws up his
dialog: courage and speaks.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: That would be me. We are here on
dialog: behalf...
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: | know why you're here. You're a
dialog: delegation from Urland, from beyond
dialog: Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts.
text: The travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions to
text: one of his companions. The man steps forward and hands over
text: a leather pouch. One by one, Valerian places the contents on
text: the table for Ulrich's inspection.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
text: A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire-
dialog: blackened.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Scales.
text: At this, Ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering
text: irridescent disks as big as saucers.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: All right. How did you come by these?
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: | found them. At the mouth of the
dialog: lair.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (grim)
dialog: What else?
text: Valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears
text: to be a curved sword. He jabs it into the table.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
text: A claw.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: That's no claw. It's a tooth. By the
dialog: gods!
text: He runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at
dialog: his visitors.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: And you want me to do battle with
dialog: that?
text: Valerian has lost all trace of timidity.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Who else can we turn to? We all know
dialog: what we're dealing with here. This
dialog: is a basilicok.
dialog: (he takes a step
dialog: forward)
text: A cockatrice.
dialog: (another step, bolder)
text: A dragon.
text: (he leans close to
dialog: Ulrich)
dialog: This is no stag, no bear, no natural
dialog: creature. This is one of your kind.
dialog: And only a necromancer such as
dialog: yourself can rid us of it.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Did you try the Meredydd sisters?
dialog: What about Rinbod? I've heard it
dialog: said he killed a dragon once.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: They're all dead. You're the only
dialog: one left.
text: With a sigh, Ulrich lowers himself into a chair. He rubs his
text: withered legs and shakes his head.

speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: It's a long way to Urland.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Every quarter, upon the solstices

text: Greil, a grizzled peasant, speaks up.
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: My daughter, for one.
speaker_heading: OTHER TRAVELERS
dialog: My sister... cousins...
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: All women?
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Girls. Virgins, to be exact, chosen
dialog: by lot.
text: Galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales and
dialog: tooth.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Master, don't you think —
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Silence!
text: He broods for a long time.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Are you afraid of dragons?
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: No. Sorcerers and dragons go backa
dialog: long long time together. If it weren't
dialog: for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any
dialog: dragons.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: All right. I'll go.

scene_heading: COURTYARD - DAY
text: The travelers are making ready for departure in the grey
text: light of dawn. As Hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box,
text: Ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: | know of this dragon. Vermithrax
dialog: Pejorative: she's four hundred years
dialog: old. As far as | can tell she's the
dialog: last of her kind. Very appropriate
dialog: that I'm the one to finish her off,
dialog: don't you think?
dialog: (he tries out the
dialog: crutches)
text: There. Flatten the highest mountain.
dialog: What say you, Galen?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Speak up.
dialog: (still no answer)
dialog: You, Hodge.
text: Hodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps packing.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (to Galen)
dialog: While I'm gone see you keep your
dialog: nose in your books and your hands
dialog: out of my reagents. Leave my
dialog: instruments alone too.
text: Galen crouches against the castle wall; he regards his master
text: sullenly.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Look at yourself. How far will you
dialog: get like that? A league, two leagues?
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: I'm not worried about the road.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: (sarcastic)
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: Why don't you wave your hands around
dialog: and summon up a coach-and-four?
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Don't mock me.
text: Galen gets up and calls out to the Urlanders.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: You pilgrims: You're used to
dialog: lotteries. Why not draw straws to
dialog: see who'll be first to carry
dialog: ironshanks here.
dialog: This is too much for Hodge.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Hold your tongue. If the master's
dialog: got a mind to go, he'll go.
text: Galen approaches the old sorcerer.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Send me. You're always saying | need
dialog: seasoning. | need a test. Let me go.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: You're not ready.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: I'm ready for anything.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (wan smile)
dialog: Don't be so hasty. Your time will
dialog: come.
text: The walkers are ready to set forth. Hodge picks up his pack,
text: steps forward and pulls open the great gate.
speaker_heading: HORSEMEN
text: Three mounted men are outside the gate, helmets on their
text: heads, swords on the belts and longbows across their
text: shoulders. They look formidable. The Urlanders take a step
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: backward.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Tyrian!?
text: Tyrian is a lean, heavily bearded nobleman. There is a coat
text: of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: (amiable)
dialog: Good morning, all.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: We're not afraid of you. Give us the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: Why, the road is yours. All the way
dialog: to Urland. It's a long journey, isn't
dialog: it? But when you're in search of a
dialog: sorcerer, | suppose no distance is
dialog: too great.
text: Sensing trouble, Galen moves forward. Ulrich touches his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Say nothing.
text: Galen hears the urgency in the old man's voice and obeys.
text: Hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: What do you want with us?
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: Well, like my good friends here,
dialog: I've come for a bit of black magic.
dialog: No doubt you've heard of our troubles
dialog: at home. This is Cragganmore, is it
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Aye, this be the place of Ulrich.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: Tyrian dismounts and saunters up to the old magician.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: And here we have the mystical presence
dialog: himself, no?
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: You'd best keep your distance — and
dialog: your manners.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: If he's ready to lay a dragon in its
dialog: grave, he's got nothing to fear from
dialog: me.
dialog: (turns to the Urlanders)
dialog: I've no more love for that creature
dialog: than you lot. Nor has the King. But,
dialog: before you stir things up, don't you
dialog: think ita good idea to see you've
dialog: got the right man for the job?
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Aha - it's a test you're looking
dialog: for. We don't do tests.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: I'm sure you don't. They never do
dialog: tests - and not many real deeds
dialog: either. Oh, conversation with your
text: grandmother's shade in a darkened
dialog: room, the odd love potion or two...
dialog: but comes a doubter, well then, it's
dialog: the wrong day, the planets are not
dialog: aligned, the entrails aren't
dialog: favorable, we don't do tests.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: We've got no doubts. We require no
dialog: test.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: And you're not going to get one.
text: When Ulrich finally speaks, his voice is low and
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: authoritative.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: (to Galen)
dialog: Go to the conjuring room. The iron
dialog: box. Fetch me the dagger within.
text: Galen's eyes widen with alarm.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: The dagger. Be quick.
text: Galen dashes into the castle. Ulrich gazes almost shyly at
dialog: Tyrian.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: You shall have your test.
speaker_heading: CONJURING ROOM
text: Galen comes puffing up the steps, locates the iron box, and
text: flings it open. Amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a
text: professional magician is an ivory-handled dagger covered
text: with runic inscriptions. Galen eagerly examines it to see
text: how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle,
text: but it is all too genuine. A murder weapon.
speaker_heading: ULRICH'S VOICE
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.
text: Galen throws open a window and looks down into the courtyard.
text: He displays the dagger.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Not this one, was it?
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: The very one. Let it fall.
text: Galen hesitates, then tosses it. Tumbling end over end, it
text: arcs downward. The old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand
text: and plucks it neatly out of the air. Galen watches as Ulrich
text: passes the weapon to Tyrian and strips back his robe exposing
text: a bony chest. Galen knows what's coming. He rushes for the
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: door. He's only a step away when it bangs shut of its own
text: accord. He sprints for a second exit. Whack! This door slams
text: shut too. Locked in. Quick, back to the window and climb
text: down the vine... Smack! the heavy shutters seal him in.
speaker_heading: ULRICH AND TYRIAN
text: Ulrich takes Tyrian's arm and guides the point of the dagger
text: to his breastbone.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Vita regula, vita hieratica!
text: Everyone is filled with dread. Hodge is shaking. From the
text: castle come the rattling of shutters and Galen's muffled
text: cries. A sick sarcastic smile has crept over Tyrian's lips.
text: He tenses himself to thrust.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Go on. Don't worry, you can't hurt
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CONJURING ROOM
text: Galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the
text: shutter. Below he can see the participants in this grisly
text: drama. He holds his breath. Tyrian makes a sudden movement
text: and buries the blade in Ulrich's chest. But the sorcerer
text: stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. Then, after a long moment,
text: he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that
text: holds it. Tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in
text: a heap. Very quickly he remounts. In another moment he and
text: his companions are gone. The others are riveted in horror.
text: Hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief.
text: Galen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the
text: gloomy conjuring room. Click! The doors unlatch themselves
text: and swing open.

scene_heading: FUNERAL PYRE - DAY
dialog: Ulrich, principal magician and sorcerer of the western world,
text: reposes ona hardwood pyre. His hands are folded on his chest.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: His face is peaceful. While the visitors wordlessly look on,
text: Galen touches a burning brand to the kindling. At first the
text: fire catches normally enough, but when the flames start to
text: envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green, producing an
text: unearthly roar. The onlookers back away from the intense
dialog: heat.
speaker_heading: GALEN
text: The erstwhile apprentice stands his ground, blinking back
text: tears, his face weirdly illuminated by the fire.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CONJURING ROOM - DAY
text: Galen sits alone amidst the museum4ike collection of magical
text: apparatus. He stares at the amulet, considering its
text: significance. His reverie is interrupted by the murmur of
text: voices below. At the window he looks down to see Hodge bidding
text: farewell to the delegation from Urland. Valerian is the last
text: to leave. He pauses at the gate and glances up at Galen.
text: Then he moves on. The young student of magic sets his jaw,
text: suddenly filled with resolve.
text: Moving through the room, he busies himself with the old man's
text: effects. He scoops up the loose books and parchments and
text: locks them into trunks. He drapes muslin cloths over the
text: alchemical devices. He sows a handful of salt over the
text: pentagram inscribed in the floor. Finally, he opens the cages
text: and releases the crow, the falcon, and the great horned owl.
speaker_heading: COURTYARD
text: Hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping
text: ashes and small bones into a leather pouch — the remains of
text: Ulrich. Up behind him comes Galen, now clad in a traveler's
text: cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Hodge — what are you doing?
text: Hodge quickly conceals the pouch.
speaker_heading: HODGE
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: Just making my farewell, thank you
dialog: very much.
text: He quickly climbs down, picks up his pack and follows Galen
text: out through the gate. As the door is pushed shut a huge oaken
text: timber falls into place, barring the castle against the
text: uninvited.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HILLTOP - DAY
text: Galen and Hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn
text: to look back across a wide valley. There on another hilltop
text: on the far side sits Cragganmore, lit by the red rays of the
text: setting sun. Galen removes the amulet from his neck and
text: clutches it in his fist. Hodge is bug-eyed to see it.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Be careful with that! You don't know
dialog: what you're doing.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Stand back!
text: He raises his hands toward the castle and calls out:
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Cragganmore! Domus noni am! Silva
dialog: celet!
speaker_heading: CRAGGANMORE
text: The vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and stretch,
text: magically brought to animate life. They flow upward over the
text: masonry, branching out and covering every surface, then up
text: onto the roof. Finally only the tops of the chimneys and the
text: highest turrets stand above the green carpet. A century's
text: growth in a matter of seconds.
speaker_heading: GALEN & HODGE
text: On their hilltop the old retainer gives the youth a fearful
text: look. Galen is too flushed with excitement over what he has
dialog: done to notice.

scene_heading: FOREST PATH - DAY
text: Galen and Hodge trudge along an overgrown cart-track under

speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Oh, it's a vale of tears in which we
dialog: dwell. It doesn't matter who you
text: are, a king in his robes, a peasant
dialog: in his rags, when your time comes,
dialog: no magic can save you...
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: I guess...
text: The apprentice's mind is elsewhere: he's got a coin hovering
text: in mid-air above his palm, bobbing gently as he walks.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: ..the kindest lord a man could ask
dialog: for... now he's gone. Ye gods he was
dialog: fussy about his bath. And you'd think
dialog: he could boil his own eggs with the
dialog: snap of a finger, but no, he had old
dialog: Hodge do it, of course.
dialog: (snurfling)
text: Up before five | was, mucking out

text: it tightly.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Careful with that!
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Too cold, is it?
text: A great coat drapes itself over Hodge's shoulders.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Too warm?

speaker_heading: HODGE

dialog: Well, that's a handsome thought, O

speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: Well | haven't. All I've seen is

scene_heading: DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT
text: The moon shines down on the far reaches of the Kingdom of
text: Urland, coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with the
text: skeletons of dead trees, blackened rock and bare ground.
text: Advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of armed
text: men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril. The horse is
text: skittish. Finally, in spite of shouts and lashings, it refuses
text: to go further. The leader, Horsrik, barks out an order:
speaker_heading: HORSRIK
dialog: Close enough! Bring her out!
text: A young woman, no more than seventeen, is brought forth from
text: the cart. Long black hair falls down over a white tunic. Her
text: dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face. She is
text: half-carried, half dragged to the edge of a steaming crack
text: in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post. By

text: There is a low rumble; the earth shakes. Horsrik glances
text: nervously around. He carries on by rote.
speaker_heading: HORSRIK
dialog: By this act shall be satisfied the
dialog: powers that dwell underground and
dialog: the spirits that attend thereto. In
dialog: gratitude for this sacrifice His
dialog: Majesty has declared the family —
dialog: what's the name? —
text: He prods the girl, but she is too terrified to speak. Beneath

dialog: (rushing it)
dialog: — the family Plowman to be free of

dialog: — ordained and signed this day,

speaker_heading: THE GIRL
text: She strains against her manacles, cocking her head to listen
text: as the rumblings below subside. Presently the steam and smoke
text: blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a
text: hundred yards distant, the wheel of the cart jammed between
text: rocks. Summoning up a wild will to live, she squeezes her
text: hands against the cold iron rings. No use. She spits on her
text: wrists and twists desperately. Blood starts. One hand slips
text: free. She looks at the horse. The animal tosses off its
text: blindfold and looks back at her. Now she strains again and
text: pulls her other hand free. She wipes the blood on her frock
text: and sprints toward the horse. But she doesn't get there. The
text: earth abruptly shifts from under her feet, tumbling her among
text: cracked and steaming rocks. When she raises her head a huge
text: shadow has fallen over the horse. There is a piteous whinny,
text: then a roar. The girl's face is suddenly lit by flames. She
text: scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way.
speaker_heading: THE CHASE
text: The girl hasn't taken a dozen steps when something huge
text: hurtles forward and blocks her way. Something scaly and
text: glittering. She whirls and stumbles off in a new direction.
text: This time she's cut off by a monstrous claw tipped with rapier-
text: like talons. She screams and crawls away. Another claw
text: prevents her escape.

text: He glances over and discovers Galen missing.
speaker_heading: GALEN
text: He walks back along the trail, looking for Valerian. Pretty
text: soon the rest of the travelers are out of sight. He hears
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: the sound of a splash. He turns off the trail and pushes
text: through some shrubbery.
speaker_heading: FOREST POOL
text: Under the oaks and hickory, a forest stream has widened into
text: a quiet pool. A pile of clothes lies on a rock at the edge.
text: Out in the middle, Valerian is treading water.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: You're too far behind us. Come on
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: You go ahead, I'll catch up.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Not a good idea to get separated.
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Right. I'll be along.
text: Galen leans over and splashes some water on his face. Feels
text: good. He shucks his pack and starts to throw off his clothes.
dialog: Valerian doesn't like it.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: That's all right. Don't come in.
text: But Galen is now naked and walking into the water. He swims
text: out toward Valerian.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: (edgy)
dialog: You better get back to the group,

text: Galen keeps swimming.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN

speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Galen works his way through the murky green underwater world.
text: Suddenly, he stops short and stares. He's only a few feet

dialog: is no boy.
text: ON THE SURFACE
text: Galen comes shooting to the surface, coughing and sputtering.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: By the gods!
text: Valerian is pale and frightened.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Stay away.

speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Ask my father.
text: They finish dressing in silence. Finally:
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: The lottery! Daughters are chosen,
dialog: but sons are not!
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: That's right. Unless you have plenty
dialog: of gold or property.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: If you're rich enough, your name

speaker_heading: THE VISION
text: Galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his
text: pack. As he leans over he catches sight of what appears to
text: be a reflection in the water: Tyrian on horseback. He whips
text: around, but no one is behind him. Riveted by the vision, he
text: hurries along the bank to follow it. After a few paces the
text: blurry figure dismounts, unslings a longbow, nocks an arrow
text: and draws the string taut.

dialog: No!
speaker_heading: FOREST

text: shoots past her and on into the forest.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Hodge!
speaker_heading: TRAVELERS
text: Galen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the Urlanders
text: coming toward him. Hodge precedes the group with an unsteady
text: gait. He sees Galen, raises up his arms and flops face down
text: on the trail. A long arrow protrudes from his back. Galen
text: kneels beside him. The uneasy company keeps its distance.
text: Hodge struggles to speak.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Galen? Can you hear me?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: | hear you.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: You know, somebody shot me, but |
dialog: can still talk. There's something
dialog: that has to be done.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: | know.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Not that cockatrice. Ulrich's ashes.
dialog: Here.
text: Hodge's hand comes out from under his coat gripping the
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: leather pouch. Galen tugs at it, but Hodge can't let go.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: Take it. Sorry, you'll have to peel
dialog: it loose.
text: Galen pries the sack out of Hodge's clenched fingers. Suddenly
text: the hand comes up, grabs Galen by the hair, and pulls him
dialog: near.
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: (a croak)
dialog: ..burning water... find the lake,
dialog: throw it in...
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: (holding up the pouch)
dialog: What are you doing with this, Hodge?
speaker_heading: HODGE
dialog: ..burning water...
text: He dies. Galen frees himself from his grasp.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Hodge, don't die. Listen to me. You're
dialog: not going to die.
text: Galen is frantic. He pulls out the amulet and wraps his hand
dialog: around it.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!
dialog: (he shakes the body)
dialog: Excede, mortem! Revoca, vitam!
text: But Hodge has passed on, and Galen's magic has no way to
text: reach him. Suddenly the youth cries out in pain. He drops
text: the amulet and looks at his palm. The device has burned his
text: flesh. Now he becomes aware of troubled Urlanders looking
text: over his shoulder, witness to his failure.

text: Wind whips the leaden wave tops ona vast rainy lake. The

speaker_heading: FJORD
text: The boat pulls into a long narrow waterway with granite cliffs

scene_heading: DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY
text: The travelers descend a mountain pass and emerge through a

text: Galen slows to inspect the weird surroundings. Valerian trots

speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Come on. Don't dawdle here.
text: Galen falls into step with her.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: The whole kingdom like this?
speaker_heading: VALERIAN

speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: Over there. Doesn't matter. We're in
dialog: no danger if we just pass through

text: Galen stops. High on the slope beside them is a gaping
text: fissure.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: I see it. Let's have a look.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: No!
text: But Galen is already toiling up the incline.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Greil! Malkin! Help!
text: The travelers turn to see what's the matter.
speaker_heading: THE LAIR
text: Galen approaches the lair, pausing beside a wooden post with
text: iron manacles dangling from it. He fingers them thoughtfully.
text: Malkin, Greil and Valerian rush up behind him, their faces
text: drawn with worry.
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: Look, you don't have to do this. We
dialog: know you're a fine young magician.
dialog: None better. There's no need to prove
dialog: it to us.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Are there other entrances?
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: No. One's enough.
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: Come on. The road's this way. We'll
dialog: tell everybody how close you got.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: (coolly)
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: No smoke. How do you know it's in
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: Don't be a fool. Come away now and
dialog: live to tell about it.
text: Instead, Galen starts into the crack. Greil and Malkin hasten
text: away, but Valerian lingers, watching in mounting frustration
text: as Galen probes further and further into the lair. She picks
text: up a fistful of stones and throws them at him.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Go ahead! You're going to die! What
dialog: a fine trick that will be!
text: But Galen is lost in the gloom. She flees.
speaker_heading: UNDERGROUND
text: Galen puts his hand on the rugged wall: the rocks are hot to
text: the touch. Something glinting on the floor catches Galen's
text: eye: an irridescent disk, a dragon scale. lt flashes the
text: colors of the rainbow as Galen examines it. All at once the
text: ground shudders; chunks of rock fall from the ceiling. A
text: pall of smoke billows up from the depths.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: Galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging ina
text: swirl of smoke. There is no sign of the Urlanders. He throws
text: down his pack, climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the
text: massive cliffs rising behind the lair. He grasps the amulet
text: and closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Now, great mountain, hear my command:
dialog: Terrae lapsus consignet latibulum

scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: mountain, sweeping tons of debris into the air. Boulders the
text: size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician.
text: Eyes wide with awe, he turns and runs for his life. Even as
text: he careens down the slope, chunks of rock rumble past. One
text: catches him at the knee and sends him flying.
text: He covers his head and joins the landslide. Finally the dust
text: lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the
text: cowering Urlanders. They look with real fear at the man who
text: just conjured up the Apocalypse. Tattered and torn, covered
text: with dirt, Galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at
text: his handiwork.
speaker_heading: LANDSCAPE
text: The territory has been drastically transformed: the dragon's
text: lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite.
text: The Urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction.
text: Galen grins a triumphant splittip grin that fails to win
text: them over. Presently they back away and run off down the
text: trail, Valerian in their midst. Galen's grin fades.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: VILLAGE - DAY
text: The Village of Swanscombe is little more than a rough and
text: ready collection of thatched huts and mud-daubed outbuildings

speaker_heading: VALERIAN
text: She trots across the square and enters a deserted blacksmith

speaker_heading: SQUARE
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: She walks across the square toward the voices. She is joined
text: by Greil, Malkin and the other travelers, all of them puzzled
text: by the desolation. As they approach the grange hall the voices
text: grow louder. They seem to be singing. The main doors open
text: briefly and three villagers scamper out, dripping wet and
text: wrapped in white muslin. Valerian and her companions look at
text: each other in astonishment.
scene_heading: IN THE GRANGE HALL
text: In a wooden cistern in the middle of the hall a woman is
text: being held under water. After a few moments she is pulled to
text: the surface by a tall red-haired man with long bony fingers:

dialog: And they listen?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Shh! They think this a holy place, a

speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: This is the granary. What kind of

speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Your god had nothing to do with it.
dialog: Indeed, Galen's act is already the stuff of legend:

text: Galen is surrounded by a crowd of wide-eyed kids and nota

speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Looks like you've been up to a little
dialog: sorcery yourself.
text: Valerian doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Or is it witchcraft?
text: She still doesn't reply. It's all she can do to keep on

speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: What's the matter? A real woman never

speaker_heading: SIMON

speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: | saw what | saw. But this jack-anapes

speaker_heading: CELEBRATION
text: While the proud Simon dances in the background with his
text: daughter, a group of tipsy villagers clusters around Galen,
text: belching forth a drinking song. The young magician raises

text: stops. The singing dies away. The ensuing silence is broken
text: by the sound of galloping hooves. Presently three horsemen

text: Tyrian dismounts and looks around in his usual friendly way.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: A celebration! Don't stop on my

speaker_heading: MALKIN
dialog: What would you have of us then?
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: Not a thing. It's this one.
text: (he gestures toward

dialog: The King would meet our new benefactor
dialog: and offer his gratitude to the man
dialog: who succeeded where so many have
dialog: failed.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: (sobering up)
dialog: What sort of gratitude? A knife in

text: Tyrian's smile freezes on his face. He steps in front of
text: Galen, towering over him.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: My young friend, I'd as soon dispatch
dialog: you as | did the others, and for the
dialog: same reason. But his Majesty would
text: like a cozy chat, and commands
dialog: otherwise.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Don't go, Galen. Cast a spell and

speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: Well, well: still plenty of cheek

text: Having buried the dragon under a mountain, Galen decides
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary

speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Don't worry. I'll be back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: RIDERS
text: Three horses gallop through the moors and fens of central

text: slanting light of a new day.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THRONE ROOM - DAY
text: Within the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight
text: poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls. In
text: the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne. There is
text: Casiodorus Rex, King of Urland, a bearded man in his fifties,
text: as spare and somber as the room in which he sits. He is
text: flanked by a few servants, assorted courtiers and Tyrian.
text: Standing before them all is Galen, looking unhappy. He pours
text: a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: One of the best things about the
dialog: water here in Urland is that there's
dialog: so much of it — look at that!
text: Water continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing.
text: Galen takes a sip.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Mmm. Good. But not cold enough.
dialog: Perhaps | could borrow a scarf from
dialog: his Majesty.
text: The King makes no sign. Galen approaches stiffly, takes a
text: scarf and retreats.
speaker_heading: GALEN
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: I cover the goblet, so... remove,
dialog: so...and behold: winter in a mug!
text: And he's done it: he turns the goblet over and a small chunk
text: of ice hits the floor. The royal reaction is equally frosty.
text: Galen is bombing, and he knows it.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: All right. How many of you have ever
dialog: seen a table fly?
text: He mutters an incantation. In the audience, Tyrian notes
text: that Galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet. There is
text: a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins
text: to jitter and buck. As the wine spills and plates go flying,
text: the King wearily raises a hand.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Enough! That's fine.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Wait, it'll rise now.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Don't bother. Not necessary.
text: The table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Tell me: the landslide — it was
dialog: accomplished this same way?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Yes.

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric?
dialog: Of course not, you weren't even born.
dialog: He was my brother, a great King and
text: a valiant man-at-arms. When he
text: ascended to the throne, the dragon
dialog: was unbridled. No one knew where it
dialog: might strike next. So he brought
text: forth his broadsword and his spear,
dialog: assembled a company of his best
text: fighters and went out to do battle.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He was never seen again. But his
dialog: attack provoked the most terrible
dialog: reprisals: whole villages incinerated,
dialog: entire crops burned. Death, famine,
dialog: horrible.
text: The King grimaces as the memories come flooding back.

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Not by me. Did you ever consider the
dialog: consequences of failure?

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Then the beast is dead?
speaker_heading: GALEN

text: Two guards thrust Galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred

text: doubtful moment. Suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips
text: it off his neck and out through the bars.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: He makes an ironic salute and leaves. Galen sits down heavily

speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Unseen by Galen, a figure clad in silk and lace skitters

speaker_heading: GALEN

dialog: Cubiculum gravis aperat!

speaker_heading: ELSPETH

speaker_heading: DUNGEON

speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: There! Stop him!
text: Galen rides like mad for the exit, but he's a half-second
text: late: the doors boom shut in his face. He wheels the horse

dialog: Tyrian! Tyrian!

text: Horse and rider race across a night landscape under brooding

text: Many buildings are ablaze. As he watches in horror, fires
text: spring up in the fields and trees. Intermittently he can see
text: the silhouette of the dragon as it spreads destruction.
text: Finally the creature swoops up and away. Galen stares skyward,
text: losing sight of it in the clouds. For a moment, silence.
text: Then, with a thunderous rush of air that almost blows him

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Get away, you little bastard. We've

text: Galen staggers back, reaching for his horse. The animal shies

text: catches him on the back of the head. Galen reels away.
speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: VALERIAN

speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: I can't.

speaker_heading: MALKIN
dialog: (returning her look)
dialog: Damn right.
text: Finding nothing, the group pushes into the metal shop, where
text: Simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on an

text: props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to Simon.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN

dialog: You could never afford it.
text: He spins on his heel and joins his men as they ride out of
text: town. Valerian and Simon watch them go. When the riders are
text: out of sight, they return to the shop. With a couple of stout
text: poles, they strain to lift the anvil off its base. Finally
text: it topples over. Valerian slides the base aside, revealing a
text: trap door. She raises it and a cramped Galen unfolds himself
text: from the space below. On his face is a curious look of
dialog: determination.

dialog: Smith —have you ever forged a

speaker_heading: WEAPONS
text: Simon is going through a cabinet, tossing out hoes, rakes,

text: examines them doubtfully. Now Simon produces an armload of
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: swords. Galen is impressed; he looks them over carefully,
text: testing and rejecting them in turn.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: These are your sharpest?
text: Simon plucks up one of the swords, carries it to the center
text: of the room. He lays a horseshoe on the anvil. He brings the
text: sword down — whack! — and cuts the horseshoe in half.
speaker_heading: SIMON
text: Even Tyrian carries one of these.
text: Galen hefts it dubiously.
speaker_heading: GALEN
text: It's sharp — but it's not sharp
dialog: enough.
text: Valerian has been watching all this with growing concern.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Not sharp enough for what?
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: For what I'm going to do with it.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Nothing's that sharp.
text: Simon gnaws his lip. Reluctantly, he brings a long box from
text: the bottom of the cabinet. He opens it. Lying on a bed of
text: silk is an exquisite two-handed broadsword. The flat blade
text: gleams like a mirror. Galen reaches in and lifts it out.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: The best | ever made.
text: Valerian is as awed as Galen.

text: Big flat oak leaves are gliding along the current. Very

scene_heading: KING'S CASTLE - NIGHT
text: Carrying torches to light their way, families - some with

text: courtyard of the King's castle. Simon is there with Valerian,
text: and so is Galen, disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide-
text: brimmed hat. Like many others, he carries a stick topped
text: with a bleached skull — to all appearances, just another
text: participant in this weird pagan ritual. A barrel decorated
text: with flames and dragon's wings sits on a raised dais in front
text: of the main entrance. Horsrik, the King's herald, supervises
text: preparations for the lottery. Armed guards appear carrying a
text: sealed chest. Horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour
text: the contents — hundreds of wooden tiles, each bearing the
text: name of a potential sacrifice — into the barrel. Trumpets
text: blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage:
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: the King, his daughter, courtiers and Tyrian. Valerian nudges
dialog: Galen.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN

dialog: hereby proclaims the sum of thirty
dialog: ducats to be paid to anyone producing
dialog: the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn, fraud

text: Galen pulls his hat low over his eyes. As the moment for the
text: drawing approaches, Valerian becomes more and more uneasy.
text: She pushes forward through the crowd until she's just below
text: the barrel. She eyes the people around her. Some of them
text: seem equally worried, others — the better dressed and better
text: fed — are smug and complacent. The King and his retinue are
text: serene. A chant goes up from the crowd:
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!
text: Horsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved
text: dragon's head and stirs up the names. This done, a new chant
dialog: goes up:
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Bare the arm! Bare the arm!
text: At a signal, a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve from
text: Horsrik's right arm. He holds it high. The crowd surges
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: forward. The atmosphere is full of dread and excitement.
text: Valerian looking pale and determined, is jostled and pushed
text: to the edge of the platform.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Draw the name! Draw the name!
text: The moment has come. Down goes Horsrik's arm and up it comes,
text: holding one little wooden square, one young woman's fate. An
text: expectant hush falls over the mob. The virgins of Urland
dialog: tremble and wait.
speaker_heading: HORSRIK
dialog: Now, my countrymen, hear me: behold,

dialog: many may live. I shall lay down my
dialog: life for family and fellows. | shall
dialog: go to my grave for the love of our
dialog: King and his wise policy. And my
dialog: name is —
text: He looks down at the tile to read the name, but no sound
text: comes to his lips. He looks back at the crowd, a cold sweat
text: breaking over his face. He swallows, but still can't bring
text: himself to speak. At his feet, Valerian is holding her breath.
text: Anew chant goes up.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: The name! The name!
text: By now Horsrik is trembling. He stares down at the tile, his
text: mouth set in a grim line. The King is getting annoyed. He
text: gestures and the crowd falls silent.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Read the name.
speaker_heading: HORSRIK
dialog: (mastering himself)
dialog: The name is: Princess Elspeth Ulfilas,
dialog: filia regis.
text: There is a moment of profound shock. Then a low murmur of
text: wonder moves through the crowd. Galen looks at Valerian; she
text: sags with relief. The King turns to his daughter. She shows
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: nothing. He rises from his chair, comes forward and snatches
dialog: the tile from Horsrik.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: That's not the name. It's been
dialog: misread.
dialog: Valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: There's no mistake! The name's been
dialog: chosen - let it stand!
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: No, the good Horsrik has misspoke
dialog: himself.
dialog: (he looks at the tile)
dialog: In fairness to this individual, whose
dialog: name I can't make out, we'll destroy
dialog: this tile.
text: He quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his elbow.
text: Led by Valerian, the crowd cries out in protest.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: No! What better name than your own
dialog: kin? At last we see justice done!
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Silence! We will have a new choosing.
dialog: | will draw the name myself.
text: He reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile. He
text: looks at it and his eyes widen. Betrayed, he swivels to face
text: his daughter. The din of the crowd reaches a crescendo.
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Let it stand! Let it stand!
text: Elspeth takes the tile from her father's nerveless fingers,
text: looks at it with satisfaction and holds it aloft.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: The name is as you heard it and as

text: The King moils through the tiles, finding his daughter's
dialog: name again and again.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: The lottery is invalid. Another and
dialog: another. What treachery is this?
text: Valerian, chanting with the rest, falls silent. She looks at
text: Elspeth with sudden interest and respect, then awe.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Hear me, good people! It is true,
dialog: that my name appears on many of the
dialog: lots. This does not falsify the
dialog: drawing, it certifies it! | have
dialog: learned that my name has been kept
dialog: from jeopardy in all the drawings in

dialog: the rest many times — once for each
dialog: risk that, over the years, you took
dialog: and | did not.
text: The crowd is dumbfounded. Gradually voices erupt ina
text: cacophony of shouts, whistles and excited conversation. Galen
text: sees his chance: there's an unguarded door near the stable.
text: He drifts toward it and slips inside.
speaker_heading: THRONE ROOM
text: Galen pokes his head in: the room is empty. He scurries over
text: to a chest, flings it open and starts rummaging. Finding
text: nothing he moves on to a cabinet. He breaks the lock and
text: pries it open. Again, nothing.
speaker_heading: CASTLE CORRIDOR
text: Galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down
text: a hall. Suddenly he stops short. There in front of him is a
text: guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings. Galen
text: hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves.
text: But the man is only headed for another window and a better

speaker_heading: LIBRARY
text: Galen enters the library, his enormous shadow dancing crazily
text: on the torchlit walls. Hurrying through, his attention is
text: drawn to some open books on a table. Closer inspection reveals

text: suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet. But where
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: COURTYARD
text: As the crowd disperses Valerian watches Elspeth walk back in
text: the castle, lofty and composed. She looks for Galen and
text: discovers he has gone.
speaker_heading: LIBRARY
text: By now, the room is in total disarray. Galen has opened all
text: the chests and trunks and knocked half the books from the

text: when a voice interrupts him.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Don't go to all that trouble.
text: Galen whirls around to find the King standing in the doorway.
text: The monarch looks shattered. Galen edges toward the split in
text: the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers.
text: At that moment Tyrian comes through the door, sizes up the
text: situation and draws his sword.

dialog: I'm unarmed. If you want a fight, at

dialog: Good and hot.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Don't bother. That's not the kind of

scene_heading: DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY
text: Clouds scud low over the lifeless region. The dragon's lair

text: searching for dragon scales. The basket is already more than
text: half full when she finds herself ominously near the mouth of
text: the cavern. She's about to turn back when she spies a
text: particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards
text: further on. As she reaches for it, there is a sudden hiss!
text: She jerks her hand back and freezes. There in the shadows is

text: This time, as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge, they
text: gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact. Such

dialog: Fare thee well.
text: The old man departs. Galen unfolds the bundle and brings out
text: its contents: mail hauberk with coif, studded leather gloves,
text: padded jerkin, a scabbard and a small wooden shield. He lays
text: them out on the stream bank, then strips off his tunic and
text: kneels down to splash some water in his face. As the cups

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT
text: A.cold wind whistles through the rocks near the dragon's
text: lair. By the light of a flickering torch two workmen finish
text: driving a heavy post into the ground. As they affix a pair
text: of iron manacles they see the torches of a procession coming
text: up the slope. They hurry down to meet it. Horsrik is in the
text: lead, followed by soldiers and royal attendants. Elspeth
text: rides in the tumbril behind a blindfolded horse. Bringing up
text: the rear is Tyrian. At last the cart can go no further.
text: Elspeth alights and leads the rest of the troop to the post.
text: As the soldiers put the irons around her wrists, Horsrik
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: unrolls a parchment, turns his back on the wind and begins
dialog: to read:
speaker_heading: HORSRIK
dialog: Now be it known throughout the
dialog: kingdom, that the Princess, having
dialog: been chosen by a deed of fortune and
dialog: destiny —
text: Horsrik blinks. There's a black stain growing in the middle
text: of the parchment; all at once it bursts into flames. He cries
text: out and flings the document away. There follows a flash of
text: light and a puff of smoke and Galen is standing there, as if
text: he had materialized out of thin air. Horsrik and his startled
text: men backpedal down the slope.
speaker_heading: HORSRIK
dialog: No fire, | beg you.
text: Galen raises his hands in a menacing gesture.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Be gone!
text: That's enough for Horsrik and company: he and the soldiers
dialog: depart.
speaker_heading: HORSRIK
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: | declare these proceedings duly
dialog: ordained...
text: Only one man remains behind the challenge the young sorcerer:
text: Tyrian. He draws his sword.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: | knew I'd find you here. Well, I'm
dialog: not as sentimental as some. The
dialog: kingdom, every one of us, need this

dialog: I've got plenty of reasons to kill
dialog: you that have nothing to do with
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: this sacrifice.
text: Galen draws his own sword. As it emerges into the night air
text: it seems imbued with a blue phosphorescence.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: Most impressive. Can you use it?
text: Elspeth twists around in her chains.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Let it be! Please! Tyrian is right —
dialog: it's our only hope!
text: Galen starts to reply, but as soon as his attention wavers,
text: Tyrian is lunging toward him, sword point directed at his
text: neck. Galen barely manages to parry the thrust before Tyrian
text: is at him again, blade swinging toward his knees. Galen drops
text: the tip of his sword to catch the blow. When the two steel
text: edges connect, sparks fly. In a series of thrusts and counter-
text: thrusts, each accompanied by a shower of sparks, Tyrian backs
text: Galen up the mountain.
speaker_heading: ELSPETH
dialog: Tyrian — both of you — run! Flee!
dialog: It's coming!
text: Sure enough, at that moment the earth gives out a low moan
text: and undulates in a sickening movement. Vapors begin rising
text: from the lair.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: In a trice! This is no swords-man.
text: He might be right, for Galen turns and bolts across the slope.
text: When he reaches the post with Tyrian two steps behind, he
text: whirls and brings his blade down on Princess Elspeth's chains.
text: The chains part in an explosion of sparks.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Run! Get out of here!
text: The Princess darts from the piling as Tyrian swoops down to
text: continue the attack. Galen dodges and the stake catches
text: Tyrian's blow. The earth shakes again. Galen glances at the
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
dialog: Princess.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: No! Stop! What are you doing?
text: Elspeth is not running away down the mountain. Instead she
text: is walking, slowly and deliberately, right into the smoking
text: cave. Swoosh! Tyrian's sword comes down again. The dismayed
text: sorcerer ducks back and Tyrian's blade again bites deep into
dialog: the wood.
speaker_heading: TYRIAN
dialog: You've failed, my friend, and | thank
dialog: the gods for it. Come out from behind
dialog: that post.
text: It's now or never. Elspeth is no longer in sight. Galen grits
text: his teeth, grasps the sword with two hands and swings it as
text: hard as he can ina wide arc. The blade never even slows
text: down as it sails right through the post, lopping it clean
text: off. The glowing sword flashes above Galen's head and eagerly
text: buries itself in Tyrian's chest. The King's man is as startled
text: by the amputated piling as he is by his own death. His eyes
text: roll up in his head, his knees buckle and he topples backward —
text: the blade sliding free.
speaker_heading: DRAGON'S LAIR
text: Smoke swirls at the mouth of the cave as Galen enters, holding
text: his sword before him, lighting his way with its faint blue
dialog: glow.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Elspeth!
text: The floor of the cave as it winds down into the mountain is
text: paved first with rock, then with dragon scales, then with
text: bones. With each footfall, clusters of mysterious insects
text: scuttle away. Galen pauses to mop his brow; it's getting
text: hot. A sound echoes up from the depths, a grinding sound
text: like the gnashing of teeth, followed by hissing and squealing.
text: Galen grips his sword tighter and pushes on. Suddenly he
text: stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper: Elspeth's. The
text: grinding sounds are louder. He hurries forward and rounds a
text: corner. He stops and gags.
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
speaker_heading: BASILISKS
text: Two disgusting little reptiles — like scaly raccoons — are
text: perched on the corpse of Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, feeding
text: contentiously on choice bits of the royal flesh. Galen groans:
text: he lashes out and his sword beheads one of the tiny monsters.
text: The other one buzzes its half-formed winglets and hisses a
text: hot stream of air. Galen brings down the sword and slices it
text: in half. Eyes riveted on Elspeth's remains, he edges around
text: the carnage and backs away. Hissss! — there's a third one,
text: lurking in the shadows, munching on something; it might be a
text: hand. Galen shrieks and jumps away. The little creature comes
text: at him and clamps its jaws on his leg. Galen stabs at it
text: repeatedly. Finally it lets go, and flails and flops across
text: the bloody floor, ululating its death agony. As the creature's
text: last mewlings echo down through the cavern, the ground
text: quivers. Bits of stone fall from the ceiling.
speaker_heading: LAKE OF FIRE
text: Galen works his way down a narrow passage whose walls are
text: alive with insects and beads of sulphurous water. As before,
text: he holds the sword in front of him; he marvels at its
text: increasing brightness. The heat is increasing too; sweat
text: mats his hair and runs down his face. A few yards further on
text: the sword starts pulsating. Now the walls take on a flickering
text: rosy sheen and the passage widens into an underground vista
text: of staggering immensity: an underground lake, its surface
text: bubbling and torn with sheets of flame. Arching over it is a
text: vault of stone, penetrated here and there by natural chimneys.
dialog: The dimensions of this internal world are unknown — the
text: fiery lake disappears into half a dozen side chambers. The
text: one clear path is accessible only by a series of flat stones
text: leading across the hot liquid. Galen grips his sword and
text: resolutely hops from rock to rock.
speaker_heading: VERMITHRAX
text: He's halfway across when the earth rumbles and the stepping
text: stones teeter beneath his feet. A fiery wave washes over his
text: legs, leaving his boots smoking. Another tremor knocks Galen
text: to his knees. As he scrabbles to pick up his sword and shield,
text: the great head of Vermithrax rises up out of the depths on
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: its long neck. It gazes at him through huge pale eyes under
text: armored lids. A tongue flicks out and runs around its lipless
text: mouth. The head sways from side to side. The mouth hinges
text: open, the nostriHike igniters come on and touch off the
text: jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards. A roaring tube of
text: flame engulfs Galen. He crouches behind his dragon scale
text: shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his life.
text: The dragon pauses to take a breath. Galen springs to his
text: feet, and bounds back the way he came, his skin and clothing
text: singed. Flames lick at his back as the dragon lets fly with
text: a second burst.
speaker_heading: TUNNEL
text: Coughing and weeping, Galen staggers up through the tunnel,
text: nearly tripping over the body of one of the baby dragons. A
text: few seconds later, Vermithrax follows, squirming and clawing
text: its way upward. When it reaches its dead offspring it surveys
text: the scene with expressionless eyes. Bringing its head low,
text: it sniffs and nudges at the lifeless little ones.
speaker_heading: AMBUSH
text: At that moment Galen leaps out from behind a niche in the
text: tunnel wall and lunges forward. Striking sparks, the point
text: of his sword slides across the dragon's plated cheek and
text: stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck. There is an
text: unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back and
text: upward. Galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding half
text: a sword. The rest is buried in the beast's neck, and
text: Vermithrax doesn't like it. It flings its head this way and
text: that, knocking rocks loose from the ceiling. Its movements
text: cause the ground to quake. As boulders tumble around him,
text: Galen drops to the floor under his shield. Dragon flame
text: reaches through the cascading debris and washes over him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DAWN
text: Valerian roams the rock-strewn slope not far from the dragon's
text: lair. Presently she comes upon a once-familiar object — the
text: fire shield. Half the scales are gone, the rest are charred
text: and curling. Grimly, she moves on. A few paces away she picks
text: up the blunted sword. She scans the rocks and finally sees
scene_heading: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.comillibrary
text: what she's looking for.
speaker_heading: GALEN
text: He's lying face down behind a boulder, his clothes charred,

text: Valerian packs her belongings into a rucksack. The last item

text: Galen has come to a halt in the middle of the path. He's

speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: What are you doing?

text: The passage widens out and once again Galen is standing on
text: the shores of the lake of fire. He looks around. The water
text: is rolling with bubbles of gas, and flames run hither and

text: Gathering his courage, he hops across the stepping stones to

speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Ex favilla, vita nova!
text: Gripping the amulet with his free hand, he scatters Ulrich's

text: Thoroughly bewildered, Valerian stumbles out into daylight.

text: Galen runs to her. They embrace. When they look up, Ulrich
text: is at their side.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Where's my amulet? Give it to me,
dialog: please.
text: Galen's hand locates the jewel under his shirt. He finds
text: himself reluctant to part with it.
text: With a hurricane howl, a column of flame touches down nearby
text: and rushes toward them. They stagger back as the dragon sweeps

speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Be quick!
text: Galen hands his treasure over. Ulrich closes his hand around
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Come close to me.
text: Galen and Valerian approach. The old man's hand is suffused
text: with an internal glow. Behind them, the dragon is turning
dialog: for another pass.
speaker_heading: VORTEX
text: All at once the glow brightens, and in another instant the
text: world spins off into a blur, setting all three afloat ina
text: timeless netherworld. Valerian and Galen cling to each other
dialog: in terror.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Don't be afraid. You have served me
dialog: with great courage. Now you must
dialog: show me you have even more.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Anything!
text: The voices seem to be coming from a huge distance. Starlike
text: gleams whiz by, and fleeting glimpses of half-recognizable
text: faces and forms. The wizard's eyes are like glittering
text: crystals. Tiny motes and planetoids dance in the hairs of
text: his beard. He seems wreathed in luminescence.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: You must destroy the amulet, and me
text: along with it.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: You brought me from the flames, you

speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: When the time comes, you'll
dialog: understand. Here.
text: He dangles the amulet in front of Galen. Even more reluctantly
text: than he let it go, he takes it back.
speaker_heading: MOUNTAIN TOP
text: Abruptly, the vortex is gone and they find themselves atop a
text: rocky crag overlooking the eclipse-darkened fields and farms
text: of Urland. Galen glances at his surroundings and stares at
text: the amulet, full of awe.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: | know what you're thinking. You
dialog: have learned much and done well.
dialog: Don't worry, you won't need it any
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: GRANGE HALL - DAY
text: Greil is urging Simon, the last of the converts, into the
dialog: cistern.
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: Make haste, brother.
text: He dips Simon's head under water.
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: Now be thou baptized in the name of
dialog: the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. May
dialog: the Lord our God light our way.
text: In the background, half the congregation is staring through
text: the burned-out walls, fervently praying and crossing
text: themselves, wondering if they'll ever see the sun again. A

text: cry goes up: a shape crosses the solar corona, wheels over
text: the village and streaks away toward the mountains — the
dialog: dragon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MOUNTAIN TOP
text: Galen and Valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch
text: Ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff. The
text: old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Nimbus! Tempestas! Fulmen!
text: From over the horizon roiling inky-black clouds churn down
text: upon them. Thunder booms and echoes. A bitter wind whips
text: their clothing. As the storm gathers fury, the dragon
text: reappears, circling in the distance. Finally it homes in on
text: the mountain crag and dives at Ulrich. The conjurer makes a
text: gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beast's
text: scaly flanks. It emits a high thin scream and rockets past.
speaker_heading: GALEN & VALERIAN
text: Valerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of
dialog: granite.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Here. Do as he said. Smash it.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Not if it means killing him.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
text: He resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds
text: and starts another pass. Again, the sorcerer summons lightning
text: bolts. But the dragon keeps coming; this time a talon splits
text: the old man's cape.
speaker_heading: GALEN & VALERIAN
text: Valerian wrestles the amulet away from Galen. It falls to
dialog: the ground.

speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: You heard what he said.
text: She lifts the chunk of stone. Galen grabs for it.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: No! You can't!
scene_heading: THE LAST ATTACK
text: Vermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward.
text: Ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. He folds
text: his arms and bows his head. Leathery wings humming, the
text: creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the
text: master magician away in its huge hind claw.
speaker_heading: ULRICH
dialog: Galen!
text: Galen and Valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling
text: upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. As
text: the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear
text: Ulrich's faint screams.
speaker_heading: DEATH
text: Now Galen understands. He seizes the granite block from
text: Valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. He
text: takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then
text: brings the rock down with all his might. There is a blinding
text: flash as it shatters into a million fragments.
text: Far above there is another blinding flash as Ulrich's earthly
text: body explodes against the belly of the beast. The darkened
text: sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the
text: dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian
text: torch plummets to the ground.
speaker_heading: LAKE
text: Below, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. Trailing
text: a wake of flame, Vermithrax plunges like a comet into the
text: water. There is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam.

speaker_heading: GALEN & VALERIAN
text: They stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further
text: explosions boil the water from the pond.
speaker_heading: ECLIPSE
text: Behind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a
text: pale sun.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: THE CARCASS - DAY
text: Grey misty light reveals the beast's mangled remains. Galen
text: and Valerian emerge from the fog, walk under a blackened
text: wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to
text: the huge charred head. The death agony has twisted it upside
text: down. The mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise.
text: The eyes are glazed. Now the sound of voices floats toward
text: them, chanting an ancient hymn. A moment later a mob of
text: Christians, led by Greil, crests a hill and moves toward the
text: hulk. The song ends.
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: Let us pray.
text: The members of the congregation fall to their knees.
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: We thank thee, Lord, for this divine
dialog: deliverance. Verily is thy presence
dialog: amongst us, fully manifest in this,
dialog: thy great work.
text: Galen and Valerian look at each other. She takes his hand.
speaker_heading: GREIL
dialog: Arise, children of the Lord and
dialog: forsake evermore the pagan mysteries.
dialog: Rejoice in the true power of the
dialog: Christian God!
text: Galen turns and leads Valerian away. They disappear into the
dialog: mist.

scene_heading: FLENSING - DAY
text: In the clear light of a new day, ladders have been tipped up
text: against the creature's back. Teams of men swarm over the
text: crusted flesh, slicing off long strips for piecemeal burial.
text: Below, yoked oxen drag the heavy carrion away on sledges. In
text: the background other workmen dump the remains into an open
dialog: pit.
speaker_heading: THE KING
text: With the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves, the royal
text: coach pulls up to the shore of the lake. A door creaks open
text: and King Casiodorus totters out. His face is puffy, his eyes
text: are red. He slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon
text: and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword. Horsrik
text: steps out of the coach and draws himself up.
speaker_heading: HORSRIK
dialog: (loud)
dialog: All hail Casiodorus Rex — Dragon
dialog: slayer!
text: The workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement
text: and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle. Wordlessly they

scene_heading: ON THE ROAD - DAY
text: The trail leads through copses and open meadows. Side by
text: side, Galen and Valerian march up a long slope under a hot
text: sun. He limps a bit; she finds a staff and hands it to him.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: You want to rest?

dialog: No. I'm fine.

dialog: You miss Ulricn.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: And the amulet.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: That too.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad
dialog: you did what you did.
dialog: (he doesn't reply)
dialog: You may not be a sorcerer, Galen,
dialog: but I love you anyway. | don't regret
dialog: anything that happened. I just wish —
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: — that we had a horse.
text: Galen falls a step behind. He briefly closes his eyes and
text: mutters something. They walk on a few paces. Then there is a
text: whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters
text: forth. It crosses a meadow, comes right up to Valerian and
text: nuzzles her.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: GALEN
text: A horse.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN

speaker_heading: GALEN
text: No. It must have been wandering loose.
dialog: Or wild.
text: Galen climbs aboard. He reaches out to help her up.
speaker_heading: VALERIAN
dialog: Wait a minute. | just wished for a
dialog: horse and here it is.
speaker_heading: GALEN
dialog: You don't want to wish it gone, do
