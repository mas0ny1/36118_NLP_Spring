text: A murky green pond dotted with floating litter.
text: NADINE ROSTAMI (16) skinny, self-conscious posture, a face
text: that hasn't quite grown into her nose, stands on the pond's
text: BRIDGE staring into the muck. She clutches a LARGE DUFFLE BAG
text: and talks into her CELL PHONE.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I just called to tell you I'm
dialog: chucking everything you ever gave
dialog: me into the Norfolk pond. Yes, that
text: disgusting scummy festering
dialog: cesspool they haven't drained in a
dialog: hundred years and that has like 8
text: Cheeto bags and a dead squirrel
dialog: floating in it right this very
dialog: moment. Every birthday present, all
dialog: our pictures, that Canada
dialog: sweatshirt you got me from Canada
dialog: that's my favorite because the
text: inside is still fuzzy after a
dialog: billion washes... yeah, even that.
dialog: That's how dead serious I am. I

speaker_heading: VOICEMAIL LADY (V.O.)
dialog: Thank you. Your message has been

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Motherfucker.

speaker_heading: BEEP.
speaker_heading: KRISTA (V.O.)
dialog: It's Krista, leave a message and
dialog: try to keep it short because I
dialog: think I have ADD. No, I'm serious.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Your stupid voicemail lady cut me

speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND/RECESS - DAY
speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.)
dialog: Krista and I had been best friends

dialog: Spring of 2nd grade.
text: Crouched under the PLASTIC SLIDE, we find LITTLE NADINE (6),
text: heavy brows and the faintest hint of a mustache even at this
text: age, and LITTLE KRISTA (6), blonde, chubby, glasses an inch
text: thick, playing Barbies together. Nadine has KEN's pants off
text: and is making him hump Krista's SKIPPER doll.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: My name's Krista, what's yours?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Nadine Hamidi Yousefa Rostami.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Wow, that's abuncha words. You're
dialog: real good at the Ken, too.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: You think so?
text: Krista smiles. Nadine beams, making Ken hump even faster.
dialog: Then, an idea:
speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, you wanna be best friends?
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Sounds good to me I guess.
speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.)
dialog: From that day forward, we were
dialog: inseparable.
text: Covered in head-to-toe protective pads, Nadine and Krista
text: nervously roller-skate down the sidewalk, holding each
text: other's hands for support, both horribly uncoordinated.
text: Nadine's older brother, DARIAN (8), bikes by with his
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: LITTLE DARIAN
dialog: (startling them)
dialog: Lesbos!!!
text: They lose their balance and eat it.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN HOME DOORSTEP - HALLOWEEN NIGHT
speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.)
dialog: We started doing everything alike.
text: Dressed in matching SHREK COSTUMES, they rush up to a

speaker_heading: SUBURBAN MOM
dialog: Aww, you boys make such adorable
dialog: ogres.
scene_heading: INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.)
dialog: We learned new things together.
text: Now 9-years-old, Nadine and Krista are frozen in front of the
text: television, their eyes as big as baseballs.
text: Turn to reveal: They found the CINEMAX channel.
text: Darian suddenly pops up from behind the couch.
speaker_heading: LITTLE DARIAN
dialog: You big fat perverted molesters!

scene_heading: INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Now 12-years-old, a taller, lankier Nadine gets up off the

text: She rips open the stall door and frantically calls Krista
text: inside, their faces awash with amazement and disgust.
scene_heading: INT. SAV-ON CHECK OUT LINE - LATER THAT DAY
text: A lone box of ULTRA ABSORBENT MAXI-PADS goes by on the

text: magazines as the MALE CASHIER rings them up.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: As we grew up, theoretically, we
dialog: should've grown apart.
scene_heading: INT. OPTOMETRIST'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Now 14, Krista trades in her glasses for CONTACT LENSES. She

speaker_heading: KRISTA

dialog: Whaddaya think?
speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: (to Krista)
dialog: Do I still look like him, or is it
dialog: better now?
text: She holds up a PHOTO of PEDRO FROM NAPOLEON DYNAMITE for
text: comparison. Even without the mustache, the resemblance is
text: uncanny.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: You don't look like a small Mexican
dialog: boy at all anymore. We're so ready
dialog: for high school.
scene_heading: INT. SUNNY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL DANCE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.)
dialog: But as it turned out, growing up

speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: That is, until it didn't...
text: RECORD SCREECHES TO A HALT and we END MONTAGE.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNNY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL QUAD - LUNCH TIME
text: Everyone is sectioned off into cliques: Mean Girls eyeing
text: their manicures and complaining about the heat. Jocks with
text: their pecks flexed. The Dorks. The Drama Kids. The one
text: pregnant chick and her boyfriend who knows his life is over,
dialog: aaaaaaaaaand-—
text: Nadine and Krista, now 16, still just the two of them. Nadine
text: has grown out her Pedro haircut and shaped her brows
text: (shooting for Kim Kardashian but landing somewhere around
dialog: Mayim Bialik). It's an awkward, grows-on-you kind of
text: cuteness. Krista is blonde, pretty in a tomboy sort of way,
text: wearing a Radiohead t-shirt. They're sitting under a tree
text: with a penis carved into it.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: We have to relocate. The penistree
text: smells like barf.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: (eating an enormous burrito)
dialog: I love the penistree, it's been our
dialog: spot since freshman year.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Ehh. I feel like we need a change.
speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.)
dialog: That should've been my first clue:

text: wearing a bright red and green RONALDO JERSEY. Time stops and
text: the music swells as he runs his fingers through his hair.
text: Nadine gazes at him longingly, mesmerized. All of the sudden
text: her burrito SMASHES INTO HER FACE, beans and rice everywhere.
speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell, idiot?!
text: Nadine's brother, Darian, cracks up. He's now 18, buff,
text: gorgeous, and insanely popular. He and his buddy FUTCH (17)
text: linebacker's build, carry JACK IN BOX bags.
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: Oh sorry, did I bump you? Tell mom
dialog: I'll be home late, Futch is having
dialog: a party.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: (wiping burrito off her
dialog: cheek)
dialog: Screw you, tell her your gay self!
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: You should try smiling more, it's
dialog: good for you.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: You should try.... not sucking
dialog: more! And not being so dumb and
dialog: retarded...more.
text: Darian frowns at her pitiful comeback. Feels bad for her.
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: I love you, Nadine.
text: Nadine rolls her eyes, watches as Darian walks over to the
text: FLAGPOLE where the popular people hang out. Every single
text: person stops what they're doing to greet Darian The King. He
dialog: owns this school.
text: CARLY CORVETTI (17), vampire-gorgeous with a hint of crazy,
text: makes tragic bedroom eyes at him. He hardly notices.
text: THREE SOPHOMORE GIRLS approach Nadine.
speaker_heading: SOPHOMORE GIRL #1

dialog: (turns to her friends)
dialog: What's that old movie where it
dialog: turns out Arnold Schwarzenegger is
dialog: twins with that short fat bald guy?
dialog: (friends have no idea)
dialog: You know! It's on TBS a lot, it's
dialog: from the 80's? And Arnold's like
text: big and buff and good-looking and
dialog: cool? And then his twin is just
dialog: like the leftover waste of genetic
dialog: shit?
dialog: (they still have no idea)
dialog: Come on, I know you guys know this!
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Twins. The fucking movie is called
dialog: Twins.
speaker_heading: SOPHOMORE GIRL #1
dialog: Twins! Exactly, exactly!

speaker_heading: NADINE

dialog: Hmmm.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: No, I was just wondering if that's
text: possible. Kicking someone's face
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Oh yeah. Sure. Let's say I'm like a
dialog: small Asian Karate master and I
text: just keep kicking his face and
dialog: kicking his face, bah! bah! bah!,
dialog: and then finally after like 45
text: minutes, his face is all bloody and
text: mutilated and dangling off the bone
dialog: like roast beef and shit. Uh huh,
dialog: absolutely possible. 100%.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll buy that.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Anyway, whatever, let's not talk
dialog: about him. Hey, so I had an idea
dialog: for us for prom.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Get this. Hot dog suits. Matching
dialog: ones. It'll be awesome, ‘cause
dialog: it'll be like, "Hey fuckers, You
dialog: know how much we give a shit about
dialog: prom? We're dressed like pork
dialog: wieners, that's how much." You know
dialog: what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: That's awesome, I love it.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Me too, me too. Is it kinda
dialog: pathetic, though? I don't wanna

speaker_heading: ERWIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, so, uh, you know that tree
dialog: you guys always sit under? I took

speaker_heading: KRISTA

dialog: balls, what's he doing right now?"
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: You know what, screw it, for twenty

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: No, no, my actual head. My skull.
dialog: It's too small. Before I thought my

dialog: thinking it's actually just that my
text: head's too small. It makes me look
dialog: ridiculous. I think that's why no

dialog: fucked up part, okay? There's no
dialog: surgery for it. Even if I win the

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: KRISTA

speaker_heading: KRISTA

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I'm not not-seeing your brother.
dialog: I've been thinking about this and
dialog: you really like peanut butter cups,
dialog: right? Well, I would never ask you
dialog: to stop eating them just because
dialog: they make me uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: What? That's the worst analogy I've

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: That's crazy! They're not even that

speaker_heading: KRISTA

speaker_heading: MONA

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Come on, come dance with us!
text: Before she knows it, she's with a big group of POPULAR GIRLS

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Erwin's in a FULL-ON SUIT & TIE. He looks like he's going to

speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Oh, no, no, I was just -- I was
dialog: just dressed like this when you
dialog: called.
text: Nadine nods, not buying it. She moves down the buffet line.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Mmm, clam chowder.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Ooh, I love clam, I could eat clam
dialog: all night long.
dialog: (eyes bulge, realizing)
dialog: No! I didn't mean it like that.
dialog: I seriously meant the real clam,
dialog: not the other clam! No, I mean the
dialog: other one is fine, too, it's great!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What I'm trying to tell you is that
dialog: I like shellfish and I also like
dialog: the other shellfish -- at least
dialog: hypothetically -- but only one of
dialog: those things would I announce at
dialog: full volume in the Souplantation.
text: Nadine just looks at him.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Erwin?
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: You know, I thought chocolate bacon
dialog: would be bad, and I'm surprised to
dialog: say: It's actually worse than that.
dialog: It's just a total miss on every
dialog: level.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: It's not your fault. Unless you
dialog: invented it?
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: No. That was not me.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: That was a joke. I didn't actually
dialog: think you invented chocolate bacon.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Okay.
text: It's their turn. They buckle up in the FERRIS WHEEL.
speaker_heading: ERWIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we go...
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: (as it takes off)
dialog: Wooooo0o0!
text: They reach the top.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Wow, look at that view...

dialog: laughs.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I think I can see Catalina...
text: Erwin smiles. They settle in.
speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Oh, I don't know. I'm just an
dialog: average guy I guess.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: But if you had to expand for the
dialog: two minutes we're on this ride.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Well, I guess I do kinda wish
dialog: people at school didn't just
dialog: automatically stereotype me as the
dialog: nerdy Asian kid... There's a lot
dialog: more to me than that, and I feel
dialog: like if they could see it, they'd
dialog: realize I'm actually, well... kinda
dialog: cool even.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Yeah? Like how?
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: I'm mean, not to brag or sound
dialog: totally full of myself, but, for
dialog: instance... I'm a crazy talented
dialog: flautist.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: As in... you play the flute?
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Not just boring Mozart stuff, I can
dialog: play anything, I really jam on that
dialog: thing. Not to brag.
text: Another beat.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: This is just a suggestion, Erwin,
dialog: but if the goal is to up your cool
dialog: factor, I'm not exactly sure
dialog: "flautist" is the best approach.
dialog: Erwin shrugs. Yeah, maybe not...

dialog: Someday I'd really love to own a
dialog: monkey...
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: A monkey?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: They're illegal, it's almost
dialog: impossible, I'd have to get like 20
dialog: permits. I've thought about buying
dialog: one off the internet, but I read
dialog: about this girl who spent her life
dialog: savings to get a Squirrel Monkey
dialog: from Thailand and then it died 2
dialog: days later. That story depressed
dialog: the crap out of me, I couldn't get
text: out of bed for days.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: That's terrible. I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: It's okay.
text: sort of sit there a second, reflecting on that.
text: Erwin leans over and open-mouth kisses her.
speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (pushing him off)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: What?! I don't know! Was that bad
dialog: timing?! I thought that was good
dialog: timing? We're on the ferris wheel,
dialog: you were sad about the monkey, I
dialog: was comforting you?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Oh. My. God.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Okay. Sorry. That was weird then.

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: It's fine. It's okay.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: No, I feel awful. I'm gonna make it
dialog: up to you. I don't know how yet,

text: the room, she notices Carly standing close to Darian,
text: flirting it up. Heather sees it, too.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah, you prob'ly want to break
dialog: that up, actually. Carly's kind of
text: a massive ho if the way her labia's
dialog: hanging out of her shorts hadn't
dialog: clued you in.

speaker_heading: KRISTA

speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CARLY
dialog: Seriously? It's barely lam.
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: I'm an old man, Carly. I can't keep

speaker_heading: CARLY

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Me, too. Thanks again. See you

speaker_heading: ERWIN

dialog: You're an idiot and you're going to

dialog: 60.
scene_heading: INT. NADINE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The house is dark and quiet. Nadine puts down her stuff,
text: stands there a moment, not sure what to do. She flips on the
text: HOME COMPUTER, logs onto Facebook...
text: She scrolls through Status Updates and Mobile Uploads --
text: everyone in the entire world is having more fun than she is.
text: She clicks on DAN GODWIN'S PAGE (Hot Soccer Dan), her cursor
text: hangs over the SEND FRIEND REQUEST BUTTON for a moment. She
text: chickens out, goes back to the home page.
text: AND THAT'S WHERE SHE SEES IT: "Krista Kaller has changed her
dialog: profile picture."
text: She clicks it open to see: It's gone from a pic of Krista and
text: Nadine, to a PIC OF KRISTA AND DARIAN uploaded at the party.
dialog: They couldn't look happier.
text: Nadine stares at it in disbelief. Pissed, she goes to her own
text: page, clicks "UPLOAD NEW PROFILE PIC," then opens her iPhoto,
text: searching for a pic of herself with someone other than
dialog: Krista. Except... they're ALL with Krista.
text: She closes iPhoto, frustrated. Drums her nails. Then boom, an
speaker_heading: IDEA!
scene_heading: EXT. NADINE'S BACKYARD - NEXT DAY

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: So what you wanna do is line this

dialog: take a little swing...
text: Nadine hits the ball and it goes right through the thingy.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: See! See that?! Ha! I always said

dialog: the kids won't play croquet with

speaker_heading: KRISTA

dialog: about it.

dialog: Intercut
text: Krista leans into her computer screen, getting a closer look.
text: In the pic, Nadine is hanging out at Golf N Stuff with her
text: arm around...AL PACINO. It's a pretty good Photoshop job, but
text: the dimensions are still slightly off.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Yeah, I'm still pretty speechless
dialog: myself...
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: You photoshopped yourself at Golf N
dialog: Stuff with my favorite actor.
speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: KRISTA

speaker_heading: KRISTA

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: We're not Siamese twins, so we have
dialog: to stop acting like them.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Okay...?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: It's not like we share a torso and
dialog: since you decided to become a
dialog: country singer I just have to stand
text: there smiling and playing the
dialog: tambourine even though I hate
dialog: country music and I'm only doing it
dialog: because you have the liver.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: What are you trying to say right
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: My point is, we're too codependent.
dialog: I think we need space.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Space?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Space.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Well, I don't want space.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I know, it'll be very rough.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I don't know why you're saying all
dialog: this. I feel like it's because of
dialog: Darian.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Nope. Nope. Not at all why.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: I feel like it is.

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: So this is where you eat lunch. I
dialog: never knew.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Oh hi. Hey. Yeah, we practice in
dialog: here sometimes. These are my

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Hey, has anyone told you guys you
dialog: kinda look alike?
text: They just stare blankly at her.

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Don't be nervous, I won't look at
dialog: you, I'll just stare at my feet if
dialog: that helps.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Uh... alright.
text: As Erwin gets up his nerve, Nadine finds a seat in the
text: theatre, pulls out her burrito. Erwin starts out slow, then
text: gathers confidence, until finally breaking into an awesome
text: rendition of Come on Eileen by Dexy's Midnight Runners. He
text: jams on it, adding a badass beat-boxing element.
text: Nadine drops her burrito, watching him in awe. It's
text: absolutely fucking incredible. When he finishes, she gives
text: him a standing ovation.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Holy shit, are you kidding me,
dialog: Erwin?!
text: He kicks the ground, bashful.
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: Oh, be quiet...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Wait, you mean that in, like, a
dialog: good way, right?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I can't believe you just beat-boxed
dialog: on that thing. Who are you?!
speaker_heading: ERWIN
dialog: That's a new technique I'm trying
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I don't know how else to say this,
dialog: but you have single-handedly made

text: into Heather's waiting CONVERTIBLE with FOUR OTHER POPULAR
text: GIRLS. Heather turns up her music and the girls hoot and
text: cheer as they screech off.

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Krista has dandruff!
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NADINE
text: There's a Costco-size bottle of
text: Head and Shoulders in her shower,
dialog: if you don't believe me. If she

text: Darian sets down the weights, sensing what this is.
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: Nadine, I know exactly what you're

speaker_heading: NADINE

scene_heading: INT. NADINE'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: Nadine tosses and turns in bed, unable to sleep because she

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: You've been on the phone for 2
dialog: hours. And stop doing that baby
dialog: voice, you're a grown freaking man!
text: He just giggles louder. She gives up, switches on her TV,

dialog: something out last night. Something
dialog: big.
speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I'm worried you'll freak out when I
dialog: tell you, though, because it's

speaker_heading: KRISTA

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: So there's this girl, Carrie, and
dialog: she's all dicked up 'cause her
dialog: mom's a psycho and makes her read
dialog: the bible 20 hours a day or some

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: That -- and I'm sorry because I

speaker_heading: KRISTA
dialog: You think he asked me to be his

speaker_heading: NADINE

dialog: Isn't this what you were after the
dialog: whole time.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Not like this...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I've never seen Krista cry like
dialog: that before... it was so sad. And
dialog: then Erwin, I even hurt Erwin, and
dialog: he's the nicest person ever. Last
text: week he had a spider in his car and
dialog: felt too bad killing it so he just
dialog: kept trying to shoo it out the
text: window. It bit him like four times
dialog: in the process...

speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know, mom... I just wanted
dialog: things to be like they were, you
dialog: know? When Darian came along it
dialog: just changed everything.
text: Mona puts an arm around Nadine, pulls her close.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Honey, being friends would be easy
dialog: if everything always stayed the
dialog: same... you always lived right down
dialog: the street from each other, had the
dialog: same hobbies, were single and not-—
dialog: single at the same time. But you
dialog: grow up and realize your lives
dialog: aren't always going to intersect so
dialog: neatly. Hell, next year you two may
dialog: go off to different colleges...
dialog: Couple years after that, maybe
text: she's married with a baby while
dialog: you're out freaking some Italian
dialog: guy you just met at the club. Do
dialog: they still call it "freaking" or is
dialog: that over now?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Pretty sure that one's done.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You get my point though. A lot of
dialog: friendships can't handle change.
dialog: But the good ones... they adjust.
dialog: If you really care about each
dialog: other, you find a way to make it
dialog: work.
text: Nadine lets this sink in. After a moment, she puts her arms
text: around Mona, hugs her tight.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I love you, mom.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I love you too, hon.
dialog: (beat, looks around)

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Darian --
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: No, I'm serious. I really wish I
dialog: would've fallen for somebody else,

dialog: best friend. She's amazing.
text: Nadine can tell how sincere he is.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: You've gotta take her to prom
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: She doesn't want to go.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I have a plan to fix that. I kinda
dialog: need your assistance, though.
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: What do you need?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: A ride some places, help with a few
dialog: errands, and if you happen to know
dialog: the lead singer of Radiohead and/or
dialog: someone who does sky-writing?
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: (are you kidding me?)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Might have to switch some things

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: Exciting, huh.
speaker_heading: NADINE
text: Smells like taco seasoning.

scene_heading: MAINTENANCE."
speaker_heading: DARIAN

scene_heading: EXT. PARTY CITY - EVENING

scene_heading: EXT. ERWIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Darian cuts the engine, quietly rolls up along Erwin's curb.
text: They quietly slide out of the car, creeping through the dark.

dialog: style.
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: (whispers )
dialog: You think that's necessary?
text: He's just walking normally.
speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: That's what mom told me...
text: They get in line, both looking very nervous about this.

speaker_heading: ERWIN'S DAD
dialog: (in Korean)
dialog: Erwin! Get out here right now!

speaker_heading: NADINE

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I can't wait.
text: Nadine clicks the phone off just as she pulls up outside

speaker_heading: NADINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Show time.
text: Nadine swallows, nervous.
scene_heading: INT. KRISTA'S BEDROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Krista is folding laundry on her bed when she hears something
dialog: strange outside...
text: It almost sounds like Radiohead's Karma Police, except
dialog: something about it is not quite right.
text: She moves to the open window, looks down to see she's being
dialog: serenaded by --
text: A PERSIAN MAN (45) -- big mustache, long pony tail,
text: iridescent shirt unbuttoned to reveal copious chest hair and
dialog: gold jewelry.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He's standing below her window with a guitar, singing Karma
text: Police in a very thick accent, about 10x more up-tempo, and
text: with lots of little middle-eastern vocal trills.
text: He tosses his hair and dances in place, feeling the rhythm.
text: During this performance, Nadine pushes a little machine onto
text: Krista's front lawn. It's a FOOTBALL FIELD PAINTER. She
text: wheels it across the grass, spelling out he words "I'M
text: SORRY." It's not sky-writing, but close.
text: Krista can't help but laugh. The dude finishes the song and
text: they both clap.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: I wanted to get Thom Yorke but he
dialog: wasn't available, and, well, my
dialog: mom's cousin Hamayoun was. He's

speaker_heading: KRISTA

speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: Wow, sis.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Is the zebra print too much? I was

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Why don't you show these assholes

speaker_heading: TIME CUT--
speaker_heading: NADINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We decided to go to Denny's.
