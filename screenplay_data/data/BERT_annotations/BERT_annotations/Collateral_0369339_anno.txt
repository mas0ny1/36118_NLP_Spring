text: slide past in a 400mm lens. Then, entering a plane of focus is
text: VINCENT. He walks towards us...an arriving passenger. Suit.
text: Shirt. No tie. Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say
text: "confident executive traveler." The suit's custom-made but not
text: domestic. His hair and shades are current, but it would be
dialog: difficult to describe his identifying specifics...grey suit,
dialog: white shirt, medium height. And that's the idea...
scene_heading: CLOSE BEHIND VINCENT
text: OVER his left shoulder, walking through milling travelers
text: towards the distant wall of metal and glass, sunlight streaming
dialog: at him...
scene_heading: ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN
text: - suit, blonde crew cut - walks to camera. Same sunlight, but
text: it hits him from the side. His trajectory is from the left.
text: His eyeline is slightly right. Just now, he looks down at a
text: ticket in his hand...
scene_heading: OVER VINCENT'S LEFT SHOULDER...
text: right now something catches Vincent's eye. And the two men bump
dialog: into each other...
scene_heading: TWO-SHOT...
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You okay? Sorry...
text: Vincent puts down his briefcase. The man has a similar

dialog: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, mate. Enjoy

scene_heading: VINCENT GRABS THE BRIEFCASE OF THE MAN
text: with the North London working-class accent. And continues

text: flowing like liquid along windshield glass...
dialog: 
text: SOUNDS are dreamlike and abstract, reverberated and discordant,
text: bouncing off concrete walls: car doors OPENING and CLOSING.
text: Brakes. A BABBLE of multi-lingual crosstalk.
text: Racing Forms. A Farsi newspaper. African hands on a
text: Blackberry. Max's hands do The New York Times crossword. A
text: West African speaks French into a cell phone. Metallica in a
dialog: headset. Hip-hop, Norteno...

scene_heading: INT. TAXI DISPATCH - L.A. - DAY 2

dialog: open...
scene_heading: INT. ONE CAB - MAX'S HANDS 3
text: enter. They wipe the seats with paper towels and 409...a DMV
text: LICENSE fitted into the small Lexan holder. On it is a picture
dialog: of Max.
text: Lights being checked. Indicators. Hazards. Switches. Similar
dialog: to a pilot doing an aircraft check list. Fast. All fine.
scene_heading: REVEAL NOW: MAX'S BRIEFCASE
text: He opens it, preparing for his workday. CD caddy of personal

scene_heading: INT. FOURTH CAR - VINCENT - NIGHT 106D
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: is coming...
speaker_heading: VARIOUS ANGLES
text: ...and the SEQUENCE BUILDS, Vincent working toward the front...
text: Max and Annie desperately looking for cover. City racing by.
text: Train racing by city. A few RAGGED PASSENGERS trying to huddle
text: out of harm's way with nowhere to go. As the TRAIN THUNDERS AND
text: SHRIEKS over the track junctures...
speaker_heading: THE FIRST CAR
text: Max and Annie rush in, slide the door shut. This is as far as
text: they can go. They drop into a crouch at the door, breathing
text: hard, terrified, Max with his back against the wall, arm stiffly
text: keeping the door handle wedged tight, his head just below the
text: door's window. A harsh, ragged whisper:
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Where's the next station?
text: A frozen moment. Eyes locked. Knowing they're probably going
text: to die together, even though they hardly know each other.
text: THE TRAIN GOES BLACK, LIGHTS DYING AS THEY SHRIEK OVER ANOTHER
text: JUNCTURE...then the LIGHTS RETURN, stuttering.
text: Max rises slightly up, peers over the lip of the window. Here
text: comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car. He sees
text: Max. He shouts, barely audible from here...
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: YOU CAN'T WIN, MAX! I DO THIS FOR A
speaker_heading: LIVING!
text: ..-and he keeps coming, .45 at his side, a sheet of blood down
text: his face from the missing part of his ear.
text: ...the visage of Vincent, the .45 in his hands, scares the shit
text: out of the early-morning passengers.
text: ..-and Max clutches the H+K, takes a deep, shaky breath, his
text: eyes on Annie's, not even sure in that moment what he's going to
text: do, probably die, and he lunges up, Vincent not ten feet away...
text: AND THE TRAIN GOES DARK.

text: A BLIZZARD OF MUZZLE FLASHES, both men FIRING THROUGH THE
text: WINDOWS at each other, GLASS SHATTERING between the cars and
text: getting sucked away by the wind, Max screaming, face lit only by
text: the GUNFIRE, clumsy in how he holds Vincent's H+K, firing one-
text: handed, not aiming, not looking where he's shooting...Vincent's
text: Para-Ordnance BOOMING OUT MASSIVE ERUPTIONS OF FLAME...

text: ---and then abrupt silence as the LIGHTS RETURN, Max looking
text: down, his expression nearly childlike with terror. He stares at
text: the H+K in his shaking hand, sees the slide is locked back -
text: gun's empty. He rises up. His look says, "go ahead, kill
text: me..." through the shattered window.
text: Vincent's standing in the other car, right where we left him.
text: Watching Max. A little smile on his face.
scene_heading: INT. VINCENT'S CAR - NIGHT 107
text: Vincent ejects the empty magazine. Before it even hits the
text: floor or at his feet...Vincent's hand loading a full mag, the
text: weapon pointed at Max, like it was when he reloaded and shot
dialog: Peter Yip the first time.
text: Odd, though. His fingers aren't working that well. His
text: brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone. He fumbles the reload, in
dialog: fact.
text: The magazine of stacked .45's drops, landing at his feet among
text: the expended casings. A few fresh droplets of blood patter
dialog: quietly.
text: Vincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like
text: way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if
text: confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back
dialog: of the car.
text: The .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor.
text: Max watches Vincent walk away.
text: Vincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an
text: aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his
dialog: breath.
text: Max slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars.
text: Slides the second door open. Enters.
text: Vincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously
text: nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the
text: floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool.
text: Vincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across
text: from him. Annie appears in b.g., watching them.
speaker_heading: VINCENT + MAX
text: sit there, riding the train. Softly:
speaker_heading: MAX
text: We're almost at the next station.

scene_heading: 10/9/03 MM revs. (yellow) 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 107
text: Vincent smiles faintly. He leans his head toward Max as if
text: conferring a secret. In a halting whisper:
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: Guy. Gets on a subway. Dies.
dialog: (off Max's look)
dialog: Think anybody'11 notice?
speaker_heading: MAX
text: looks into Vincent's eyes. It means "I'm that guy" and "will
dialog: anybody notice me when I'm gone?"
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: leans back, gazing straight ahead now. Rocking gently with the
dialog: motion of the train...
text: ..--and with much effort and to Max's amazement, Vincent emits a
text: soft, rasping wheeze, but it's a faint laugh all the same.
text: Max has no idea what's so funny to a dying man. Vincent looks.
text: Max follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all
text: the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is:
speaker_heading: AN AD
dialog: The whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine. A dream place.
text: Limitless horizon.
scene_heading: INT. VINCENT'S CAR - MAX - DAWN 107A
text: Vincent's no longer laughing. In fact, Vincent's no longer
dialog: doing anything. Ever.
text: Annie comes to Max and sits. She shivers. Max takes off his
text: zippered, hooded sweatshirt and puts it around Annie. It's a
text: small gesture. But it's a protective and confident act... She
text: takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the
text: train together, side by side, neither saying a word. For now.
text: The train pulls in to a station...
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR
text: .»..and Max pulls Annie to her feet. The doors open. They
text: silently get off. The first sideways streams of yellow light
text: shaft into the station.
text: The doors close again. The train pulls out.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 107A
text: WE HOLD ON Vincent for a while. Riding the train by himself,
text: into the dawn, his head back as if sleeping, alone in the car,
text: as the sun rises.
text: Another dead guy on the subway...riding into a new day.
text: And Max, in his Polo shirt and dirty pants, an arm around Annie,
text: wearing his stained sweatshirt, rises to us up the
text: escalator...freeways, arteries of traffic behind them.
