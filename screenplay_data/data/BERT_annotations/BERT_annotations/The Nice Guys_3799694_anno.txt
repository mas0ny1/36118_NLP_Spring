text: Once-glamorous Hollywood Boulevard -- a RED-LIGHT district.
text: In the VALLEY, SMOG alerts keep kids HOME FROM SCHOOL.
dialog: At the start of this decade, Los Angeles filed a lawsuit
dialog: against the Big Three automakers.
dialog: The charge? A CONSPIRACY to suppress what was then known
dialog: only as "a smog control device."
text: In fact? The CATALYTIC CONVERTER, as it is now known, had
dialog: been withheld for over a decade.
text: All the above is TRUE. The story that follows: PROBABLY NOT.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - COLDWATER CANYON - L.A. - NIGHT
text: Lighted HOMES dot the landscape. Clinging like stragglers
text: to the steep canyon. Wreathed in fog. Secure. Sleepy.
text: Above, random cars shuush by up on Mulholland.
text: PUSH IN ON ONE HOME
text: Nestled in the canyon. The back door opens, emits a brief
text: shaft of light, as a BOY (14) in pajamas lets the dog out.
text: He shuts the door. And the CAMERA DRIFTS alongside the
text: house. He's visible through windows, heading down the hall,
text: switching off lights as he goes.
text: WE PUSH IN THROUGH A WINDOW
text: Following behind the boy. Down a darkened hallway as he
text: stops at one particular door...
text: He turns the knob, ever so gently. Listens... Then --
text: CLICK--! The boy switches on a PEN FLASHLIGHT.
text: Enters the room. Creeping in carefully, inching his way
text: towards A BED. He leans down. Peers underneath.
text: From above, SNORING. Mom, Pop. He shines the light:
text: THERE, under the bed, surrounded by dust bunnies--
text: A STACK OF PORN MAGAZINES
text: The boy grasps one from the top. Gingerly, slides it off.
text: Stands again. Penlight, off. Heads back out
text: INTO THE HALLWAY
text: The boy (let's call him Bobby) moves quickly now. Starts
text: back down the hallway, examining the magazine.
text: It's called BUSTER. And it's a clear product of its decade.
text: The cover prominently features a porn star with a noteworthy
text: rack... Bold lettering proclaims her to be: SUPERSTAR MISTY
text: MOUNTAINS. Bobby smiles.
text: We follow him into the KITCHEN. He raids the fridge. Finds
text: half a HAM SANDWICH, drops it on a plate. Eyes riveted on the
text: CENTERFOLD: MISTY in full glory--
text: He turns, heads toward his room... A man with a purpose. Do
dialog: we want to know this purpose?
text: He stops. Damn. Forgot something. Jogs back, with us in tow.
text: Crosses to the fridge. Opens it. Grabs a bottle of milk.
dialog: Of course, forgot the milk. Where's our thinking?
text: He stands, the kitchen window at his back, and pours himself
text: a glass... And that's when we see something he doesn't--
text: OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW
text: A CAR. Way in the distance. A POWDER-BLUE TRANS AM.
text: It appears out of nowhere. Punching through the guardrail up
text: on Mulholland with a fog-muffled CRUMP-!
text: It's almost comical. Half-obscured by Bobby's head, the car
text: crosses our POV. Showering earth.
dialog: Then it's GONE. Blink and you missed it. Window, boring again.
text: Holy shit. BOBBY, oblivious.
text: Leaves the kitchen, actually yanks our POV away. Walks,
text: juggling the sandwich and magazine, into the living room.
text: Raises the glass of milk, takes a sip --
speaker_heading: THE WALL EXPLODES
text: Just DISINTEGRATES. The whole damn thing.
text: Part of the CEILING going with it, as
scene_heading: THE POWDER-BLUE TRANS AM
text: BLASTS into the house, moving impossibly fast.
text: Showering DEBRIS. Trailing trees, brush...
text: It hurtles across the room. DETONATES obstacles. BLOWS them to
text: splinters. Sweeps the place clean, doing 50, half on its side--
text: Then, just as promptly, DEPARTS.
text: Crash--! Sails OUT THE OPPOSITE WALL. Into the night.
text: Just like that. CAMERA PANS TO FOLLOW --
text: Peering out the gaping HOLE, out and down --
text: Unbelievable. There it is, STILL GOING. Plunging down a
text: HILLSIDE. Tumbling. Chewing up huge GOUTS of dirt.
text: WHAM--! It slams to a STOP. A hundred yards down the hill.
text: Battered. Smoking... Stillness, then. Echoes, fading...
text: BOBBY, knocked off his feet by the impact, stands shakily.
text: Stares out what used to be the back wall of his house...
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - MINUTES LATER
text: BOBBY staggers downhill in his PJs. Past uprooted trees,
text: gouged earth. Trailing in the car's WAKE --
text: The sound of DOGS BARKING fills the canyon now. Faintly we
text: hear Bobby's PARENTS up above. Calling his name.
text: Bobby stumbles. Falls. Rolls to his feet...
text: THERE, BELOW.
text: The car sits steaming. Roof pancaked.
text: He forces his feet to move. Approaches the wreck as you'd
text: approach a sleeping dragon. Cranes his neck for a look...
text: The car is empty. And then A COUGH. BEHIND him, he spins--
text: Stops dead. Transfixed.
scene_heading: MISTY MOUNTAINS
text: Lies twisted against a rock. Completely nude. Famous curves
text: bruised, discolored (this is to be handled tastefully.)
text: Bobby can't help staring. He tries to make sense of what he's
dialog: seeing: That's Misty Mountains. That's her in the flesh.
text: Her breath comes in hitches, gulps.
text: Her eyes are swimming. Unfocused.
text: Finally notices BOBBY. Fixes him with a pain-wracked stare.
scene_heading: MISTY MOUNTAINS
dialog: How... do you like my car... Big Boy.
text: SIRENS, approaching.
text: She convulses. Spasms once, twice. BLOOD jets from her mouth.
text: She dies staring at him.
dialog: The strangest moment of this kid's young life.
text: The two of them in tableau. SIRENS, closer now. Wind, gusting.
text: We hold... And then Bobby does something odd. He grips his
text: pajama top. Yanks it over his head. Shivers, it's cold.
text: Steps up next to the corpse...
text: Delicately lays the fabric across her. Covers her up.
text: Withdraws. Stands trembling in the cold.
text: Waiting on the sirens... CUT TO BLACK. ROLL CREDITS.
dialog: Pause, then--
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o)

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: SOMEONE watches from a store window across the street.
dialog: He's got a kind face, this man. Late-thirties maybe.
dialog: For the record? Meet JACKSON HEALY.
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: Take this one. Thirteen and already she's

scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

speaker_heading: OLDER MAN (0.s.)
dialog: Yeah! Who's the man, baby?! Who?!
speaker_heading: YOUNG BEAUTY (o.s.)
dialog: -.. You are. You're the man. Oh, yes.
dialog: You're the man! You! You!
scene_heading: CAMERA FINDS HEALY
text: Just below the window. Hidden in SHADOW. Bored, eating

speaker_heading: YOUNG BEAUTY (o.s.)
dialog: You're the man! You're my Foxy-fox!
text: Healy frowns: Foxy-fox..?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BEAUTY (o.s.)
dialog: Foxy-fox! Foxy-fox!

text: Whispers to himself:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah, but is he the man...?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BEAUTY
dialog: Oh, yes baby! Yes! You're the man, baby!
text: Ah, that's better... Healy smiles as he finds a cashew.

scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO: A POLYNESIAN RESTAURANT
text: HEALY sits across a table from a knockout BLONDE. They stare

text: The blonde cuts him off:
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Jack... I slept with your father.
text: The guy at the next table does a SPIT TAKE.
text: BACK TO SCENE - Healy dusts peanut debris from his hands.
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: Marriage is buying a house for someone
dialog: you hate... Remember that.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - SAME HOUSE - LATER
text: The YOUNG BEAUTY exits. Alone. Her BICYCLE, stashed by the
text: front door. Banana seat. Tassels on the handlebars. She gets
text: on, rides off. HEALY steps from the shadows. Stares after her.
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: Yep, these days the world is a vulgar,
dialog: unromantic place...
text: HEALY cracks his neck. Grimaces. Slips on a pair of BRASS
text: KNUCKLES. Starts towards the front of the house--
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: So I adjust.
text: Healy knocks on the FRONT DOOR. The OLDER GUY answers it.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Are you the man?
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: What..?
text: Healy SLUGS him. WHAM--! SHATTERS the man's JAW--
text: And right then we FREEZE FRAME. On the moment of impact.
text: The poor guy's face CONTORTED IMPOSSIBLY. Sickeningly.
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o)
dialog: I don't have a job title. I'm not in the

dialog: with someone --
scene_heading: INT. THE COMEDY STORE - NIGHT
text: Setting up for the night's business. Healy sits in a booth at

speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: -- Someone's threatening you, someone's
dialog: messing around with your underage

text: The older man gives Healy an ENVELOPE. Shakes his hand. Leaves.
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: -- You might ask around for me: Jackson

dialog: good, I'm easy to find. When it isn't--?
scene_heading: INT. UNITED DC-10 - COACH SECTION - MID-FLIGHT - NIGHT
text: Crammed to overflowing with weary travelers. The color

speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.) ,
dialog: -- Means I'm traveling... The 1° and 14°
dialog: of every month.
text: Healy reaches into the front pocket of his jacket, takes out

text: Never taking his other hand off the briefcase.
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: LA to New York. Drop off and pick up. No
dialog: questions asked. Not something I'm proud
dialog: of... But it's work.
text: A stewardess approaches Healy--
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Sir..? I'm sorry, but if you'd like to
dialog: smoke you'll have to move to the smoking
text: section of the plane.
text: Healy follows her finger. On the floor, a yellow LINE. Beyond
text: that, a bunch of people smoking. Healy gets up --
text: Moves FIVE WHOLE FEET. Sits. Ah. Now it's cool to smoke.
text: Joins his fellow smokers, puffing away. Smoke BILLOWS
text: throughout the plane... A BABY coughs.
scene_heading: EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - GRAVEL TURNOUT - SUNSET
text: The city of Los Angeles laid out as far as the eye can see.
text: Which isn't that far, really. SMOG obscures most of the view.
text: TWO CARS are parked up here. Healy's Chevelle, and a Ford.
text: Healy leans against the Ford.
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: Sometimes I feel okay about things. Not
dialog: often. Scotty, my AA sponsor, keeps trying
dialog: to get me to quit this kind of work.
text: Inside the Ford is a WOMAN. Dirty blonde hair. Young.
text: Healy a slip of PINK, COW-SHAPED NOTEPAPER:
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I think there's two of ‘em... I just got
dialog: the name and description for one. They've
dialog: been talking to all my friends, asking
dialog: where I live. I'm scared.
text: Healy studies the slip of paper. Pockets it.
text: The woman hands him an envelope.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You'll take care of ‘em?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Consider it done.
text: The girl offers Healy a fragile smile.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Thank you... I feel better already.
dialog: You... You make me feel safe.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: That's my job.
text: Healy starts to leave, counting the money in the envelope--
text: Then stops. Turns back. Leans in the window:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Um, you're short.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I'm... What?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You're twenty bucks short.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry... Here, ummm...
text: She fishes through her purse for some cash. Finds two tens.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Sorry, here...
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MULHOLLAND
text: The FORD drives off. Taillights, receding. Healy watches it go.
speaker_heading: HEALY (v.o.)
dialog: Truth is, I've been thinking about what
dialog: Scotty said... I could try for an
dialog: investigators' license. Become a detective,
dialog: you know..? Those guys help people.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe then I'd feel good in the morning.
text: CUT TO BLACK. Pause. Then--
scene_heading: INT. RESIDENTIAL HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
text: A HAND dangles limply from the edge of a PORCELAIN TUB.
text: WIDEN to reveal a tousled-looking MAN, 40-ish. FULLY
text: DRESSED, immersed in water up to his neck. Dead asleep...
scene_heading: Meet HOLLAND MARCH.
text: Somewhere in the house a PHONE starts to RING.
text: Slowly, March's EYES open. He sits up, sloshing water.
text: Winces. Puts a hand to his throbbing temple. Stops, frowns.
text: There's something WRITTEN on the palm of his hand.
text: With a permanent marker, in an unmistakably feminine script:
dialog: YOU WILL NEVER BE HAPPY
text: March just stares at it: How did that get there..? The phone,
text: still RINGING. March ignores it. An answering machine picks up:
speaker_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE (0.s.)
dialog: You have reached March Investigations.
dialog: This machine records messages. Wait for
text: the tone, and speak clearly.
text: A BEEP, followed by:
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (HOLLY) (o.s.)
dialog: This is your daughter speaking. Thursday,

speaker_heading: MARCH

scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S CAR - SUNSET BOULEVARD - DAY
text: March in a beat-up CONVERTIBLE. Stuck in a GAS LINE.

dialog: Nossir. People are still mean and petty
dialog: and unforgiving... which is good, ‘cuz
dialog: otherwise I'd be out of a job.
text: Up at the pumps, a FIGHT breaks out. March ignores it...
text: Peruses the day's newspaper. A featured headline:
scene_heading: BRAZIL'S 'KILLER BEE' RAMPAGE CONTINUES
text: He takes out a PORTABLE ELECTRIC RAZOR the size of a BRICK.
text: Starts shaving. The glamorous life of a detective.
speaker_heading: MARCH (v.o.)
dialog: They implemented a no-fault divorce here
dialog: couple of years back. That screwed things
dialog: up... Lotta private cops folded.

dialog: Missing..? I see.

speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: I'm terribly worried... Fred's just never

text: March squints at the PLAQUE affixed to it:
text: FRED MILLER -- A devoted and loving husband.

speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Um, Mrs. Miller... Your husband Fred..?
dialog: Exactly how long has he been missing?
speaker_heading: OLD LADY

text: March sidles up, whistling. Glances both ways.
speaker_heading: MARCH (v.o)
dialog: But it's worth it. As long as you get the

speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Ow! Shit!
text: He pulls his hand back out. His wrist is BLEEDING. Fuck.
text: He puts pressure on it. Red SEEPS through his fingers.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Ow, OW, Ow.

text: Sees her snake beneath a chain-link fence.
text: Once inside, she stands. Dusts herself off.
text: Paces off 10 steps across the scorched, barren ground.
text: 6 steps over, 3 back -- like following a treasure map.

text: She finds a specific spot. SITS. Composed. Takes out a BOOK.

text: his pocket. It's PINK. And shaped like a COW. Checks it--
text: Then gets out of the car, whistling a tune. He crosses to a
text: slightly run down 50's-modern HOUSE. Patting his coat pockets
text: as he goes, looking for something:
text: His brass knuckles. Gone. Shit. He shrugs it off. KNOCKS.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Just a minute..! Who is it?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Messenger service. Holland March home..?
text: The door opens -- revealing none other than HOLLAND MARCH.
text: Distracted, scratching at the bandage on his wrist--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hi.
text: Healy SLUGS MARCH full in the face.
text: March drops as though pole-axed.
text: Healy steps past him. Inside. Shaking his hand in pain...
text: Shuts the door. Looms over March. Poised like a dancer:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Mr. March, we're gonna play a game.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: This is a mistake, you got the --OOOFF--!
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: It's called, "Shut up, unless you're me."
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: I... I LOVE that game.
text: Healy spots March's WALLET on a nearby counter. SLUGS him
text: again for good measure, then crosses -- begins idly flipping
text: through the wallet. Stops. Whistles low:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You're a private investigator?
text: MARCH manages to sit up. Props himself against the wall.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Look... There's 30 bucks there. Take it.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I told you, I'm a messenger.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: You afford this on a P.I.'s salary?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: At night I'm a superhero. What's the
dialog: message?
text: Healy kneels down next to March--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Stop. Looking. For Amelia.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Fine. Hey. 'Nuff said. Put a fork in me.
dialog: I'm done. Don't really put a fork in me.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (stands)
dialog: That's fine, Mr. March. Amelia will be
dialog: happy to hear you got the message. Almost
dialog: done. Last thing..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You wanna know who hired me to find her.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Bingo. Now, we can do this the easy way--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Her name's Glenn.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Or we can do this the hard way--
dialog: 18
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: My client's name is Lily Glenn. She's an
dialog: old woman. Thinks Amelia might be her
dialog: niece... Hired me on Tuesday.
text: Healy stops, momentarily thrown. March spits blood.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Anything else..?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You just gave up your client.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Well, I made a discretionary revelation--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: No, you gave her up, just like that. Some
dialog: poor old woman pays you good money and
dialog: that's how you treat her..?
text: March just shrugs. Supports himself on a coffee table...
text: Stands. Slowly, painfully. Covertly slipping one hand into
scene_heading: an OVERTURNED COOKIE JAR--
text: Comes up with a .38 SPECIAL. Spins toward Healy...
text: Only Healy isn't where he was, he's dropped, he's on the
text: ground, foot lashing out -- KICKING THE COFFEE TABLE.
text: -- WHAM! -- the whole damn thing comes up from the ground.
text: SLAMS MARCH in the face. Knocks him back on his ass.
text: Healy is on him in a flash. Grabs the gun. Dumps the shells.
text: Tosses it... Says, sadness in his voice:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I'm sorry you didn't get the message.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I get it now. I dig. I get it.
text: Healy grabs March, wrenches his bandaged arm up behind his
text: back. Pins him against the wall.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Ow. Watch it there! I'm injured!
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Listen, when you talk to your doctor,
dialog: tell him you've got a spiral fracture of
dialog: the right humerus... Got that?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Wait, wait... Jesus, man, STOP!
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: Deep breath.
text: Healy twists March's arm PAST THE BREAKING POINT -- CRACK! --
text: March screams as we SLAM-CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MARCH'S HOUSE - DUSK
text: Healy comes out the front door. A YOUNG GIRL, carrying a
text: grocery bag, is headed the opposite way, swigging a drink--
text: It's the same girl he saw in the FENCED-OFF LOT earlier.
dialog: This, we will come to realize, is March's daughter HOLLY.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Hi. Want a Yoo-Hoo?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: A Yoo-Hoo..? Man, I haven't had one of
dialog: those in about 10 years.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Knock yourself out.
dialog: (hands him one)
dialog: You a friend of my Dad's?
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: Business associate. He's inside. Resting.
dialog: (vigorously shaking the bottle)
dialog: Didn't I see you crawling around an empty
dialog: lot a few blocks over..?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: ... Maybe... I read there sometimes.
text: Healy nods. Takes a swig of his drink. Smiles.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: "It's me-he for yoo-hoo!"
dialog: (nods again, a beat)
dialog: Well... Thanks.
text: The girl waves. Walks up to the house. Healy gets into his car.
text: Takes another sip of Yoo-Hoo. Smiles. Drives off.
text: CUT TO: A WHOLE DAMN CASE OF YOO-HOO. CLINK-ING as --
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT
text: Healy lugs it down the sidewalk on Sunset. Pushes through a
text: small crowd of people waiting outside a CLUB.
dialog: 20
scene_heading: INT. THE COMEDY STORE - SAME
text: Busy night. A BAD STAND-UP holds forth on the lighted stage:
speaker_heading: RONNIE THE COMIC
dialog: So you heard about this lawsuit..? L.A.
dialog: is suing the automakers over the
dialog: catalytic converter.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Thing is, I don't see what all the fuss
dialog: is about... I installed one on my car,
dialog: nothing happened... Except, well, I
dialog: turned into a Catholic. But that's it.
text: The laughter is not deafening.
text: Healy wrestles the Yoo-Hoos through an UNMARKED DOOR at the
text: back of the club. Starts up a FLIGHT OF STAIRS --
text: Someone enters behind him. Healy looks back:
text: TWO MEN. One's older, with horn-rimmed glasses and a brush
text: cut. The other's in his twenties, feathered hair and gold
dialog: chains. Back in the day, Richard Lynch would have played
dialog: this guy. Don't know who that is? Shame on you.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sorry, this area is private.
text: Gold Chain ignores this. Starts up toward Healy. The Older
text: Guy closes the door at the base of the steps.
speaker_heading: GOLD CHAIN
dialog: Wow. You got, like, an apartment up here?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Guys, if you're looking for a bathroom--
speaker_heading: GOLD CHAIN
dialog: Nice try. We're looking for Amelia.
text: A BLUR OF SILVER.
text: GOLD CHAIN has a STEEL BATON. Healy can't react. Hands full
text: -- WHACK--! Down he goes. Yoo-hoo's SMASHING as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: AN OLD WOMAN'S FACE, DISTRAUGHT
text: This is Lily Glenn. And she looks like she's about to cry--
scene_heading: INT. PASADENA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MARCH walks past camera. His right arm is in a CAST now.
dialog: 21
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Mrs. Glenn, let's be reasonable; this is
dialog: a high profile case, your niece was a
dialog: famous, um... actress. The head medical
dialog: examiner himself ID'd the body--
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: I'm telling you, I SAW her, Mr. March. I
dialog: didn't imagine it. I saw my Misty alive.
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: I... I thought you said you found her...
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: No... I said I was tracking the girl you
dialog: saw; doesn't mean it's your niece.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: Why won't anyone believe me?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Mrs. Glenn, you were upset. You were at
dialog: your dead niece's house, all those
dialog: painful memories -- you just made a
dialog: mistake, could happen to anybo--
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: I'm telling you, it was Misty. There was
dialog: no mistake... I saw her through the front
dialog: window--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yes, you said--
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
text: --clear as day. She was wearing a blue
text: pinstriped jacket. She was writing
dialog: something... Then she came out and drove
dialog: off before I could get her attention.
dialog: (points)
dialog: This was TWO DAYS after the accident!
dialog: AFTER they said she went off that cliff!
text: A pause. March takes a deep breath... Then:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Mrs. Glenn, Misty Mountains is dead...
dialog: She died in that accident... I never
dialog: should have taken your money in the first
dialog: place.
text: The old woman starts to cry. Chin set in feeble
dialog: determination:
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: Even if it's for nothing... Even if this
dialog: Amelia girl isn't my niece... I don't
dialog: have anything else, do you understand..?
dialog: Please, Mr. March -- please -- will you
dialog: keep looking for her? For me?
text: March sighs... Considering.
text: Then looks the old lady directly in the eye and says:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: No.
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S CAR - SAME
text: March climbs in the passenger side. Slams the door. A pause.
text: Holly sits in the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Holly... Am I a bad person?
text: Holly picks at her nails, distracted.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: ... Yeah, pretty much.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (nods, then)
dialog: Drive. Get me out of here.
text: Holly puts it in gear.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Did you solve the case, dad?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ... Sure. Yeah. Case closed.
scene_heading: INT. HEALY'S APARTMENT - SAME
text: WHAM--! Healy smacks against a wall.
text: Then crumples as GOLD CHAIN enters frame. Looms over him.
text: In the background OLDER GUY is tossing the place. Emptying
text: drawers. Throwing stuff... Gold Chain kneels next to Healy:
speaker_heading: GOLD CHAIN
dialog: Okay, sport, I'm asking you again...
dialog: Where is Amelia?
text: Healy makes himself sit up. He looks resigned, weary. He
text: spots a pack cigarettes amongst the nearby debris. Grabs it
text: as a wave of LAUGHTER wafts up from the club below.
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: .».. Told you... I just don't know anyone
dialog: named Amelia... I--
text: Gold Chain KICKS Healy in the gut, WHAM--! No warning. Folds him
text: sideways, retching. More LAUGHTER from the club below.
text: Healy straightens again. In pain.
speaker_heading: GOLD CHAIN
dialog: You don't talk, we're gonna have to start
dialog: breaking your fingers. You understand.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I understand.
text: OLDER GUY calls out:
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: Got some kind of hidden cabinet here!
text: GOLD CHAIN turns, crosses the room. Starts pounding on the
text: cabinet. Breaks it open. Inside is a heavy canvas BAG.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: UM, YOU DON'T WANNA OPEN THAT... That's
dialog: not mine. My friend wanted me to hold it
dialog: for him... Trust me, don't--
text: GOLD CHAIN ignores Healy, rips the bag open--
text: AN EXPLOSION OF BLUE PAINT.
dialog: Just like one of those charges they hide with bank money.
text: Turns Gold Chain's face an impossible, shocking BLUE --
text: At which point, through the floor, comes the BIGGEST BUZZ
text: YET of LAUGHTER... Like a sitcom soundtrack.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That's, um... that's not gonna come off.
text: GOLD CHAIN snarls. Savagely wipes his face on towels.
text: Crosses to the AQUARIUM, dips his face, scrubs--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Tried to tell you.
text: Gold Chain stops. His still-blue face dripping wet.
speaker_heading: GOLD CHAIN
dialog: You tried to tell me..?
text: He reaches in the tank, grabs a TROPICAL FISH -- FLINGS IT.
dialog: 24
text: It SMACKS the wall wetly. Next to Healy.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Come on, the fish...? Don't do that.
text: No dice. The guy just sneers, groping for another fish.
dialog: Healy appeals to the older dude:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Can you please tell this guy to act like
dialog: a professional?
text: Older Guy just SHRUGS as Gold Chain gets hold of a yellow-
text: striped number. Tosses it, squirming, into Healy's lap.
speaker_heading: GOLD CHAIN
dialog: You're gonna eat that, bastard. Do it!!
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: This isn't gonna help you... Do you get
dialog: that? This is silly and unprofessional--
speaker_heading: GOLD CHAIN
text: EAT THE GODDAMN THING!! NOW!!
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: No.
text: Gold Chain draws an AUTOMATIC. Lets it dangle at his side.
speaker_heading: GOLD CHAIN
dialog: ... Stand up.
text: Healy sighs. Gets to his feet. It's slow going. He's in pain.
text: Stands in the middle of the room... Arms held loosely.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Stop and think. Is this why you came here
dialog: tonight? To make me eat fish? To shoot me?
text: Healy locks eyes with the kid. Gone is any trace of
text: resignation. Of passivity. He suddenly looks... hard.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You could have come in here. Beat up on
dialog: me. Trashed the place. I wouldn't have
dialog: cared. It's what I expected.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: But you didn't do that. Instead you gotta
dialog: piss me off. Make an enemy. Even if I did
dialog: know something, there's no way I'd give
dialog: it up to you. You're a moron.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Also, Slick, blue ain't your color.
dialog: 25
text: GOLD CHAIN RAISES THE GUN AND FIRES.
text: Healy's already in motion..! The bullet goes wide. Past
text: Healy's shoulder, keeps going --
text: OUT THE OPEN WINDOW
text: Hits a WOMAN in the APARTMENT across the street.
text: Her half-open window SHATTERS, pop--!
text: Arm wound. She goes down with a YELP. Drops from sight.
text: The OLDER GUY knocks the GUN aside.
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: You stupid son of a bitch!
text: VOICES, now, from across the way. SHRIEKING.
text: Healy, a BLUR. Dives into the BEDROOM. Hits, flat.
text: Sweeps a SHOTGUN from behind the bed. SPINS, barrel up --
text: Front door, open. Still swinging... Visitors, gone. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOLLYWOOD STAR LANES - MORNING
text: Googie architecture gleams in the bright morning sun.
scene_heading: INT. HOLLYWOOD STAR LANES - SAME
text: A party for Holly in progress. MARCH stands at the counter,
text: surrounded by a pack of howling YOUNG GIRLS, all CALLING out
text: their shoe sizes. He raises a hand:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Whoa, whoa, EASY. Christ Jesus, one at a
dialog: time, huh? THANK you. Janet, size..?
speaker_heading: JANET
dialog: You took the Lord's name in vain.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: No, I didn't, I found it useful... Cindy,
dialog: you a six..?
text: CUT TO: THE OBLIGATORY BOWLING SHOTS
text: Except every ball goes straight in the gutter.
dialog: Squeals, giggles..!
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - RESTROOM - SAME
text: MARCH, in a closed stall. On the pot. Reading TIME MAGAZINE.
text: The cover story's about GLOBAL COOLING.
dialog: 26
text: Arm, still bugging him. He fishes out a cigarette, lights up.
text: Hears the bathroom door open. Clopping FOOTSTEPS. Looks down--
text: ALLIGATOR BOOTS. Outside. A hand TAPS politely:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I'm in here.
speaker_heading: HEALY (0.s.)
dialog: It's me, Mr. March. I intend you no harm.
dialog: You're safe. Say "yes" if you understand.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE STALL
text: Stands JACKSON HEALY. Calm, posture seemingly casual. He
text: waits... Then, slowly, the stall door swings wide--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ~.. Yes.
text: Reveals MARCH, still on the throne. Holding the door open
text: with his bad hand. The other's got a GUN trained on Healy.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: How stupid do you think I am? Huh..? I
dialog: got a permit to carry, dumbass, and since
dialog: your little "visit" yesterday this baby
dialog: stays right here, right where I can--
text: As he goes to pat his holster, the STALL DOOR starts to
text: swing closed, he quickly has to BANG it back open. He looks
text: ridiculous. The cigarette falls from his lips, burns his
dialog: leg. He swears --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: ... Need any help?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Just stay right there, you mother.
text: March reaches for his pants, the STALL DOOR swings shut
text: again. He BANGS it open -- he can't hold his gun, and the
text: door, and pull his pants up.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ... I got this.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You mind if I look away..?
text: March shifts. Tentatively rises up... Gives up. Sits again.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: All right, this is pissing me off... What
dialog: do you want?
dialog: 27
text: Healy takes a deep breath, looks a little embarrassed:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I, uh... I need you to find Amelia for
dialog: me.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - HEALY & MARCH, SEATED - SAME
text: March is wary. Watchful. Healy attacks a slice of pecan pie
text: with gusto, seemingly unruffled.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ++. SO you think these guys want to...
dialog: hurt this chick Amelia?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sure... After they're done killing her.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Any way to warn her?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I can't reach her. I been trying.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I don't get it. Why do you care? What's
dialog: in it for you?
text: A pause. Healy chews, swallows... Then:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I don't want to have to move.
text: March looks thoroughly perplexed. Healy shrugs:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Look, it doesn't matter.
text: Healy drops a wad of bills on the table.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Two days in advance. That's $400. Plus
dialog: whatever the old lady's giving you --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Old lady, fuck you, old lady, you broke
dialog: my arm, I quit, remember?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: So call her up, get back on the case. Get
dialog: paid twice.
text: March dry-washes his face with his hands.
dialog: 28
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Help me find Amelia. You were looking for
dialog: her, right..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: .«.. Yes and no.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Excuse me?
text: March leans back in his chair, sighs.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Last week, the old broad hired me to find
dialog: her niece -- Misty Mountains.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Misty Moun--
dialog: (stops, frowning)
dialog: The dead chick? The porno chick--?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah. That one.
dialog: (leans forward)
text: Two days after the crash, Auntie Lily
dialog: went to clean out her niece's place...
text: Spotted Misty inside her house, through
text: the front window. Alive and well. Then
text: saw her drive away.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I checked it out anyway... Talked to the
text: guard at the front gate, turns out there
dialog: was a girl there that evening --
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: Amelia. The old lady saw Amelia.
text: March makes a "bingo" gesture.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Guard confirmed it. Keeps notes of all
dialog: cars, in and out. I ran the plate, got
dialog: her name --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: And..?
text: March affects disinterest. Casually holds up three fingers:
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Three.
dialog: (frowns )
dialog: Three what?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Three days, in advance. If you want the
dialog: rest.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: $600..? That's fucking robbery.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I only got $400.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Banks are still open, you can hold one up
dialog: if you hurry.
text: From behind him comes a "bud-dum-BAH-!" He turns, startled--
text: And sees HOLLY there. Perched on the edge of the booth.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Holly, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Giving you a rim job.
speaker_heading: MARCH
speaker_heading: RIM SHOT.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Whatever.
text: (plops down beside him)
dialog: Hey, can we go one more game, before--
text: She sees Healy. Stops, blinks...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: ... You're the guy that beat up my dad.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: It's okay. He won't hurt me, he only did
dialog: it for money. He's a nice guy... aren't
dialog: you, slick?
text: Healy manages a lame smile. Holly stares at him.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You beat people up... and charge money?
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Wow. No way... So, um... How much would
dialog: you charge to beat up my friend Janet?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: How much you got?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Okay, discussion over.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Hey, is that apple pie?
text: She reaches over and grabs March's plate. Starts eating.
text: Bouncing a little in her seat. Happy as a clam.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Two days. That's all I got.
dialog: March makes a decision:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Four hundred. Two days. We find her
dialog: sooner, I keep the money.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That's good.
text: He scoops up the money, checks his watch:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Because I already know where she is.
scene_heading: EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY
text: Kids playing on swings. Blankets with family picnics.
text: Nearby, littered across the grass:
text: More than A HUNDRED PEOPLE.
text: Sprawled on the ground. Arms, legs akimbo. Each one wearing
text: a GAS MASK, lying perfectly still... This is a "Die-in."
text: They're pretending to be dead as a form of protest.
text: Hand painted signs proclaim: FOR THE BIRDS!
text: To one side, a few spectators.
text: Smoking. Pointing. Looking bewildered. Whatever...
dialog: 31
text: MARCH and HEALY appear at the edge of the gathering.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (nods at the protesters)
dialog: There you go. Thank you and goodbye.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Wait. What do you mean, there I go..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: This is Amelia's protest group. She's in
dialog: there somewhere. So. Have at it--
text: March turns to leave.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Hold on -- how do you know she's actually
dialog: in there?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I told you, it's her protest group. She
dialog: started it. Which was the hot tip I got
dialog: yesterday just before you broke my arm.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Okay, but she's holed up somewhere,
dialog: hiding, right? What makes you think she's
dialog: gonna be here, if--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Of course she's gonna be here. It's her
dialog: protest group.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Stop saying that.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (put-—upon)
dialog: You know what? Watch this.
text: He turns. Loudly addresses the crowd of protesters:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: EXCUSE ME! HI! We're looking for Amelia.
text: No response -- everybody still pretending to be dead.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: AMELIA? ARE YOU HERE..? HELLO..?
dialog: (nothing)
scene_heading: LOOK, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT -- DOES
dialog: ANYONE HERE KNOW AMELIA?
text: Finally, from amongst the "dead" comes a mask-muffled VOICE:
dialog: 32
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.s.)
dialog: We can't talk to you!
text: March squints, searching for the source of the voice.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What? Who said that?
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.s.)
dialog: We can't talk to you! We're dead!
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah, okay, I get it. Real clever... But
dialog: this is a serious matter here.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.s.)
dialog: So is this, we've all been killed.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Look, pal--
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.s.)
dialog: Fuck you, we're dead!
text: One of the smoking onlookers turns to March, offers helpfully:
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: They can't talk to you, man. They're
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Thanks. That's helpful.
text: The smoker smiles, nods: no problem. HEALY turns to the him:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What are these assholes protesting
dialog: anyway..?
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: I dunno...
dialog: (smokes more, then)
dialog: HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS PROTESTING?
dialog: Pause, then:
speaker_heading: VOICE #2 (0o.s.)
dialog: The air.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You're protesting the air..?
speaker_heading: VOICE #2 (o.s.)
text: The pollution. The birds can't breathe.
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: So you all died because of the pollution?
speaker_heading: VOICE #2 (0o.s.)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What about the gas masks? I mean,
dialog: wouldn't that have saved you?
text: Long pause... no one answering this one.
speaker_heading: VOICE #3 (0.s.)
dialog: ... They didn't work.
text: March, his plan in tatters. Steps into the crowd:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Can we get back to Amelia here--
text: He steps on some guy's hand:
speaker_heading: DEAD GUY
dialog: Ouch, fucker!
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (addressing everyone)
dialog: AMELIA..? WE KNOW YOU'RE HERE. WE NEED TO
dialog: SPEAK WITH YOU...
text: A new voice cuts in now, this one from behind March somewhere:
speaker_heading: VOICE #4 (0.s.)
dialog: Hey. Dickhead. She's not here.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Of course she's here. This is her protest
dialog: group.
speaker_heading: VOICE #4 (0.s.)
dialog: So..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: So that means she's here.
speaker_heading: VOICE #4 (0.s.)

speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yes, she is.
speaker_heading: VOICE #4 (0.s.)
dialog: No, she isn't.
dialog: 34
text: March getting pissed now. Glances back at Healy for help.
dialog: Healy just shrugs: What do you want me to do..?
text: Now another dead protester starts talking:
speaker_heading: VOICE #5
dialog: She's not here because of her boyfriend.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (turning towards the new voice)
dialog: Her boyfriend..? Why?
speaker_heading: VOICE #5 (0.s.)
dialog: "Cuz he died. Really died. Three days ago.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: He died..? So then, where's Amelia..?
speaker_heading: VOICE #5 (0.s.)
dialog: We can't help you. We're dead.
text: March stares up into the sky, exasperated:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Okay. Which one of you assholes wants to
dialog: make twenty bucks..?
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
text: March driving. Healy in the passenger seat. One of the
text: PROTESTERS sits in back. Brown hair, about five foot five.
text: Gas Mask pushed back on his head. His name is Chet.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Up here, Chet..?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Yeah. Make a left here.
text: March turns left. Pulls up to the curb. They all climb out.
text: They're standing in front of BLACKENED HUSK that was once a
text: COZY BUNGALOW... It's been burned to the ground.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What the fuck is this..?
speaker_heading: CHET
text: That's Dean's house. Amelia's boyfriend.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That's not a house, Chet.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: I told you, he burned to death--
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: But you didn't tell us the house burned
dialog: to death.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: So..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: So now we can't search it.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe you can search the burned part.
text: March sighs. This is not going well.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I thought you knew Amelia.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: I mostly knew her through Dean... He kept
dialog: talking about some film they were making.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Film?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: He was a filmmaker. Experimental films.
dialog: That's how we became friends. 'Cuz I'm
dialog: kinda in the business myself.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: I'm a projectionist.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Anyway, Dean stored all his stuff here.
dialog: Had a bunch of old film stock. That's what
dialog: caused the fire. Went up, POOF! --
dialog: (nods )
dialog: His life's work and his life. Gone...
dialog: Makes you think, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Not really.
text: March spots a kid, 14 or so, long hair. Riding his bike just
text: up the street. He motions to him:
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, kid! Come here!
text: The kid rides up. Eyes March with adolescent defiance:
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You know the guy that lived here?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Maybe... What's it to ya?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: He'll give you 20 bucks if you answer.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Wait, I didn't say that.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: 20 bucks, man. Or you can blow.
text: March takes a deep, deep breath. Fishes a twenty out of his
text: pocket. Hands it to the kid.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah. I knew the dude. Filmmaker dude.
dialog: Saw him making a film last month.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: An experimental film, right?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I guess... More like a nudie film.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Did you see a girl with him? Blonde. Five
dialog: nine, give or take. Named Amelia?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Naw... I didn't see her, but I saw that
dialog: famous chick.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What famous chick?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: The dead one. Porn star. Misty something.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Misty Mountains? You saw Misty Mountains?
text: March and Healy exchange looks.
dialog: 37
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: But you didn't see this other girl,
dialog: Amelia.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Nope... I hung out for a while, too.
dialog: Tried to get a job. Talked to the
dialog: producer. Sid... Sid Hatrack I think.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Nobody's name is Hatrack.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Whatever. I asked him to give me a job.
dialog: Because, you know, I got a big dick. I
dialog: offered to show it to him.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That's nice... You sure you didn't see
dialog: any other girl?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I'm sure... You guys want to see my dick?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: 20 bucks.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: We already gave you 20 bucks.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That doesn't count towards the dick.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: We don't want to see your dick.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Fine... Fags.
text: The kid rides off.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, kid... What was the name of that
dialog: film? Did they tell you?
text: The kid looks back:
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah. Stupid title: "How Do You Like My

text: ves. He is not in a good mood. We come in mid-chat:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Fine, you got me for two days. But two
dialog: days is two days. That's the deal. Like
dialog: it or lump it.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sure. Just to clarify -- I decide to
dialog: "lump it," what... does that entail--?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I dunno. It's from the Bible.
text: onto Hollywood Blvd. Healy chews his lower lip:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: There's something funny here...
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Nah. Guy burned up. Happens, trust me.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: It "happened" three days ago -- same day
dialog: Amelia fell off my radar.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You phoned, she didn't answer --how's that
dialog: radar? Maybe she dislikes you.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Or she's dead.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: God willing.
text: him a dirty look from Healy. March glances up
dialog: does a swift double-take --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey-hey! HATRACK.
text: ly pulls over. STOPS. He's pointing past Healy, out
scene_heading: W -- Above them, a XXX theater MARQUEE: SAVAGE SID
text: presents: HARD IN THE SADDLE. Healy laughs:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Shattuck. Who's that?
dialog: 39
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Savage Sid. The porn KING. Experimental
dialog: film, my ass. They were making a porno.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Damn. So, he was there.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Yeah... and he didn't burn up.
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Holly stuffs some clothes into an overnight bag. MARCH is on
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What..? I can't -- yes, for Mr. Shattuck.
dialog: I'm an old friend. I'll wait. Thanks.
text: As he speaks, he keeps a weather eye out the WINDOW:
speaker_heading: HIS POV - HEALY
text: Standing out on the patio. Glancing around the neighborhood,
text: crushing a bug on the cement, whatever...
text: March notices HOLLY staring out the window, too. Worried.
text: He covers the mouthpiece with one hand, says:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Holly, ease up. This is work.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: Look at him. He looks like he's getting
text: ready to shoot the neighbors.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: See..? I like him better already.
text: Then, into the phone:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah, hi, I'm here... What's it about..?
dialog: Well, I'd prefer to speak directly with
dialog: Mr. Shattuck --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay. Well, I was asking after a mutual
dialog: friend of ours, Amelia. I wondered if--
dialog: (beat, his face changes)
dialog: What..? Say that again.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Okay. Thank you.
text: He hangs up, looking exhilarated.
dialog: She plops
speaker_heading: NEWSPAPER,
dialog: 40
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That was the number I got for Sid
text: Shattuck.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: And..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: They were setting up for a party... I
dialog: asked for Amelia, they said she'd be
dialog: "back" in time for it. Back. Like she's
dialog: been staying there.
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Who are you staying with tonight?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Jessica... You're going to a party?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: No, I'm going to a BIG party.
text: down across the room, looking pissed. Picks up the
text: reads from the front page:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: "Adult film star Misty Mountains, shown
dialog: here at last month's Detroit auto show."
dialog: Dad, she's gross.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: So are midgets, but people like them in
dialog: movies. It's WORK, kiddo. I do this, we
dialog: won't have to sell the furniture.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Can we sell it anyway?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Jessica's... NOW.
scene_heading: EXT. MARCH'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - SAME
text: Holly exits the house just as Healy heads in. She blows on by
text: without looking at him -- then stops. Turns, says:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: ... I'm friends with a cop, you know.
text: Healy glances over. Says mildly:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That so..?
dialog: 41
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: He likes my dad a lot, too.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Maybe they should get married.
text: She turns on her heel and stalks off. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEL AIR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
text: The L.A. basin, a dazzling scatter of lights below us.
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S CAR - DRIVING - SAME
text: HEALY navigates Bel Air Road. March checks street numbers.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: ... Tell me something: Did you actually
dialog: believe the old lady... I mean, that she
dialog: saw Misty alive that night?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hell no... You kidding? She's a blind old
text: bat. Her glasses are actual coke bottles,
dialog: the whole things. Paint a moustache on a
dialog: Volkswagen, she says, "That Omar Sharif
dialog: sure runs fast."
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: ... So then, why'd you take the case in
dialog: the first place?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: For the money.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Oh...
text: They lapse into silence. Majestic houses glide past --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: This Shattuck guy, he just distributes
dialog: porno? Nothing else?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That's the word.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (surveying the lush homes)
dialog: Tell you something, brother, you and me
dialog: got it all wrong.
text: A line of cars is forming just ahead. Beyond it we can see a
text: VALET shooing an errant DEER out of the road.
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That's it up there...
dialog: (turns)
dialog: We do this my way. Nice and easy. 68 and
dialog: sunny. Got it?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: 68 and sunny. Roger that.
text: Another VALET hurries towards them as they climb out of the
text: car. March takes a ticket off the valet... Then stops--
text: A LOUD NOISE emanates from the back of the car... A steady
text: POUNDING. The valet, utterly thrown. Healy, bewildered--
text: Not so, MARCH. His face settles in a SCOWL. He grits his
text: teeth. Stalks to the trunk of the car. Heaves it OPEN--
text: His daughter HOLLY is inside.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I know what you're gonna say -- but since
dialog: I'm already here, you might as well take
dialog: me in with you, right..?
text: March's expression doesn't flicker. He simply shuts the
text: trunk again. Calmly walks to the valet, hands him the keys:
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: (over renewed POUNDING)
dialog: Um, I can't take your car like that.
text: March sighs, flicks a look to Healy that says, "You see what I
text: put up with..?" Goes back to unlock the trunk... CUT TO:
text: MARCH HUSTLING HOLLY ALONG THE SIDEWALK
text: Taking her away from the party. Healy trails behind them.
text: Holly, wide-eyed; watches as scantily clad GIRLS flounce by--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Dad, there's like, whores here and stuff.
text: Looking around for a cab.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: How many times have I told you..? Don't
dialog: say, "and stuff." Just say, "There are
dialog: whores here."
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Well, there's like, a ton.
text: A CAB pulls to the curb nearby. March waits for two chicks
text: in tube tops to clamber out.
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Dad, come on! I said I was sorry. I can
dialog: even help. I'll ask around for this
dialog: Amelia chick. Or that blue guy. Dad--!
text: He shoves Holly inside. Gives her some money. Slams the door.
text: Watches as the cab pulls away. Shaking his head.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Cute kid.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: If you say so.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What happened to her mom, anyway?
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: There was a house fire. She burned up.
text: Happens.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah. Lot of that going around. Shall
dialog: we?
text: They head back for the party. AND WE SEE BUT THEY DON'T--
text: HOLLY'S CAB slows at a stop sign, fifty yards away--
text: And HOLLY jumps out. Just flings open the door and runs.
text: A tiny cab driver head sticks out the window, "Hey!"
scene_heading: INT. PARTY - SHATTUCK HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The place is ABSOLUTELY HUGE. The property spreads out
text: behind the house and goes down the hill quite a ways.
text: A MASS OF BODIES clog a nearby DANCE FLOOR. Satin jackets,
text: Halston knock-offs, white suits and feathered hair.
text: March and Healy enter. Wander amid the chaos.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Right, so... If Amelia doesn't show, we
dialog: still got Shattuck. We brace the guy.
dialog: I'll come on like the good guy -- you
dialog: blind his son, or whatever. Work your
dialog: magic, and--
dialog: (stops noticing)
dialog: What are you looking at..?
dialog: 44
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Nothing.
text: March follows his gaze to a very young, very cute GIRL.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You were checking out that redhead.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: No I wasn't.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Nothing to be ashamed of. She's cute.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: She's fifteen.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Seventeen if she's a day. And she's hot.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That chick could be your daughter.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: No, she couldn't... Look, obviously I'm
dialog: not attracted to my own daughter--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Great. What do you want, a medal?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: --I'm just saying, youth is attractive.
dialog: Like, sometimes, when Holly brings home
dialog: some of her older girlfriends...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I'll give you fifty bucks to change the
dialog: subject.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let's split up. You spot Amelia or a guy
dialog: with a big blue face? Find me.
text: He peels off. March watches him vanish into the assembled
text: disco chic. A passing WAITRESS nearly collides with March--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Whoa, incoming..!
text: He sidesteps, deftly snags a DRINK off her tray. Heads off.
text: TIME CUT: A HALF HOUR HAS PASSED - PARTY IN FULL SWING
text: It may be a party, but Healy is NOT enjoying himself. He
text: stands, getting jostled. How hard can this be..?
dialog: 45
text: Squints across the room--
text: SEES MARCH. At an INDOOR BAR. Talking to the bartender.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Now what you really gotta be worried
dialog: about is them killer bees--
text: HEALY clamps a big mitt on March's shoulder:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Take it easy, brother, there's enough for
dialog: everyone--
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Oh. Hi
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Any luck..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Nope. You?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: None... No girl. No blue face. Nothing.
text: The bartender hands March his drink.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Hey. Less drinking. More looking.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What are you, some kind of super-prude?
dialog: This is like my third drink.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Whatever, I'm gonna check the rest of the
dialog: house.
text: Healy stalks off... March watches him go. Downs his drink in
text: one shot. Hands the empty glass back to the bartender.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hit me again, Skipper.
text: The bartender pours him another one. March drinks it...
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, listen... I seem to have misplaced
dialog: my sister. Dirty blonde hair, ‘bout yay-
dialog: high..? Answers to Amelia?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Hmmmm. Doesn't sound like anyone I
dialog: know... You want one more?
dialog: 46
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (considers)
dialog: Why the hell not..?
scene_heading: SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:
text: MARCH AT A BAR BY THE POOL
text: He's got another drink in front of him.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah, see, I'm looking for a gal-pal,
dialog: answers to Amelia..? Actually, she's my
dialog: sister, I'm worried about her.
text: MARCH TALKING TO A COCKTAIL WAITRESS
text: She hands him a fresh drink.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ... bout yay-high, answers to the call of
dialog: the wild..? Nah, just kidding. She's my
dialog: sister. I forgot her name.
text: MARCH WITH TWO TOPLESS CHICKS
text: Drinking a Mai Tai now.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ... I gotta find her... I'm her sister.
dialog: She's worried about me. I'm worried, too.
text: He grins like an idiot at the two girls.
scene_heading: INT. SHATTUCK HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME
text: Fewer people back here. HEALY finds an office. Waits for the
dialog: right moment, tries the door--
scene_heading: INT. SHATTUCK'S OFFICE - SAME
text: The place is a mess. DIRECTORS' CHAIRS stacked in a corner.
dialog: Lighting equipment... Makeshift storage for porn production.
text: Healy crosses to the desk. It's piled high with CLOTHING
text: wrapped in plastic. This, apparently, is PORN WARDROBE. He
text: lifts a pinstriped jacket off the top. It's hand labeled:
dialog: “HOW DO YOU LIKE MY CAR, BIG BOY"
dialog: Misty, scene 1.
text: He dumps the rest of the clothes on the floor. As he does, a
text: PIECE OF PAPER flutters out... Healy retrieves it:
dialog: 47
text: The paper is PINK... And it's SHAPED LIKE A COW. FEMININE
scene_heading: HANDWRITING on it: 28-10 BURBANK APT. WEST, FLT 2, 10:30 pm.
text: Amelia's writing..? Healy frowns. Pockets the paper.
text: Looks around the office once more...
text: Then exits into the hallway. Starts toward the living room.
text: Glancing at the DEN, in passing. Stops--
scene_heading: INT. SHATTUCK HOUSE - DEN - SAME
text: HOLLY is in here. With the young REDHEAD we saw earlier.
text: And some DORKY LOOKING GUY.
text: They're watching a porno being projected against a wall.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: . Um, Holly... I'm not so sure you
dialog: should be watching this.
text: The dorky guy waves Healy out of the way:
speaker_heading: DORK
dialog: What's it to you, idiot..? Move. You're
dialog: in my way.
text: Without even looking, Healy grabs the dork by the hair.
text: BOUNCES his head off the coffee table -- WHAM! --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Look, dickweed, that girl sitting there
dialog: is a minor... Where do you get off
dialog: showing her this kind of stuff, anyway?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: He's not showing it to me --
text: Healy stops.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: He isn't?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: No... He just wandered in...
dialog: (points at redhead)
dialog: She put it on.
text: Healy looks slightly deflated now.
dialog: 48
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah, well... She shouldn't be watching
dialog: this kind of stuff either.
speaker_heading: REDHEAD
dialog: Watching it..? Man, I'm in it.
text: Healy blinks. Frowns. Looks over at the screen for a moment.
dialog: Takes a good hard look this time...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: «+. Oh.
text: The dorky guy is still just sitting there.
text: Fingering the rapidly forming bruise of his forehead.
text: Healy clears his throat... Looks over at the dork:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Listen, uh... Sorry about that, man...
dialog: Your head okay?
text: The dork doesn't answer. Starts crying instead... Healy nods:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: «+. Good.
text: Decides it's time to leave. Exits... HOLLY watches him go.
text: Pause, then feigning nonchalance, she says to the REDHEAD:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, by the way, I'm supposed to meet
dialog: someone here. Do you by any chance know a
dialog: girl named Amelia..?
speaker_heading: REDHEAD
dialog: Hmmm... She in the business?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I think she did a film with Sid Shattuck.
speaker_heading: REDHEAD
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Don't know her. But Sid's gross. He told
dialog: me this one chick was his sister, right?
dialog: Then a few days later, I walk in on them
dialog: and they're all, doing anal and stuff!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Don't say “and stuff" -- just say,
dialog: "They're doing anal."
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - OVERLOOKING CANYON - NIGHTTIME
text: March steps outside and draws a deep lungful of night air--
dialog: 49
text: Sees a STRAGGLER out on the deck. Five-two. Blonde. He grins
text: drunkenly at her. She waves:
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, yourself. What's your gig, blondie?
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: I do a little acting.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Little acting? Hey! Me too. Do this.
text: He motions for her to shoot him; finger-gun. She does--
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Bang!
text: March takes it high in the chest. GRUNTS. Staggers.
text: Executes a death-pirouette.
text: Topples over the railing, into the night.
text: The BLONDE laughs, claps... pause... FROWNS.
text: Steps to the edge, peers over the railing--
text: Sees MARCH bounce down the canyon like a rag puppet.
scene_heading: EXT. BOTTOM OF HILL - SAME TIME
text: MARCH tumbles to a halt like tennis shoes when you stop the
text: dryer. Sits up, trailing weeds. From above, faintly:
speaker_heading: BLONDE (0.S.)
dialog: Woooo! That was great!
text: She wanders away, already disinterested.
text: MARCH takes stock. Miraculously, his cast is intact. Stands,
text: patting his jacket... Aw, no. His gun, GONE. Jarred loose.
text: He turns, looking around... Stops cold--
text: There is a WOMAN watching him from the shadow of the trees
text: down here. March can only make out her bright YELLOW DRESS.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Jeeze, you scared me... Listen, this'll
dialog: sound weird, but I lost my gun.
dialog: (stops, squinting)
dialog: Hey... You look--
text: The woman BOLTS. Just like that.
dialog: 50
text: Takes off running without saying a word.
text: Gone. March stares after her. Blinks. Shakes his head.
text: Whatever. GUN. Just find the gun... He starts pawing the ivy.
text: Bingo. He finds it. Stands, checking the weapon over.
dialog: Takes a step back--
text: AND TRIPS OVER THE DEAD GUY.
text: The one sprawled out in the ivy directly behind him.
text: March "YELPS!" loudly. Stumbles. Falls on his ass...
text: Sits in the dirt. Slack-jawed. Blinking at the body.
speaker_heading: HEALY (0.S.)
dialog: Yo! March! What are you doing?
text: March jumps again. Snaps his head upward --
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE DECK - OVERLOOKING CANYON - SAME
text: Healy stands, looking down.
speaker_heading: MARCH (0.s.)
dialog: Get... Get down here... Now.
text: Healy frowns, puzzled -- March doesn't sound so good.
text: Holly wanders out onto the deck.
text: Healy glances back, makes a fast decision... Pulls some
dialog: money out of his pocket:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Holly, get yourself a cab. Go home. Now.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: No way! I'm helping! You can't tell me--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: March?
speaker_heading: MARCH (0.s.)
dialog: WHAT! ?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Tell Holly to take a cab home.
speaker_heading: MARCH (0.s.)
dialog: HOLLY?! Jesus, are you still here!?
text: Holly looks pissed... Snatches the money out of Healy's hand.
text: Turns on her heels and marches off, sullen.
dialog: 51
text: Healy makes sure the coast is clear. Then -- HOPS THE RAILING.
text: Hits. Scrambles downhill, showering dirt... Slides to a stop.
text: A beat, as he notices the corpse and registers it for what
text: it is: a corpse. A ragged exit wound bisects its face.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What happened? Who is he?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I... I think I'm gonna throw up.
text: Healy goes through the guy's pockets. Finds a wallet.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Um... You're not gonna like this.
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: I can feel it at the back of my throat.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: It's Sid Shattuck.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: It's Sid-- Oh, God. No. No.
text: Healy is squinting at the body... Thinking.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What is going on..? Anybody worked on
dialog: this Amelia flick -- the boyfriend; then
text: Misty; now Shattuck... They're all dead.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Who fucking cares??
dialog: (points to corpse)
dialog: Before we break the case of the century,
dialog: could we maybe consider dealing with this
dialog: ROTTING DEAD GUY???
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What should we do with him?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Are you kidding? We gotta move him.
dialog: (off Healy's look)
dialog: There was a girl... She SAW me here.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Did she see the body?
dialog: 52
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Doesn't matter. It'll be found. She can
dialog: place me here, looking for a gun --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: And tell the cops and you'll go to jail.
dialog: I get it.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I vote for Plan A: I throw up -- then we
dialog: move the body.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I'm down with that.
text: March nods. Bends over. Begins executing his plan. TIME CUT:
scene_heading: INT. PARTY - SHATTUCK HOUSE - SAME
text: Holly stands upstairs by the main bar. Fuming. She swipes a
text: flute of champagne off a passing waitress, drains it...
text: A HAND taps her shoulder. She whirls, GUILTY as hell --
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Are you the one who's been asking about
dialog: Amelia?
text: Holly blinks. A six foot tall AMAZON in a HALTER TOP stares
text: down at her, questioningly.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: ... I, uh, may have said something.
speaker_heading: AMAZON
dialog: What do you want with her?
text: Holly's not sure how to handle this. Swallows, says:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: She's... she's my sister, see. I need to
dialog: warn her. Yeah, see, two freaky guys came
dialog: around..? They're all, where is she,
dialog: where is she -- Scared me, kinda.
text: The Amazon scrutinizes her for a long moment...
speaker_heading: AMAZON
dialog: Okay. You seem like a decent kid...
dialog: (nods )
dialog: I'll take you to her.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: »..- You'll, um... Oh. Kay.
dialog: 53
text: Holly nods. Smiles. Her smile looks a tad sickly. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TREES AND BRUSH -- WITH MARCH AND HEALY
text: Our guys drag SHATTUCK'S BODY through the brush.
text: Healy's got his legs. March has hold of an ugly tie.
text: Both grunting. Sweating. Speaking in harsh whispers:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: How the hell'd you spot him, that's what
dialog: I'm wondering. From way up top..?
dialog: (dawning realization)
dialog: Wait a minute. You didn't... Did you FALL
dialog: down that hill?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Oh, come on... I had three lousy drinks--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sure. That's why you can't walk straight.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: For Chrissakes, I'm carrying a dead body!
dialog: I'm sorry I'm not Baryshnikov here--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Ha! You can't say "Baryshnikov!" You DID,
dialog: you fell down here! Didn't you?
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Unbelievable. First you get drunk... Then
dialog: you take a header off the balcony which,
dialog: I'm sure, is a keen old-time detective
dialog: trick--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Can we just get him out of sight, please?
text: March indicates a sagging FENCE, separating properties.
text: They plod toward it, wheezing with effort.
text: PARTY NOISE, wafting on the night air.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Ready? On three; one... two... THREE.
text: They heave the corpse over the top. It DROPS from view..!
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE
dialog: At the end of the day? It's not their fault, I mean, really,
dialog: how could they know there was ANOTHER party at the
dialog: neighbors'? Below the fence, 30 feet straight down?
text: DEAD SHATTUCK plummets out of the sky and EXPLODES a glass
text: table. Takes out a busboy. 150 people watch, thunderstruck.
dialog: 54
speaker_heading: BUSBOY
dialog: JESUS! MY LEG! Oh my God! My leg!
text: Healy and March, uncomprehending. They peer over the fence:
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: I think he's still in sight.
text: They BOOK. Back up the hill. Hit a set of wooden STEPS and
dialog: keep right on climbing. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHATTUCK HOUSE - STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT
text: THE AMAZON leads Holly past the valet station.
text: Down the street to a waiting LIMO. Engine idling.
speaker_heading: AMAZON
dialog: Hop in back, sweetie.
text: Holly swallows hard. Climbs in, heart thudding. There is a
text: man seated back here. Face turned, looking out the window.
dialog: The Amazon leans in after Holly, says:
speaker_heading: AMAZON
dialog: This one says she's Amelia's sister.
text: Then pulls back out, SLAMMING THE DOOR.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Is that a fact?
text: He turns to look at Holly -- his face, a scrubbed but no
text: less vivid shade of BLUE...
speaker_heading: BLUE FACE
dialog: Good times.
scene_heading: EXT. SHATTUCK HOUSE - OUTSIDE STAIRS - NIGHT
text: With HEALY and MARCH, as they retreat up OUTSIDE STAIRS.
text: Pushing through people, shoving them aside.
text: March reaches a wooden LANDING: Deck, hot tub.
text: Lunges for the NEXT set of stairs.
text: Healy appears, close on his heels. Turns towards the stairs,
text: accidentally SLAMS into a big guy. Starts to apologize --
text: FREEZES. Dead stop.
text: We recognize the BYSTANDER. It's OLDER GUY.
text: Blue-Face's partner. Big as life. Their eyes lock....
text: They launch. NO HESITATION. March, everyone else, forgotten.
dialog: 55
dialog: Older Guy's .38, clearing leather --
text: Healy KICKS OUT--! Sends it sailing. It lands in the HOT
text: TUB. Older Guy counters: PULLS A SWITCHBLADE. Lunges.
text: PANDEMONIUM. The deck clears rapidly. People SCREAMING.
text: Running every which way, surging up the stairs and meanwhile--
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - SAME TIME
text: HOLLY pressed back up against the door of the limo. Feeling
text: behind her for the door handle.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: - No thanks. I think we must be talking
dialog: about a different Amelia.
text: Blue Face inching towards her. Voice deadly calm:
speaker_heading: BLUE-FACE
dialog: Really..? How can you be sure? Why don't
dialog: you describe your sister for--
text: Suddenly he stops. Breaks off mid-sentence, staring past her
text: out the window. Holly darts a look herself, sees--
text: A GIRL IN A YELLOW DRESS
text: Bolts out of the front door of Shattuck's house. Frantic.
text: Trailing a backpack. Accosting the VALET. YELLING:
speaker_heading: YELLOW DRESS
dialog: I need my keys. Now. My keys, HURRY--!
text: Her words, clearly audible.
text: BLUE FACE flicks a glance at the seat across from him.
text: Holly, following his gaze again:
text: A FADED PHOTOGRAPH sits there.
text: It's a shot of AMELIA. The woman we saw hire Healy. Looking
text: slightly younger with a graduation cap and tassel...
text: OUT THE WINDOW: The GENUINE ARTICLE. No mistaking her.
dialog: Blue-Face just won the lottery.
dialog: Everything changes, that quick.
text: Holly, now worthless. Blue-Face lunges ACROSS her.
text: Thrusts open the DOOR, pinning Holly in the process.
speaker_heading: BLUE-FACE
dialog: Don't fucking move.
dialog: 56
scene_heading: A GUN MATERIALIZES
text: In his outstretched fist. He sights down the barrel.
dialog: This is it, he's not fucking around.
dialog: And you know what..? Holly decides she isn't either.
text: Fuck being scared. She wrenches one arm free--
text: GRABS THE DOOR AND YANKS IT SHUT
text: Right on Blue-Face's wrist.
text: A loud CRUNCH--! He BARKS sudden PAIN.
text: The gun bucks in his hand. DISCHARGES, KA-POW--!
text: Shot goes wild. Blasts splinters from the valet box.
text: BLUE FACE recoils and HOLLY kicks the door back open.
dialog: Leaping from the car--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Amelia, run!!
text: Amelia SPINS. Locks eyes with Holly... BOLTS like a cheetah.
text: PANIC. People yelling, rushing for cover. Holly stumbles,
text: gains her feet as Blue-Face fumbles with the gun, reaching
dialog: for her--
text: This time she slams the door ON HIS FINGER.
text: PAIN, white-hot. He shrieks, falls back inside the car.
text: Holly doesn't miss a beat--
text: SHE RUNS FOR IT. Heart thudding, feet slapping pavement.
text: Chasing a blotch of retreating YELLOW, as Amelia flees down
text: the canyon. The party's become a ROUT.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE STAIRS - BACK WITH MARCH
text: MARCH heading up the STAIRS fast-- following the sound of
text: the GUNSHOT. The wood, vibrating... thrumming. He looks up:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Fuck me.
text: Panicked PARTY GUESTS. STAMPEDING DOWN towards him, as behind
text: him they STAMPEDE UP. He fights through, bursts out--
scene_heading: EXT. VALET AREA - FRONT OF PARTY - SAME
dialog: Onto the drive. Casts about --
scene_heading: HIS POV: THE BLACK LIMO
dialog: 57
text: BLUE-FACE at the wheel. Laying rubber. People actually FLINGING
text: themselves aside-! IT SCREECHES off, down the canyon.
text: March turns -- the VALET who parked his car earlier gives
text: him a slightly surprised look:
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: Hey, man, I think that limo is going
dialog: after the girl who was in your trunk! Far
dialog: out, huh?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: My trunk--?
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh, fuck. FUCK..!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where the hell are my keys?!
scene_heading: EXT. SHATTUCK HOUSE - WOODEN LANDING - SAME
text: The DECK, now empty after the exodus.
text: HEALY and OLDER GUY. Still at it. Circling each other.
text: OLDER GUY darts in quickly, brandishing the knife.
text: HEALY scrambles back -- Stumbles against the HOT TUB.
text: A glint of METAL in the water. THE GUN.
text: Healy dodges a SLASH -- DIVES for the weapon.
text: Comes up, soaking wet, spins to FIRE --
text: Too late. Because OLDER GUY'S already ON TOP OF HIM.
text: Tackles him. STABBING. As they both PITCH BACKWARD --
text: Over the EMBANKMENT.
text: Tumbling, bouncing. DOWN THE WOODED HILLSIDE.
text: Skipping, end over end. Kicking up dirt --
text: Then WHAM--! WHAM--! the two men slam to an abrupt STOP in
text: the middle of a clearing. Twenty yards apart.
text: Healy groggy, bleeding, wet... The REVOLVER'S GONE.
text: He spots it to his left. Tries to stand. Collapses.
text: SCRAMBLES for the gun. Hands and knees.
text: Snatches it up and AIMS IT before Older Guy can even get to
text: his feet. PULLS THE TRIGGER:
dialog: CLICK--! Older Guy FLINCHES --
text: Nothing. It's a misfire.
text: Healy pulls the trigger twice more --
dialog: 58
dialog: CLICK--! CLICK--!
text: It won't fire. He gets it immediately: The cartridges are wet.
text: Older Guy smiles.
text: He's still got the knife. He starts for Healy.
text: Oh, Shit. Frantically, Healy flips the GUN CYLINDER open.
text: Spins it as fast as he can. Water flying off the thing.
text: Flicks it back into place. Aims. Older Guy ten yards away--
text: CLICK--! CLICK--! CLICK--!
text: Fuck. Healy tries to stand and back up at the same time.
text: Falls again. Fuck. Flicks the cylinder open. Spins it.
text: Desperate. Blows on it this time--
text: Older Guy is almost on him. He flicks the cylinder closed.
text: CLICK--! CLICK--! CLICK--! CLICK--!
text: Older Guy SWINGS THE KNIFE--
scene_heading: CLICK--! CLICK--! BLAM--!
text: MUZZLE FLASH. Close range. The bullet catches Older Guy in
text: the collar bone. SHATTERS IT. Blood and flesh go flying.
text: Older Guy SCREAMS, spun like a top. Goes down flailing.
text: The shot echoes in the canyon closeness.
text: HEALY drops his arm to his side. Chest heaving.
text: There. Much better. Tosses the gun. Spits blood.
text: Steels himself. Staggers to his feet. Half-limping now.
text: Kicks the knife away. Looms over Older Guy.
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: (wheezing)
dialog: Wait... You don't... I can pay you. I can
dialog: pay y--
text: Healy rears back and STOMPS the guy's elbow.
text: We hear a SHARP SNAP and the man SCREAMS again. SQUIRMING.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Are you bargaining with me?
text: Older Guy shakes his head emphatically.
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: No... No... I'm gone... You'll
dialog: never... see me again... Never...
dialog: 59
text: Healy takes the KNIFE. Holds it an INCH from the guy's EYE.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Uh-huh. Where will you be?
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: Mi... Michigan...
text: Healy considers a beat. Then, surprisingly, nods.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Michigan works.
text: Withdraws the knife. Staggers upright. Was it worth it?
text: He'll worry about that later. Turns, starts uphill -- then
text: just as suddenly STOPS. Ears pricked:
text: A SCREECH OF TIRES from down the canyon.
scene_heading: HIS POV: DOWN THE HILLSIDE
text: We can see A ROAD below us, through the trees.
text: Healy spots two figures RUNNING. They dodge across the
text: tarmac. Start down a wooded SLOPE. Getting OFF THE ROAD.
text: Behind them, A LIMO SHRIEKS TO A STOP.
text: A MAN jumps out, pulling a gun. Hard to say from this
text: distance, but it looks like his face might be BLUE.
text: Healy galvanizes. Powers forward. Running on his hurt leg.
text: Older Guy, forgotten -- and meanwhile
scene_heading: INT. CAR - WITH MARCH - DRIVING - SAME
text: He takes a corner full-speed. UP AHEAD--
text: THE LIMO. Angled in the middle of the road.
text: BLUE-FACE aiming a gun down the canyon. FIRING.
text: No hesitation. March VEERS. Targeting Blue-Face.
text: Stomps the accelerator. Engine, howling..!
text: BLUE-FACE reacts to the noise.
text: Doesn't miss a beat. Spins and FIRES RIGHT AT MARCH.
text: WINDSHIELD, splintered..! March ducks.
scene_heading: SKIDDING. OUT OF CONTROL.
text: Blue-Face DIVES aside, nick of time, as
text: MARCH'S CAR - Fishtails. Slews off the road...
dialog: 60
text: Just misses a full-grown DEER. Sends it SCAMPERING.
text: A TREE RUSHES AT US. March slams it HEAD ON... WHAM--!
text: Silence. A beat. March shakes his head. Clearing it. Turns--
text: BLUE-FACE is gone. Down the hillside.
text: March blinks, and then--
text: Someone ELSE flashes across the road, limping:
speaker_heading: MARCH
speaker_heading: HEALY!
text: Healy doesn't stop. Hobbles, yelling back, pointing:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: See if you can cut him off! Go!
text: Shit. March jams it in reverse. Pulling free. Takes off as--
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON ROAD - FURTHER DOWN THE HILL - SAME
text: Holly and Amelia stumble down onto another paved road. Amelia
text: clutching her BACKPACK. Both running for their lives--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Go! Run!
text: What happens next happens quickly:
speaker_heading: BLUE-FACE
text: Emerges from the trees behind them. Stops, drawing a bead on
text: Amelia. His finger tenses on the trigger, as
text: A DEER BURSTS FROM COVER
text: Ten feet away. Leaping into the road. It's the one that
text: March spooked. It fetches up sharply, seeing Blue-Face --
text: At which point, inexplicably, we make a HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE INTERIOR OF A FAMILY SEDAN
text: DAD, driving a tad fast, whips around a corner.
text: From the back seat, his son YELLS:
speaker_heading: SON
speaker_heading: DEER!
text: Dad cries out, SWERVES--! Misses the deer, thank God.
text: Hits BLUE-FACE instead.
dialog: 61
text: Just fucking nails him--! FLINGS him, limbs skewed, into the
text: air... He lands with a sickening THUD--! CUT TO:
text: HOLLY -- Still running. Shoots a look back. Sees the CAR
text: come to a SKITTERING STOP. Sees THE DAD get out... Stare --
text: Then HOP BACK in his car and take off.
text: Leaving BLUE-FACE lying there, in the middle of the road.
text: His leg, twisted back at an impossible angle...
text: Holly stops... Hesitates...
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: He's HURT. Just... just hang on!
text: She starts back toward him. Amelia calling after her:
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Are you crazy?! Stay away from him!
text: Holly just keeps going. Onto the road.
text: Approaches the downed man--
text: He's a mess. He rolls over, gasping... SEES HOLLY. Stops.
text: Holly stares back at him... Turns to call to Amelia --
text: Sees her RETREATING at a dead run. Goodbye.
text: BLUE-FACE, meanwhile, is out of it... He reaches out a hand
text: for her... She makes a decision. Crouches, takes his hand.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: It's okay... you're gonna be alright...
dialog: I'll get help.
text: A RUSTLING sound. Holly spins, startled--
text: HEALY is standing behind her. Staring down at BLUE-FACE. Grim.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: A car hit him, we need an ambulance..!
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Right.
text: He strips off his sliced up jacket, lays it across Blue-Face.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Holly, go flag someone down... Hurry,
dialog: he's in a bad way.
text: Holly scurries off. Healy and Blue-Face, alone now.
dialog: 62
text: He looms over the prone figure.
text: For a moment, Blue-Face turns his eyes upward at Healy,
text: imploring -- then, with dawning recognition:
speaker_heading: BLUE-FACE
dialog: You...
text: Healy regards him, detached.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Me.
text: Blue Face coughs... Fixes Healy with a belligerent grin:
speaker_heading: BLUE-FACE
dialog: Too late... The word already went out on
dialog: you and the private cop... Ever hear...
dialog: of John Boy..? By now, he's... heard of
dialog: you... You ain't got long to live.
text: Healy shrugs philosophically.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Nobody does.
text: He reaches out a powerful hand; calmly, clinically...
scene_heading: QUICK TIME CUT -- ANOTHER ANGLE
text: HOLLY comes running back down the road. Desperate, flustered:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Healy! No one's stopping!
text: Healy stands over BLUE-FACE'S BODY.
text: Slipping his jacket back on:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sorry... He didn't make it.
text: Holly shifts her gaze to the corpse. Stunned.
text: Casually, Healy leans down, starts rifling the dead man's
text: clothing. Comes up with a WALLET.
dialog: Checks the license: Seymour Jones. Detroit, Michigan.
text: He frowns at that... Just as HEADLIGHTS SWEEP them.
text: Healy quickly tosses the wallet, as RED AND BLUE flashers
dialog: fill the night --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: And that would be the cops.
dialog: 63
text: Holly doesn't even look up.
text: She can't stop staring at the body in the road. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON ROAD - AFTERMATH - NIGHT
text: POLICE CARS, skewed across the roadway. A COP routes
text: traffic, past the accident site -- BLUE FACE'S BODY is
text: loaded into an ambulance.
scene_heading: PARKED AT ROADSIDE -- MARCH'S CAR
text: Healy leans against it, calmly smoking. While March argues with
text: the UNIFORMED OFFICER, standing guard:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Look, you got our statements. Can I
dialog: talk to my kid now or what? She's over
text: with the nurse.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Sir, I was told to keep you here. So I'm
dialog: keeping you here. Just following orders.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (indignant)
dialog: Yeah, well... Hitler was just following
dialog: orders!
dialog: Healy thinks about correcting March -- but really, what's the
text: point..? Right then, a WOMAN appears at the cop's side.
text: She's dark. Dark hair. Dark eyes. And beautiful. Late 20s,
text: early 30s. She wears a crisp, tailored business suit.
text: As soon as she arrives, the cop gives her a quick nod and
text: departs. Just like that... The woman smiles at March:
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You're Mr. March, I think.
dialog: (to Healy)
dialog: And you are..?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Not answering that question.
speaker_heading: WOMAN / TALLY
dialog: (slight shrug)
dialog: My name is Tally. If you'll come with
dialog: me..? My boss would like a word.
text: March and Healy just exchange looks. Follow warily, as she
text: leads them to a black SEDAN. Stops, waits, as --
text: THE BACK WINDOW GLIDES DOWN
dialog: 64
text: Revealing ANOTHER WOMAN. Late 40's. Well kept.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: Gentlemen. How do you do?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: About this bad, most of the time.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: My name is Judith Kuttner. I work for the
dialog: California Department of Justice.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I see... Well, that explains exactly
dialog: nothing. What the hell's all this about?
dialog: Why are you holding us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: Please, keep your voice down. I'm trying
dialog: to be discrete here...
dialog: (pause, deep breath)
dialog: I'm Amelia's mother.
scene_heading: EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK - NIGHT
text: L.A. continues to dazzle. Clouds awash with the glitter from
text: below. TALLY plays a game with HOLLY in the background. As --
scene_heading: KUTTNER AND OUR GUYS
text: Sit at a picnic table. Talking. The SEDAN shields them from
text: the road. Kuttner nervously lights a smoke... There's a
text: snapshot of Amelia on the table.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: First off, I want to thank you. From the
dialog: interviews we're getting, it sounds like
dialog: you might have saved my daughter's life.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That was mostly Holly.
text: Kuttner glances back at Holly. Chews her lip. Thinking...
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: I need your help. And I'm wondering if I
dialog: can really trust you.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Most people don't... But I'm starting to
dialog: get the idea you don't have much of a
dialog: choice.
text: Kuttner regards March... Makes a decision.
dialog: 65
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: My situation is... well, "delicate" is
dialog: putting it mildly. My job can be very
dialog: public sometimes --
text: Healy frowns -- then suddenly snaps his fingers:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That's where I've seen you before -- on
dialog: TV. Prosecuting that car company thing.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: The lawsuit over the catalytic converter.
dialog: Exactly. That's half my day.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The other half I spend on pornography.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Really..? That makes two of us.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: You may have noticed that Hollywood
text: Boulevard has devolved into a cesspool.
dialog: Not to give cesspools a bad name.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: So you're, like, an anti-porn crusader?
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
text: More or less... The Vegas mob is looking
dialog: to expand their porn apparatus to L.A. I'm
dialog: doing everything I can to stop that--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Right. Porn is bad, yes, we get it --
dialog: (breaks off, squints)
dialog: -- Wait... Your daughter made a Sid
text: Shattuck film.
text: Kuttner nods. Stares off:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Ouch... Ma'am, no offense -- but why'd
dialog: Amelia do this film, if she knew it could
dialog: embarrass you?
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: Oh, that's what she wanted. She's a
text: petulant child, she... lashed out. Since
dialog: her father died we've had... a difficult
dialog: relationship.
text: She stubs
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: So, there's a film out there, somewhere.
text: A prime piece of blackmail.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: That would be my worry, except for one
dialog: small detail --
dialog: (beat)
text: There is no film. Not anymore.
text: out her cigarette.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: It's been destroyed... There was a fire,
dialog: Amelia's friend, boyfriend, whatever he
dialog: was--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Dean. Yeah. We've been to the house.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: This Dean was apparently editing the film
dialog: when the fire started -- all the footage
dialog: burned. Everything.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: A great loss to cinema, I'm sure. That
dialog: begs the question:
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mrs. Kuttner, why is everyone who worked
dialog: on that film now dying?
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: I don't know, Mr. March. I wish I did.
dialog: All I know is Amelia is in danger.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: So put her in protective custody. After
dialog: tonight she'll get scared, come running
dialog: home--
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: No. She won't. You don't understand--
dialog: (sudden tears)
dialog: I know how she thinks. She doesn't trust
dialog: me. I'm... Big Brother. I'm the
dialog: government.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She thinks it's me doing all this.
text: The implications of this set in. She wipes her eyes.
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: My daughter is out there, running scared.
dialog: And she can't call home... because she
text: thinks her own mother is trying to kill
dialog: her.
text: She reaches into her bag. Takes out a CHECKBOOK.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: I want to hire you. Both of you. Find
dialog: Amelia. Protect her.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CHECKBOOK
text: We see the sum take shape -- T-E-N THOUSA--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hire us? Sure. But we don't come cheap.
dialog: (smug)
dialog: I'm thinking five thousand dollars.
text: She stops writing. Pause... She rips up the check. Starts
text: writing again. March grins triumphantly at Healy. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MARCH'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - FALSE DAWN
text: Healy stands back here. Staring at the half empty pool.
text: Smoking... March comes out through the sliding glass doors.
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: She's asleep now. She's fine.
text: Healy nods. March kicks a beachball into the pool.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Listen, something bothers me...
dialog: (frowns )
dialog: Kuttner's prosecuting this car company
dialog: thing, right? Could mean hundreds of
dialog: millions against the big three.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah. So?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That guy tonight, the Blue-face one...
text: Got a look at his ID.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's from Detroit.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ... Probably nothing.
text: Healy nods... Then:
dialog: 68
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Oh, I almost forgot...
text: He reaches into his coat. Takes out the COW-SHAPED paper he
text: found at the party.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I found this in Shattuck's office.
dialog: (reads )
scene_heading: 28-10 Burbank Apt. Western, Flight 2.
dialog: 10:30 pm... I think Amelia wrote this.
text: March glances at it: 28-10 BURBANK APT. WEST, FLT 2, 10:30 pm.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: She might be trying to skip town -- what
dialog: do you think?
text: March shakes his head, a beat --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I think whatever it is, it can wait. I
dialog: need 8 hours...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just drop by in the afternoon tomorrow.
dialog: We'll sort it all out.
scene_heading: INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME
text: Healy, driving away from March's house. He spots something
text: out the side window, squints:
scene_heading: BEHIND SOME CONSTRUCTION FENCING
text: We can just make out the beam of a FLASHLIGHT -- held by a
text: small figure sitting in the dirt... Reading from a book.
text: Healy, bewildered. He hits the brakes and we CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HOLLY MARCH
text: Sitting Indian style in the middle of the vacant lot -- this is
text: exactly where we first met her... She reads out loud to no one.
text: Healy steps into frame behind Her... She stops reading but
dialog: doesn't look up:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Hey.
text: Healy glances around. No one else here.
dialog: 69
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You've got your foot in the toilet.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: ~.. What?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Your foot. It's in the toilet.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Oh.
text: Healy takes a couple of steps forward.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You just knocked over the lamp.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Right. Sorry... Was this your room?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: «+. No. Mom and Dad's.
dialog: Healy nods: Oh.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: «++. Mom loved detective stories.
text: She closes the book. Takes a deep lungful of night air.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Aren't you supposed to be in bed?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I see.
dialog: (nods )
dialog: ... Then I'll leave you to it.
text: Healy turns to leave... Heads back to his car.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Mr. Healy..? Can I ask you something?
text: Healy stops, looks back:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Anything.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: ... What did you do to that man tonight?
dialog: 70
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What. .?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: On the road... When I went to go get
dialog: help. What did you do?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I... Nothing.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You didn't...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: .».. Did you kill him?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: No... Of course not. I -- of course not.
text: She studies him a moment longer. Finally nods: she believes him.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Okay... That's good...
dialog: (little smile)
dialog: ... I knew you couldn't do something like
dialog: that... Goodnight, Mr. Healy.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A CAR DOOR SLAMMING
text: As Healy gets back into his car. Keys the ignition.
text: Catches sight of himself in the rearview mirror:
text: Notices something he hadn't before... Something troubling.
text: He shakes it off -- Puts the car in gear. Drives away...
text: And we CUT TO BLACK. Darkness. Silence. A count of FOUR, then:
text: FADE UP. A TV NEWSCAST. A SLICK, WELL DRESSED MAN being
text: interviewed. As workers in the background set up tables.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: I'm here with a representative of the
dialog: Detroit Auto Manufacturers, Mr. Bergen
dialog: Paulsen... Mr. Paulsen, I understand
dialog: you're in town today getting ready for
dialog: the Auto show--
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: That's right, Mike. For thirty years, it's
dialog: been my privilege to debut the finest in
dialog: automotive technology. Right here in L.A.
text: The CAMERA starts to pull back from the TV set now.
dialog: 71
text: We're inside Healy's apartment. The TV drones on, unnoticed...
text: The reporter asking about the catalytic converter lawsuit now.
text: Healy walks past frame. Fresh from the shower. Hair tousled.
text: We follow him over to his "word of the day" calendar:
scene_heading: Internecine \In.ter.ne.cine\, adj: Pertaining to dissention
text: within a group; mutually destructive.
text: He ponders a moment, then says out loud:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: The marriage failed when their internecine
dialog: struggle overwhelmed what love remained.
text: He smiles, satisfied. Shrugs on his coat. Exits whistling.
scene_heading: EXT. MARCH'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Healy sits on the front porch. Waiting. Smoking.
text: MARCH'S CAR pulls into the driveway. March and Holly climb
text: out. She's carrying packages. March carries a new suit.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, hey! The man of the hour!
text: They approach Healy.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Didn't know what time you'd be here. You
dialog: said the afternoon--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Right. Sure. Sorry... But I went to the
dialog: bank. Got your money. Right here.
text: He pulls out an envelope.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That's all of it. Half. Twenty-five
dialog: hundred... Yep...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, minus a couple hundred...
dialog: Damage to the car... I figured you'd want
dialog: to chip in for that.
text: Healy just shrugs it off.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 72
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What do you think..?
text: March holds up his suit, proudly. It's maroon.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Nice... I guess.
text: Holly pushes past Healy. She does not look happy.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: We stopped at a bar. That's why we're
dialog: late.
text: She darts inside the house.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Right... So, uh, how you wanna do this?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Well... I think we, you know, give it a
dialog: couple of days... Then we'll call
dialog: Kuttner, see if we can hit her up for a
dialog: second installment.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: We can -- I mean... What..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You don't want to call too soon. Gotta
dialog: act like you're on to something, been
dialog: working hard... Then wammo.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm good at this. Trust me.
text: He heads into the house. Healy turns, follows him inside:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Wait, you're just gonna... lie to her?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (off Healy's expression)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: She paid us. ME. She paid me to do a
dialog: job... I don't wanna lie to her.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Fine. I'll lie to her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Don't worry. This is a good thing. We're
dialog: gonna get some free bread.
dialog: 73
text: March hits play on his answering machine. He's got two
text: messages. Both from Lily Glenn, Misty's aunt:
speaker_heading: LILY (on machine)
dialog: Mr. March, this is Lily Glenn. I haven't
dialog: heard from you about Misty's case--
dialog: March fast forwards it:
speaker_heading: LILY (on machine)
dialog: Mr. March, I really want to find out if
dialog: you've made progress--
text: March deletes both messages. Uninterested... Looks up:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Right. So, we good?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Good..? No, we're not good.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, we have theses clues to follow --
text: He fishes out the COW-SHAPED PAPER he got off Blue Face.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Burbank Airport? Western flight 2? I'm
dialog: thinking she's skipping town --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Great! Fine! She gets shot in another
dialog: city. We're off the hook.
text: Healy turns, starts to walk back out the front door.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Forget it.
text: Just then, HOLLY appears from down a hallway.
text: March doesn't see her. Neither does Healy.
text: March follows Healy, reaches for his shoulder --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Wait, wait. Just one Goddamn secon--
text: Healy SHOVES HIM. March stumbles, knocking trash and beer
text: bottles off the coffee table. Lands on his ass... Sits in
text: spilled beer, pitiful.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I'll find these guys myself. I don't need
dialog: a pathetic idiot.
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Oh, you don't need a pathetic idiot.
dialog: Ahhh, see, I had it confused --
text: March glances over at that exact second. LOCKS EYES with his
text: daughter. The look on her face stops him cold:
text: She's ashamed of him.
text: Healy on his way out the door, says:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You're the world's worst detective.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: .».. Yeah, but I got a really cool ad.
text: Then, just before Healy's gone, March makes a decision --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, Healy -- say 'Hi' to Amelia for me.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ‘Course, you won't have much luck at the
text: airport... Seeing as it's not a flight.
text: Healy hesitates, turns back... March shrugs:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Your note. It's not a flight. Look at it.
text: Healy looks at it: 28-10 BURBANK APT. WEST, FLT 2, 10:30 pm.
text: March gets to his feet... Speaks unerringly from memory:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Most airports -- Burbank included -- have
text: nighttime overflight curfews. 10 to 6.
dialog: Plus that first number? It's today's date,
dialog: reversed the European way -- which makes
dialog: sense when you see FLT. That's not flight.
dialog: My guess? It's flat. As in apartment.
text: Pause. Healy stands, thunderstruck. Licks his lips, thinking.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: And Burbank APT. West..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: The Burbank Apartments West. I've driven
text: past it a few times. It's a dump.
dialog: 75
text: He gets up. Sighs. Turns to Holly:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: We're going now. And you're going to
dialog: Jessica's. For real this time.
scene_heading: INT. HEALY'S CAR - BURBANK - EVENING
text: Healy slews his car to a stop along a deserted-looking block
text: on Vineland... Healy and March clamber out. Look around.
text: Only there's nothing here. A gas station. An empty lot.
text: AN ELDERLY MAN is out walking his dog. Healy hails him:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: ‘Evening. We're, uh, looking for the
dialog: Burbank Apartments..?
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: (points to empty lot)
dialog: Used to be there. Tore those puppies
text: down, going on two years now.
text: He walks on. Leaves March and Healy just standing there.
text: A pause. Another pause. Then March turns to Healy and says:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: So. The airport, then..?
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT SKY - ESTABLISHING AIRPORT
text: Above us, a BOEING 737 climbs skyward. Wingtips blinking --
scene_heading: CAR BLOW-BY - HOLLYWOOD WAY - BURBANK
text: Healy and March rocket past, doing eighty.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - WITH HEALY AND MARCH
text: Healy at the wheel. Speeding. Racing against time.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Well, they used to have those overflight
dialog: restrictions. I read all about ‘em. So,
dialog: okay, maybe they changed them, but if they
dialog: did then that's... that's just wrong.
text: Healy is just ignoring him. Fuming. March decides it's best
text: to drop it. Stares out the side window. Squints, then:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, she's not going to the airport.
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What. .?
text: March points out the window.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Pull over.
text: Healy glances over:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Look, I've had it to here with your --
dialog: (stops)
dialog: What? What are you pointing at?
speaker_heading: MARCH'S POV:
text: The car glides to the curb, and the two men stare silently
text: at this vision before them... Healy whistles:
text: A FIFTEEN-STORY GLASS AND STEEL TOWER. Rising up from an
text: expanse of asphalt. On a huge MARQUEE:
scene_heading: BURBANK AIRPORT WESTIN
scene_heading: And underneath: Visit "THE FLIGHT LOUNGE" Disco 1 & 2
text: Healy just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: West is Westin. She's not leaving town.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (nods )
text: She's meeting someone.
scene_heading: INT. WESTIN HOTEL LOBBY
text: MARCH AND HEALY hurry through the faux-maritime Mecca that
text: is the AIRPORT WESTIN. Locate the FLIGHT LOUNGE.
scene_heading: INT. "THE FLIGHT LOUNGE" - BAR - SAME TIME
text: For the moment, no one but the bartender, JOE.
dialog: Our guys belly up to the bar --
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: "Evening. What can I get you?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Information. Ever see this girl?
text: He props a snapshot of AMELIA on the bar. Joe frowns:
dialog: 77
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: Looks familiar. You guys cops?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: In spirit. She woulda come in, like, last
dialog: half hour..?
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: Hey. I just work here.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I know, dickhead, that's why I'm asking.
dialog: Maybe ordered something wacky, say, a
dialog: bourbon martini..?
text: Bingo. We see the spark of recognition:
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: Riiiight... Could be. Memory gets foggy,
dialog: you know? What's in it for me?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (indicates Healy)
dialog: He'll stop doing it.
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: Doing what?
text: Healy grabs Joe's TIE, yanks--! Bounces his head off the bar.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That.
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: OW! Fuck.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Listen -- Joe, is it?
dialog: (reading nametag)
dialog: We really need to find her.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah. And Joe, we can do this the easy
dialog: way, or-- oh, wait, this is the easy way.
text: Healy reaches for Joe again --
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: Okay! Jesus. What ever happened to
dialog: offering me twenty bucks?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: We're in a recession. The girl?
dialog: Healy and
dialog: Healy and
dialog: Red flag.
dialog: 78
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
text: The PENTHOUSE. Top floor.
dialog: (massages his forehead)
dialog: She's in the penthouse. There. You happy?
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: She's there now.
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: Sure, yeah, but listen -- you guys don't
dialog: wanna go up there, trust me.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Why? Who's there?
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: These New York guys. Business guys,
dialog: whatever -- point is, they got fucking
dialog: bodyguards. Mohammed types -- you know
dialog: the kind, had their balls removed. What's
dialog: that called?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Marriage.
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: Anyway, he booked the penthouse.
dialog: March exchange glances:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What the hell is she up to..?
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Guys, no one wants trouble. She's gotta
dialog: come back down. Can't you just... hang
dialog: here, have a couple cold ones on me?
dialog: March mull it over. Why not?
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: There. See? Very reasonable. Your buddy,
dialog: that was the problem, he wasn't
dialog: reasonable --
text: HEALY picks up on it instantly:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Say again. Our buddy..?
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: The other guy, yeah, come round lookin'
dialog: for Amelia -- he wasn't with you?
speaker_heading: 719
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Describe him. He have a name?
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: No name. Big fucker. Blonde. Like a
dialog: Nebraska boy, corn-fed, you know?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Where'd he go?
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: Got on the elevator. Right before you
dialog: came in.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You witnessed this.
scene_heading: JOE THE BARTENDER
dialog: No, it was told to me by a wise old
dialog: Indian, of course I fucking witnessed it.
dialog: (stands)
dialog: I'll grab you a couple beers.
text: He exits. HEALY chews on that. Says without looking up:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Could be... Makes sense... John Boy.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Who. .?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Some guy Blue Face mentioned.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Mentioned? Mentioned how?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You know: "This man is coming to kill
dialog: you..." That kinda crap.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Big, farm-looking motherfucker. .?
dialog: (beat, shakes his head)
dialog: Shit, what am I talking about..? We don't
dialog: even know what John Boy looks like.
text: March is starting to look panicked.
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Look, all we gotta do is wait, right..?
text: She comes down, we grab her, ta-da.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I suppose. Unless he's up there now,
dialog: murdering her.
text: They both sit there, pointedly not looking at each other.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Not worth getting shot over.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You wouldn't think.
text: He rubs tired eyes. Lets out a long, ragged breath.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Okay. Here we go.
text: March's face registers the sort of undistilled misery only a
dialog: true coward can appreciate.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - HOTEL - SAME
text: Healy and March step inside the elevator.
text: March presses "P". They ascend.
text: It's a glass elevator, you can see the city outside.
text: They stare at the elevator doors. They've seen the city.
text: New Age MUZAK, serene. All of life's rough edges, blunted.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (abruptly)
dialog: Munich.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That's it, right? What you call a guy,
dialog: had his nuts removed? A Munich?
text: Healy slips on his brass knuckles. Flexes his hand.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Munich is a city in Germany.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (brightens)
dialog: Hitler only had one ball.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah, I'd heard that.
dialog: (watching the floor indicator)
dialog: Okay, here we go.
text: They face forward. Shoulders squared. Ready for anything.
text: The elevator glides to a stop, ding--!
text: The doors open. They're both about to exit, when--
text: LAUGHTER fills the corridor. Healy frowns, listening.
dialog: Wheezing, asthmatic laughter -- the kind, you think you're
dialog: gonna pass out, the joke's so fucking funny.
text: HEALY leans out, cautiously... Just in time to see
speaker_heading: A SUITED MAN
text: Stumbling toward him. Weaving, side to side.
text: Equilibrium, gone. Wheeze... Stumble...
text: Healy draws a sharp breath:
text: From the guy's collar, a sad little spritz. Wheeze..!
text: Like a kids' drinking fountain. Bright blood. Arterial.
text: HIS THROAT'S BEEN CUT.
text: Guy collides with the wall. Eyes, pleading with Healy...
scene_heading: POUNDING FOOTSTEPS, NOW
text: These from the OTHER direction. MARCH stares, eyes wide --
scene_heading: A SIMILARLY DRESSED MAN
text: Comes rocketing out of a side corridor. Headed their way --
text: Three loud, sharp REPORTS.
text: BULLETS rip through his mid-section--!
text: The window behind him, cracked. Splattered. He SCREAMS and
text: the WHEEZER keeps on wheezing and all is blood and chaos --
text: HEALY doesn't say a word. Never changes expression.
text: Leans back into the elevator. Reaches past March --
text: Pushes the "Lobby" button.
text: The doors glide shut, erasing the corridor.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE, IN THE SKY
text: The gut-shot MAN bursts through the picture window.
text: Tumbles past the elevator --
dialog: 82
text: Inside, Muzak plays, soothing.
text: Healy slides the brass knuckles off.
text: Stashes them in a pocket.
text: Their visit to the penthouse, 15 seconds in duration.
dialog: You know, it was never all that hot of an idea.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (looking ill)
dialog: Feels... like I'm gonna...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Don't even think about it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HEALY'S CAR
text: Squealing up out of the parking garage. Onto the street.
dialog: Getting the fuck out of there. Fast.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - WITH HEALY AND MARCH - DRIVING - NIGHT
text: March presses his forehead to the side window.
text: His face, a study in despair... Without looking up:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Cops.
text: Sure enough, STROBING RED, BLUE -- painting the buildings.
text: Without missing a beat, Healy swerves into an alley behind
text: the Westin. Pulls over. Kills the ignition... Pause.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You know, the thing is --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Shut up.
text: They sit. Checking the mirror. Saying nothing...
text: The cops get farther away. Crickets resume chirping.
text: Pause... the tension, palpable.
text: March opens his mouth to wrap things up --
text: Something lands on the car. HARD.
text: WHAM--! Buckles the roof. What in the name of God..?
text: March claws for his weapon, then FREEZES as
scene_heading: TINY HUMAN FEET
text: Appear. On the WINDSHIELD.
dialog: 83
text: Hearts in their throats, our guys swap glances.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What the fu--??
text: FEET. Walking down the windshield...
scene_heading: AMELIA, THEIR QUARRY
text: Hobbles into view. Torn dress. Cuts, scratches. Poised atop
text: the hood, eyes crazed, hair wild --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: HOLY SHI--!
text: The moppet in the windshield SPINS, startled. Executes a sad
dialog: little burlesque for their benefit:
text: They watch, oddly detached, as she raises a BERETTA she's
text: been clutching and BLASTS a shot through the windshield.
text: KA-POW! The seat cushion blooms stuffing, as--
scene_heading: AMELIA SLIPS--!
text: Goes over backwards. Tumbles from sight. Out of frame. Just
text: like that. Gunsmoke, hanging in the air.
text: Silence. They both sit there.
text: By unspoken assent, they clamber from the car, one on each
text: side. Find her splayed flat on her back. Unconscious.
text: March glances up at the FIRE ESCAPE they've parked under.
text: Looks at Healy. The wind blows. SIRENS...
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: THE FRONT DOOR bursts open. March and Healy enter. Carrying
text: the half-conscious AMELIA between them.
text: HOLLY is in the living room playing TV PONG with her friend
text: JESSICA. She jumps to her feet, surprised to see them:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Holy shit, you got her!
text: March is equally surprised to see his daughter.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What the hell are you doing here? You're
dialog: supposed to be at Jessica's!
dialog: 84
text: They walk/drag Amelia through the living room and into
text: Holly's room. Lay her on the bed. Holly and Jessica tag
text: along behind them.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Sorry, Mr. March, my sister kicked us
dialog: out. She was having some guy over, didn't
dialog: want us around.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (still pissed)
dialog: Yeah... Well... Your sister's a slut.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I know.
text: On the bed, Amelia's eyes flutter open. She squints.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Feel well enough to talk? We got some
dialog: questions.
text: She shifts her gaze to Healy. Eyes focusing.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: You were... You were supposed to get
dialog: these guys off of me.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Amelia, do you know what they want? Who
dialog: sent them?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Yeah. I know... It was my mother.
text: March and Healy exchange looks.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Why don't you start from the top?
text: Amelia shuts her eyes again. Tired.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Why? It doesn't matter. It--
dialog: (stops, sighs, then)
dialog: I... made a film... With Dean, my
dialog: boyfriend. The idea was we'd do this...
dialog: artistic, uh, film. Experimental film--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Porno film?
text: Amelia's eyes snap back open.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: It's not a porno! Look, do you know who
dialog: my mother is?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yes. We've met her. We talked to her.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (bitter)
dialog: What'd she tell you..? That I was a loon?
dialog: That I was lashing out?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Yeah, well... My mother is a criminal.
dialog: She's one of them.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Them..? Who's them?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: She's one of the insiders. She's one of
dialog: the capitalist, corporate suppressors.
dialog: (getting worked up)
dialog: She's one of the elite fear-mongers. And
dialog: her and her pig cronies have us in the
dialog: cross-hairs. We're just pawns, man!
dialog: They're trying to kill us all!
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Gosh.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: So, you're saying your mother is... bad?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: -.. Yes.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Does this have anything to do with the
dialog: birds?
text: Amelia lets her head fall back again. Closing her eyes.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: My mother is supposed to be working for
dialog: the Justice Department, right?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sure. She's prosecuting that car thing.
dialog: 86
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Yeah. Only she's not... I mean, she's not
dialog: prosecuting it. The automakers..? She's
dialog: gonna let ‘em walk.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: But... they have evidence--
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Sure, they have evidence. They've got
dialog: memos proving Detroit conspired to
dialog: suppress the converter. Proving they'd
dialog: rather poison our air than spend a little
dialog: money...
dialog: (warming again)
dialog: But my mother's gonna say it's not enough
dialog: to convict. She's gonna lie. She's on the
dialog: take. Money, again, right? Mammon, that's
dialog: her god. That FASCIST, CAPITALIST --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: Okay, okay..! Back up. How do you know
dialog: this?
text: Amelia calms again.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: I was spying on her... I listened in on
dialog: her phone calls.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: So why didn't you just go to the police?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: She is the police! She's the head of the
dialog: Justice Department!
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: Then to a newspaper.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Look, these people all work together! You
dialog: been living under a rock?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: So you decided to make a... porno film?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: It's not a porno. We made a statement.
dialog: And yes, it contained nudity --
dialog: 87
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: And porn stars..?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: That's just the commercial element. Okay?
dialog: Sid said we had to have that... The
dialog: reality was, we were gonna get our
dialog: message out there... It was all in the
dialog: film. Names. Dates. Everything.
dialog: Everything my mom was doing. Once it got
dialog: out, once it was in theaters there was no
dialog: way they could suppress it. No way to
dialog: cover it up.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I just want to get this straight. You
dialog: made a porno -- where the important part
dialog: was the plot?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: What's your hang-up, man?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: So, it's not about the actors, the sex,
dialog: nothing. It's the fucking story? That's
dialog: what you're telling us?
text: Amelia nods, calming again.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: ... My mom found out about it. Killed
dialog: Dean. Destroyed all his work...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Your mom killed Dean?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Of course. She killed Misty, too.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: And Sid Shattuck?
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: March nods.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: So, it's like, uh, Jack the Ripper and
dialog: then your mom.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: So what are you gonna do?
dialog: 88
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: ... I don't know... I haven't figured it
dialog: out yet...
dialog: (leans back, eyes flutter)
dialog: I'm just tired now. I'm tired.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Right... Well, we'll think on it. You,
dialog: uh, get some rest.
text: They all step out of the room. Close the door.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What do you think..?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I like her!
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I like her dress.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I think she's a loon. According to her,
text: her mother is single-handedly taking down
dialog: all of western society.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Yeah. People do want to kill her
dialog: though... Like John Boy.
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: Maybe he heard her talk for five minutes.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Who's John Boy?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: He's on "The Waltons."
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: This is a different John Boy.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: We think.
text: The phone in the kitchen starts to RING. March gets it.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: This is March.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - TALLY
dialog: 89
text: Judith Kuttner's assistant. She stands in the middle of a
text: well-appointed study at Kuttner's house.
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: Mr. March, this is Tally... I don't know
dialog: who else to call.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Tally..? What's going on?
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: I don't know quite how to say this. So
dialog: I'll just say it -- I think Judith, Mrs.
dialog: Kuttner, I think she may be involved in
dialog: something... How do I put it...
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Illegal..?
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: I wouldn't go that far. Shady. Maybe.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Well, her kid certainly seems to think
dialog: so.
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: Amelia? Did you talk to her? Is she safe?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah. She's here now. A little banged up,
text: but still intact.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She thinks her mom is a one woman crime
dialog: spree.
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: That's insane. Whatever Judith's doing,
dialog: it's to benefit Amelia, bet on it --
dialog: still...
dialog: (plunges in)
dialog: I just got a call from her... She
dialog: wouldn't explain herself. But she said
dialog: she needed $100,000 dollars in cash.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: I don't know. I think she's in trouble.
dialog: She sounded... scared.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Scared?
dialog: 90
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: I can send the family doctor to look
dialog: after Amelia, if--
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Mr. March, would you be willing to carry
dialog: the money for me?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Carry the money..?
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: I don't know where else to turn. And I'm
dialog: worried about Judith... Will you help?
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: March and Healy lean against March's car. Waiting for Tally.
text: March finishes a cigarette. Checks his watch.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Tally should be here any minute.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (nods absently)
dialog: Wish I knew who to believe on this thing.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Tell you what, that kid's a write-off.
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: She's misguided.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: She's NUTS. She won't be happy ‘til
text: there's a bird in the White House.
text: A pause... Then Healy shrugs.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Maybe they're both telling the truth.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (frowns, then)
dialog: I had this friend, right? In the Secret
dialog: Service. Worked the Nixon detail -- this
dialog: was after they threw him outta office...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anyway, one day Nixon is out driving,
text: down near San Clemente. Just him and a
dialog: few agents.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 91
speaker_heading: HEALY (CONT'D)
dialog: And they come upon this accident, first
text: ones on the scene. Guy pinned under his
text: own car. So, NIXON gets out, RUNS to the
dialog: guy's side to check on him... Nixon says
dialog: to him, "You're gonna be fine, son.
dialog: You're gonna be okay." But then, the guy
text: just dies, right there.
text: Pause. March has a vaguely constipated look on his face.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Just look at it from the other guy's
dialog: point of view. The guy that died... He's
text: out, driving along one day. Gets ina
text: horrible accident. And he's laying there,
text: near death. Staring up at the sky... And
text: former president RICHARD NIXON appears to
dialog: him... Tells him he's gonna be fine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What did that guy think? Did he think
dialog: this was normal..? You know, that
dialog: everyone sees Nixon before they die--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You're expecting an angel, you get this
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Right... Same situation... Just looks
dialog: vastly different depending on your point
dialog: of view. That's what I'm saying.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: It all just depends on your point of view.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sure. Right--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: --how you look at it.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah. What's wrong..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: For Chrissakes, you tell me this epic
dialog: fucking story, and ten minutes later the
dialog: point is there's two ways of looking at
dialog: things? Why not save time and say,
dialog: "There's two ways of looking at things."
dialog: 92
text: Healy just shrugs.
text: March rubs his eyes. Tired. Lights another cigarette.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ..-. Be kind of a bummer, that's what
dialog: death was like.
text: Healy nods...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Could be worse... Could be Agnew.
speaker_heading: A GREY MERCEDES
text: Pulls up along side them. TALLY gets out. Carrying a LARGE
text: METAL SUITCASE. She sets it on the hood of March's car.
dialog: Looks at our guys:
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: That's it. $100,000. I packed it
dialog: myself... It wasn't easy putting this
text: together on short notice.
text: March and Healy offer no reply. She regards them oddly:
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: I want to thank you, for doing this.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's nice to have people like you in the
dialog: world, still... What are we gonna do once
dialog: we run out?
text: Healy stands, pulls the suitcase toward him.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: So, tell us where to go.
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S CAR - DRIVING SAME
text: March driving. Healy in the passenger seat, eyes closed. The
text: metal SUITCASE rests on the backseat.
text: March drives in silence. Smoking... But then, after a few
text: moments, his eyelids start to droop. He shakes it off.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Man, I'm getting kinda tired here...
dialog: (glances over)
dialog: Healy?
text: Healy SNORES lightly.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Terrific...
dialog: 93
text: He stares back out the windshield. Concentrates on driving...
text: But his eyelids grow heavy again. His eyes shut for a second--
text: He snaps them back open:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Shit. Hey, Healy? Wake up!
text: Healy mumbles something. Looks over:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Sorry, I'm falling asleep here, man.
dialog: You're gonna have to drive.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Alright. Pull over at the next turn off.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Okay, cool...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Listen, you worried at all -- I mean
dialog: about making this drop?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Not me... I got insurance--
text: He pulls up his pants leg revealing an S&W AIRWEIGHT REVOLVER
text: in an ankle holster.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: This baby right here... Never leaves me.
dialog: Ever.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Cute... Let's just hope you don't have to
dialog: use it.
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: I'll pull off here.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You know what? You don't need to pull
text: off... The car can drive itself.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What are you talking about..?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Just let go of the wheel, man.
dialog: March considers for a second...
text: Then tentatively lets go of the wheel--
dialog: 94
text: And sure enough, as they approach a bend in the road, the
text: car turns all by itself... March looks delighted:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, I didn't know it could do that!
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You kidding? All cars can drive
dialog: themselves. It's amazing what Detroit can
dialog: do these days.
text: From the back seat, a GIANT, MONSTROUS KILLER BEE, roughly 6
text: feet tall, LEANS FORWARD. Turns it's humongous COMPOUND EYES
text: towards March. Oversized tongue protruding, says:
speaker_heading: GIANT KILLER BEE
dialog: Yeah, March, where the fuck have you been?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Like you know! You don't even drive, you
dialog: fly everywhere, asshole.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: He's got a point there, Bumble... You
dialog: can't even WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!
dialog: JESUS! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!
scene_heading: MARCH'S EYES SNAP OPEN
text: He fell asleep at the wheel. He's been dreaming.
text: Healy is YELLING at him:
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: LOOK OUT GODDAMNIT! LOOK OUT!
text: March whips his head around--
text: They're headed right for a CONCRETE OVERPASS SUPPORT.
text: HE SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
dialog: Too late -- WHAM! --
text: THEY SMASH INTO THE SUPPORT HEAD ON.
text: March and Healy jolted against their seatbelts as the car comes
text: to an immediate stop. The front end STOVED IN.
text: THE METAL SUITCASE launched out of the back seat.
text: SHATTERS the front windshield. Keeps going -- SMACK! --
text: IMPACTS against the concrete support. Breaking open.
text: Showering SHREDDED NEWSPAPER everywhere.
text: March and Healy stare out the broken windshield.
text: In shock. Silent. Stunned.
dialog: 95
text: The newspaper rains down all over the car.
text: There is no money in the suitcase.
text: It takes awhile for all this to process. March blinks:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: The suitcase.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (swallows )
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: There's no money.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I know.
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Maybe someone... Messed with it... I
dialog: mean, uh--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Tally packed the money herself. She said
dialog: so.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She totally fucked us.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (frowns )
dialog: Doesn't... make sense, I mean, why? What
dialog: good's it do to... send us off on a... a
dialog: thing, a--
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: --a wild goose chase.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Wild goose chase, exactly. Take us out of
dialog: the city...
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Three, four hours... When we could be
dialog: back dealing with Amelia and--
text: March stops cold. The same exact second as Healy.
text: Fear swims in their eyes. They exchange a look--
dialog: 96
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Motherf--!
text: March keys the ignition. The engine catches -- sounds like shit
text: but at least it runs... Slams it into reverse --
text: PULLS FREE of the concrete support.
text: BLASTS backwards--! Throws a smoking 180, as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Holly plays solitaire. Tries to ignore the background jabber
text: of JESSICA, phone welded to her chin:
speaker_heading: JESSICA (on phone)

text: THE DOORBELL RINGS. Holly gets up --
speaker_heading: HOLLY

speaker_heading: JESSICA (on phone)

dialog: like, a murderer. Shit, now it's gonna
dialog: bug me, who was that actor..?
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - MARCH AT A PHONE BOOTH - SAME
text: A BUSY SIGNAL. MARCH slams down the phone. Frenzied. Flings
text: himself into the car, waves at HEALY, go, go --
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S HOUSE - SAME
text: Holly opens the FRONT DOOR. On the other side, a tall,
text: bland-looking man with a medical bag:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You're Holly..?
dialog: (extends his hand)
dialog: Dr. Malek.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Hi. She's inside. Come in.
text: He smiles amiably. Shrugs out of his coat. Shuts the door.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Mind fetching your Dad?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Uh... he's running an errand.
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yeah? Back anytime soon?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh. Hour, tops.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Fine. Now, then, Nurse Holly, how's our
dialog: patient? That's her?
text: He points to JESSICA, who flashes a brisk Ally-Sheedy wave.
dialog: Never looks up.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: No, that's Jessica. What she's got you
dialog: can't fix.
dialog: (points to bedroom)
text: In there asleep. Slight fever.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: On drugs, you think? What was she saying?
dialog: Was she making sense?
text: He crosses to the bedroom. Turns, and for the first time
text: something captures Holly's attention:
speaker_heading: ON HIS CHEEK
text: Just below the right ear, looms a large, discolored LUMP. A
text: mole. Holly watches it go by... mesmerized. Frozen.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: She... uh, she called us fascists.
text: Holly, heart pounding now. And it gets worse -- an oblivious
text: JESSICA picks this moment to chime in:
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Holly. What's the name of that actor on
dialog: the Waltons? Richard something. With the
text: hockey puck on his face.
text: Beside Holly, the man goes very STILL.
text: The temperature in the room seems to drop.
text: A FLICKER. He recovers quickly, like he never heard --
text: Too late. Holly saw. She knows.
text: With affected casualness, she crosses to the counter:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: That show's for retards. Dr. Malek, would
dialog: you like a cookie? Just baked 'em.
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: None left. I looked, remember?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (quiet desperation)
dialog: No, there's a couple. Doctor?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR/JOHN BOY
dialog: I could be persuaded. After I've had a

text: HOLLY HAS A GUN IN HER HAND
text: The gun she just lifted from March's COOKIE JAR.
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: Nurse Holly..?
text: Ten feet separate them. John Boy smiles. Raises his hands.
text: The MEDICAL BAG drops. A SYRINGE rolls free --
dialog: Jessica just now noticing the gun--
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Holly, what are you doing?! Are you CRAZY?
text: Holly licks dry lips, says to John Boy:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: There are handcuffs in the desk, asshole.
dialog: Get them. Slow.
text: John Boy, so still it's frightening. Brow furrowed. Like
text: he's listening to a radio only he can hear.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: HEY! Did you hear me?
text: Pause... he looks up. Consults his watch.
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: This is really slowing me down, Holly.
text: JESSICA, still in shock.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: HOLLY! What's going on?!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (clenched teeth)
dialog: Jessica, it's him. He's the guy.
dialog: 99
text: John Boy reaches in his pants. The action so casual Holly
text: doesn't think to stop him. From the waistband, he produces a

speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: Jessica, if you help me with this, I'll

speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Come on, now... 68 and sunny...
scene_heading: INT. MARCH'S - LIVING ROOM - SAME
text: JOHN BOY seems, if anything, MORE casual now. As he slowly
text: walks toward Holly. A dreadful stillness about him.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Jessica. Dial 911.
text: John Boy cocks his head. Hears a car, faint in the distance.
dialog: Keeps moving.
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: Jessica..? I wouldn't do that if I were
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Jessica, DON'T LISTEN.
dialog: The pressure, simply too much. Jessica's just a kid, she
text: BOLTS--! Rushes headlong for the door --
text: CROSSES BETWEEN HOLLY AND JOHN BOY
text: Mistake. A split-second advantage, and John Boy takes it.
text: With no seeming effort, he GRABS JESSICA.
text: SLINGS her round in front of him. Facing the GUN.
text: HOISTS her into the air, legs kicking --
text: AND HURLS HER.
text: It's bizarre. All his might, flat-out THROWS her at Holly.
text: Here she comes... Surreal. Holly DUCKS.
scene_heading: JESSICA PINWHEELS PAST HER--
dialog: 100
text: Goes CRASHING though a side WINDOW. An explosion of glass.

scene_heading: EXT. MARCH'S HOUSE - STREET - SAME

speaker_heading: HEALY

text: AS A STRANGE MAN casually crosses March's front lawn.
text: In no great hurry. He spots March and Healy. Waves.
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: ‘Evening.
text: Healy and March, thrown. The guy, so utterly unperturbed.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey... Do you know what that loud noise
dialog: was?
text: The words hang in the air. JOHN BOY pauses at his car.
text: Casually opens the trunk, reaches inside --
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: Yeah, just now..? I threw that girl out
dialog: the window.
text: Healy reacts instantly:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: MARCH! DOWN! !
text: Healy TACKLES March behind a PLANTER--
text: As JOHN BOY comes up FIRING. A STERLING SUBMACHINE GUN.
text: FULL AUTO. Rips the suburban nighttime to pieces.
text: March's car takes the first fusillade. Tires blown. Glass
text: shattered. John Boy swivels, targets the planter. Chunks of
text: concrete go flying.
dialog: 101
text: March rolls out to one side, looks up -- SEES JESSICA.
text: At the side of the house. Lying there.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: JESUS CHRIST..!
text: Without thought, he powers to his feet. Sprints across twenty
text: feet of lawn. GUNFIRE chasing him. Earth shooting up in gouts.
text: He flings himself FLAT around the side of the house. Combat
text: crawls to Jessica. Checks her. Alive. Gathers her up, as --
text: BACK OUT ON THE STREET
text: Healy is making a move. First lull in the fire, he BOOKS.
text: Across the drive. Towards March's car --
text: LUNGES across the front of it.
text: Clears the hood. Touches down. Rolls.
text: Gun aimed, UNDER THE CAR, towards John Boy's feet. SWEARS:
text: John Boy is LOOKING BACK.
text: The killer lies flat. Already aiming under the car. Healy
text: jumps, CLINGS to the door panel, as the world ERUPTS...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - SAME
text: March bursts in the side door, carrying Jessica.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: HOLLY! !?
text: He half-runs, half-staggers. Rounds the corner --
scene_heading: HOLLY AND AMELIA
text: Are crouched, hugging each other.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Fucking fascists!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Dad..!
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah, yeah, okay. Come on.
text: He pushes them into the bedroom. Places Jessica on the bed:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Stay here. Don't move.
text: He takes the GUN from Holly.
dialog: 102
text: Runs to the FRONT of the house, and meanwhile --
scene_heading: OUTSIDE - HEALY'S PINNED
text: Behind a eucalyptus TREE. Every few seconds he thrusts out
text: an arm, FIRES. Shooting blind.
text: The TREE gets RIPPED TO SPLINTERS in response.
text: John Boy's head snaps sideways. Sees MARCH inside the house.
dialog: Doesn't miss a beat --
text: Draws a SECOND WEAPON from the trunk of his car.
text: A HANDGUN. Targets March with it.
text: While still firing at HEALY, he aims the other gun.
text: Blows SHOT AFTER SHOT through the front WINDOW at March's
text: scuttling form. Glass, COLLAPSING.
text: John Boy drop-stuffs new clips so fast it's scary.
dialog: Slap-click--! Slap-click--!
text: In the midst of this, he pauses to check his watch. Frowns,
dialog: annoyed. Off-schedule. It's taking too long --
scene_heading: BACK INSIDE - BEDROOM
text: JESSICA, now, stirring. HOLLY crouches:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Amelia, gimme a han--
dialog: (swivels round)
dialog: Amelia?
text: Reacts, startled. AMELIA, poised in the WINDOW. Overlooking
text: the steeply pitched BACK YARD.
speaker_heading: AMELIA
dialog: Tell Mr. Healy thanks for nothing.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Wait -- Amelia, NO!!
text: Amelia JUMPS. Slips from view, plummets -- CUT TO:
scene_heading: FRONT YARD - HEALY AND HIS TREE
text: He picks his moment -- BREAKS COVER.
text: Spins into view. Puts three in the raised TRUNK LID, pow-
text: pow-pow-! JOHN BOY, now, forced to dodge --
text: Healy sprints. DIVES through the shattered front WINDOW of
text: March's house. Hits, rolls... Comes up running --
dialog: 103
scene_heading: PUMPS TEN SHOTS
text: Back out the fucking window as he races toward cover--
scene_heading: OUTSIDE, JOHN BOY
text: Decides on retreat. Distant SIRENS, now. Approaching.
text: He climbs behind the wheel of his car --
text: SHRIEKS out of the driveway. In a cloud of brick and stucco.
text: Right then, the EUCALYPTUS TREE finally BREAKS IN TWO--
text: Slams down with a THUNDEROUS CRACK--! Just missing his car.
text: He screeches away. Brow slightly furrowed. Disappointed.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - FOLLOW WITH MARCH
text: Crouched low, MARCH arrives at the bedroom. Opens the door --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Oh, no...
text: HOLLY, in tears... He moves to the window, peers out:
text: A 15-FOOT DROP, TO THE HILLSIDE. Amelia nowhere to be seen.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - WITH JOHN BOY - DRIVING
text: It doesn't take JOHN BOY long to realize he's riding on
text: RIMS. Two blocks from March's, he PULLS OVER. Gets out...
text: Approaches a random CAR. Goes to break the GLASS, stops --
text: A POLICE CAR is approaching.
text: The first to respond. Inbound. 30 yards out.
text: In a split-second? John Boy changes tactics.
text: Walks right out INTO THE ROAD. Waves his arms frantically --

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Sir? Please calmly tell me what th--

text: Bounces his head off the hood. CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE POLICE CAR, SQUEALING OFF --
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DRIVING
text: JOHN BOY at the wheel. He hits the flashers, just for fun.
text: Checks the rear view -- Can hardly believe his LUCK:
dialog: 104
text: Because there, running up the road, SCREAMING for him to
dialog: STOP... is none other than AMELIA.
text: He permits himself a smile. CUT TO BLACK. PAUSE. FADE IN ON:
scene_heading: EXT. MARCH'S NEIGHBORHOOD - AN HOUR LATER - COPS EVERYWHERE
text: POLICE CRUISERS, six of them. Flashers turning. The night
text: wears on. Everyone's dead tired.
text: MARCH wanders in circles. Takes an interest in the ground.
speaker_heading: AMELIA KUTTNER
text: Is a blanket-covered lump in the middle of the road.
text: Pitifully small. COPS swarm round. All too late.
text: HEALY says nothing. Looks on, his face unreadable. His
text: client, dead. She paid him. He just stands there. There's
dialog: nothing he can do.
text: And so he just stands there.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: March and Healy sit, HANDCUFFED to a bench in the hallway.
text: March stares at the ground. Healy gazes at the ceiling.
text: They're silent.
text: We hear the low murmur of station activity in the background.
text: We hold... Finally, a man enters frame. Suit, tie. Lawyer.
scene_heading: PERRY THE LAWYER
dialog: Alright, guys. They're letting you out on
dialog: your own recognizance... You'll be
dialog: processed and free in an hour.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What about Kuttner? Did they question her?
scene_heading: PERRY THE LAWYER
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: No. They didn't... They're not going to.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Perry, listen to me--
scene_heading: PERRY THE LAWYER
dialog: No, March, you listen... You're lucky to
dialog: be getting out at all. She's the head of
dialog: the Justice Department, you can't come in
dialog: here spouting this crap and expect --
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Perry, it's true. She had her daughter
dialog: killed--
scene_heading: PERRY THE LAWYER
dialog: March, it's your word against Kuttner's.
dialog: You lose... They're gonna want to
dialog: question you some more in the next couple
dialog: of days --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You might want to think about changing
dialog: your story.
text: March falls silent. Healy continues to stare at the ceiling.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES - 101 FREEWAY - MORNING
text: Cars backed up as far as the eye can see. It's rush hour and
text: nobody's moving. A thick CRUST OF SMOG hangs over the city.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI CAB - 101 OVERPASS - SAME
text: March and Healy in the back seat. Holly up by the driver.
text: They inch along, breathing exhaust fumes.
text: March stares out the window. From up here on the overpass,
text: he's got a nice hazy view of the city in the morning sun.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You know those idiots -- those protester
dialog: idiots?
text: Healy looks over.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I think they were right... The birds
dialog: can't breathe.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Think so?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah. I think so.
text: Silence. They inch forward some more.
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: Amelia dead. Misty, Shattuck. All dead.
dialog: The rest of us get to choke --
dialog: (looks over)
dialog: No one cares.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Well, it looks that way.
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Guess that's how it goes sometimes.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That's how it goes a lot of the time.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I need a drink.
scene_heading: EXT. MARCH'S HOUSE - SAME
text: The CAB pulls up outside of what's left of March's house.
text: Glass broken. Bullet holes. Police tape.
text: March and Holly climb out and stare at their home while
text: Healy pays the driver.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: In some ways, it's kind of an improvement,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah... Grab whatever you need and we'll
dialog: stay in a motel or something... For
dialog: tonight anyway.
text: Holly disappears inside the house, just as a huge BOAT of a
text: car pulls up to the curb outside. Parks awkwardly.
text: An old woman gets out. We recognize her. It's Lily Glenn,
text: Misty's aunt. She approaches March. Looking determined again.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (last thing he needs)
dialog: Mrs. Glenn, hello... I know you've been
dialog: calling. I've been a little busy.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: Well, I just--
dialog: (stops, seeing house)
dialog: Oh, my! Your house!
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yes, my house. We're remodeling... Mrs.
dialog: Glenn, perhaps now is not the time--
text: The old woman, sensing the brush off, ignores the house
text: looking like a war zone. Puts her determined face back on:
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: Now is the time, Mr. March. Have you made
dialog: any progress on my case?
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: No, Mrs. Glenn. Not really... I'm not
dialog: sure I'm going to.
text: She notices Healy, seemingly for the first time.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: He's supposed to be looking for my niece!
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Um, yes. Heard about that.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: She's alive, too. I know because I saw
dialog: her. Only, nobody believes me. Why won't
dialog: they believe me?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Um, I don't know, ma'am.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: I saw her at her house! Right through the
dialog: front window, clear as day! She was
text: writing something at a desk. She was
text: wearing a blue pinstriped jacket...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Sure. I've seen that jacket.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Mrs. Glenn, please... I need to get--
dialog: (stops, catching something)
dialog: What'd you say?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What. .?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You've seen that jacket.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah. At Shattuck's. It was in his office
text: with a bunch of other wardrobe.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: The jacket was in his office?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah. A blue, pinstriped jacket. Had
text: Misty's name on it. It was for the film.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Wardrobe. For the film.
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I think I just said that.
text: March blinks once. And suddenly he gets it.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Holy fucking shit!
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: (reacts to language)
dialog: Oh, my..!
text: Healy's totally lost now. March, suddenly excited.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Mrs. Glenn, I need you to take us to
dialog: Misty's and show us exactly what you saw.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - STREET - DAY
text: MARCH steers to a halt outside Misty Mountains' Hollywood
text: Hills hideaway. It looks forlorn after only a week.
text: As they all exit the car, LILY speaks excitedly:
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: There. That's the window.
text: March is silent. Intent. Uses Lily's KEY, opens the door--
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - SAME
text: Spacious living room. Lot of BUILT-INS: Cabinets, consoles.
text: Psychedelic furnishings, erotic art. HEALY sizes it up, then
dialog: states the obvious:
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: Mrs. Glenn. There's no desk in this room.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Well I... I don't know what to say...
text: MARCH, meanwhile, is looking around. Staring up at the
text: ceiling. Examining the floor. Holly watches him:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Dad, what are you doing?
text: March bumps the coffee table. It's pretty heavy. He kicks it
text: again. It's really heavy. Starts checking it over.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Just hang on... Hang on...
dialog: 109
text: There's a long split down the middle of the table. He tries
text: to get his fingers in there. Feels underneath it.
text: Hits a latch... The coffee table splits open.
text: We see something inside. Elevating. EMERGING. He grins --
text: A MOVIE PROJECTOR rises into view.
text: LOCKS in position, click--! Pause. There it sits.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: I don't understand.
text: He turns to her, eyes twinkling.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Very simple. You did see your niece that
dialog: night, Mrs. Glenn. You saw her on that
text: wall. At a desk. In a pin-striped suit.
text: He rummages inside the console. Healy, confused --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Wait. So what she saw... she was looking
dialog: at a MOVIE?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Not a movie. THE movie. Misty's farewell
text: performance. Projected on that wall.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You can't be serious.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You got a better idea?
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: All the copies of the film burned up.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Then how did Lily watch it through that
dialog: window two days after it supposedly
dialog: burned? Chrissakes, the WARDROBE matches.
dialog: LILY stammers:
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: I... I'm confused --
dialog: They pay her no heed.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: What if Amelia lied to us?
dialog: 110
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You're saying she made a copy?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: A copy, yes. Wouldn't you?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: And gave it to Misty.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: YES. That night she came, checked the
dialog: film against that wall, then carried it
text: off with her -- all while Lily watched.
text: Healy, wheels turning. LILY tugs March's arm:
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: I need to ask something --
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I dunno, March. That's pretty thin...
text: But now, against his will, HEALY's hooked. He snaps his
text: fingers. Looks up, eyes wide:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: The businessmen.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: At the Westin, remember? Bartender said
dialog: she was meeting some dudes out of New
dialog: York. Conducting some kinda business --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Selling them the film.
dialog: (excited)
dialog: See? What'd I tell you? It's out there,
text: man. The film still EXISTS.
text: They exchange triumphant looks. LILY, insistent now:
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: Please... please stop talking.
text: They all trail off. Turn, to find her looking STRICKEN.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: I listened to everything you said... Does
dialog: this mean...
dialog: (lip trembles)
dialog: Does this mean my niece is dead..?
dialog: 111
text: Awkward pause. Holly avoids her gaze. Healy looks pained.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: She was murdered, Lily.
speaker_heading: MRS. GLENN
dialog: ...I see.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: But we're gonna get the people who did it.
scene_heading: INT. CEDARS SINAI HOSPITAL - LOBBY - DAY
text: HEALY, HOLLY AND MARCH hustle through the HOSPITAL doors.
dialog: Moving fast and loose --
scene_heading: INT. PATIENT ROOM - AFTERNOON - MAN IN BED
dialog: Okay. Remember the WHEEZING GUY, from a few pages back? The
text: Airport Westin sequence -- his throat cut, exactly, that
text: guy. Well, he's HERE, in bed. A survivor.
text: Private room. Hushed, dim. He lies still. Throat bandaged.
text: He hears a sound. Looks up -- Sees HEALY enter furtively,
text: beckon to MARCH and HOLLY. The guy goes rigid.
text: They approach. Huffing, out of breath. Flank the bed. March,
text: elected spokesman. He smiles, offers pad and paper:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hi, I don't know if you remember us, but
dialog: we have a couple questions. If you can
dialog: just, you know, write the answers --
text: The guy RECOILS. Swats away pad and pen. Scared witless.
text: Actually makes MEWLING noises.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Whoa! Easy! No one's here to hurt you.
text: The man seems to think otherwise. Seems INCONSOLABLE.
dialog: March frowns:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Damn. What's this guy's problem? I mean,
dialog: yeah, the cut throat. Obviously --
text: HEALY tumbles to it first. Leans in, gaze steady:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: We're not with anyone else. Okay?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sir, was someone else here?
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: Um, yeah. About six-two? Blond hair, big
dialog: thing on his face?
text: At this, the Wheezer stops struggling and promptly faints
text: dead away. March shakes him. Again. Nothing.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Swell. Now what?
text: March leans back against the wall to wait. Kicks something
text: on the floor. Look down.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey... Check out the floor.
text: There's numerous scraps of NOTEPAPER, scattered all over the
text: linoleum by the bed. Healy stoops. Grabs one. Whistles:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I'll be damned... John Boy did question
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: How can you be sure?
text: Healy flashes the note: "DON'T KILL ME." March immediately
text: gets down on his knees, starts snatching up notes. Reading
text: them. Holly follows suit.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Please... Please..."
dialog: (grimaces)
dialog: That's useful.
dialog: Holly's got one:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "No... We didn't get it yet..."
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Didn't get what? The film?
text: Holly just shrugs. Healy thinking:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: She didn't give it them, maybe? Not yet?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: They never took possession? Oh, great.
dialog: That's just great. And now she's dead.
dialog: 113
text: Healy grabs another note:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: "After they were done with it..."
dialog: (thinking)
text: Hand over the film, after they're done
dialog: with it. THEY. Her protest group?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: The Birdy Bunch. "Done with it.." What
dialog: does that mean?
text: They scramble through more notes. Discarding one after
dialog: another until March finds:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: "Her friend is a projectionist."
text: Healy stops... Frowns:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Is that... Are they talking about that
dialog: protester kid, you know--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: The idiot kid.... Chet! That was his
dialog: name! Chet!
text: Holly finds another note. Reads it:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: "At the L.A. Auto show."
text: MARCH and HEALY both freeze.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: The Auto Show. Isn't that, like,
dialog: tonight..?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yeah... Big party. All the mucky-mucks'11
dialog: be there... The press, everyone...
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You don't think--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Great place to get the message to the
dialog: people, you know..?
dialog: Off March's look we CUT TO:
dialog: 114
scene_heading: EXT. GRANDE VISTA HOTEL - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT
text: Below us, a sprawling HOTEL COMPLEX.
text: Opposite the L.A. Convention Center.
scene_heading: THREE HI-RISE TOWERS
text: Form a "U" around a ground-level COURTYARD. Swank. Ritzy.
text: CARS rotate on huge PEDESTALS down there. As SEARCH-LIGHTS
text: sweep the sky. There's even a dance floor on the ROOFTOP.
text: Welcome to the L.A. Auto Show's GALA OPENING NIGHT.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD LEVEL - PARTY - SAME
text: We spot MARCH, HEALY and HOLLY moving among the rich and well
text: dressed. They push through the bustle of activity. Harried. Out
text: of breath... MARCH corrals a passing SECURITY GUARD:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hi there! We're looking for the
text: projection room.
text: The guy points up, past a giant suspended MOVIE SCREEN -- to
text: the far side of the hotel, dotted with windows.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Ninth floor. You have a pass..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Sure. We have a pass.
dialog: (the guy leaves)
dialog: We don't have a pass.
dialog: HOLLY, ever-helpful:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: They gotta let hotel guests up, right?
text: Before they can respond, Holly leans over, and as they pass
text: a POOLSIDE TABLE -- she snags a set of keys from two
text: oblivious CHATTING GUESTS.
text: March smiles. Chip off the old block. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - 9TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - SAME
text: Music, heard faintly. Our guys come barreling out of the
text: elevator. Down the HALLWAY...
text: The whole floor's been taken over by the show. Makeshift SIGNS
text: taped to the doors. They pass a guy, March flags him:
dialog: 115
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, you seen Chet? The projectionist?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Just left... Like ten minutes ago. Went
dialog: for a drink. And you are..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: In a hurry. Thanks, buddy.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: (frowns )
dialog: How'd you know my name was Buddy?
text: They round the corner. Still moving. Scanning paper signs.
text: Healy spots one that reads "MOVIE ROOM." Nudges March.
text: They try the door. Locked. March signals Holly, still at the
text: far end of the hallway:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Check down there... We clear?
text: Holly looks both ways. Gives March the thumbs up.
text: Healy grabs the handle. APPLIES HIS WEIGHT to the door panel.
text: Shifting. Heaving. An audible SNAP--!
text: March motions for Holly to keep an eye out, as
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - SAME
text: They enter what looks like a fairly nice hotel SUITE. Couches,
text: chairs, parquet floors. And there, aimed out the WINDOW --
text: A BIG CLUNKY PROJECTOR, rented for the occasion.
text: THERE'S A FILM IN IT, threaded onto a PLATTER.
text: Healy crosses the room. Plucks at the leader, unspools ten
text: feet of film. Holds it to the light --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Well. .?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (blinks, perplexed)
dialog: It's... a bunch of cars.
text: March hunkers down. Pores over the footage.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: "Motor City Pride." This isn't it. It's
dialog: not the film.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: The projectionist, he must still have it
text: stashed somewhere.
text: From BEHIND them issues a calm, clear VOICE:
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.s.)
dialog: My thinking, exactly.
dialog: They SPIN, startled --
text: IT'S TALLY. In one hand, a bright, distractingly GREEN WALKIE-
text: TALKIE. In the other, an equally distracting AUTOMATIC.
text: She closes the HOTEL DOOR without looking, actually slams it
text: right in Holly's FACE, locks her out--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, Tally, how's it going? Wow, you look
dialog: great. Nice gun.
text: She waggles the automatic:
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: Got it special for you. Weapons on the
dialog: floor. Now.
text: Healy sighs. Unlimbers a revolver, tosses it. Ditto March.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You kill the projectionist..?
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: No. My associate's out looking for him
dialog: now. We'll find him.
text: Healy squints at her. Sizing her up--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Tell me, Tally. Ever killed anybody?
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: In Detroit, yes. Three times.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (not what he was expecting)
dialog: Oh... Really?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: That's where this mess began, isn't it?
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: Sorry?
dialog: 117
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Detroit. Misty Mountains was at that auto
dialog: show. Last month.
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: She was stupid. Kept bragging about her
dialog: new movie. The stir it would cause.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Tally, listen. You're not a murderer.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: She did kill three people --
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: I mean, you know, deep down.
text: Abruptly, there is a sharp KNOCKING at the door.
text: A poorly disguised VOICE calls:
speaker_heading: HOLLY (o.s.)
dialog: Room service..?
text: Tally frowns. Her attention drawn to the door, briefly--
text: And that's enough time for MARCH to MAKE HIS MOVE.
text: He drops to the FLOOR. Darts out an arm --
text: Grabs the CUFF OF HEALY'S PANTS. Frantic. Searching.
text: Healy frowns down at him... Tally, too... Gun still leveled,
text: as March determinedly goes for Healy's OTHER leg--
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: What's wrong with him?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Not sure.
dialog: (to March)
dialog: Um... March? What the fuck are you doing?
dialog: Just curious.
text: March sits up, a trifle breathless--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Shit. I was going for the gun... I guess
dialog: you musta moved it...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What gun?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: The one you showed me... Your ankle gun.
dialog: 118
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Who told you I had an ankle gun?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You did. You showed me, remember?
dialog: (floundering)
dialog: You know, on the -- the road. Last night,
dialog: right before we hit that, um...
dialog: (frowns )
dialog: Hang on. Did I... dream that..?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Are you serious? Are you fucking serious?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: No, no, wait--
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You DREAMT IT, you moron. There's no
dialog: ankle holster. Wow. WOW. This takes the
dialog: prize--
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: SHUT UP, BOTH OF YOU!
text: Tally unlocks the door:
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: Holly..? You can come in.
text: Holly, enters, pushing a small service tray.
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: Very clever, Holly.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Thanks, I thought so--
text: And on the word "so" Holly moves. Fast. Snatches the COFFEE
text: POT off the tray and flings it at Tally... Covering her with
dialog: SCALDING HOT LIQUID--!
text: Only Tally doesn't seem all that bothered. Perhaps the fact that
text: the coffee isn't actually hot has something to do with it.
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: I got it in the hallway... I thought it
dialog: was hot.
text: Tally just shakes her head. Moves to close the door--
text: AND SLIPS... Slips on the coffee puddle at her feet.
text: She goes down with a YELP. CRACKING her head on the doorknob.
text: The GUN in her hand discharging, BLAM-! Takes out a lamp.
dialog: And she's OUT COLD. That quick.
text: March pops to his feet. All business.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Well, that worked out... Now, we gotta
dialog: find this projectionist before John Boy.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: That guy said he went for a drink... Take
dialog: the upstairs bar. I'll take downstairs.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - LAVISH BAR - SAME
text: CHET, THE PROJECTIONIST, sits at the bar looking nervous.
text: Checks his watch for the umpteenth time. Glances around.
text: A MAN steps up a few feet away. Scans the crowd.
text: Tall, broad, easy-going grin. Giant mole... John Boy.
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: Anyone here seen the projectionist?
text: CHET gives an involuntary start. John Boy catches it. Turns:
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: You're the projectionist..? Look, we got a
text: problem on nine. Someone knocked over the
text: projector. Film's all over the floor.
speaker_heading: PROJECTIONIST
dialog: The film's on the floor, really?
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: Yeah, fuckin' mess. Follow me..?
text: CHET nods, gulps his scotch. John Boy waits, smiling. CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP PARTY - SAME
text: A smaller, more exclusive version of the party downstairs.
text: MARCH AND HOLLY step out of the elevator. Survey the scene.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Stay here. Guard the elevator.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Dad, I want to help--
dialog: 120
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Good. You can push the button for me when
dialog: I get back.
text: He walks away, leaving her fuming. Heads over to the bar.
text: (Clearly a different bar than the one we just saw Chet at.)
text: Starts scanning the crowd in vain.
text: Absently plops down on a barstool... The second he does, a
text: hand taps him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey, pal, what can I do for you..?
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (spins his chair around)
dialog: Excuse me..?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (VOICE)
dialog: Free drinks, man. What'll you have?
text: March blinks at the endless line of bottles behind the bar.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: «+. Free drinks..?
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - SAME
text: Healy makes his way through the crowds. Spots the main bar.
text: Pushes towards it... Catches the bartender's attention:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Hey, I'm looking for a guy about Five-
text: five. Brown hair. He's supposed to be
dialog: running the projector for us--
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Yeah-yeah. Guy already came and got him.
dialog: Something about film on the floor, right?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Which way did they go?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: They took the service door, right over--
text: But Healy's already on the move. We follow him as he pushes
text: through the service exit.
text: He jogs down the corridor, tries the door a the far end -- it
text: leads to a LOADING DOCK.
text: Empty. He starts to head back in, when a NOISE startles him.
text: He spins. Movement, there... Inside one of the dumpsters.
dialog: 121
dialog: Healy runs over --
text: A BLOOD-covered CHET THE PROJECTIONIST is in the dumpster.
text: Barely moving. Eyes glassy.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Jesus, Chet! Can you hear me? Chet?
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP PARTY - SAME
text: Holly by the elevator, being ignored by the ultra-rich.
text: Something catches her eye:
scene_heading: A DISTRACTINGLY GREEN WALKIE-TALKIE
text: Clipped to someone's BELT. Looks just like the one TALLY had.
text: Holly leaves her position to get a look at the OWNER...
text: Medium height. Compact. Not young; definitely an older guy...
text: He turns -- OH, SHIT. It not an older guy --
dialog: It's the OLDER GUY.
text: His arm in a sling. Pledge to HEALY, forgotten.
text: Holly creeps closer to him, trying to act casual as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - PARTY - SAME
text: JOHN BOY strides quickly up the stairs to the terrace level.
text: Casually wiping something off his hands with a handkerchief.
text: Nearly collides with a party guest. A guy we recognize. Flanked
text: by two BURLY BODYGUARDS. It's Bergen Paulsen, the car company
text: exec from TV. They lock eyes.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: What... What're you doing here..? I can't
dialog: be seen with you.

dialog: The film... It's here.
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: Here!? Just what are we paying you for!?
dialog: You were supposed to take care of it!
text: John Boy fixes him with a dead stare. Unnerving. Says:
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
dialog: I am.
text: Then turns, keeps walking. Looking annoyed now.
text: Reaches into his coat pocket. Takes out a Walkie-Talkie.
dialog: 122
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP PARTY - SAME
text: With OLDER GUY as John Boy's VOICE CRACKLES from the walkie-
dialog: talkie on his belt:
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY (on walkie)
text: The film's in the projector, repeat, in
text: the projector.
text: Older Guy snatches up his radio:
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: What..? We already checked--
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY
text: It's spliced into the other film. Right
dialog: in the middle of it... Go get it.
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: On my way.
text: He clicks off. Stands, all business. Starts to go...
text: But some sixth sense STOPS him. He frowns. Turns:
text: Locks eyes with HOLLY.
text: To date, they've not met. No matter. Recognition flashes
text: between them. She heard. She KNOWS. It's in her eyes.
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: Don't you know it's rude to eavesdrop?
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP PARTY - BAR - SAME
text: MARCH, still sitting at the bar. OLDER GUY and HOLLY step up
text: behind him... OLDER GUY leans down, says in March's ear:
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: I've got a gun pointed at your daughter's
dialog: spine... Come with me.
text: March turns, straightens, a big lop-sided GRIN on face.
text: Oddly? Doesn't seem any too frightened.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: A gun..? Why's that? Hey, Holly?! Your
dialog: buddy here want a drink? They're FREE.
text: Older Guy stops, surprised: This guy's plastered.
text: Holly, somehow, looks less surprised.
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: Let's all just step this way, Mr. March.
dialog: 123
text: He indicates an area behind the Port-a-Johns. Obscure. Empty.
text: Screened by PALM TREES.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hey, if you say so. It's a party, right?
scene_heading: INTERCUT - HEALY DOWNSTAIRS
text: Trying to help Chet. Trying to talk to him at the same time.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Chet, the film? Amelia's film? Where..?
text: Chet's head slumps to one side, against Healy's arm. Giving
text: him a close up view of Healy's watch... He smiles suddenly.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Starts... now...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What..?
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Spliced... in... Starts now...
text: And right at that moment we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. 9TH FLOOR SUITE - PROJECTION ROOM - SAME
text: All is still and quiet in here.
text: THE CAMERA slowly closes in on the projector...
text: As without warning -- CLICK! -- the system jumps to life.
text: The whole thing, running off a TIMER.
dialog: Chet or no Chet -- it's movie time.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - SAME
text: Suddenly all the lights dim. The search lights shut down. And
text: a blast of JAZZY, UP-TEMPO MUSIC fills the air.
text: JOHN BOY goes rigid. Spins. Looking up--
text: THE GIANT SCREEN STARTS TO GLOW
text: Blossoms to life as, below, A THOUSAND HEADS turn as one...
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - NEAR THE EDGE
text: March, WOOZY. Leans on a chair back for support. Older Guy
dialog: shoves HOLLY with the GUN --
dialog: 124
speaker_heading: OLDER GUY
dialog: Okay. This is far enou--
text: STOPS. Frowns. From below, MOVIE MUSIC.
text: What in God's name..? He turns, distracted --
dialog: It's as good a chance as March is gonna get.
text: MARCH'S FACE. Slack. Drunken. Miserable.
text: And then, OUT OF NOWHERE, it transforms--
dialog: If you blinked, you missed it. Suddenly he ain't drunk.
text: Suddenly he looks hard. And grim... And FURIOUS.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: (completely sober voice)
dialog: HOLLY, DUCK!
text: Holly hits the floor as--
text: MARCH SPINS, SLINGS THE CHAIR--!
text: OLDER GUY doesn't react quick enough.
text: THE CHAIR SMASHES him in the face..!
text: And March is still in motion. Spinning -- knife-edged HAND
text: outstretched. CHOPS viciously at the guy's NECK. Once. TWICE.
text: Crushes his trachea, COLLAPSES it.
text: The man stumbles in circles. Fingers go slack. The gun
text: drops. March is on it, instantly --
text: OLDER GUY grabs HOLLY. An iron grip. Gurgling..!
text: March FIRES, BLAM--! From the ground, no hesitation.
text: Blows Older Guy BACK... Toward the looming EDGE.
text: He teeters, starts to go over... Still clutching Holly.
scene_heading: MARCH DOESN'T THINK
text: LUNGES. Sheer desperation. With his good arm, miraculously
text: SLAPS HOLLY BACK onto the ROOF --
text: Sadly, accompanies Older Guy INTO THE SKY.
text: THEY PLUMMET. Holly SCREAMS--!
scene_heading: DOWN. DOWN.
text: Two men. Tumbling... Getting smaller and smaller... Until--
scene_heading: TWO DISTINCT OUTCOMES:
text: March hits the POOL --
text: Older Guy, well... DOESN'T.
dialog: 125
dialog: The result:
scene_heading: March SPLASHES --
dialog: Older Guy sort of... well, POPS.
scene_heading: GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT
text: Men in tuxes, women in gowns: SPACKLED. Older Guy fucking
text: exploded. A woman SCREAMS. BIKINI GIRLS flee the pool --
text: Amazingly, amid the thousand-odd folks, only a handful even
text: notice what happened... A RIPPLE, off to one side.
text: JOHN BOY SEES IT. But doesn't seem all that interested.
text: Calmly starts for the HOTEL; he's got to stop the FILM--
scene_heading: EXT. SECURITY EXIT - SAME
text: The doors burst open. HEALY EMERGES. Scanning the crowd. One
text: hand on the GUN in his pocket. Just in time, as, up above
scene_heading: ON THE GIANT MOVIE SCREEN
text: "Motor City Pride," is abruptly PRE-EMPTED.
text: Clicks. Pops. A few feet of LEADER. And then --
scene_heading: MISTY MOUNTAINS APPEARS, 30 FEET HIGH
text: She looks great. Healy exhales a ragged breath. The film's
text: rolling, the jig's up: HUNDREDS of people, gazing upward --
text: Now ANOTHER ACTOR appears on screen. We HEAR dialogue:
speaker_heading: MALE ACTOR
dialog: I'm Bergen Paulsen! I represent the
dialog: Detroit auto manufacturers!
text: DOWN IN THE COURTYARD
text: The real Bergen Paulsen watches. Thunderstruck:
speaker_heading: BERGEN PAULSEN
dialog: Oh, my God...
scene_heading: JOHN BOY - ODDLY DETACHED
text: Observes the switchover. He's too late.
dialog: Okay, fine. Knows what he has to do.
text: Turns, shoulders back through the crowd. Fishes in his coat.
text: Approaches a poolside LAMBORGHINI, revolving on its pedestal--
text: In passing, calmly rolls a HAND GRENADE underneath it. Keeps
text: walking. Produces an AUTOMATIC, never breaks stride.
dialog: 126
text: Aiming up at the 9th floor.
text: He targets the projector and OPENS FIRE.
scene_heading: INSTANT PANDEMONIUM.
text: People screaming. Scrabbling to get out of his way.
text: He BLOWS A WHOLE CLIP skyward.
text: No good. The film keeps right on playing...
scene_heading: INT. SWIMMING POOL - WITH MARCH
text: MARCH comes to, UNDERWATER. Panicked.
text: THRASHES wildly. God, he's DROWNING--!
scene_heading: OPENS HIS EYES, SEES RICHARD NIXON
text: Swimming beside him. Waving...
text: It barely registers... HE KICKS HIS LEGS--
text: We follow him up... up... out of the blue deep. He breaks
text: the SURFACE. Clutches the CONCRETE. Choking, gasping --
text: A CAR BLOWS APART.
text: Not twenty feet from him.
text: The Lamborghini TEARS ITSELF TO BITS. Bystanders, killed.
text: Ripped by shrapnel. Black oilsmoke FUNNELS SKYWARD.
text: FULL SCALE CHAOS. A thousand people run for their lives.
dialog: Our guys can kill a party like no one's business.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - WITH HOLLY - SAME
text: At roof's edge, HOLLY drops flat. Shouts down:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: DAD..!!
text: SMOKE billows upward. But she spots March...
text: A tiny figure down there. On his KNEES. He waves up at her.
text: She lets out a breath. RELIEVED.
text: Starts to turn away -- something catches her eye. THE FILM.
text: MISTY'S IMAGE starts to shake... Skips... Then, all at once
text: THE SCREEN GOES DARK.
text: Someone just stopped the movie.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Uh-oh.
dialog: 127
scene_heading: WITH MARCH - BELOW
text: Retrieving his fallen gun... He notices it too.
text: Takes a few steps. Staring up...
text: SOMEONE GRABS HIM. He start to recoil--! It's HEALY.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: The film. Let's go.
text: Healy pulls him toward the hotel. March, fighting to KEEP
text: UP. Huffing, wheezing. Two sorry-ass saviors, these.
text: Healy turns to say something -- FREEZES.
text: Focusing past MARCH'S SHOULDER. Eyes wide.
text: JOHN BOY. THEY LOCK EYES.
speaker_heading: HEALY
text: MARCH, ON YOUR NINE.
text: Huh? March spins, whoops, that's his THREE --
text: HEALY doesn't blink. Cross-draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.
text: Through the smoke. JOHN BOY dives, rolls --
scene_heading: FIRES AT MARCH, BAM-BAM-BAM--!
text: Jesus! MARCH DIVES across a sports car...
text: Lunges over the hood. Metal, pocked..! PERFORATED.
text: He LANDS. Shaken. Hugs the vehicle. Safe, ALIVE.
text: HEALY, RELENTLESS. PROWLS THE SMOKE.
text: Gun up. Around him, flame. CARNAGE.
scene_heading: WITH MARCH - HIDING
dialog: Here's the thing: With respect to HIM? The car is stock-
dialog: still. Immobile, and thus good cover. One problem:
text: THE CAR IS REVOLVING
text: And so is MARCH, oblivious.
text: Behind him, scenery keeps changing... He doesn't notice.
text: Raises his gun. Takes a steadying breath.
text: Behind him, JOHN BOY drifts into view... March, eyes closed:
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Okay. You can do this. Ready? One. Tw--
text: BANG--! Blood LEAPS from his arm. March, SHOT.
dialog: 128
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: WOOOOOWWW!! Fuck! Fuck! OW!
text: He looks around. Confused.
text: HEALY targets the muzzle flash. Lays COVER FIRE as MARCH
text: attempts to dive back over the car, and meantime--
scene_heading: INT. PROJECTION ROOM - 9TH FLOOR
text: HOLLY comes bursting through the door:
text: TALLY is here. Nose broken. Looks like shit. THE FILM'S off
text: the projector, she's got it in a canister. Using electrical
text: TAPE to SEAL it. Whirls round, SCISSORS in hand --
scene_heading: AND HOLLY SLIPS
text: On the COFFEE puddle from before. Goes down, SLIDING...
text: IT SAVES HER LIFE
text: As Tally HURLS the scissors, THWACK--! They STICK in the
text: wall. Holly scrambles past her... Snatches the FILM CAN.
speaker_heading: TALLY
dialog: Give me that, you fucked-up little
speaker_heading: HIPPIE!!
text: Advances on Holly. Murderous... With nowhere to run, Holly
dialog: looks Tally right in the eye, says:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Lady, you want it..?
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Go get it.
text: With that, she turns, and rolls the can straight for the
text: balcony RAILING. Tally FREAKS. Lunges after it --
text: Holly TRIPS HER. Down she goes. She SCREAMS. Leading with
text: her face, WHACK! Into the railing. She's done. Holly then
text: watches, mesmerized...
text: As the future of Detroit ROLLS OFF THE EDGE. Into space.
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
text: Everyone looks up, following the sound of Tally's scream.
scene_heading: THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST
text: Arcing through the night.
dialog: 129
text: JOHN BOY, frozen. Tracking its descent... MARCH, crouched
text: behind a car, watching... HEALY, transfixed... CEO BERGEN
text: PAULSEN, HIS BODYGUARDS... all RAPT.
text: It catches the moonlight like a shiny COIN.
text: VANISHES into the billowing SMOKE... Spell, broken:
speaker_heading: PAULSEN
dialog: (to bodyguards)
dialog: Get me that film.
text: And just that quickly, it's a whole new ballgame.
text: Basically? Everyone makes a run for the film.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - THE CHASE IS ON
text: In a split second, everyone's up and running.
text: March STAGGERS, nearly goes down. Beaten, bedraggled. DEAF.
dialog: He should lie down. Instead?
text: For no visible reason, he GALVANIZES.
text: Suddenly he's RUNNING.
text: HEALY appears at his side. They pour it on.
text: Leaping obstacles. Dodging flaming wreckage --
text: JOHN BOY materializes. Ten yards to their right.
speaker_heading: Healy SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: March! Get the film!
text: Then PEELS OFF towards John Boy. FLINGS himself at the guy.
text: They go crashing through tables and furniture.
text: Locked in combat. And meanwhile--
scene_heading: MARCH, STILL RUNNING
text: Up ahead, Bergen Paulsen's BODYGUARDS, sprinting for the
text: film... March is closer.
text: He swoops in at a dead run. Snatches up the film --
text: KEEPS GOING.
text: Just clutches it to his chest and fucking RUNS.
text: BODYGUARDS, pounding after him. He swerves, toward the HOTEL
text: LOBBY. Feet slapping. Breath, sawing in and out.
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: NowayfuckyoufuckYOUNOWAYFUCKYOU.
dialog: 130
text: A BULLET cuts the air like an angry hornet.
text: Hits the GLASS entryway -- COLLAPSES IT.
text: As March LEAPS. Sails through the shattered doors...
text: Lands. Tumbles, HARD -- rolls to his feet, KEEPS GOING.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - HEALY AND JOHN BOY FIGHTING
text: JOHN BOY's got HEALY. He SPINS him -- SLAMS him down onto a
text: GLASS BAR. Shatters it with Healy's FACE.
text: Healy, in trouble.
text: SCRABBLES BEHIND HIM with both arms. Flails at John Boy's coat.
text: Actually jams a hand in his COAT POCKET. Yanks, tugs --
text: Breaks FREE. SPINS back around. Arms up --
text: STOPS. Noticing something. Something in his hand.
text: It's a GRENADE PIN.
text: He just yanked it from John Boy's pocket.
text: He stares at it dumbly. John Boy looks, too.
dialog: Oh, Shit.
text: Healy turns and RUNS. John Boy paws at his coat. Frantic. GIVES
text: UP. Whips it off and FLINGS IT.
scene_heading: NIGHT BECOMES DAY
text: A shattering ROAR. The floor tilts sideways. DEBRIS,
text: showering. Bits of flaming wood--!
scene_heading: JOHN BOY, ROCKED.
text: Blown off his feet. Flung, head over heels --
text: HEALY, blown sideways. Rolls to his feet. ON FIRE. Hurls
text: himself at JOHN BOY, no hesitation, and meanwhile
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - WITH MARCH
text: MARCH bursts forth into the REAR PARKING LOT.
text: Running for his life. Running to SAVE THE FILM.
text: Paulsen's BODYGUARDS, on his tail...
text: Gunshot, a brittle CRACK--! Parts his hair.
text: He jukes left. Out into the STREET and
dialog: WHAM! -- A CAR HITS HIM
dialog: 131
text: Doing maybe 25 miles an hour. Not too fast, but fast enough.
text: Pops him up onto the hood. He SMACKS the windshield.
text: LOSES THE FILM. It slips out of his hands.
text: Starts ROLLING. Away from him. Down the street...
text: The driver gets out, PISSED OFF:
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What the fuck you think you're doing?!
dialog: That's L.A. for you.
text: MARCH, dazed, ignores him. Or maybe he doesn't even hear him.
text: Struggles to his feet. Film, GONE. He dropped it.
text: Where--? There. ROLLING. March is gonna have to CATCH it --
text: BEHIND HIM, OUT OF FOCUS
text: The BODYGUARDS appear. Shove past the irate DRIVER. Knock him
text: on his ass... He starts yelling. An altercation ensues --
speaker_heading: MARCH, OBLIVIOUS
text: Breaks into an awkward, hitching jog... As, behind him,
text: amazingly -- a FULL BLOWN FIGHT ensues. The driver SCREAMING.
text: Then someone FIRES A GUN back there. BLAM--!
text: March doesn't care. Keeps on. Like a kid chasing after a ball.
text: Five feet in front of him... Three feet...
text: MORE GUNFIRE now. The driver firing at the bodyguards. Them
text: firing back. Who knows..? March reaches out. One FINGER...
text: Touches the canister. STOPS it.
text: It wobbles once. Becomes still...
text: He snatches it up. His prize.
text: And promptly collapses.
text: Right in the middle of the road. Falls down. Sits clutching
text: the film. Looking around, addled. Woozy. Breath sawing.
text: There are bodies over there. Flashing lights, too. People
text: moving. The POLICE... March frowns, when did they get here?
dialog: He didn't notice. He's got the film. And meanwhile:
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - SAME
text: HOLLY appears now. Following a trail of destruction.
text: Running, head throbbing. Rounds the side of the hotel --
dialog: 132
text: And there's HEALY. At his feet, flat on the cement:
speaker_heading: JOHN BOY.
text: Healy's got him in a headlock.
text: Meaty forearm, encircling the guy's big bull neck--
text: He's CHOKING him to death.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Holly, get back! Go away!
text: Holly remains. Panting. Fixed on Healy:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: What are you doing?! Stop! Healy stop!
text: Healy doesn't let up. John Boy turning purple in his arms...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Please! You don't have to kill him!
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Yes, I do, Holly! Get away! Now!
text: She refuses to budge. Stares Healy down:
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You don't! You didn't kill that blue-
dialog: faced guy... You didn't kill him.
text: Healy's caught off-guard. Suddenly aware of the lie he told.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Holly... He killed Amelia... He's a
dialog: murderer.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: But you're not. Leave him for the police.
text: Healy, conflicted.
text: The teenager watching him choke a man to death.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Mr. Healy, if you kill this man, I'll
dialog: never speak to you again.
text: Healy stares up at Holly.
text: A long moment... John Boy dying every second of it.
text: Finally, Healy sighs... cautiously disengages himself.
text: As he rolls to one knee, we see that he's HURT. Bleeding.
text: He looms over the fallen John Boy:
dialog: 133
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Congratulations... You owe your life to a
text: sixteen year-old girl.
text: John Boy locks eyes with Holly... Says nothing.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: (raises his arm--)
dialog: Goodnight, John Boy.
text: On the blow to the HEAD we CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: PAUSE. FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: MISTY MOUNTAINS
text: Big as life. Wearing a BLUE PIN-STRIPED SUIT. She sits at a
text: desk, writing. The nameplate on her desk says JUDITH KUTTNER.
text: We hear a KNOCKING off screen. She looks up:
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: Come in.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: A door opens. And a CHEESY LOOKING GUY steps through. He
text: fixes Misty with a stare, then starts to WILDLY OVERACT:
speaker_heading: CHEESY GUY
dialog: I'm Bergen Paulsen! I represent the
dialog: Detroit auto manufacturers! What's this
dialog: about you suing us?!
text: Misty stands up, strikes a sexy pose:
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: You poisoned our precious air! The people
dialog: won't stand for it!
text: Cheesy Guy approaches Misty, tries out his own sexy stance:
speaker_heading: CHEESY GUY
dialog: What if we could come to some kind of
dialog: arrangement, Mrs. Kuttner..? A monetary
dialog: arrangement.
speaker_heading: MISTY
dialog: »-. I don't know... I'd need to know the
dialog: exact amounts you'd pay me -- along with
dialog: the dates and times of payment.
dialog: 134
speaker_heading: CHEESY GUY
dialog: That's no problem... Take off your
dialog: clothes and we'll talk about it.
text: Misty hesitates for a second, then starts to disrobe as a
text: FUNKY GUITAR RIFF kicks in.
text: And now the CAMERA starts to pull back, revealing the edges
dialog: of a MOVIE SCREEN. Back further now--
text: We're inside a courtroom. A closed door, grand jury hearing.
text: Jurors watch the projected film with mounting discomfort.
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME
text: March and Healy sit on a bench in the hallway. March stares at
text: the ground. Healy gazes at the ceiling. They're silent.
text: A door opens down the hall, and the real JUDITH KUTTNER
text: emerges. Flanked by two UNIFORMED OFFICERS.
text: They sit her down on a bench directly opposite our guys.
text: Handcuff her to it. Move off a few paces to stand guard.
text: An awkward silence... Kuttner breaks it.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: I guess you two think you've done
dialog: something here.
dialog: Pause, then:
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: This ain't about what we've done. It's
dialog: about what you did.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: Do you even... have a clue as to what
dialog: just happened?
speaker_heading: MARCH
text: More than a clue.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: I stepped out of line..? That it? Took
dialog: money for personal gain..?
dialog: They say nothing.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: I didn't want that money. It wasn't some
dialog: "plan" I had. Do you get that? There's a
dialog: protocol. I followed it.
dialog: 135
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: What does that even mean?
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: You think you're gonna bring down the car
dialog: companies? Start a revolution? What age
dialog: are you two living in?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Detroit can't be allowed to fail. It's as
dialog: simple as that... They'd take the whole
dialog: country down with them.
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: I was acting in the national interest.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: And your daughter? What about her
dialog: interests?
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: (blinks)
dialog: «+. I tried to save her.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: You had her killed.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: (flash of anger)
dialog: I did no such thing! Detroit had her
dialog: killed! I wanted her safe -- why do you
dialog: think I hired you?
dialog: (beat, calm again)
dialog: I tried to save her from herself.
text: Her composure, restored. It's downright creepy.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You're going to jail, Mrs. Kuttner. Where
dialog: you belong.
text: A pause. She regards both of them for a moment, then says:
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: I am going to jail... But it won't make a
dialog: difference.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Whatever happens, Detroit won't be held
dialog: accountable. If I'm not there to take
dialog: care of it, so someone else will.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah..? We'll see.
speaker_heading: KUTTNER
dialog: Yes. You will, Mr. March.
dialog: 136
text: She leans back as the courtroom doors burst open, people
text: start to file out. A lawyer walks past March and Healy:
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: We're getting you in, right after lunch.
text: He gives them the thumbs up, walks on past.
text: March and Healy stare across at Kuttner... Lost in thought.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A RINGING BELL
text: WIDER - It's a CHRISTMAS BELL. Guy in a SANTA COSTUME stands on
text: a street corner ringing it... Apparently it's Christmastime.
text: A CAR pulls up next to Santa. Healy gets out. Starts down the
text: sidewalk. In a bit of a hurry. Ducks into a restaurant--
scene_heading: INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT - SAME
text: A hostess approaches Healy, he waves her off.
text: Spots HOLLY sitting by herself at a table. Walks over to her.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Where do you think? He's at the bar.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I guess he heard.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, boy, did he ever.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: See if you can do something with him,
dialog: ‘cuz I sure can't.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I'll try...
scene_heading: INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT - BAR - SAME
text: MARCH, folded across the bar like a man clutching a life raft.
text: Soused... Healy appears, takes the seat next to him.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Healy..? What are you--
dialog: (squints)
dialog: Holly call you..?
text: Healy just nods.
dialog: 137
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Ah... Guess you're here to tell me what
dialog: an asshole I am for having a little
dialog: drink, huh?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Not today I'm not.
text: He signals the bartender.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Scotch, please.
text: March regards his friend with drunken incredulity...
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: ... So, you saw it, on the TV--
text: March points at the black and white suspended behind the bar.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I saw.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: They're lettin 'em off... The car
dialog: companies... Scott free...
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Not enough evidence... So they say...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I saw.
text: The bartender sets a drink in front of Healy. His first
text: drink in five years. He looks down at it, considering...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Look... Maybe they got away with it this
dialog: time... Thing is, people are stupid, but
dialog: they aren't that stupid--
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: If you say so...
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: I say so... These guys are going down. In
dialog: ten years, we're all gonna be driving
dialog: electric cars from Japan. So fuck ‘em,
dialog: you know?
text: March thinks for a moment... Slowly starts to nod.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Yeah... Fuck ‘em.
dialog: 138
text: Healy raises his drink in a toast. March follows suit.
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: For the birds.
speaker_heading: MARCH
dialog: Hallelujah.
text: They drink. March looks down. Sees a BEE crawling on the
text: bar. He takes a napkin. MASHES it.
text: CUT TO BLACK. THE END.
dialog:
