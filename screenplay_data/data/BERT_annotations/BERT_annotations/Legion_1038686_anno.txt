scene_heading: THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
text: Vast. Barren. No signs of life.
text: A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains. The
text: unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold.
text: A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE. Solemn. Weary. Determined.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: When I was a little girl, my mother
dialog: would remind me each night before
dialog: bed to be sure to open my heart to
dialog: God, for he was kind, merciful and
dialog: just. Things changed after my
dialog: father left a few years later,
dialog: leaving her to raise me and my
dialog: brothers alone in a little place
text: out on the edge of the Mojave
dialog: Desert. She never talked about a
dialog: kind and merciful God again.
dialog: Instead she spoke of a prophecy.
dialog: Of a time when all the world would
dialog: be covered in darkness and the fate
dialog: of Mankind would be decided. One
dialog: night I finally got up the courage
dialog: to ask my mother why God had
dialog: changed, why was he mad at his
dialog: children. "I don't know," she
text: said, tucking the covers around me,
dialog: "I guess he just got tired of all
dialog: the bullshit."
text: And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED
dialog: OUT, leaving us in:
text: DARKNESS...
text: A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS
text: SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS.
text: TITLE: "Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m."
dialog: 
scene_heading: A BLOOD RED MOON
text: reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the
text: smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice
text: something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,
dialog: coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!
speaker_heading: TWO BLACK BOOTS
dialog: land hard in the water...and we're in:
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT
text: A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
text: pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly
text: he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have
text: been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,
text: deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a
dialog: fight.
dialog: His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.
text: He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick
text: walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?
text: A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down. Seems
dialog: to motivate him.
text: Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
text: toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in
text: time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,
text: SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.
text: He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash
text: dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
dialog: past.
text: Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a
text: MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.
text: Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor
dialog: sharp.
text: Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare
text: chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK
text: TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.
text: As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK
text: WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,
dialog: and then...
text: ...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO
text: WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
text: The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.
text: The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.
text: A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...
text: ...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...
text: ...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
text: ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...
text: CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,
text: SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out
text: of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront
text: across the street.
dialog: "GUN &amp; SPORT WORLD"
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GUN &amp; SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists. Quiet except for the
text: sound of RAIN, then...
text: SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a
text: shower of glass.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GUN &amp; SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.
text: His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
text: fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.
text: His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
text: shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is
dialog: a living book. But the writing is in no language we
dialog: recognize.
text: He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
text: OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.
scene_heading: FRESH. BLOODY.
text: He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,
text: and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the
text: cement floor around his feet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GUN &amp; SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the
text: ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,
text: his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life
dialog: for this.
text: Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
text: Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.
text: Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit. Stops cold.
text: The place is locked up tight. Metal gate over the front
text: doors, bars over the windows. How the hell's he going to get
dialog: out of here?
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME
text: Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's
text: BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.
text: The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY. Busy night.
text: Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a
text: deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the
dialog: streetwalkers.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: Goddamn' animals. Nights like this
dialog: I wish I could take a match to this
dialog: city just so I could watch all
dialog: these motherfuckers burn.
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?
text: Burton doesn't even smile. He's dead fucking serious.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: A fresh start. That's what this
dialog: place needs.
text: He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people
text: they pass, picking them off one by one.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: Pow! Pow! Pow!
text: Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh. Estevez eyes his
text: partner, wary.
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ
dialog: Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so
dialog: happy we get to share beautiful
dialog: moments like this. They really
dialog: brighten my da--
text: KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE
text: just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.
text: Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time
dialog: to see...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GUN &amp; SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS
text: Michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly
text: out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ (O.S.)
dialog: Freeze!
text: Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car,
text: crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael.
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ
dialog: Drop the bags! Hands on your head!
text: In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO
text: CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE.
dialog: "Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!"
text: The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (sensing their unease:)
dialog: It's starting. There isn't much
dialog: time.
text: The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what
text: the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: Shut the fuck up and drop the bags
dialog: now!
text: Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ
dialog: Hands on your head! On your head!
text: Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
text: Michael slowly turns around. Calm.
text: Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,
text: FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible
dialog: decision made.
text: And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!
text: In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him
text: helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's
text: Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off
dialog: with Burton.
text: Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: Let `em go!
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ
dialog: Take the shot, Burton!
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--
text: Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his
text: throat like a skipping record.
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ
dialog: Burton!?
text: THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the
dialog: confusion.
text: Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY
text: QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive
text: pressure were building inside him.
text: And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH
text: BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE
speaker_heading: CLOWN!
text: His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully
dialog: in control.
text: Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice
text: GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: What are you doing, Michael? These
dialog: weren't your orders.
text: Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ
dialog: What did you say?
text: Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm following my own orders now.
speaker_heading: BURTON
dialog: Then you will die along with the
dialog: child.
speaker_heading: ESTEVEZ
dialog: Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
text: BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops,
text: leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's
text: faster, already FIRING back.
text: Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH! The squad car window
text: SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing.
text: Smoke rising from his gun.
text: With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags
text: and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car.
text: He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the
text: FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a
text: wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS)
text: Bolts awake. Breathing hard. Covered with sweat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN
text: Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped
text: bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got
text: shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN
text: A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the
text: eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the
text: trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in
text: decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the
text: trailers roof lines, marking the season.
text: One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily
text: out into the cool western morning. Home.
text: Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a
text: two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that
text: Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.
text: Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign
text: glows like a beacon in the darkness:
scene_heading: "PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB"
text: A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (O.S.)
dialog: You okay, Jeep?
text: Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about
text: twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep
text: from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's
text: strikingly beautiful.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Sorry to wake you, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (stepping out of the
text: trailer, hands on her
speaker_heading: BELLY)
dialog: Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a
dialog: storm all night. Must know
dialog: somethin' I don't.
text: She approaches Jeep. Sees the strain in his eyes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Another bad dream?
text: He struggles for a moment, nods.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's just stress, Jeep, that's all.
dialog: You do too much worryin'. About
dialog: this place. About your dad.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: About me...
text: A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: You're the only thing I like
dialog: worrying about.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: See what I mean? You're worried
dialog: about a girl eight months pregnant
dialog: and it isn't even your baby. Now
dialog: that's enough to give anybody
dialog: nightmares.
text: Jeep turns away, dejected.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Go ahead, make fun of me.
dialog: Everybody else does.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (turns him back around)
dialog: C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You
dialog: know how much I appreciate
dialog: everything you and Bob are doing
dialog: for me, but a month from now, this
dialog: baby'll have a new family and I'll
dialog: have to start thinkin' about what
dialog: the hell I'm doin' with my life.
dialog: This is not news Jeep wants to hear.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: So you're still going through with
dialog: it...?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama.
dialog: Christ, I can barely take care of
dialog: myself as it is.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: I could help you. We could do it
dialog: together, you know? I want to.
text: Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but
text: this just isn't where she's at.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You gotta stop carryin' the weight
dialog: of the world on your shoulders.
text: Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (rubbing her arms)
dialog: Now can we go back in? I'm
dialog: freezing my ass off out here.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Go on. I'll be right there.
text: Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the
text: trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the
text: clank of the door, she's gone.
text: And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of
scene_heading: FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.
speaker_heading: JIMMY STEWART (V.O.)
dialog: I don't know whether I like it very
text: much being seen around with an
dialog: angel without any wings.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV
text: Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his
text: guardian angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in
text: and out. We hear a WHACK, which causes the image to
text: momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE (ON TV)
dialog: Oh, I've got to earn them and
dialog: you'll help me, won't you?
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY
dialog: BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine
text: roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in
text: the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.
text: The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm
dialog: you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old
text: plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and
text: tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded
text: diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off
dialog: the Shopping Network.
text: Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an
text: ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine
text: stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.
dialog: You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer
dialog: drinker.
text: Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is
text: cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed
dialog: dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when
dialog: your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK. The
text: dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's
text: hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Lord as my witness, Bob, one of
dialog: these days that thing's gonna hit
dialog: you back.
speaker_heading: WHACK!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We
dialog: got a special relationship here.
speaker_heading: WHACK!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Yeah, they got names for that kind
dialog: a relationship.
text: The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the
text: MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE".
text: A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair
text: and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the
text: jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling
text: as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that
dialog: really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a
text: billboard of rebellion.
speaker_heading: SANDRA (O.S.)
dialog: It's disgusting.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOWARD (O.S.)
dialog: You're right. It is disgusting.
text: Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the
text: diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA
text: and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Really, how can she go out in
dialog: public wearing that?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I don't know. Why don't we just
dialog: ask her?
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Howard, don't. You'll embarrass
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (shouting across the
speaker_heading: DINER)
dialog: Audrey, honey? Your mother was
dialog: wondering if you got dressed this
dialog: morning with the specific intention
dialog: of showing your ass off to the
dialog: entire world?
text: The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard
text: with a caustic smile.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping
dialog: to get double teamed by a couple of
text: meth head truckers in the bathroom
dialog: of some desert shithole.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Good thing we stopped here.
text: And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches
text: the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it.
text: Howard turns back to his wife. Rigid smile.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I feel satisfied with that answer.
dialog: I really do.
text: Sandra buries her face in her hands.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: I'm being punished for something, I
dialog: know it.
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the
text: music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT
text: The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through
dialog: this barren country.
text: A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path. HEAVY BEATS thunder
dialog: from within.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS
text: The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS
text: (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad
dialog: boy.
text: He passes a weathered road sign:
scene_heading: "ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES"
text: Kyle's expression says this is not good news.
text: He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat. No signal.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Shit...
text: He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
text: The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the
text: lonely row of old gas pumps.
text: Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in
dialog: the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.
text: Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and
text: rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the
text: SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.
text: The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK
text: parked in front of the garage with its hood up.
text: Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and
text: flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around.
dialog: Which way is north?
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Darren, your fuckin' directions
dialog: suck, man.
text: He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way
text: out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in
text: search of a pay phone.
text: The good news is that he finds one. The bad news is that
dialog: it's been broken for ten years.
text: Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing
text: a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her
text: very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look
text: is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name
text: tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hey...
text: She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You know that shit right there
dialog: ain't good for the baby.
text: She lets out a long slow exhale.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Guess I should think `bout quittin'
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Now hold on, girl, let me bum one
dialog: before you do.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can buy a whole pack inside.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Tell ya what. You let me have one
dialog: of yours, and I'll give you two
dialog: from the new pack you're gonna sell
dialog: me.
text: She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette.
text: Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle
text: takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Am I in the right place?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (peers at the map)
dialog: Only if nowhere's right, `cause
dialog: that's where you are.
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Sonuvabitch. There another phone
dialog: around here? You know, one that
dialog: works?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Bob'll probably let you use the
dialog: diner phone if you ask him real
dialog: nice...And pay `im somethin'.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I can handle that. You got
dialog: pancakes here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for
dialog: three seventy-five. We also got
dialog: french toast for four dollars if
dialog: you're into that. I personally
dialog: like the pancakes though.
speaker_heading: JEEP (O.S.)
dialog: You okay, Charlie?
text: They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing
text: mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie
text: quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just
dialog: lost.
text: Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he
text: shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette
text: back up to her lips. An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Three seventy-five, huh?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY
text: The DOOR JINGLES. Charlie and Kyle enter.
text: Audrey's eyes light up when she sees Kyle. He notices her as
text: well. How couldn't he? She's directing every ounce of sex
text: appeal she has in his direction.
text: Her parents, on the other hand, shoot a look of utter fear in
text: Kyle's direction, as if he personified their worst suburban
dialog: nightmare.
text: Charlie heads to the register. Digs out a fresh pack of
text: smokes from underneath the counter.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I hope Salem Lights are okay,
dialog: `cause that's all we got left.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
dialog: Where ya been, Charlie?
text: Bob steps off the chair.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: This ain't a resort you know. I
dialog: got orders stacking up here.
dialog: In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it
dialog: certainly makes Bob feel better to say it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (sees the two cigarettes
dialog: Kyle's handing her)
dialog: You best not be smokin' again. Not
dialog: in your condition.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (gestures to the diner)
dialog: Bob, do you see where am I right
dialog: now? Can my condition really get
dialog: any worse? `Sides, you ain't one
dialog: to talk.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What? I quit two years ago.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, so why you still carryin'
dialog: that fancy lighter `round for?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It was a gift from my ex-wife,
dialog: alright? I'm sentimental. I don't
dialog: wanna forget how much I hate her
dialog: guts.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hey man?
text: Bob turns to Kyle. Doesn't like what he sees.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Can I use your phone? My cell
dialog: doesn't get a signal out here and
text: the pay phone outside is busted.

speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Any news about when our truck might

dialog: have us on the road two hours ago.
dialog: The rate we're going, we'll be

text: Jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a
text: workbench. There's an unsettling intensity in his eyes, as
dialog: if fear itself were driving him.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Leonardo...!
text: Jeep freezes, knows he's in trouble He reluctantly turns to
text: see his father standing next to the Anderson's broken-down
dialog: Uhual.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The fact that this truck's hood's
dialog: up mean anything to you?
text: Jeep stares at the ground. Couldn't be anymore
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: BOB
text: (approaches, peering past

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: Whaddya workin' on that's so
dialog: goddamn important you're not doin'

speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Nothin'...
text: Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails.
text: Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Found it under a bunch of stuff in

dialog: like to throw anything away...
text: Bob considers him, softens.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Whaddya doin'?
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I
dialog: think it's real good of you to lend

dialog: your responsibility.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: (heard this before, pushes
dialog: past him)
dialog: Oh whatever, leave me alone.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't walk away from me while I'm

scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How long you gonna follow her

speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Don't say that about her! She's
dialog: not like that!

dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bob gives Jeep a hard stare. Yeah, she is.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You really think she's gonna stick

speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Look, I know it doesn't make any

speaker_heading: BOB
text: (points up at the PARADISE
speaker_heading: FALLS sign)
dialog: See that up there? Your mother
dialog: thought I was crazy for wanting to
dialog: buy this place, middle of
dialog: nowhere...But I just knew this was
dialog: what I was supposed to do. Told
dialog: your mom, "just wait." Told her
dialog: when they finally ran the freeway
dialog: through here like they were
dialog: plannin' on, this place would be
dialog: like Grand Central Station.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But I was wrong. The freeway never
dialog: came and now the only people who
dialog: ever stop here are the ones who are
dialog: lost.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And your mom? Well she got tired
dialog: of waitin'.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: C'mon Dad. You can't blame
dialog: yourself for what she did--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're
dialog: about to make the same damn mistake
dialog: I made, believing in something
dialog: that's never gonna happen...Or
dialog: someone.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's time for you to move on from

dialog: tough pill to swallow.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Now get to work on that truck. I
dialog: wanna have these people on the road
text: by nightfall.
text: Bob walks back into the diner.
text: Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices
text: something off in the distance.
text: Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a
text: living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north.
text: Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the
text: distant mountains. A storm is coming.

text: Kyle is about to address him again, when something else
text: steals Bob's attention.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (holding up a silencing
speaker_heading: HAND)
dialog: Yeah, wait a minute.
text: The TV has gone on the fritz again. Only now the image is
dialog: mostly snow.
text: Bob climbs back onto the chair. Faces the TV.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What's wrong with you today?
speaker_heading: WHACK!
text: The image flickers but doesn't improve.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: I told you to get the satellite TV.
dialog: But you don't wanna listen.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What the hell do I need that crap
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: History Channel, man!
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I got all the history I can take.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's for sure.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What's your problem now?
speaker_heading: WHACK!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where do I start?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You know this was the top-of-the-
dialog: line model when I bought it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, in the Fifties.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You shouldn't be watchin' anyways.
dialog: (rubs his hands together)
dialog: Okay, baby, this is gonna do it.
text: Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK!
text: And the picture snaps into FOCUS. Only it isn't the picture
dialog: he was expecting.
text: The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and
text: its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner.
text: Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: See? Clear as day.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Nice work, Bob. What the hell's
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's just one of those test things.
dialog: That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the
dialog: screen, which read:
dialog: "THIS IS NOT A TEST"
text: Bob switches the channels. All the same.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't look like a test.
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the TV as
text: if a little distance will bring some clarity. He bumps into
dialog: Kyle.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yo, am I the Invisible
dialog: motherfuckin' Man here? Do you
dialog: have a phone or not?
text: Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH.
text: That gets Bob's attention. Bob snaps the money out of his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: In the back past the kitchen. Make
dialog: it fast.
text: Kyle hustles passed Percy.
text: Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes.
text: Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: If there's a real emergency aren't
dialog: they supposed to give us some
dialog: information about what to do?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: I'm sure it's a mistake.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey, Percy, give that old radio of
dialog: yours a shot. Maybe they got some
dialog: news about the TV.
text: Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf.
text: Switches it on.
text: STATIC. He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal.
text: The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting. Station
dialog: after station the same thing.
text: The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW
text: TONES. Everyone goes very still.
speaker_heading: KYLE (V.O.)
dialog: Let me talk to him...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER - BACK OFFICE - SAME
text: Kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back
text: office, phone to his ear.
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Cuz a father should be able to talk
dialog: to his son, that's why. Now put
text: `im on the phone.
dialog: (a beat then a smile)
dialog: Is that my little man...? Yeah,
dialog: well I'm working hard, so that I
dialog: can be with you. You bein' good?
dialog: (strange STATIC can be
speaker_heading: HEARD)
dialog: Wait... You're breakin' up.
dialog: Hello...?
dialog: (hangs up in frustration)
dialog: Shit!
text: Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial.
text: Frowns. No dial tone.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What the hell...
text: He keeps trying. Nothing.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe there was an earthquake?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER - SAME
text: Everyone is looking at Howard.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: They keep sayin' we're overdue for
dialog: a big one.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Lot a folks could be hurt.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Not if it was centered in the
dialog: desert.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Exactly. Could be nothing to worry
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: So then why's the TV out?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Maybe it just hit the relay
dialog: stations. Aren't those usually in
dialog: remote areas?
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, `cause of the radiation they
dialog: give off.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: There ain't no radiation comin'
dialog: from those things. Plus that don't
dialog: explain the radio being out too.
dialog: Some of those stations broadcast
text: over hundreds of miles. Any quake
dialog: that big and we would a felt it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Percy's right. I didn't feel
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Maybe it's a terrorist attack or
dialog: something...?
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: (covers her mouth)
dialog: Oh god...
dialog: Everyone considers that grimly, then:
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, for cryin' out loud. There's
dialog: no use in speculating. I'll just
dialog: call my brother up in Needles. He
dialog: must a heard something.
speaker_heading: KYLE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't think so.
text: Kyle has reappeared in the diner.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Whaddya talkin' about?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Phone's dead. Just tried to make a
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're shittin' me.
text: Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Oh, this is just great.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to
dialog: get excited about. Probably just
text: working on the lines.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: Sides, I'm sure Jeep'll have your

scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: Jeep is buried under the Uhaul's hood, working at something
text: with a socket wrench. It's not going well.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Damn it!
text: He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands. The
text: sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention.
text: He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off
text: the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery
text: how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that
dialog: windshield.
text: After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN
text: ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal
text: frame and wheels of a walker.
text: The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on
text: the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner
text: with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches
text: her disappear inside.
text: He then looks toward the horizon again. The WALL OF DARK
text: CLOUDS are growing ever closer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
text: A JINGLE as the old lady enters. She surveys the scene as if
text: feasting on paradise. Maybe her eyes aren't so good.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Have a seat wherever you want,
text: Ma'am. Specials are on the board.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Thank you, dear.
text: The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons.
text: She smiles at them pleasantly.
text: Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Oh, I already know what I want.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, what'll it be?
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: I'll have the steak, please.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And how'd you like that cooked?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Rare if you would. And water, no
dialog: ice.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Coming right up.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Charlie, is it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: What an unusual name for a girl.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So they say. I'll be right back
dialog: with your water.
text: The old lady turns to the Andersons.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm
dialog: Sandra and this is my husband
dialog: Howard.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: What a nice young couple you are.
dialog: What brings you out to these parts?
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: We're moving out to Scottsdale.
dialog: But our truck broke down, and so
dialog: we're stuck here while it's being
dialog: fixed.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Oh, what a nuisance.
text: A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head. She doesn't seem
dialog: to notice it.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are
dialog: down around here. The phone and
dialog: TV, you know?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDRA (cont'd)
dialog: And I just was wondering if you
dialog: might have heard something on your
dialog: way up? You know, about what's
dialog: going on?
text: Gladys smiles strangely.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Oh, don't worry yourself about
dialog: that, sweetheart. It'll all be
dialog: over soon.
text: Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that
dialog: response.
text: The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S
text: FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the
dialog: least.
text: Howard and Sandra exchange looks. Creepy.
text: The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a
text: quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one
text: eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the
dialog: Andersons. Something about her...
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: The carburetor's shot. Don't know
dialog: why. Looks brand new.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: (glances over at the
speaker_heading: ANDERSONS)
dialog: Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: I could try to rebuild it, but it'd
dialog: take a while, and I don't think we
dialog: have all the parts. If we call
dialog: right now, we might be able to get
dialog: a new one down here tomorrow
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's not gonna happen. Goddamn
dialog: phone's out.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: What?
text: Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front
dialog: of Gladys.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Thank you, dear. How far along are
dialog: you?
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Charlie rests a hand on her belly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just about there.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: The father must be very proud.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I wouldn't know.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: You mean he's...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Out of sight. Out of mind.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Oh, I see. So you're not married,
dialog: I take it?
text: A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it
text: away. But another one lands in its place.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nope.
text: Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real
dialog: ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady. More
text: FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food.
text: Charlie is still trying to wave them away.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: That's too bad.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I prefer it that way. I don't
dialog: a need a man tellin' me what to do.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: But what about the baby?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I've got it under control.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Yeah, but it's gonna burn.
text: Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well. Kyle
text: glances over from the counter.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What did you just say?
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: (all smiles)
dialog: I said your fucking baby's gonna
dialog: burn.
text: Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Go to hell, lady.
text: She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward
text: the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Total fucking Jesus freak.
text: Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour
text: her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are
dialog: swarming now. How did so many get in here?
text: Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of
dialog: events.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: All those babies. They're gonna
dialog: burn.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Gladys, please. There's no reason
dialog: to --
text: Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt!
dialog: All you do is complain! Complain!
dialog: Complain!
text: Sandra covers her mouth in shock. Everybody in the diner is
text: now focused on the old lady.
text: Howard gets up from the booth.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Howard, it's okay! Don't listen to
dialog: her!
text: But Howard's already standing over Gladys.
speaker_heading: HOWARD

scene_heading: RAZOR SHARP TEETH.
text: EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor.
text: Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over. Blood
text: covers her face and chest.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: You're all going to fucking die!
text: Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he
text: whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head
text: sideways. THWACK!
text: BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK. Impossibly, Gladys is
text: still standing.
text: She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE
text: DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake.
text: Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't move!
text: But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING
text: WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB!
text: Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast,
text: as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --
speaker_heading: UPSIDE DOWN!
text: BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't
text: track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in

text: Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (struggles to cock the
speaker_heading: GUN)
dialog: Fuck!
text: Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE
speaker_heading: ROOM!
text: The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He
text: snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Shoot her, Jeep!
text: Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: (a sickly sweet smile)
dialog: You'll never save her.
text: Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear
text: paralyzing him where he stands.
speaker_heading: PERCY
text: SHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH!
text: Gladys rockets straight at him!
text: But Jeep's too afraid to move. He clamps his eyes shut,
text: bracing himself for the end.
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an
dialog: animal.
text: Jeep slowly opens his eyes. His gun's still cocked.
text: Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet.
text: He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his
text: silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so
dialog: shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing
dialog: such serious heat.
speaker_heading: SANDRA (O.S.)
dialog: Somebody help me!
text: Sandra is on the floor with her husband. Blood pours freely
text: from his neck.
text: Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation --
text: then he rushes to help.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Press your hands over the hole!
text: Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Don't look at me like that, lady!
dialog: I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you!
dialog: Now put your goddamn hands over the
dialog: hole before your husband bleeds to
dialog: death!
text: Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck,
text: desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out
text: between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid
text: kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The fuck was that?! What the fuck

text: Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her

dialog: froze. I saw what I needed to do,
dialog: but I was afraid...
dialog: (breaks down)
dialog: She could've killed you!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEEP (cont'd)
dialog: Or Charlie...She would've killed me
dialog: if it wasn't for...
text: He can't get the words out. Bob rests a hand on his boy's
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: There's nothin' to be ashamed of,
dialog: Jeep.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Not everybody can play the hero.
text: Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front
speaker_heading: DOOR JINGLE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
text: Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and
text: Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling,
text: gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help.
text: Percy races for the back.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (catching Percy by the
speaker_heading: ARM)
dialog: Where you going?!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: To get my bible!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The hell you need that for?!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Well somebody's gotta start
dialog: prayin'...
text: Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING.
text: Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the
scene_heading: SOLID UNDULATING BLACK CURTAIN OF FLIES SURROUNDING THE TRUCK
text: STOP'S PERIMETER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OUT.
text: Everything in the diner is suddenly cast in DARK RED as the
text: day's remaining sunlight filters through the swarm.
dialog: Apocalyptic.
text: No one breathes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A BLACK HAND AND A HOOK TEAR A SHIRT OPEN
text: Revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to
dialog: the bone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: Percy and Charlie are tending to Howard. Sandra is holding
text: her husband's hand, trying to comfort him, while Audrey
text: watches from a distance with grim fascination.
speaker_heading: PERCY
text: (raises a bottle of
speaker_heading: ALCOHOL)
dialog: Okay, hold `em steady.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (nods, peakish, to
speaker_heading: HERSELF)
dialog: Oh god, please don't throw up.
text: Howard writhes as Percy pours alcohol on the wound.
text: Sandra can't help but stare at Percy's hook.
text: Meanwhile across the diner, Bob and Jeep peel back the
text: tablecloth to examine Gladys' bullet riddled corpse. Kyle
text: stands over them with Bob's shotgun trained on the body --
dialog: just in case.
text: Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse angles
text: from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from
text: Percy's frying pan.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: She's cold as a freakin' ice cube.
dialog: If I hadn't just seen her walk in
dialog: here, I'd say the old bag's been
dialog: dead for hours.
text: Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged
text: mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Well, I don't care how long she's
dialog: been dead, the bitch ain't stayin'
dialog: in here with us.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the
text: plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily
text: eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't get it. Why don't they
dialog: come closer?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: How the fuck am I supposed to know,
dialog: man? You askin' me to explain the
dialog: behavior of a motherfuckin'
text: pestilence.
text: A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped
text: to the ground.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: (holding up the keys)
dialog: You guys!
dialog: 
scene_heading: GLADYS' CUTLASS SUPREME
text: Its windows are completely caked with dust. The men WIPE
text: AWAY a layer of brown from the glass, allowing them to peer
text: inside the car.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You see anything?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No Twilight Zone shit if that's
dialog: what you mean.
text: Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door. Unlocks it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Careful. Old lady could have some
text: kind of rabid poodle locked up in
dialog: there.
text: Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell
text: hits them.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Agh! What the fuck is that?
text: Bob covers his nose.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jesus.
text: Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in. Dark, dirty. But
dialog: nothing unusual.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Nothin' here.
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: How `bout the trunk?
text: They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR. Jeep slips the key
dialog: in.
text: The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS. ROTTING.
scene_heading: MAGGOT INFESTED.
text: Bob quickly slams the trunk closed. The guys are reeling
dialog: with disgust.
text: Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats
dialog: in her hoopty! What the fuck is
dialog: wrong with white people?!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Least now we know where that smell
dialog: was coming from.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin'
dialog: necessity we figured that out, man.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: (sees something up the
speaker_heading: ROAD)
dialog: Hey...
text: They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze.
text: A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild
text: stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust
text: clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug
text: splattered windows.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Okay, now we're talkin'.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Wait a minute. Check it out. It's
dialog: LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way
dialog: out here?
text: Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I'm from Nevada, man.
text: They consider the police car a moment more. See the
text: SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS.
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Give me the shotgun.
text: Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, thank God, the police!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
text: The door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the
dialog: diner.
text: The three men see her moving toward the car. Jeep's face
text: goes slack.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Charlie, wait!
text: The men begin to run toward her...
text: While out of the police car steps...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those
text: piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her,
text: as if she was exactly who he expected to see.
text: In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in
text: front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Take one step closer and I'll drop
dialog: you right here.
text: A long beat as Michael considers Bob. Icy cold.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That how you greet all your
dialog: customers?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mister, after what we've been
dialog: through here today, you're lucky we
dialog: didn't shoot you first and greet
dialog: you later. Now let me see your
dialog: teeth.
text: Michael stares at him blankly.
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Your teeth goddamn it! Lemme see
dialog: `em!
text: Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well
text: kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others
dialog: ease slightly.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: No, shark teeth, Pop.
text: Bob lowers the gun.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Okay... Suppose you tell us your
dialog: name then.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sorry about all that, Michael.
dialog: This old lady just went crazy
dialog: inside my place here. She had
dialog: these teeth. Never seen anything
text: like `em. Practically bit a man in
dialog: half.
text: Michael remains silent. Doesn't seemed shocked in the least
dialog: by what he's heard.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So what are you doin' out here?
dialog: Gotta say you don't exactly look
text: like a police officer. Even one
dialog: from L.A. Then again, you have to
dialog: be, right? I mean, who the hell'd
dialog: be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
text: Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in
text: kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the
dialog: shotgun again.
text: Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to
text: the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic
text: table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You don't know, do you?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Know what?
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We don't know anything. Nothing's
dialog: working here. The TV, the radio,
dialog: the phone...
text: Michael just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm running out of time.
text: Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob
text: blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Back off, fella...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Now, I don't care if this is the
dialog: second coming of Jesus fucking
dialog: Christ, I say it's time for you to
dialog: either get talkin' or get the hell
dialog: outta here!
text: In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob's
text: hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find
text: himself holding air.
text: He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun
text: pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Easy! Easy!
text: Michael's expression is totally calm. Merciless.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry.
dialog: Tell `em you were only kidding!
text: But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared. He squeezes his
text: eyes closed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let `em go!
text: Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction.
dialog: Considering her.
text: The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand
text: and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra
dialog: and Audrey.
text: Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna
dialog: go spillin' blood for no good
dialog: reason in front of all these decent
dialog: people, do ya? Our friend Bob here
dialog: ain't worth the trouble it'd cause
dialog: ya.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So whaddya say `bout just lettin'
dialog: `im go and then you can be on your
dialog: way? Nice `n' easy.
text: But Michael doesn't seem to register this plea. It's not
dialog: looking good.
text: No one BREATHES. That's when Kyle notices something out in
text: the direction of the road.
text: DOZENS OF TINY HEADLIGHTS APPEARING IN THE DARK HAZE.
text: APPROACHING.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What the--?
text: Michael turns, sees the lights.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: They're here.
text: Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it
text: back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun,
text: speechless.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're going to need this.
text: Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser.
text: Pops it, revealing a staggering ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY.
text: HE BEGINS TO LOAD GUN AFTER GUN.
text: Percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Lord, have mercy.
dialog: (waving back Audrey and
speaker_heading: SANDRA)
dialog: You ladies best get back inside.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: What is it? What's happening? Who
dialog: is this man? Why's he driving a
dialog: police car?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Shut up, mom!
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Audrey pulls her mother back into the diner.
text: Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle. Another one
text: goes to Percy. Finally he places a third one in Jeep's
text: hands, who stares down at it anxiously.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wait. I don't think that's such a
dialog: good idea.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Dad, I can handle it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Michael)
dialog: He's just a kid --
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: I said, I can handle it!
text: Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He can handle it. He doesn't have
dialog: a choice.
text: Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked
text: everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the
text: men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: If you want to live, you'll do
dialog: exactly as I say.
text: He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie. He cocks a
text: Glock and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: When you fire, you keep your thumb
dialog: off the slide. Don't hesitate.
dialog: Don't do anything brave. There's
dialog: no safety.
text: He gives her a hard look. She nods nervously. Trusting him
dialog: but not sure why.
text: Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the
text: others, then he bolts after Michael.
text: Percy follows. Then Charlie.
text: Now it's only Jeep and his father left.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And Bob rushes into the diner.
text: A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road.
text: THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER. CLOSER.
text: He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Fuck it.
text: And races after his father.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A DEAD BOLT
text: Thrown. Locking the diner door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
text: Frantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of
text: the door, sealing off the entrance.
text: Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields.
text: Window blinds are snap closed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Jeep races in, locks the back door. Then he pushes a desk in
text: front of it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS
text: The place is transformed. Locked up tight. The ROAR OF
text: ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER.
text: Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap.
text: She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to
text: keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Sandra? What's happening?
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: It's okay! Everything's okay!
text: Sandra closes her eyes. Struggling to believe it.
text: Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into
scene_heading: DARKNESS.
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We hear CRIES OF ALARM. TOTAL BLACK. Chaos.
speaker_heading: BOB (V.O.)
dialog: Jeep, get the flashlights!
speaker_heading: PERCY (V.O.)
dialog: Everybody just stay still!
speaker_heading: KYLE (V.O.)
dialog: Now that we're locked in here, what
dialog: the fuck are we supposed to do?
text: A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH
text: THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face.
text: Michael looks up at the ceiling.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - NIGHT
text: A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy
text: and Kyle. They quickly take their places behind the
text: "Paradise" sign. Pitch black surrounds them.
text: The RUMBLE OF ENGINES is gone, leaving only the RUSH OF THE
text: WIND coming up off the desert.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Where the hell did they go?
text: Bob turns to Michael sharply.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Alright, Rambo. You got us up
dialog: here. Now you mind explaining what
dialog: the fuck we're fighting?
text: Michael is about to answer, when:
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Listen!
text: Over the wind, another sound becomes audible.
text: The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You hear what I'm hearing?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah...The hell is that?
text: The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct.
text: Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN.
text: But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with
dialog: dread.
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: It sounds almost like...
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Ice cream.
text: TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the darkness. And sure enough, an
text: ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly toward the diner. The EERIE
text: CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from a speaker on its roof. It's too
text: dark to see who's behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You've got to be fuckin' kidding
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Alright. There's a safety switch
dialog: on the side of your gun. Push it
text: all the way down. Two clicks.
text: The men quickly do as they're told.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Now when this starts, you hold on
dialog: tight, you hear me? If you don't,
dialog: you're going to blow your hand off.
dialog: Understand?
text: Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: The fuck y'all lookin' at me for?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: Jeep faces the boarded up front door, awkwardly holding the
text: MP5, trying to assume a tough guy posture. If only he could
dialog: stop shaking, it might be believable.
text: Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the
text: windows. The ICE CREAM TRUCK'S HEADLIGHTS fan across the
dialog: diner.
text: Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows.
text: Charlie stops next to Jeep. Senses him shaking. Rests a
text: hand on his arm. And that seems to help...a little.
text: Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the CALLIOPE.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Oh, honey, listen. It's the Ice
dialog: Cream Man.
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME
text: The Ice Cream Truck pulls to a stop with its headlights
text: facing the diner.
text: Everyone aims their guns at the truck. Tense.
text: From the Ice Cream Truck...a DARK BLOODY SHOE STEPS to the
dialog: ground.
text: MOVING up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to
text: reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. Say
dialog: hello to THE ICE CREAM MAN.
text: He looks like he's been through hell -- literally. As he
text: steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even
dialog: more clearly.
text: He's tall. Too tall. His clothes don't seem to fit him.
text: And he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like
dialog: taffy. If he got down on all fours, you might mistake him
text: for some kind of spider. He surveys the diner, the garage,
dialog: the roof -- assessing the situation.
text: On the roof, the men wait for something to happen.
speaker_heading: KYLE
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Ah, he don't look that bad.
text: The Ice Cream Man's gaze snaps up to the roof. He heard.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
text: That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING
text: TORTUROUSLY DOWN TO NEARLY THE MIDDLE OF HIS CHEST! ROW
text: AFTER ROW OF A RAZOR SHARP TEETH FORM with the sickening
text: sound of CRACKING OF BONES.
text: From his new mouth, the Ice Cream Man lets out an earth
text: shattering HOWL.
text: Everyone except Michael is practically hyperventilating with
dialog: fear.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Get ready!
text: And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING
text: SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal
text: man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT.
text: Michael aims.
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: Bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on
text: his back. Still. Arms and legs in a twisted, twitching
dialog: mess.
text: Michael keeps his aim. Waits. The CALLIOPE music continues
dialog: to play.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Is that it?
text: Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A
text: freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the
text: wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE
speaker_heading: COMMUTERS.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Now! Shoot now!
text: The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.
text: WINDSHIELDS SHATTER! TIRES BLOW OUT! ENGINES EXPLODE!
text: Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE!
text: DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering.
text: In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS
scene_heading: PEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL
text: FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many
text: mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Spread out! Don't let them get
dialog: close to the windows!
text: The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions.
text: They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't
text: actually touch the ground.
text: From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow
text: Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight.
text: Their faces lighting up with each FLASH.
text: SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from
text: a sprinkler.
text: BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't
text: seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in
dialog: their sheer numbers.
text: With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the
dialog: diner.
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ON BOB firing madly. Then... CLICK! CLICK! Oh, no. He's
text: out of ammo.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Shells!
text: Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch
text: and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fuck!
text: With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down
dialog: for the ammo. Stretching... Further...
text: A HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM
text: BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers
text: before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in
text: tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she
text: clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT.
text: Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts
text: to slip down toward her. She's coming fast!
text: Percy sees his friend in trouble.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Bob!
text: Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the
text: bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide
text: even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he
dialog: can't stop!
text: BOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP
text: RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!
text: She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something
text: akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM!
text: The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing
text: force halts Bob's slide.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (extending his hook)
dialog: Grab my hand!
text: Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays
dialog: on.
text: But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more.
text: Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Gun!
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly
text: catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman
text: pounces on him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (jamming the gun in her
speaker_heading: MOUTH)
dialog: Fuck off!
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body
text: goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Pull me up!
text: Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME
text: Hiding in the shadows... listening to sounds of WAR just
dialog: outside.
text: Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears. A few feet away,
text: Audrey clutches a butcher's knife.
text: Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another. Trying to
dialog: keep it together.
text: Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the
text: handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS
text: rattle the plates on the shelves.
text: Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the
text: front windows.
text: Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds.
text: Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face. Staring.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME
text: Percy is swivelling left and right, firing like mad.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Come on, motherfuckers! Come on!
text: Closer and closer the creatures come. Most are eviscerated
text: by the fire from the rooftop.
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: ON CHARLIE staring at the window. CLOSER. Charlie's eyes go
dialog: wide as --
text: SMASH! A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window. Glass,
text: sand and dust swirl in.
text: Audrey and Sandra SCREAM.
text: Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready.
text: Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically
dialog: for the intruder. It's so dark!
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Where is it?!
text: Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She
text: looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's
dialog: too much.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Mom! Open your eyes!
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: I can't! I can't!
text: Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's
text: got hold of his legs! That gets Sandra's eyes open!
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: (springing after her
speaker_heading: HUSBAND)
dialog: Howard!
text: Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through
text: the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about,
text: desperately trying to grab a hold of something.
text: Sandra scrambles after her husband. Reaching for him.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Daddy!
text: The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's
text: outstretched hands. She has him!
text: The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered
text: window. It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light
text: falling across its face, reveals:
text: A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age. Her skin is a deathly
text: blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
text: Deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated
text: flesh on her arms, neck and face. The self-inflicted wounds
text: of a drug addict. Her voice is not QUITE HUMAN.
speaker_heading: TEENAGE GIRL
dialog: See what you made me do, mother!?
text: Sandra screams, holds on.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: No!
text: Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's
dialog: arms.
text: Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but
text: with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he
text: discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms.
text: Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched. A human
dialog: tug-of-war.
text: ON HOWARD'S FEET -- TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE
text: CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS.
text: Howard's body lurches further out the window.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Howard!
text: Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie
text: daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain
dialog: leverage.
text: ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS
scene_heading: ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM!
text: Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window,
text: losing her grip on Howard's belt.
text: Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY
text: LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to
dialog: his baby girl.
speaker_heading: RAGGEDY MAN
speaker_heading: (SWEETLY)
dialog: There you are!
text: And he starts to pull her arm even harder...Other creatures
text: suddenly notice her as well, focusing their attack as if she
dialog: alone was their target.
text: Jeep immediately let's go of Howard and dives for Charlie,
text: grabbing her free arm just before she's pulled through.
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Without the help, Audrey and Sandra can't hold on any longer.
text: Howard is ripped from of his family's hands and out the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Daddy!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME
text: The tide is turning. The men seem to have gotten their game
text: on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: They're running! We got `em!
text: Kyle turns happily to Michael. Gone. Kyle looks around the
text: roof with alarm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: Only a few more inches separate Charlie and certain death
dialog: through the window. Jeep's losing her!
text: A FLASH OF STEEL. SCHING!
text: Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like
text: hands still grasping Charlie's arm no longer attached to
dialog: their owners.
text: Michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a
text: machine gun in the other. He lights up everything in his
text: path. The window blinds become a WALL OF FIRE. Creatures
text: SCREECH and flee into the night, having successfully taken
dialog: their first victim.
text: Charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and
text: Jeep scoot away from the window.
text: Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael. She's going
text: after Howard. He intercepts her before she can make it out.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Let me go! He's alive!
text: Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from
text: the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: He's alive!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No... Not anymore.
text: Sandra breaks down.
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As Charlie climbs slowly to her feet -- a sudden pain. She
text: clutches her belly. Winces.
text: Jeep catches her arm to steady her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (RECOVERING)
dialog: I'm okay. I'm fine.
text: She glances back at Michael. He's watching her. Those eyes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thanks...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I told you not to do anything
dialog: brave.
text: Charlie doesn't know how to respond. She's about to say
dialog: something when --
text: Kyle rushes into the room. A smile on his face.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: We got `em runnin'!
text: Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his
text: excitement falling.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Where's Howard?
text: No one responds. Sandra and Audrey are huddled together.
dialog: Crying.
text: Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the
dialog: adrenaline.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Someone needs to be on the roof.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I'll go.
text: Bob grabs Kyle's arm.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: (approaches Michael,
speaker_heading: DETERMINED)
dialog: You better start talking.
text: All eyes on Michael. These people want answers. Finally:
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The first time God lost faith in
dialog: Man he sent a flood. The second
dialog: time...he sent what you see
dialog: outside.
text: Everyone takes that in for a moment, then:
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: You sayin' this is the
dialog: Apocalypse...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm saying this is an
dialog: extermination.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Those things out there are vessels.
dialog: The Possessed. The weakest willed
dialog: are the easiest to turn.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Possessed by what? Demons?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No...by angels.
text: That silences the room.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: (pulls out his bible)
dialog: Son, I don't know what bible you
dialog: been readin', but in my version,
dialog: the angels are the good guys.
text: Michael looks squarely at Percy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's where your book is wrong.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: How come you know so much about
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I know because until last night, I
dialog: was on their side.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: You mean you're...
dialog: Michael considers Jeep, then:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Not anymore...
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Right and yesterday I was the
dialog: fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know,
dialog: fuck this. I don't even believe in
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's fine, because He doesn't
dialog: believe in you either.
text: Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: C'mon, Bob. Have you looked
dialog: outside recently? Those aren't
dialog: exactly our regular customers out
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How do we know he didn't bring them
dialog: here himself?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He brings them here and then he
dialog: saves us from them? You're a
dialog: genius, Bob.
text: Bob falls silent, confounded.
text: Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So you're here to protect us?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Not you...
dialog: (looks at Charlie)
dialog: Her.
text: Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Me?! Why me?!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because your child is the only hope
dialog: humanity has of surviving.
text: In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can
dialog: do when told such a thing. She LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No way!
text: But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes
text: genuine fear.
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: Jesus Christ...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Exactly.
text: Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is
text: starting to make sense.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: You're sayin' she's the mother of
dialog: the Messiah?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed
dialog: to be a vi--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Go fuck yourself, Bob!
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Makes you wonder about Mary.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (approaches Michael, panic
dialog: setting in)
dialog: Look, this is not possible! I'm
dialog: just a waitress! I'm nobody! I
dialog: can't give birth to the Savior of
dialog: Mankind!
dialog: (and finally)
dialog: I don't even own a car!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: None of that matters anymore.
dialog: Either your child lives or Mankind
dialog: dies.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: So what, we're supposed to just
dialog: hold those things off until Mary
dialog: over there squeezes one out?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That can't be. I'm only eight
dialog: months pregnant.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Oh we're fucked. We are so fucked!
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: How are we supposed to survive here
dialog: for a month?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We won't have to...
text: At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's coming soon, isn't it?
text: Michael nods.
text: Charlie sways on her feet. Jeep rests a hand on her
text: shoulder, steadying her.
text: With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group
dialog: with finality.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: If you want to live you'll do what
dialog: I say. This first attack was a
dialog: test of our strength. The next one
dialog: will be a test of our weakness.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: Something much worse is on its way.
text: Everyone exchanges terrified looks. Finally, Kyle steps
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Okay, what's your plan?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We'll keep watch on the roof in
dialog: shifts of two. Jeep, go get some
dialog: tools. We need to close up this
dialog: window before somebody else goes
dialog: out.
text: Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he
text: follows after Michael, leaving Charlie to stare at the
text: SHATTERED WINDOW, the blinds flipping wildly in the wind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE NIGHT
text: Percy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides. They're
text: wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from
text: the cold and the flies.
text: Percy scans the horizon. Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the
dialog: darkness.
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: They're out there. Sons of
dialog: bitches. I can feel `em.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Damn it's cold!
text: Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his "hands"
text: together to keep them warm. Kyle notices. Sees the dog
dialog: tags.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You were in the Army?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Navy, two tours. But the second
dialog: one didn't work out so well, so I
dialog: didn't get to go back for a third.
dialog: Suppose that makes me lucky in a
dialog: way. Served with Bob, you know.
dialog: That's how I ended up in this
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What was it like? Being in a war?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Dark. Like this.
text: Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45. Nervously switches
text: it from hand to hand.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: So what's with that gun?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Your piece. The one you killed
dialog: grandma with. Don't reckon it's
dialog: for huntin' buck.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No. I uh -- keep it for
dialog: protection.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Protection from what?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: From people.
text: Percy looks at him skeptically.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: People.
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah, people who might try to give
dialog: me a hard time, you know?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Just regular people or uh...
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah, well, no, not regular,
dialog: regular people.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Irregular people then.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I'm talkin' people whose job it is
dialog: to give other people a hard time.
dialog: Kinda person who doesn't get enough
dialog: fiber in their diet, you know what
dialog: I'm sayin?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: So it's a work thing, is it?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Exactly. Strictly business.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: This business of yours... You like
dialog: it?
text: Kyle's eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Who the fuck are you to be sweatin'
dialog: me, man? I got my reasons for
dialog: doin' what I do.
text: Percy just stares at him, penetrating. Finally:
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: When I was a kid my father would
dialog: sit by my bed every night before
dialog: I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me,
dialog: Percy, if you don't wake up
dialog: tomorrow, if it turns out that
dialog: today was your last day on earth,
dialog: would you be proud of what you've
dialog: done in this life? Cuz if you
dialog: ain't, then you better start
dialog: gettin' square.
text: Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to
text: the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SILVER ZIPPO
text: rolls between dirty fingers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - NIGHT
text: Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up
text: some steaks with the other. He pauses in his cooking every
text: few moments to take a slug from a can of beer. Can't get it
dialog: down fast enough.
text: Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a
text: prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread
dialog: around.
text: Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes. He pulls
text: another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it and
text: places it in front of her.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: On the house.
text: She looks up at him. Smiles weakly. Takes a sip.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You hungry?
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Couldn't eat if my life depended on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well I figure just cuz the world's
dialog: coming to an end, it doesn't mean a
dialog: man's gotta starve. All I can say
dialog: is thank heavens they left the gas
dialog: on.
text: Sandra takes another sip of beer. Considers it.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Never much cared for beer.
dialog: Howard's the beer drinker in the
dialog: family.
text: The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her
text: again. She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses
text: them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. This
text: is a battle she's losing.
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling
text: with Percy's old radio. Back and forth on the dial.
text: Listening for anything. Nothing but STATIC.
text: Up at the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael
text: nail broken table planks across the shattered window. He
text: eyes the strange tatoos running down Michael's arms, the two
text: jagged wounds visible above his shirt line.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: What did you do...you know, before
dialog: you came here...?
text: Michael considers the question a beat, then:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was a soldier, a general, in His
dialog: army.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Well, what changed? What made you
dialog: leave?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was given an order I didn't
dialog: believe in...
dialog: (off Jeep's look:)
dialog: He lost faith. I hadn't.
text: Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: So what happens to you...after this
dialog: is over?
text: Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Sometimes we have to face the thing
dialog: we fear the most in order to be
dialog: free of it.
text: Michael picks up his gun.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's almost time for the next
dialog: shift.
text: Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him,
text: deep in thought.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAWN

dialog: TITLE: "December 24th - 6:05am"
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - MORNING
text: Michael is searching the horizon in front of the diner for
text: movement. His expression focused, determined.
text: On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to
text: stay awake. The beer taking over. His eyes droop closed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: Sandra awakens with a start.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Howard?
text: But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is
text: still asleep. The drugs have started to wear off... and her
text: fear is returning.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Sandra splashes water on her face. Stares at herself in the
text: mirror. A living wreck.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Sandra steps out of the bathroom.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Sandra...
text: Sandra freezes.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: A beat then:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Sandra...
text: Sandra spins around. Searching.
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Howard? Is that you?
dialog: It sure sounded like Howard.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Help me... Please...
text: This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from. Sandra
text: turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it.
text: Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (from behind the door)
dialog: Help me. Sandra...
text: Sandra is stricken. What the hell is she going to do?
text: That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door.
text: She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SANDRA'S POV:
text: Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door. NAILED
text: TO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS.
text: But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible
text: black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are
dialog: breathing.
text: Sandra goes slack with horror.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Help me, please!
text: Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES
text: covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Howard!
text: Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it
text: away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when
text: Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Mom!
text: Kyle races to restrain Sandra.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Let me go! He's alive!
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags
text: Kyle in the face. Down he goes.
text: Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME
text: The SHOUTING from the back office awakens the rest of the
text: sleepers. Percy springs up. Charlie is shaking Jeep.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME
text: The ROAR OF WIND ripping off the plain is all that can be
text: heard. ON BOB as his head drops down with drunken fatigue.
dialog: Sleep.
text: RISING OVER HIM TO SEE...
text: Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - SAME
text: Sandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey
text: hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy
text: appears in the doorway.
text: Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and
text: that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION.
text: Howard is there. A few feet away. Alive.
text: Sandra races toward him. Just behind her comes Percy.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Howard!
text: And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL --
text: -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying
text: streams of dark fluid toward Sandra --
text: -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her
text: from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not
text: stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door
text: SLAMMING closed behind them.
text: Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into
text: the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground.
text: But she's not fighting anymore.
text: Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his
text: back to the door, breathing heavily.
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Percy?
text: He takes a step forward, then falls to ground.
text: The entire back side of his body is gone. Burned away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A SHEET
text: covering a body.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - FREEZER ROOM - DAY
text: Percy's body lies covered on the table. Bob stares ruefully
text: at his dead friend. A broken man. Tears stream down his
text: face. He rolls the Zippo between his fingers.
text: Jeep watches his father from the doorway.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: We should get back out there...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Just gimme another minute with him,
dialog: okay?
text: Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDRA'S FACE
dialog: Catatonic.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it
dialog: looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never
dialog: know.
text: Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael
text: never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at
dialog: her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father
text: making sure his child hasn't strayed too far.
text: In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains
text: her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio.
text: Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She brings her ear up close. Wait. Is that a VOICE?
text: She adjusts the antenna, trying to bring the signal into
text: focus. CLEARER.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Hey...
dialog: CLEARER. Yes. It's a VOICE!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Hey! You guys, I think I got
dialog: something here!
text: Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around
dialog: the radio.
text: THROUGH THE HAZE OF STATIC, A GRAVELY, TIRED VOICE. STRAINED
scene_heading: BEYOND BELIEF. BUT STILL BROADCASTING.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: ... battling has been fierce. The
dialog: numbers of casualties are unknown
dialog: but all indications are that they
text: must be unimaginably large.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: If you're just joining us, we're
dialog: getting some of the first bits of
dialog: good news, if you can call it that,
dialog: since this apocalypse began just
text: twenty-four ago. A human militia
dialog: has formed on the outskirts of Las
dialog: Vegas and has begun to engage the
dialog: enemy. Also down in the Four
dialog: Corners area, we've been receiving
dialog: unconfirmed reports of another
dialog: resistance force gathering in Red
dialog: Rock National in the northern
dialog: Mojave Desert area.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Red Rock...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That can't be more than an hour up
dialog: the highway from here.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Does that mean we can leave?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No. We're not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What the hell are you talkin'
dialog: about? This is our chance!
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We can't risk being on the move
dialog: when the child comes. It's too
dialog: dangerous.
text: Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated. She shakes her head,
text: anger building. She sweeps some plates off the counter and
text: races for the bathroom.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: ... And as we fight this new
dialog: enemy, may God give us the strength
dialog: to survive and show mercy for those
dialog: of us who are already lost...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. DINER BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Charlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water
text: running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag,
text: feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant.
text: Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her
text: hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her
text: eyes, fear and anger overtaking her.
text: She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: It's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie,
text: wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought.
speaker_heading: JEEP (O.S.)
dialog: Guess it's your turn not to sleep.
text: Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: JEEP

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You mean besides the fact that I
dialog: just found out that I'm the mother
dialog: of the Messiah?
text: Jeep smiles, nods.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Crazy thing is...I didn't want this
dialog: baby. I even went down to the
dialog: clinic, you know that?
dialog: (off Jeep's reaction:)
dialog: I remember sitting there in the
dialog: waiting room, absolutely sure I was
dialog: doin' the right thing...And that's
dialog: when the feeling started. Like I
dialog: was falling into the deepest,
dialog: darkest hole imaginable. I
dialog: couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak.
dialog: I kept thinking this must be what
dialog: death is like. And when finally
dialog: they called my name, I ran.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: For a while after that I tried
dialog: pretending that it was just cold
dialog: feet, that I could go back if I
dialog: wanted to, that I could decide to
dialog: end it like I'd planned. Then I'd
dialog: start to have that feeling again
dialog: and I knew I didn't have a choice.
dialog: Somehow this had already been
dialog: decided. And it made me hate this
dialog: thing that's been growing inside
dialog: me.
text: A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then:
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: You shouldn't say things like that,
dialog: Charlie. It isn't right. You'll
dialog: get through this. I know you will.
text: She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How come you have so much faith in
dialog: me, Jeep? God knows I've never
dialog: given you or anybody else a reason
dialog: to. Or is it that you just can't
dialog: find any other hard-luck case to
dialog: follow around?
text: Jeep's face hardens. He gets up. Hurt. Frustrated.
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: You know, you're not the only who's
dialog: suffered, okay? Let me know when
dialog: you stop feeling sorry for
dialog: yourself.
text: And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare
text: after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Sand and wind. The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking.
text: Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping
text: watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: ...Then you just flip this --
text: Audrey flips the safety.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah, I got it. All the way down.
text: Two clicks.
text: She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding
dialog: one all her life.
text: Off Kyle's surprised look:
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Dated this guy last summer. A
dialog: marine. Had a thing for guns.
dialog: Parents hated him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I bet they did.
text: After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on. Hands
text: the gun over to Kyle.
text: Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her
text: expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years
dialog: overnight.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: My parents hate everything I do.
dialog: That's why we were moving.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: They thought a more "wholesome"
dialog: environment would help me "change
dialog: my ways." So fucked up. Only
dialog: reason they care at all is cuz they
dialog: don't want to be embarrassed in
text: front of their friends at the
dialog: country club.
text: Kyle considers her thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: The only time my old man ever paid
dialog: attention to me was when I was
dialog: doing somethin' bad. So you know
dialog: what I did?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I got really good at being bad.
text: She smiles at this confession. Can obviously relate. He
text: wipes a tear from her cheek.
text: She leans in. Kisses him. Passionately. Desperately.
text: His hands trace over her body.
text: She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control.
text: She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up.
text: It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over.
text: She moves down his chest. Further. Kyle leans his head
dialog: back. Further.
text: Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come
text: to life. The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant
text: red word "Paradise" illuminated above them.
text: Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP. The station's
text: FLUORESCENTS flicker on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME
text: All at once the entire diner COMES BACK TO LIFE.
text: The jukebox WHIRS ON, filling the room with Merle Haggard's
dialog: "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive".
text: Bob's TV glows with bright rolling STATIC.
text: The electric fan spins on above the grill.
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the
dialog: window.
text: Charlie is giving Sandra some water through a straw.
text: Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We back in business?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME
dialog: The truck stop is lit up like a Christmas tree. If you
dialog: didn't know better, you might mistake the place for business
text: as usual. Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof, taking in the
dialog: dramatic change.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Is it over?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don't know.
text: HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (raising his gun)
dialog: You better get downstairs.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No, I can handle it.
text: Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face. Then he
text: pulls out his silver 45.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (handing her the gun)
dialog: Just in case.
text: The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off
text: the highway to stop at the pumps.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Get ready.
text: They aim their weapons at the vehicle.
text: A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car.
text: He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the
text: coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and
text: YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He races around to the gas pump.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (lowering his gun)
dialog: Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Kyle, are they...
text: A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look
text: out over the back side of the diner.
text: AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast.
text: Kyle looks urgently back at the family. The father lifts the
text: pump. Flips the lever.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It's a trap. They saw them coming
dialog: and turned on the lights. It's a
dialog: fucking trap!
text: Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.
speaker_heading: KYLE AND AUDREY
dialog: Hey! Get back in your car! It's a
dialog: trap!
text: But down below, the man can only hear the sound of RAGING
text: WIND as he pumps the gas.
text: Kyle fires his gun in the air. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the
text: roof. His family heard it too and they start to SCREAM TO
text: HIM. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but
text: he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe.
text: Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: They're not gonna make it.
text: The father dashes to the driver's side. He throws open the
dialog: door.
text: But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time
text: to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM.
text: His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows.
text: Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that
text: surround the vehicle like swarming insects.
text: The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from
text: the vehicle by skeletal hands.
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (pushing his barrel down)
dialog: Wait! You'll hit them too!
text: So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto
text: the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the
text: ground in front of the diner.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Kyle!
text: Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the
text: woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on.
text: He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything
text: that comes at him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: The group gathered at the window sees Kyle racing out toward
dialog: the pumps.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jesus Christ, what the hell is that
dialog: boy doin'!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We have to get `im back in here!
text: Bob springs into action. Pushes the booth away from the
text: front door.
text: The sound of a gun COCKING.
text: Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don't. You open that door and we
dialog: could all be dead.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably
text: agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display.
text: He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures
text: huddled around them.
text: He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively
text: covering his face.
text: Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I got you!
text: Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening.
text: The creatures have stopped coming at him.
text: In fact, they're just standing there watching him. Waiting.
text: Kyle freezes. CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY (O.S.)
dialog: Mister...
text: Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms. GHOSTLY WHITE EYES
text: stare back at him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Fooled ya.
text: A FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT.
text: Kyle drops to his knees.
text: Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Kyle!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: Bob kicks over a table in disgust.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Damn it all to hell!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, no. Audrey...
text: Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and
text: run towards Kyle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: The young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life
text: drain from his body.
text: The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears
text: suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to
dialog: her.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
dialog: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Audrey raises the 45 and ... CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.
text: She keeps pulling the trigger. Nothing.
text: The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an
text: eerie calm for someone so young.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
dialog: You're gonna die now.
text: The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body.
text: Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the
text: diner. Blocked by advancing creatures.
text: They're everywhere. She's trapped.
text: She notices the open door to the MINIVAN. And so she BOLTS.
text: Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly
text: closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK!
text: She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press
text: against the windows. A nightmare come to life.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
dialog: Panic.
text: Charlie rushes to Michael's side.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Do you have no heart?! She's just
dialog: a kid!
text: But he's immovable.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can't let her die!
dialog: (grabbing a gun from the
speaker_heading: TABLE)
dialog: I swear if you don't do something,
dialog: I will!
text: Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wait.
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Charlie looks back at him, defiant. No one breathes. Then:
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (raising his guns)
dialog: Open the door.
text: Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the
text: dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed
text: Charlie and out into hell.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
text: With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps.
text: IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK.
text: She's running out of time.
text: Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at
dialog: the minivan. What's he up to?
text: The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if
text: they've just now noticed him.
text: And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait,
text: there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his
dialog: other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
text: The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE!
text: The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames.
text: Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through
dialog: the night.
text: The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of
dialog: glass.
text: Michael drops the gas pump.
text: He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and
text: unlocks the door.
text: Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED
text: BY A RING OF FIRE.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Come with me.
text: Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car...
text: Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Run.
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And together they run toward the open diner door.
text: BEHIND THEM THE MINIVAN EXPLODES. A BALL OF FIRE ROARS AT
speaker_heading: THEM!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
text: Everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing.
dialog: Audrey is the first one in.
text: Michael is almost there. But the fire is faster, ENGULFING
dialog: HIM IN FLAME!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Michael!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (pulling Charlie away from
dialog: the door)
dialog: Get back!
text: BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into
text: the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF
text: FIRE REACHES THEM.
text: Everyone hits the deck as the FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS
text: covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey.
text: Michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess. Jeep and Bob
text: rush to pat him down.
text: Audrey's coughing from the smoke.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll get some water!
text: Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink. She fills up
text: a pitcher of water.
text: She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher...
dialog: And SCREAMS!
text: The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her
text: wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE.
text: The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor.
text: The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress
text: outfit covering her pregnant belly.
text: Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She
text: frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room
dialog: to maneuver.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BOY
dialog: C'mon, don't be scared. I just
dialog: wanna play with your baby.
text: That's it. She's backed against the end of the counter!
text: The boy raises the knife to strike.
text: Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in
text: front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN.
text: CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's
text: hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the
dialog: blade.
text: The knife CLATTERS to the ground.
text: The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but
dialog: there's no knife.
text: Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his
text: THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps.
text: Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the
text: boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her.
text: Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie,
text: guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Are you hurt?
text: Charlie shakes her head no.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where is he?!
text: That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE
text: DINER BACK INTO DARKNESS.
speaker_heading: JEEP'S VOICE
dialog: He's still in here!
text: FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner.
text: LIGHTING under chairs. Under tables.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: Where the fuck is he?!
text: A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST. Everybody spins to track
dialog: the location of the sound.
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As soon as they move in one direction, the SCAMPERING is
text: heard in another.
text: Jeep's LIGHT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE GROUND. A TRAIL OF
speaker_heading: BLOOD.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: He's bleeding!
text: THE BEAMS OF LIGHT JOIN TOGETHER, MOVING FAST TO TRACK THE
text: BLOOD ACROSS THE DINER WHERE IT ENDS AT...
dialog: A WALL...
text: Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE TRAIL OF BLOOD
text: REACHES THE CEILING AND...STOPS.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What the fuck?
text: SCREECH! THE BLOODY BOY SPRINGS OFF A TABLE BEHIND THEM AND
text: LANDS ON BOB'S BACK.
text: Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly
text: strong arms away from his neck.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Dad!
text: Jeep can't get a clear shot. Bob's gasping for air.
text: Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's
text: back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Get ready!
text: Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked
text: creature into the air.
text: Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF
text: GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner.
text: And then in moments... All is QUIET.
text: BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet. She
text: WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, no!
text: Michael lowers his flashlight. CLEAR FLUID runs down
text: Charlie's legs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT
text: Inky darkness. A flickering light emanates from within the
dialog: diner.
dialog: TITLE: "December 25th - 3:33am"
text: The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT
text: Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with
text: Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her
text: legs. Pots of steaming water surround them.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What am I supposed to do? Just
dialog: `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I
dialog: automatically know how to do this!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Just do as I say.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah, but, how do you know how to
dialog: do this?!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME
text: Bob and Jeep keep watch.
text: The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger
dialog: -- closer.
text: Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What a way to bring a child into
dialog: the world.
dialog: (looks over at Jeep)
dialog: She ever tell you his name?
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: She's never said. I just assumed
dialog: it was Joe Danvers. You know how
dialog: she's always had a thing for bad
dialog: boys.
text: Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jeep, sooner or later she'll
dialog: realize you're the best thing
dialog: that's ever happened to her.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: I thought you said I should move
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Can't a father be wrong sometimes?
text: Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound...
text: A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as
text: if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: What was that...?
text: The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold
dialog: numbers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS
text: Michael reacts to the sound. An urgency comes over him.
text: Audrey arrives with more steaming water.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What is that?!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He's coming. We have to hurry.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry?
dialog: This isn't something you can
dialog: exactly hurry, is it?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Charlie, I need you to push. I
dialog: need you to push as hard as you
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Michael, who's coming?!
text: Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with
text: pain. It's a gruesome, bloody affair. It's getting close.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We're almost there...
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME
text: Jeep and Bob watch helplessly as the ARMY OF CREATURES has
text: closed within a hundred yards of the diner. Their ranks
text: stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: We're not gonna make it outta here,
dialog: are we?
text: Bob looks at his son. The agony stretched across his face.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be
dialog: happening to you...
text: Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob
text: pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears
text: filling his eyes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME
text: Amidst the dirt and darkness, Charlie lets out a final
text: agonizing SCREAM...
text: ...and then comes a BABY'S CRIES. Audrey, eyes wide, holds
text: up the CHILD. Stunned. Elated.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Oh my god...we did it! Charlie,
dialog: you did it!
text: Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the
text: baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace
dialog: it or be terrified by it. A commitment she's not yet ready
dialog: to make, even at this late hour.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: It's okay. The baby's okay.
text: Charlie looks to Audrey, tears streaming down her face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't...I...
text: Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Take him... Give her a minute.
text: Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to
text: soothe him by pacing around the diner.
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It's okay...It's okay...Shhh...
text: Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS. Menacing.
text: Closer.
text: Audrey reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio,
text: trying to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out
text: of the STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing
text: SILENT NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm.
text: Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up. She stares
text: at him, a burning spite in her eyes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So are we safe now? Is it over?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No. Killing the child would have
dialog: ended the war before it had begun.
dialog: Now, at least, he will have a
dialog: chance to grow up, a chance to lead
text: the world out of darkness.
text: Those words provide her little comfort.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And what happens until then...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You'll need to teach him how.
text: Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What makes you think I can do that?
dialog: What makes you think I want to do
dialog: that? If he's so important, why
dialog: don't you take him?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Each of us has a burden. This one
dialog: is yours and yours alone. Maybe
dialog: someday you'll understand what that
dialog: means.
text: Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey
text: approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. Despite
text: how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to
text: see her in such a demoralized state.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Mama? Can you hear me?
dialog: (holds up the baby)
dialog: We did it...The baby's alive.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDREY (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Mama?
text: If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face.
text: Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her
dialog: mother. But we HOLD here and...
text: DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are
text: loosening the bonds. BLOOD TRICKLES from where the rope's
text: cut through her skin.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME
text: DRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABY'S CRIES
text: reverberate up and down the ranks. They begin to look about
text: frantically, agitated by the sound. Some even begin to back
text: away from the diner.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS
text: Off in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light
text: above the plain. It could almost be mistaken for a stable in
dialog: a desert town a long time ago.
text: THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky.
text: All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of
text: the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the
text: further away from the diner we get.
dialog: 
text: HIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP
text: In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of
text: creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the
dialog: truck stop.
text: The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND.
text: AND WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE. LIKE A

speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Something's happening. They're

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The Possessed can't come near the
dialog: child, so He sent someone that can.
dialog: Someone like me.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Gabriel. My lieutenant. He's come
dialog: to do what I wouldn't.
text: ON JEEP as the realization hits him.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Your orders...
text: Michael looks at Jeep.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: You were the one who was supposed
dialog: to kill the baby? That was the
dialog: order you didn't obey.
text: Michael nods grimly. Charlie looks urgently at Michael.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What's he talking about?
text: The baby CRIES LOUDER.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Michael, what the hell's he talking
dialog: about?!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: There was never meant to be a
dialog: Second Coming. But we've just
dialog: changed that. The child lives.
dialog: The future is unwritten. There's
dialog: still hope.
text: Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Audrey...?
text: Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...
text: ...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND
text: SNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS!
text: Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door.
text: Hers is the face of madness.
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Stay away from me! Don't come any
dialog: closer!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Mom!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't do it, lady!
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: You heard what he said. They just
dialog: want the baby. Maybe if we just
dialog: give it to them, then they'll let
dialog: us go!
text: Michael cocks his gun. Points it at Sandra.
text: THE HORN BLARES ONCE MORE, DEAFENING, SHAKING EVERYTHING IN
text: THE DINER. IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.
text: Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Give him to me!
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: Why?! You never wanted him in the
dialog: first place!
text: Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words
text: rattling her to the very core.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No... I...
text: Sandra is almost to the front door.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: It's just one baby. Just one.
text: CRASH! THE DOOR IS TORN OFF ITS HINGES.
text: A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner.
text: Sandra is blinded. She raises a hand to block the light.
text: And that's when Michael fires. BLAM!
text: Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her
dialog: forehead, and...
text: ...THE BABY GOES FLYING OUT OF HER HANDS!
text: Charlie screams and the WORLD MOVES INTO SLOW MOTION... And
text: everything suddenly goes very QUIET.
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Michael fires again. Blowing Sandra's body back through the
dialog: doorway.
text: Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air.
dialog: The time for Jeep to act is now!
text: Jeep DIVES for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere
text: inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see...
text: The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the
text: spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS.
text: Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the
text: diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before.
text: This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle
text: scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly
text: insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather
text: they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine.
text: The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision.
text: And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his
dialog: striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake them
dialog: for brothers.
text: His name is GABRIEL.
text: Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical
text: looking MACE in his powerful hands.
text: And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the
text: mace arcing down at Jeep.
text: Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the
text: floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND.
text: Gabriel brings the mace up again. Jeep won't be so lucky
dialog: twice.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.S.)
dialog: Sonuvabitch!
text: Bob charges at the creature, sub-machine gun blazing.
text: Gabriel reacts by instantly UNFOLDING HIS WINGS and launching
text: himself into the air. The bullets clawing up the wall behind
dialog: him.
text: But Bob's heroic move has given Jeep time to get up and run
text: with the baby for the back of the diner. He thrusts the
text: child into Charlie's hands. And without even thinking, she
text: pulls the child protectively to her chest.
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Gabriel drops down in front of Bob, whipping his wings around
text: like a deadly, RAZOR SHARP FAN!
text: Bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face.
text: His gun falling from his hands.
text: Blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: No!
text: With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the
text: diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the
dialog: stove.
text: Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into
dialog: the fray.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, Jeep! You must protect the
dialog: child now!
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Me?! What about you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: My path ends here. You are the
dialog: true protector. You always have
dialog: been.
text: Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: But I don't know what to do!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Find the Prophets. Learn to read
dialog: the instructions.
text: Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face
text: Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Prophets? What Prophets? What
dialog: instructions?!
text: And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to
text: Michael's Police Cruiser.
text: Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the
text: baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes
text: his hand around the keys, determination building.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: C'mon!
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wait! We can't leave him!
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: We have no choice! We have to get
dialog: to Red Rock!
text: He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office.
text: Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the
text: ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood.
text: Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched
text: hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a
text: BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove.
text: Jeep is terrified.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Dad!
text: Jeep tries to help him up.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Leave me, Jeep. My place is here,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: But Dad...!
text: Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Run.
text: And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

text: Charlie opens it. Sand swirls in around her.

scene_heading: INT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME
text: Michael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like
text: enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible
dialog: family conflict.
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You
dialog: were always so eager to please Him.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Unlike you...the rebellious son.
dialog: (noticing Michael's scars)
dialog: Pity about your wings. They would
dialog: have helped you now.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: To not feel their burden...is a
dialog: dream.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You think you can defy Him and not
dialog: pay the price?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The child lives. What happens to
dialog: me doesn't matter now.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You
dialog: can help them sneak out the back
text: door, but they won't escape.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And neither will you, brother.
text: Michael slowly approaches Gabriel.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: (SOFT)
dialog: I'm not running anymore.
text: Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face. This was not
dialog: what he was expecting.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: (SENSING)
dialog: Join with me. You don't need do
dialog: this. There's another way.
text: A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: There is no other way...
text: He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! --
text: LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it
dialog: wasn't bad-ass enough.
text: And the fight begins.
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: It's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems
text: under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior
dialog: weapon.
text: With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering
text: speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The
dialog: place is getting absolutely shot to hell.
text: Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings
text: the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches.
text: Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to
text: fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight
text: into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in
text: Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he
text: lands on the counter.
text: Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest,
text: sending him fluttering back.
text: Michael thrusts himself to his feet. Gabriel recovers, jabs
dialog: again.
text: Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support
text: and lifts his body just above the deadly spike.
text: Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him.
text: Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of
dialog: punches.
text: Gabriel is rattled back by the assault. He clumsily lifts
text: his mace and thrusts with it.
text: Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a
dialog: wall.
text: Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones.
text: A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing
text: back, losing his grip on the weapon.
text: Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back.
text: Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael
text: off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking
dialog: the life out of Gabriel.

text: Audrey and Jeep help Charlie quickly move around the side of
text: the diner where the cruiser is parked. They are buffeted by
text: winds and sand.
text: Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat
text: while Audrey hustles in back.
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS
text: Jeep frantically tries to get the right key into the
dialog: ignition.
dialog: It's in.
text: Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP.
dialog: Panic.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on, Jeep!
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: I'm trying!
text: Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING.
text: A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light
text: catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a
text: SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely
text: distended.
text: Charlie screams.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Fuck!
text: Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE!
text: The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: (throwing the car in
speaker_heading: REVERSE)
dialog: Hang on!
text: Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards
text: toward the highway.
text: BUT THE CREATURE HANGS ON!
text: Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full
text: 180 onto the road.
text: THE CREATURE SHOOTS OFF THE CAR AND HITS THE ASPHALT.
text: Jeep throws it in drive just as the POSSESSED SANTA rises
text: from the pavement.
text: Pedal to the metal.
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The creature doesn't have a chance as the cruiser PLOWS into
dialog: him.
text: BONES CRUNCH as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over
text: the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a
text: cloud of dust.
text: Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Okay, we need to figure out our
dialog: weapon situation. Hopefully
dialog: Michael didn't take everything out
dialog: of the car.
text: Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a
text: police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie
text: searches under her seat. Pulls out a...GRENADE.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Is this what I think it is?
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Yes. Now just put it down...
dialog: Slowly.
text: Charlie places it onto the seat.
text: Audrey fishes around in the backseat.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (holding up each item)
dialog: Okay, all I got is a flare gun
dialog: thing. Looks like we got a box of
text: flares to go with it.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A
text: a flare gun... And a grenade.
dialog: Alright.
dialog: (hands Charlie the Glock)
dialog: Load this.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Audrey, can you figure out how to
dialog: load that flare gun without killing
dialog: us all?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: I can try.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Try real hard, okay?

text: Gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael. He
text: fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent.
text: Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't
text: hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom.
text: Unbelievably Michael is still holding on.
text: Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom
text: mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael.
text: Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner.
text: Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull.
text: Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more. It's a brutal
dialog: struggle.
text: Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms
dialog: reach.
text: He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this
dialog: angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's
text: strength is giving way. Michael is winning.
text: Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the
text: mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go
text: wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them
dialog: both through.
text: Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward.
text: Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest. Right
text: through his heart.
text: Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly
text: as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood
dialog: left in this guy.
text: Michael falls to his knees. Weakening.
text: Gabriel looms over Michael. Michael looks up at him, blood
text: leaking from his mouth.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You always wanted to live like one

text: Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward
text: the source of the CLICKING.
text: He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive
text: pool of blood.
text: It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING
text: sound is coming from Bob's SILVER ZIPPO.
text: Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to

text: Bob looks at Gabriel.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sorry... We're closed.

speaker_heading: IGNITES.

speaker_heading: JEEP

dialog: risk of hitting Audrey.
text: Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now.
text: Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her
text: hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes
dialog: off INSIDE THE CAR!
text: Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS
text: through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July!
text: Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the
text: windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, SETTING
scene_heading: HIS HAIR ABLAZE.
text: And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and FIRE.
text: BOOM! Gabriel is blown back partially through the rear
text: window. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to
text: pull himself back in. Nothing slows this guy down.
text: Jeep pulls the trigger again and...CLICK. No bullets!
text: Audrey frantically reloads the flare gun. Brings it up to
text: fire, but he's too fast! WHACK! Gabriel knocks her into the
text: side of the car with a sweep of his hand. She's out cold.
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again.

dialog: C'mon, we're almost there.
text: They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --
text: GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM!
text: Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way
text: just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up
text: a cloud of dust.
text: Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has
text: done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away.
text: Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including
text: a large part of his head, revealing that under his human
text: visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE.
text: Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM!
text: Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's
dialog: hand.
text: Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin,
text: rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel
text: knocks Jeep savagely to the ground.
text: Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at
text: Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt
dialog: again.
text: Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt. Raises his
dialog: fists. This kid will simply not give up.
text: Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,
text: shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear
text: off the ground.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: So brave. So pointless. You
dialog: should have worried more about
dialog: saving yourself.
text: Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at
text: Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope.
text: Charlie watches in horror.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Stop! Please! Don't kill him!
text: But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing
text: consciousness. The battle is lost.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Go to sleep...
text: Jeep's eyes flutter. He's almost gone.

dialog: 102.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Stop it! I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY!
text: This gets Gabriel's attention.
text: Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't want this responsibility!
text: Tears run down her face. She's dead fucking serious.
text: Gabriel lets go of Jeep. He falls to the ground, gasping
dialog: desperately for air.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Charlie, no!
text: Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: "And as the child's cries are
text: extinguished, an eternal darkness
dialog: at last descended upon the world."
text: He peels the cloth back, revealing...
text: THE GRENADE.
text: He spins around to face Charlie.
text: She's holding the pin.
speaker_heading: KABOOM!
text: GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS.
text: The creature is gone at last.
text: The sound of a BABY COOING.
text: Charlie picks the child up out of the brush.
text: She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make
text: their way to the top of the ridge.

scene_heading: EXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - DAWN
text: Jeep and Charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below.
text: ON THEIR FACES, reacting to what they see.
text: Charlie takes Jeep's hand in hers.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: We made it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yep, we sure did.
dialog: And now we see it too:
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
text: Vast. Barren. No signs of life.
dialog: No resistance force. No nothing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON JEEP AND CHARLIE
text: Taking it in. Breathing hard.
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: I'm sure they're just over the next
dialog: ridge.
text: He glances at Charlie. Worry in her eyes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What if we're on our own now?
speaker_heading: JEEP
dialog: Don't be afraid. We'll be okay.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Believe me.
text: At those words, Charlie looks deep into Jeep's eyes. Sees a
text: confidence in them she's never seen before.
text: And she leans in and kisses him. Tender.
text: When they part, Jeep stares back at her with surprise. Then
text: the surprise melts into a smile.
text: And they descend the ridge...out of sight, leaving us with a
dialog: view once again of --
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE MOJAVE DESERT - DAWN
text: A BLOOD RED SUN rises behind the distant mountains. The
text: unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat.
dialog: And we're back where we started.
text: A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE. Solemn. Weary. Determined.

dialog: 104.

scene_heading: IT'S CHARLIE'S VOICE.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S VOICE
dialog: Someday when my son is older, I

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DRIVING - MORNING - WEEKS LATER
text: Jeep is at the wheel. He looks aged, scarred from the
text: experience. His exposed arms are completely covered with the
text: INTRICATE WRITING...The Instructions. The boy he once was is
text: gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S VOICE
dialog: ... And how just at the moment when
dialog: everything seemed lost...
text: Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms.
dialog: It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy
dialog: family. Of course you'll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF
text: WEAPONRY in the back seat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...a mighty warrior fell in order
dialog: to save me.
text: Jeep glances over at Charlie and the baby. He smiles at the
dialog: image of maternal bliss.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
text: And a boy faced his fear and rose
dialog: up to save us all.
text: The sun shines through the car windows, filling our eyes with
text: its fiery light.
