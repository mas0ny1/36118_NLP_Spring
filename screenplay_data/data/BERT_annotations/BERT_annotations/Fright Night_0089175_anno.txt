speaker_heading: FRIGHT NIGHT
dialog: Written by
dialog: Marti Noxon
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: FADE UP:
text: Moving through a tract development. The houses are like
dialog: Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just
dialog: mixed differently.
text: A gloomy night, no moon. And a slightly ominous pattern
dialog: emerges...
text: Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut
text: brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and
text: pizza joint flyers.
dialog: Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or, worse, seemingly
text: abandoned. This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town.
text: A deep, commanding voice pierces the silence:
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Defy reason. Defy everything you
dialog: know.
dialog: Now we move in on one of the homes. Not the nicest on the
text: block, but inhabited. Lights on in the windows.
scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN HOME/VARIOUS -- NIGHT
text: Inside the house. A middle-class family lives here. The
text: living room is empty, but the TV's on.
scene_heading: ON THE TELEVISION
text: A commercial for PETER VINCENT. A Las Vegas institution,
dialog: he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie
dialog: imagery.
text: Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy. He's cutting a
text: girl up with a chain saw. And grinning like a mad man.
scene_heading: TELEVISION ANNOUNCER
text: Peter Vincent's "FRIGHT NIGHT."
text: The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left
text: of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box.
speaker_heading: TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
text: Something's moving in the dark.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: Also on the table -- a role-playing game in progress.
dialog: "Magic, the Gathering"... Elves and Wizards.
speaker_heading: TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
text: Only at The Hard Rock. Nightly
dialog: Wednesday Through Sunday.
text: Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT
text: coming from another room.
speaker_heading: DISTANT VOICE
dialog: Get off her!!
text: More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly
dialog: domestic scene.
text: We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps
text: through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes
dialog: toward us.
text: He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind
dialog: terror.
text: We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A
text: teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping.
text: We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if
text: something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it.
text: We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered,
text: as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the
text: wall, which Adam nearly falls over.
scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN HOME -- UPPER LANDING/BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: ADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS' ROOM. Another horrible glimpse -
text: - his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed.
text: Blood on pale pink sheets.
text: ADAM goes to his FATHER'S SIDE OF THE BED and now we see
text: Adam's father's body. His father was reaching for A GUN he'd
text: hidden under the bed.
text: ADAM gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the
text: gun. It's just beyond his grasp.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Come on, come on, come on...
text: He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in
text: his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: ADAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, come on!
text: He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking
dialog: hands.
text: THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw. Adam is
text: exposed. We see only a hint of the creature that looms over
speaker_heading: HIM --
text: Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin...
text: Human but not quite.
text: Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead.
text: HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear:
speaker_heading: DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
dialog: .we're looking at a nice day here
dialog: in Clark County, hitting a season
dialog: low of only 89 degrees...
scene_heading: EXT. SHADOW HILLS - DAY
text: MUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH
text: ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before.
text: In the daylight it seems nice. Charming, even.
text: Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes
text: in the street. Mothers unload groceries. Neighbors chat.
speaker_heading: DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
dialog: .so get out there and enjoy this
dialog: beautiful Wednesday, people.
text: We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing
text: MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the
text: rear window.
text: The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns don't seem nearly so
text: foreboding now.
text: We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the WALL
text: that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time
text: that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT, ARID DESERT.
text: In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas
text: proper. It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked
dialog: Pleasure Island.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street.
text: WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER, who is PUSHING the bike as
text: fast as he can. It STARTS, sputters -- then craps out.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to the bike/pissed)
dialog: You want me to take you apart, huh?
text: Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who
text: just recently came into his body and good looks.
text: He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite
text: trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (still talking to bike)
dialog: I will. I'll sell you for parts.
dialog: Don't think I won't--
text: Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches
text: him talk to his bike. Paused as she hauls her trash cans to
dialog: the curb.
dialog: She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her
text: ridiculous body. Stripper city. She nods to the bike,
dialog: amused.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Nothing doing, huh?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The thing's got no ambition.
dialog: (re: trash cans)
dialog: Can I -- uh, give you a hand?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I got it. Thanks.
text: She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word "LUCKY" across
text: the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice
text: his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Don't leer at the neighbors, kid.
text: Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE
text: brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
text: He and his mom have had an affectionate, teasing relationship
text: which has only recently started to have more edge.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She's the one who put a word on her
dialog: butt. I'm just reading it.
text: Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in
text: front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Is he ever going to move that
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You need to get over it, Mom.
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (WATCH IT)
dialog: Attitude.
dialog: (observes him/then)
dialog: You've been tense or something.
dialog: School?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: School's great, actually.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Amy?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good. Hasn't dumped me yet.
text: He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That'll teach you to get so tall
dialog: and handsome.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Getting what you want is stressful.
dialog: Especially when you're not used to
dialog: it. More to lose.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Are you reading those books again?
dialog: The Power of Whatever the Hell?
text: She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: They're not working. You're still
text: flipping out about a big box.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
text: Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN
text: HOUSE SIGNS into her trunk. Charlie stands there. She
text: shoots him a look -- then he helps her load.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It's an eyesore. I'm trying to
dialog: convince people to move in, not
dialog: join the legions leaving town--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If you say "mortgage crisis" again
dialog: I'm getting a new mom.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: The guy moves in and puts a giant
dialog: trash can in his yard! When the
dialog: Perry's lived there--
dialog: Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The Perry's were the greatest
dialog: neighbors ever. But they moved. I
dialog: thought you were happy their place
dialog: finally sold.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (back on the neighbor)
dialog: He's not digging a pool. Where do
dialog: you think all that concrete's
dialog: coming from?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're spying on the guy now?
speaker_heading: JANE
text: He's thirteen feet from our house.
dialog: That's not spying, that's
dialog: observing.
text: A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot
text: friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hi, Mrs. Brewster.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hi honey. Hi girls.
dialog: ANY, 16, is a stunner. And she's as cool as she is beautiful
dialog: -- the girl every other guy in school would die to be with.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: But Charlie is. And he can't believe his luck. Which puts
text: him off his game. She makes him feel like he's always
text: playing catch up.
text: Charlie moves toward the VW. Jane calls after him.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh hey -- Ed called. Again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm tired of making excuses,
dialog: Charlie. If you don't want to talk
dialog: to him, would you please tell him?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Kinda defeats the purpose.
text: He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Still can't get the bike started,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wow. No faith.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So you don't need a ride.
text: Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs
text: his backpack and RACES after her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, hey, stop--
text: She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she
text: drives again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on! Hey!--
text: Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst. The
text: girls are laughing.
speaker_heading: ON JANE
text: Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. AMY'S CAR -- DAY
text: The Beetle zips through a commercial strip. More suburban
dialog: paradise.
text: Charlie's in the front seat now. Amy drives, one hand on the
text: wheel. Casually drops one on Charlie's leg. Charlie tries
text: to act casual, but he's stoked and... amazed.
text: Cara half-sleeps in the back while BEE leans forward, flirty,
text: and eyes Charlie's COLORFUL PUMA SNEAKERS. Charlie's a
text: sneakerhead, a serious collector.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Charlie.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: Chuck likes it when I call him
dialog: Chuck, right Chuck?
text: Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's -- they're not -- that's,
dialog: like, puce? That's a macho puce.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Can you stop someplace? I'm
text: severely under-caffeinated.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (ignores her/to Bee)
dialog: Did you see the poster for the
dialog: formal? The theme is "Hope"?
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: I know. They asked me to be on the
dialog: committee again but I was like --
dialog: hope is completely 2008. Grow up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did you suggest "Despair?" Nobody
dialog: would see that coming. Or --
dialog: global warming? Everybody has to
dialog: wear tin foil.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (laughs/to Charlie)
dialog: Did you go last year? We basically
dialog: did the whole thing, Bee and me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (LIES)
dialog: Me? I, ah, was in training that
dialog: week. This big triatha--
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: (cutting him off)
text: Chuck was still under his rock.
dialog: We're so glad you crawled out.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Caffeine!? Hello!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I have Econ first period.
text: Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Charrrliiieeeee.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (KILLING HIM)
dialog: Okay. Yeah. It's no big deal.
text: Amy PULLS into a coffee place. Parks. The girls climb out.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Thank you, Jesus.
text: Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You're not going to flunk for
dialog: missing Econ, Brain.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Brain? I -- what? No, I'm--
text: But she's already walking away.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: Five minutes.
text: He watches her move off, anxious and smitten.
scene_heading: EXT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH -- COURTYARD -- DAY
text: Charlie arrives with Amy, Cara and Bee -- all the girls now
text: sport coffee drinks. Charlie has one too, with whipped cream
dialog: and the works.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
text: Kids stream into a nice, modern-looking high school. Amy
text: takes Charlie's arm.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: On time. You stress too much.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I wasn't worried.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You were doing your worried thing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I was? I have a -- what's my--
speaker_heading: MARK (O.S.)
dialog: Ladies!
text: A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up
text: along side Charlie and the girls. They draw looks from other
text: students as they move through the courtyard.
dialog: The cool kids.
speaker_heading: BEE
text: Doods. Looking massive.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (to Charlie/re: drink)
dialog: Seriously? A Mochachino? You
dialog: can't ride with the girls anymore.
dialog: You let them brush your hair, My
dialog: Pretty Pony?
text: Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it.
speaker_heading: BEE
dialog: (takes his arm)
dialog: Chuck's secure, aren't you?
text: We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design.
text: It's a thing. Charlie shows his off -- he's secure.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Puce.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Fuck yeah.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: I have track after school, maybe we
dialog: can hook up later?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. Hey. Come here.
dialog: (pulls her aside/awkward)
dialog: You know, the formal. Don't think
dialog: I wasn't going to ask you, because
dialog: I thought it was an obvious go.
text: Together. Hope, puppies, kittens,
dialog: the whole deal. You and me.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (NOT UNKIND)
dialog: Oh, no. Please. Nobody goes to
dialog: the dance senior year.
text: She smiles, moves off. He watches her, lets out a breath.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. I knew that.
text: MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow.
text: Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie:
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp
dialog: man? Make a sacrifice to the hot
dialog: ass Gods? How do you get that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Game, my friend. Rock solid.
text: Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we
dialog: see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a
text: bitch. Mark calls after him--
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You don't even have a car!
scene_heading: INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY
text: Later. Charlie's in Econ class. Seated in a back row near
text: MARK and BEN. A number of seats in class are EMPTY.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Ben Wegner?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Adam Noris?
text: Nothing. Teacher looks around.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Adam?
dialog: (marks chart/then)
dialog: Courtney Heuer?
text: A girl raises her hand.
text: Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class. Stops when he
text: sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him.
text: EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been
text: picked on by bullies his whole life.
dialog: He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And
text: his binder is covered with COMIC BOOK STICKERS.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Nick Straley?
speaker_heading: (NOTHING)
dialog: Nick?
text: Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly
dialog: at him. Like -- "you know and I know..."
text: Charlie looks away. As if he didn't see him.
scene_heading: INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY
text: Charlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall. Mark shows Charlie
text: a picture on his phone. A woman posing seductively.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Miss Granada. Geometry.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Holy crap. Where did you get that?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: She's hard up, man. Equations
dialog: don't keep you warm at night.
text: They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and
text: Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I think "it's" going to talk to us.
speaker_heading: ED
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: I need a minute.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: "It's" going to talk to Brewster.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: BEN
speaker_heading: (TO ED)
dialog: When are you going to get the
dialog: message? We don't know you--
speaker_heading: ED
speaker_heading: (RE: CHARLIE)
dialog: He does. Or did. Before the
dialog: summer and his Jock Lobotomy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Ed/uncomfortable)
dialog: What's the deal, man?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Alone.
text: Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out
text: laughing. Mark looks at Charlie.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Just the two of you. That's sweet.
dialog: He can school you in the ways of
dialog: geek-douchery.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's important. "Brewster."
text: The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into
text: action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch
text: with interest -- out of earshot.
text: Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
text: Adam's missing.
text: Charlie's looking around, self-conscious.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do you mean, he's missing?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I keep trying him -- nothing. No
dialog: texts, no phone. And he's not the
dialog: only one who's gone. You heard
dialog: roll call.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So kids aren't coming to school.
dialog: What do you want me to do about it?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Meet me at his house after school.
dialog: We'll check around. See what's up,
dialog: if he's okay.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can't after school. I'm busy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't think you get what I'm
dialog: TELLING YOU--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, do we have to do this here?
text: Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He
text: starts to lose it, raises his voice--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What, am I not even suppose to
dialog: speak to you now?--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Keep it down. Don't spaz--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's so horrible! Crossing the
dialog: streams! Will High School as we
dialog: know it cease to exist?!
text: Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: You want me to tell your pals how
dialog: well we know each other? The Lego
dialog: contests, the Farscape conventions,
scene_heading: THE COSTUMES--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: UIET--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Or how your first sexual experience
dialog: was with an Electra figurine--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. No.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Then be my backup.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (DEFEATED)
dialog: Fine. Adam's after school.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't be late.
text: Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He
text: shrugs like "I have no idea what that was about..."
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK
text: The sun has set behind the mountains. It's gloomy gray out,
text: right before dark.
text: Charlie and AMY park, climb out of her car with drinks from
text: PLANET SMOOTHIE in hand. She's still in her track and field
text: clothes. Looks tough.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You know what I want? For dinner?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're eating right now, you know.
dialog: As you speak. You literally just
dialog: forced me to get you a smoothie so
dialog: large they named a planet after it--
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: I ran six miles. What did you do?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I -- watched you. But not in a
dialog: creepy way.
text: Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So don't judge. You don't want me
dialog: to burn my big ole' booty off, do
dialog: you?
text: Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that for?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't know you're just...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (PERFECT)
dialog: Nothing.
text: A sweet moment. These two have a definite thing. It's real.
text: They're about to kiss again when JANE'S GIRLISH LAUGH stops
text: them. They both turn and REACT AS THEY SEE...
text: A MUSCLED MALE, SQUATTING AND HUNCHED-OVER -- clad only in a
text: white wife-beater and jeans. We can't make out his face.
text: Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he
text: FIXES their sprinkler.
text: PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome
text: to the point of devastating. An all-American Adonis.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look at Mom. She'sâ
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Damn right. If he followed her
dialog: home, you have to let her keep him.
text: Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment.
scene_heading: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSK
text: ED paces anxiously in front of ADAM'S HOUSE. He has a duffle
text: bag over his shoulder. Keeps checking his phone.
text: He finally dials in a number. Talks--
speaker_heading: ADAM
text: Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's.
dialog: Remember the videos we all made
dialog: back when? You and me and Adam,
dialog: bro? In tights. Want your pals to
dialog: get a load of that?
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT LAWN -- DUSK
text: Amy and Charlie approach Jane and Jerry. They overhear--
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: .so not a pool, what's the work
dialog: you're doing?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
text: Jerry has an easy-going way about him. An inviting charm.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Foundation problems. I had to rip
text: up half the basement.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: These houses were built practically
dialog: overnight. I'm never surprised
text: when they come apart.
speaker_heading: JERRY
speaker_heading: (RE: SPRINKLER)
dialog: Done. Just needed a new stem.
text: Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching. And gaping.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Jerry, this is my son Charlie. And
dialog: his -- do we say girlfriend now?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: I guess. I mean -- only if she's--
text: Amy's amused at Charlie's squirming, finally saves him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (shakes Jerry's hand)
dialog: Hi. I'm Amy.
text: He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She
text: enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie.
text: Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes
text: manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand
text: a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Jerry's our new neighbor. The
dialog: Perry place. He's "handy."
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (looks to Charlie, smiles)
dialog: No kidding.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Sorry about the mess, man. I was
dialog: just telling your mom I'll have the
text: dumpster gone next week.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Doesn't bother me.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Jerry does night construction on
dialog: the strip.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: (noticing Charlie's shoes)
dialog: You play ball? I'm always looking
dialog: for a pick up game.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (BLUFFING)
dialog: Now and then, you know.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It's more of a collector thing.
text: The shoes. He's obsessed.
dialog: (to Jerry/"those teens")
dialog: They sleep on sidewalks to get
dialog: them.
text: Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well -- they're bold. I like them.
text: Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: So... I'd ask you guys inside, but
dialog: it's a mess. I've been meaning to.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Be neighborly.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: A drink, something.
text: It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Soon, okay?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You bet. And thank you so much.
dialog: For the help.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Least I could do.
text: Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves
text: off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why did you blow him off? Oh my
dialog: God!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: A guy that good-looking, still
dialog: single? Bad bet. He's a player.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: Mom. Breaking it down.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I've had enough man trouble. I'm
text: not getting suckered again.
text: Amy and Charlie meet eyes. That was loaded. Jane notices.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't listen to me. Jaded old
speaker_heading: BROAD--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: MOM--
text: Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it.
speaker_heading: ON THE PHONE
text: A VIDEO CLIP from ED. TITLED "KID COMEBACK and SUPER SQUID!"
text: It shows Charlie, Ed and Adam when they were younger,
text: prancing around in homemade costumes and, indeed, tights.
text: The text message says "10 MINUTES -- OR THIS IS GOING WIDE!"
speaker_heading: ON CHARLIE
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (alarmed/to Amy)
dialog: Wow. Okay. I gotta go. Sorry.
dialog: Call you later.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I have dinner on--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I gotta go. I'll eat later.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Charlie!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
text: But Charlie's already off and running.
scene_heading: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- DUSK
text: Charlie approaches, sees ED pacing in front of the house.
text: He's flipping out.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Where the hell have you been?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You said after school, chill out!
text: Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Right after! It's dusk, dude, you
dialog: know what that means!?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That the sun's gone down. What's
speaker_heading: THE BIG--
text: Over him, Ed knocks loudly. Rings the bell.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey! Anybody home?
text: A long pause. Nothing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not here. Let's go--
text: But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle.
scene_heading: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DUSK
text: Ed wriggles in through the DOG DOOR. He turns, lets Charlie
text: in. Charlie looks around.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is nuts.
text: It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely
text: righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's
dialog: proper place. It's perfect.
text: They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello? Ed and Charlie here!
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: Come on.
text: Charlie follows him in. Resigned and placating.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay. Fine.
text: Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY
text: WATER, even a small AX.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Take this.
text: Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You've got to be kidding me.
dialog: Ed stops. This is it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I hate to tell you this but that
dialog: guy, your neighbor.
speaker_heading: (DEAD SERIOUS)
text: He's a vampire. One of the undead.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: My neighbor. Next door.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I just met him. Jerry.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Jerry.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's a terrible vampire name.
dialog: "Jerry." Seriously--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I didn't name him, man, I'm just
dialog: reporting the facts!
text: Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's
text: darker up here. Lights off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on, this is a gag -- right?
text: Ed's barely listening -- cautious. Every shadow is potential
dialog: death. Total shmuck bait...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hey! Anybody here?
text: They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's
text: parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty.
text: Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery.
text: Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him.
text: The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY
text: HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure.
text: Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked.
text: Charlie also reacts, scared.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Get back, demon!
text: Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open,
text: toppling A MOVIE CHARACTER STANDEE.
text: A beat. Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Ha! I killed that sucker dead!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (ANGRY)
dialog: They're not here, okay? They left
dialog: town. His dad was a deadbeat--
text: Ed pulls a MAP out of his pocket. It has lots of red and
text: black DOTS marked on it. He thrusts it at Charlie.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, see, it's not just them. It
dialog: started -- there was this thing on
text: Channel 13, a lady escaped an
text: attacker who tried to bite her.
text: Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose
text: circle around CHARLIE'S house.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Adam and me, we graphed the attack,
dialog: the disappearances. Whole
dialog: families, gone.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: And that's you guys at the center,
dialog: see? His windows are totally
scene_heading: BLACKED OUT--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: There's a ton of houses like that.
dialog: People work nights on the strip--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But every window? No. I've been
dialog: watching him. It all fits--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That Jerry's a Dracula.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. Dracula is a specific vampire.
dialog: I'M SAYING--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know what you're saying! I'm
dialog: mocking you. You've been reading
dialog: too much Twilight--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Fiction, okay? This is real. A
dialog: real monster. And he's not
text: brooding. Or lovesick. Or noble.
dialog: He's the fucking shark from JAWS.
text: He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't
text: move on until everyone around him
text: is dead.
speaker_heading: (MOST EMPHATIC)
dialog: And that book SUCKS.
text: Charlie can't help but pause. Ed's conviction is so real.
text: But he shakes it off.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: COME ON--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What about your neighbors, the
dialog: Perrys? He moved into their house.
dialog: Haven't seen them around, have you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, in San Diego like a month
dialog: ago!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Exception, proves the rule. You
dialog: haven't asked him in, have you? He
dialog: can't get in without an invitation.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, but--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Your mom? Lonely divorcee...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're on drugs.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No! Well, yeah... I thought you'd
dialog: take my word, but I have evidence
text: at home. Hard evidence.
text: Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
speaker_heading: ED
speaker_heading: (INTENSE)
dialog: We have to stake him in his nest.
dialog: You and me. Not now, it's dark.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. Cause he's nocturnal.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Just for -- okay -- for a minute
dialog: pretend you're not a douche now--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun
dialog: when we were eight--
speaker_heading: ED
speaker_heading: SIXTEEN--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (LOSING IT)
dialog: Whatever! I grew up, okay? You
dialog: don't want to, fine. But don't get
dialog: an attitude because I'd rather have
dialog: a life than make shit up!
text: Ed stops. Stung.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Right. Got it. You're soooo cool
dialog: "Brewster." Go ahead, join the
dialog: Clark High early-peakers. This is
dialog: the pinnacle for them. And that
dialog: includes your girl--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Undeniably doable, but we used to
dialog: make fun of her and her pals,
dialog: remember? They're bimbos--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Shut up!
text: Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves
text: him away. Ed stumbles. Falls.
text: He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Adam's gone -- you act like it has
dialog: nothing to do with you.
speaker_heading: (THEN/PAINED)
dialog: We were inseparable, man.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. And you know when I got
dialog: popular? The minute I stopped
dialog: hanging out with you.
text: Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS/VARIOUS -- NIGHT
text: A while later. It's REALLY DARK now.
text: Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a
text: residential street. Houses here are spaced far apart and the
text: lights in many of them are off.
text: Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark
text: corner is potentially the end of him.
text: A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps
text: GAINING. Ed abandons his skateboard and BOLTS.
text: A hand SLAMS on his shoulder, spins him around. IT's MARK,
text: Charlie's pal from school.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You crossed my yard. Tracked your
text: nerdjuice all over it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sorry. Sorry--
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: My mom works hard on that shit,
speaker_heading: MORON--
text: Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything... else
dialog: could be out there.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Can you just hit me? I don't have
dialog: time for the build up.
dialog: (he steels himself)
dialog: Go.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Jesus, man! Just do it!
text: Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow.
text: Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels.
text: The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has
dialog: experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to
text: shake Mark for a moment.
text: Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS
text: CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on
text: the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Crap. Crap!
text: There's not time to get the stuff. He can hear Mark
text: approaching in the dark.
text: He drops into a neighbor's backyard.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT
text: ED spins and slams right into MARK -- no, it's JERRY.
text: Ed falls back and scrambles away, terrified.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Get away! I'm armed mother fucker!
text: Jerry moves after Ed, angry but controlled. More like a man
text: than a monster.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: EXT. FENCE -- NIGHT
text: Mark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence. Sees Ed's
text: VAMP HUNTING STUFF on the ground, laughs.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Unbelievable.
text: A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done.
text: He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT
text: Ed trips over kid's toys and bikes as he runs to the house.
text: There's a porch light on over the back door.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (pounding on door)
dialog: Hey! Let me in! Please!
text: But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing
text: in, walking across the backyard.
text: Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Ed falls through the window into the kitchen. Looks out.
text: JERRY stalks toward him. All hulking menace.
dialog: But Ed's safe now. Calls out--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Forget it sucker! No invite!
text: BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Abandoned. I thought you did your
dialog: homework.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: -- what?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You've been watching me. I've been
dialog: watching you. Seems fair.
text: Ed BOLTS into the house.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE -- VARIOUS -- NIGHT
text: As he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his
text: pocket. We see he's wearing a cross around his neck on a
dialog: long chain.
text: JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat.
text: Ed sees A SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the back. He fumbles with
text: the lock, gets it open and runs into the backyard.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT
text: Ed races for the back gate--
text: AND SUDDENLY JERKS TO A STOP.
text: Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS he's wearing.
text: Ed's lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN, until he's choking
text: on it, the cross directly under his neck.
text: JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the
text: cross into the neighbor's POOL.
text: Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair.
text: Jerry's standing over him. Smiles a little. We get just a
text: flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH, sharper, in rows. It's
text: chilling.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Bit off more than you can chew.
text: Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: We'll see, man. I know my shit.
text: But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with
dialog: actual sympathy.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Really? Who's going to believe
dialog: you? You see the truth, but what
dialog: good is it when you're alone?
text: Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't play that stuff. That mind
dialog: crap. Come on -- try me. Try me!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You say you're glad you're
dialog: different. But how can you be in a
dialog: place like this? These people...
dialog: Even your best friend. You're
dialog: nothing to him now.
text: Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a
text: step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less
dialog: conviction.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Get back!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It can be over. I can make all
dialog: that pain go away.
text: Ed's fighting tears. Life as he knows it is gone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You were born for this and you know
dialog: it. Your "life", what you had?
dialog: That's the illusion.
dialog: (off Ed's silence)
dialog: I can take you somewhere great.
dialog: Somewhere you'll belong.
text: Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it...hope?
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a gift.
text: And Jerry moves closer, blocking our view.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- DAY
text: A new day. Sunny and hot. A truck moves the DUMPSTER from
text: Jerry's house.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Through the kitchen window, Jane watches the DUMPSTER drive
text: away. She's pleased, a little surprised. Says to herself...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Good on his word.
text: A knock at the door. It's Amy. She lets herself in.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Morning. Charlie?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You try. My voice seems to be on
text: some frequency he can't hear.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: CHARLIE!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (O.S.)
dialog: Coming!
text: Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head. Amy moves to the
text: island. Grins a little.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Talk to Hot Neighbor again? You
dialog: should facebook him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Temptress. I'm resolved.
text: Charlie runs down. Wet from the shower, discombobulated.
text: pecks Amy, grabs food off a plate. He's out of sorts.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oversleep?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Didn't.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Weird dreams.
text: Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out.
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT YARD -- DAY
text: Amy and Charlie head to the car. Charlie turns -- looks back
text: at JERRY'S HOUSE. The blacked out windows...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
text: Charlie snaps out of it. It's crazy to even entertain Ed's
dialog: theories.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing. That guy was such a tool.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (HUMORING HIM)
dialog: Totally. Poser.
text: She gets in the car. Smiles a little.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY
text: Charlie's in class. He's restless, agitated. On his pad, he
text: absently draws VAMPIRE images, blood...
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Sally Cabella?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Ed Lee?
text: Nothing. Charlie looks up.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Edward Lee?
dialog: Charlie looks around. No Ed. And just like he said -- quite
text: a few other kids are missing. Charlie takes this in, looks
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: ABOVE CHARLIE
text: SEATS ALL AROUND HIM ARE EMPTY. This time it makes an
dialog: impact.
scene_heading: EXT. BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY
text: Charlie, Mark, Ben and the rest of the guys get ready for
text: practice. Mark's in the middle of a story, but Charlie is
text: distracted -- barely listening.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: .she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude.
dialog: Like -- one zip and POP!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Huh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: What's up with you? Dreaming about
dialog: your little boyfriend?
text: Charlie takes this in, worried.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You see him around today? Ed?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I don't track "it's" whereabouts.
dialog: What did he want, anyway?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing. Homework stuff.
text: But Charlie's clearly distracted.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I have to go.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Now? You're ditching? I'll bail
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No -- I'm -- I don't feel so well.
text: He takes off. Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed.
scene_heading: EXT. ED'S HOUSE -- DAY
text: Another suburban development. Rows and rows of red tile
text: roofs, houses stacked right on top of one another...
text: Charlie rings the bell of a modest place. Not as big as
dialog: where Charlie and Jane live. But nice, well-tended for.
text: ED's mom, VICTORIA, answers. She's surprised to see him.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Charlie!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee.
text: Victoria breaks into a wide smile.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: God you're a sight for sore eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Victoria pulls Charlie in and hugs him, happy. Calls out--
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Rick! Charlie's here!
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: Look at you. So handsome!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, I -- you don't have to--
text: Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ed said you'd sprouted. And
dialog: you're, the--
text: Rick awkwardly gestures around his face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Cleared up. Yes sir--
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Ed will be so sorry he missed you,
dialog: But -- you should both be in school
dialog: now, shouldn't you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He's not here? Did you see him
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: RICK
text: He's usually up and out early.
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, sure. We're working on a class
dialog: project. I guess we crossed paths.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed,
dialog: he'd be mad that I said so, but he
dialog: talks about you all the time.
text: This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. That's... He's great.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Would it be okay if I went
dialog: upstairs? Ed has a book we need.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Of course. Make yourself at home.
text: Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick --
text: "that's good!" They're both pleased.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S ROOM -- DAY
text: Ed's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy
dialog: movies.
text: There's an art table where Ed has been working on some
text: illustrations for a noir-style graphic novel. Charlie stops
dialog: and looks at them. They're fantastic.
text: He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few
text: pictures of Ed, Charlie and Adam when they were friends.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A PHOTO
text: Charlie and Ed, arms around each other. Charlie is shorter
text: and thinner -- with really bad acne. Not cute. WAY not.
speaker_heading: ON CHARLIE
text: Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees--
text: PETER VINCENT'S "FRIGHT NIGHT" POSTER on a wall. Charlie
text: takes it in, laughs a little.
text: Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's
text: investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore
dialog: printed off the internet, books, etc.
dialog: If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more
dialog: of Ed's fictional world.
text: Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head.
dialog: It's all a fantasy -- nothing more.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is crazy.
text: He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on --
text: and one file stands out. "THE JERRY DIARIES."
text: Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds
text: a bunch of Quicktime files.
text: He opens one. Stops.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON COMPUTER
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
text: As BLURRY short clips play:
text: Jerry's truck, in motion but it looks like NOBODY'S DRIVING
dialog: IT.
text: DORIS the neighbor chatting on Jerry's lawn -- with nobody.
text: Over and over, it's appears that JERRY DOESN'T SHOW UP on
dialog: video.
speaker_heading: OFF CHARLIE
text: Taking this in. Chilled.
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: It's dark as Charlie comes home. He looks warily at Jerry's
text: house as he searches for his keys.
text: BAM -- he walks right into JERRY.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hey guy.
text: Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed
dialog: thought? Impossible, but...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey. Guy.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You could really do me a solid.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah? What kind.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I have a girl on her way over for a
dialog: beer, and I'm totally out of beer.
text: They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Bummer.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Set me up, I'll pay you back two
dialog: times. A sixer for your mom, and
dialog: one for you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Uh, yeah, sure.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
text: Jerry watches Charlie as he unlocks the door.
dialog: This is when Charlie should invite him in.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me see what Mom's got. She's
dialog: kind of a "light domestic".. .mom.
text: Charlie steps inside. Pointedly DOESN'T ask Jerry to enter.
text: Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the
text: refrigerator. But keeps his eyes on Jerry. If he steps in,
text: uninvited, Ed's theory is blown.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as
dialog: my place, huh?
text: Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE
text: THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit.
text: Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over
text: Jerry's face.
text: Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his
text: hand -- it hits the ground, explodes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fuck!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Can I help you with that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No! No. Thanks. I'll get it.
text: Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly
dialog: certain. He's been made.
text: Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the
text: doorway with the remaining beers.
text: Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: There you go. Uh...party down.
text: Jerry watches him, intense. His tone shifts -- cocky and
text: intimidating. A threat disguised as "guy talk."
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: This girl tonight -- she's a
dialog: handful. You know.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Women who look a certain way, they
dialog: need to be managed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You don't mind my saying, you got a
dialog: lot on your shoulders for a kid.
dialog: Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must
text: be a line of guys dying to pluck
dialog: that. Your mom too -- you don't
dialog: see it, maybe you do -- she's
dialog: giving it off. It's on you to
dialog: watch out for them. You up for
dialog: that?
text: Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think I can manage.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Good. Cause there are bad people
dialog: out there, man. Better keep an eye
dialog: on your women.
text: Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for the beers.
text: Charlie watches him move into the dark.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE - CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Charlie bursts into his room, freaked out -- races to the
dialog: window.
text: His room is free of all geekery. Now it's all sports and
dialog: sneakerhead stuff.
text: AMY's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books.
text: She's reading Wuthering Heights.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Where've you been? You told me to
dialog: meet you here an hour ago.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S POV
text: Jerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet. Lights on
text: behind BLACKED OUT WINDOWS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
text: Charlie breaks away from the window. It's an effort. His
text: focus is still half there, even as he tries to talk to Amy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sorry. You okay? Everything okay?
text: He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah. Why shouldn't it be?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, it should. Nothing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (re: her book)
dialog: You ever read this? It's good.
dialog: Sexy, actually.
text: Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
text: In a frustrated, unconsummated sort
dialog: of way.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Like us, you mean.
text: Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Kinda makes it hotter.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, so you keep saying.
text: He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Am I boring you? What's up?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What? No. I'm kind of wiped out,
dialog: that's all.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I can fix that.
text: She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in
text: and turned on. She pulls back, serious.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Want to get under the covers?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: -- now? Seriously?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Calm down. Let's just... see how it
dialog: goes.
dialog: Charlie's dying inside. Now?! Could not be a worse time.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Believeme when I say--thereis
dialog: nothing in the worldI'dratherdo
speaker_heading: BUT--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Charlie. Don't be nervous.
text: She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie
text: weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait...
text: Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God--
text: DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie
text: stops. Practically tosses Amy off him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You hear that?
text: He rushes to the window. Looks outside.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S POV
text: DORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What?
text: JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's
text: flirting up a storm.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Shit, shit, shit--
text: Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: He's hot. She's a stripper. They
dialog: were bound to find each other.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
scene_heading: GO-GO DANCER--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Take away two tiny pieces of cloth,
dialog: stripper.
speaker_heading: (LIGHTLY)
dialog: You jealous?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What? No--
text: Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT
text: CHARLIE. It's chilling.
text: Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling
text: her down too.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
text: He looked right at us.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Maybe. Not a big deal--
text: Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, it is a big. A very big. He
dialog: saw us and he was pissed.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Okay...
text: Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: If you're not into this, say so.
dialog: Don't do me any favors.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What? No! I am, I totally am.
dialog: just -- I don't trust that guy.
text: He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used
text: to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm going.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Amy. Don't--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No. You've got your neighborhood
dialog: watch thing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on, don't be that way--
text: But she's gone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Crap!
text: A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But
text: Doris's muted LAUGH from the other house draws his attention.
text: He looks again at Jerry's house. He can see faint shadows
text: moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts.
text: Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do? He picks up
text: the phone. Dials 911. Then thinks better of it. Hangs up.
text: Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on JERRY'S PLACE.
text: Listening and watching intently. Keeping sentry.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Later. Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window.
text: He's startled awake by a woman's SCREAMS. They sound like
text: they are coming from Jerry's.
dialog: But are they screams of pleasure or pain?
text: Charlie looks out the window. Jerry's house is dark. It's
text: all quiet. Charlie looks at the clock. tam.
text: Charlie sits back on his bed. Was it a dream? Then Charlie
text: hears A MOTOR START. Charlie goes back to the window.
text: Jerry's TRUCK starts and Jerry drives off.
text: Off Charlie, unsettled.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT
text: A short while later. Charlie moves cautiously into Jerry's
text: backyard. He's wearing ALL BLACK and his dad's old winter
text: gloves. He looks at his iPhone.
text: ON THE PHONE -- a diagram. "How to pick a lock."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
text: Charlie steels his nerves. At Jerry's back door, he clumsily
text: tries to pick the lock. After a moment or two, he realizes
text: he has no idea what he's doing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Crap.
text: He walks away from the door, frustrated. Then turns and
text: impulsively tries to KICK IN the DOOR with his foot. Nothing
dialog: happens.
text: Then something occurs to Charlie. He goes into the garden.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The Perrys...
text: Charlie finds a FAKE ROCK. Turns it over. It has a KEY in
dialog: it. Charlie's like -- duh.
text: He puts the key in the back door lock. It opens.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Charlie moves through the first story of the house. He's
text: cautious, on edge.
text: At first the place seems totally unremarkable. A typical
dialog: "guy pad". Lots of inexpensive furniture, bad art, a salt
dialog: water fish tank...
text: At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump
text: out at him. It's unbearably tense.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT
text: Charlie looks upstairs. Moves through a plain white hallway,
text: finds an open door that leads to Jerry's office, where he
text: keeps an EXTENSIVE LIBRARY.
text: On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old, decorated
text: with a strange INSIGNIA. Charlie takes a picture of it with
text: his phone.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Charlie goes into Jerry's bedroom - opens his closet. Sees a
text: variety of UNIFORMS. Cop, gas man, UPS, etc. Charlie
text: reacts, chilled.
text: Charlie stops. JERRY'S TRUCK is pulling into the driveway.
text: Charlie's in a panic. Jerry will be inside any moment.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
text: There's no time to get out so Charlie ducks into the CLOSET.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- CLOSET -- NIGHT
text: Charlie pushes as far back into the closet as he can go.
text: Leans against the back wall.
text: The BACK OF THE CLOSET SWINGS OPEN and Charlie falls back
text: into a HIDDEN HALLWAY.
text: Charlie stands, stunned, see that the hallway is lined by
text: small rooms on either side.
dialog: It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added. Each room
text: has a small rectangular WINDOW, so you can see in.
text: Charlie reacts, sick. It looks like a prison. Despite the
text: danger, he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms--
dialog: WHAM!!
text: A pale HAND slaps against the window. Charlie jumps.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fuck! --
text: DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks
text: almost BLUE.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Help...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh my God. Oh, shit--
text: Charlie tugs on the door. Locked.
text: He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The
text: FRONT DOOR. And then -- JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Oh... Oh no... Get me out of here!
text: Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm -- I won't leave you--
text: But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Please! No! Don't go!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
text: Charlie ducks inside one of the CELLS across from Doris,
text: moves behind the door.
text: JERRY steps into the hallway, walks right by Charlie's hiding
text: place. Pauses near him.
text: The door is ajar. Was it that way before? Charlie holds his
dialog: breath.
text: Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORIS's half-alive body
dialog: from it.
text: Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door.
speaker_heading: DORIS (CONT'D)
dialog: .no... . God, no... please...
text: The door to Doris's cell open. Charlie can see PART of
text: Doris's body and face.
text: Jerry is mostly obscured, bent over Doris -- holding her.
text: Charlie watches helplessly, horrified.
speaker_heading: DORIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, please... don't kill me.
text: Doris's body TENSES and starts to jerk, as Jerry TUGS AND
text: RIPS AT IT SAVAGELY. It's clear he's FEEDING ON HER,
text: although we can't see his face.
text: Doris screams, then starts to cry. It's stark and REAL and
dialog: terrifying.
text: It seems to go on and on. Doris weakens, her head lolling to
text: one side, her light fading.
text: A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement.
text: In the position she's in, she is eye to eye with CHARLIE.
text: She sees him, smiles weakly. Then mouths something -- too
text: weak to make much sound.
speaker_heading: DORIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Cha... Cha...
text: CHARLIE is petrified. Doris gets it -- smiles a little
text: grimly, puts a finger to her lips. Silence.
text: After what seems like an eternity, Jerry is satisfied. He
text: tosses Doris aside and stands away from her.
text: Charlie DUCKS behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually
text: wipes a spot of blood from his mouth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
text: Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell. Pockets the key
text: and moves off toward the stairs. After a moment, he's gone.
text: The sound of a TV starts in Jerry's living room. Something
dialog: banal like "The Real Housewives of Orange County."
text: Charlie knows this is his moment. With shaking hands, he
text: retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the "HOW TO PICK A LOCK"
dialog: screen.
text: Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell. She's
text: breathing -- alive.
text: Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny
text: screwdriver on the lock.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Please... Please...
text: The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies
text: himself. Tries again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
text: The tension is unbearable. Charlie can hear JERRY moving
dialog: downstairs.
speaker_heading: CLICK
text: The lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he
text: grabs Doris and BOLTS.
text: Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's
text: feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet.
text: He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE.
text: His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back --
text: every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's
text: happening, let alone where she is.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- STAIRWELL/ENTRY -- DAWN
text: A moment later. Charlie and Doris emerge downstairs, near
text: the entry hall. They can see the front door -- and hear
text: Jerry moving in another room.
text: Charlie looks around, trying to get oriented.
text: JERRY emerges -- almost sees them. Charlie ducks into a
text: hiding spot and grabs Doris, covering her mouth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
text: A long beat as Jerry returns to the living room with a beer.
text: Settles in a chair facing away from the door.
text: Charlie considers his options. Says almost silently:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Same floor plan.
text: He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN
text: A back door. Leading out. Charlie and Doris race for it,
text: DORIS stumbles and bumps into a chair. Stifles a cry.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DAWN
text: Jerry turns at the noise.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN
text: Charlie throws the back door open, he and DORIS ESCAPE.
scene_heading: EXT. JERRY HOUSE -- DAWN
text: The sun is just starting to rise. Charlie races for his
text: house, with Doris holding on to him tight. She's crying with
dialog: gratitude and relief, manages--
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Thank you, thank you...
text: Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins
text: going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Doris?
text: In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop
text: it as she GOES UP IN FLAMES and explodes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE REACTS
text: Horrified. In shock.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN
text: Jerry moves into the kitchen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
text: The back door is closed now -- but the blinds sway slightly.
text: And there are BLOODY prints on the floor from Charlie's
dialog: sneakers.
text: Jerry takes this in, coldly furious.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- DAWN
text: Charlie sits on his bed -- still in a state of shock. This
dialog: shit is for real.
text: Jane comes to the door, her knock cursory. She enters.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You're going to be late.
text: Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie
text: winces at the sun. He got no sleep, looks like hell.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: The hours you keep. It's like
text: living with a vampire.
text: Charlie stops. Looks at her. She has no idea.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Listen -- promise me -- that guy
dialog: next door, Jerry? Under no
dialog: circumstances do you invite him
dialog: into our house. He's dangerous.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I think I can handle myself.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, no you can't--
speaker_heading: JANE CHARLIE
dialog: Charlie-- Don't even look in his
dialog: direction, understand? And
dialog: at night, you stay inside.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Because he's dangerous. What kind
dialog: of dangerous?
text: Charlie starts gathering his things. Getting ready to bolt.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Can you trust me? For once, don't
dialog: ask a million questions--
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Charlie. Stop. I'm your mom, not
dialog: some ridiculous woman--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (GENUINE)
dialog: I'm sorry. Okay? I know... We
dialog: just don't have time for a big
dialog: thing! I'm telling you--
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That's enough. I'm done with this
dialog: conversation.
text: She moves away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mom! Mom--
text: But she's gone. Charlie looks after her, worried.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY
text: Later. Charlie approaches the school. Kids swarm around
text: him, happy and care-free. Charlie's in another world.
scene_heading: INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- LIBRARY -- DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

scene_heading: CLOSE ON CHARLIE'S NOTE PAD/COMPUTER SCREEN

dialog: 49.
text: Vamps must avoid all daylight. Vamps can walk in fog or
text: twilight.
text: Vamps always sleep in the dirt. Vamps never sleep.
text: Vamps can only die from stake through the heart. Vamps
dialog: only die from Fire.
text: Three bites to turn a victim into a vamp. One bite and the
dialog: victim has to feed from the vamp...
text: Vamps change form -- bats, animals, etc. Vamps absolutely
dialog: can NOT shape-shift.
speaker_heading: ON CHARLIE
text: We see now that he's on a computer in the SCHOOL LIBRARY,
text: isolated behind some stacks.
text: He clicks a link on one of the sites -- which leads him to
text: PETER VINCENT'S website. It's an elaborate interactive site.
dialog: It says that Vincent is a serious student of all things
dialog: occult -- especially VAMPIRES -- and has amassed a vast
dialog: collection of books and artifacts.
text: It also claims that there are different TRIBES of vampires.
scene_heading: ON CHARLIE'S NOTEBOOK
dialog: He writes in big letters
speaker_heading: TRIBES?
scene_heading: PETER VINCENT -- VAMP EXPERT?
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey.
text: Charlie looks up. Amy stands over him, a little wary.
text: Charlie covers his writing and closes his computer screen.
text: He looks like hell. Disheveled, sleep deprived, tense.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You weren't in class. What are you
dialog: working on?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Porn. Hacked it.

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, good. I thought it was

text: Charlie nods. Smiles wanly. Then--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, I'd better...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Get back to your porn. Got it.
text: She looks away, losing patience. Charlie rallies.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. Sorry. I'm just -- I could
dialog: use some coffee.

scene_heading: EXT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- QUAD -- DAY
text: Charlie and Amy sit in the busy quad.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We can't hang out at my house any

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why? What's going on?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's hard to explain. Just...

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: MARK BEN
dialog: Charlie-- Chill out-
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't know what you're talking

dialog: you know.
text: Mark steps in. Calming, reasonable.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're right. Not cool. You're
dialog: worried and it's totally
dialog: understandable.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: But he's better off, man. He'll be
text: happier with the other trolls on
dialog: the shire.
text: That's it. Charlie DECKS MARK. They go to the ground and

text: Mark is bloodied and freaked.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck man!?

speaker_heading: AMY

text: to -- sending her SPINNING.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And if I miss, she'll really be
dialog: dead.
text: The music switches. It's all TENSION. Peter FLINGS a
text: dagger. SCHWACK! The assistant DUCKS as the KNIFE embeds in
text: the board behind her, this close where her head was.
text: She screams! Breaks character.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: SEXY ASSISTANT
dialog: Holy Shit! Pete!
text: Also out of character -- PETER speaks in a thick QUEEN'S
text: ACCENT.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You can't say that!
dialog: (moves to her)
dialog: Stop the-- STOP. CUT!!
text: The music stops. The spinning board stops.
speaker_heading: SEXY ASSISTANT
dialog: You almost tore my extensions out!
dialog: Why do you have to throw a real
dialog: knife!?
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (RE: KNIFE)
dialog: It barely cuts! That board is like
dialog: butter.
text: He tears the MAKEUP appliance off his hand that made it look
text: like he cut himself. The assistant pulls out of her VELCRO
dialog: straps.
speaker_heading: SEXY ASSISTANT
dialog: Everybody else fakes it!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But this looks authentic--
speaker_heading: SEXY ASSISTANT
dialog: Then learn how to throw!
text: She stomps off the stage. Peter can't believe it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Screw this.
text: He starts to stalk off stage. CHARLIE rushes toward him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mr. Vincent! Mr. Vincent--
text: A tech guy moves in on Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Charles Brewster. From the Sun?
dialog: We had an appointment.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't think so. Talk to my guy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We're doing a piece -- "Vampires.
dialog: Separating myth from fact."
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You want a comment? That's a shit
dialog: idea for an article.
text: Peter starts to move off. Charlie, anxious, follows.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Please. I really -- I need your
dialog: expertise. You're the man on this
dialog: stuff, right?
text: Peter sees how desperate Charlie is. Stops.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What is this, like your first
dialog: assignment?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Actually -- yeah.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (takes this in/then)
text: Ten minutes.
scene_heading: INT. PETER VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Peter lives in a two story penthouse at the top of one of the
text: casino hotels that he works in. It's lavish, floor to
dialog: ceiling windows, etc.
text: Still, goth influence reigns. The decor is tacky Haunted
dialog: Mansion all the way.
text: Charlie is shown into the "museum" by Peter's ASSISTANT,
text: ARTHUR, who looks and sounds A LOT LIKE PETER.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Don't touch anything, dude.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/LIBRARY -- NIGHT
text: Charlie enters -- comes face to face with a SNARLING
text: WEREWOLF. He starts. Then realizes it's a life-size model.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ho -- wow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
text: Charlie stands back, takes in the place. It's an amazing
text: combination of FANTASY memorabilia and ACTUAL occult weapons
text: and objects. It seems to go on and on.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Got rooms of this crap. Ebay.
text: Charlie examines a case that holds all kinds of TORTURE
text: DEVICES and battle axes, as well as SPIKED BALL MACES, etc.
text: Cases hold ancient texts and scrolls, haunted objects, etc.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Amazing.
text: Charlie is genuinely impressed. The geek in him can't help
text: it. Peter enters, talks to Arthur--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Midori me.
text: Arthur pours Peter a green drink as Peter pulls off his black
text: wig (bandana attached) and peels off a nude body shirt that
text: has a bunch of TATTOOS printed on it.
text: He steps out of his boots, with three-inch LIFTS. Collapses
text: into an arm chair. He's just another balding, middle-aged
text: guy with bad eyes.
text: Peter downs his drink. Arthur hands him the bottle. Peter
text: looks at Charlie.
text: In truth, Peter's isolated himself to the point that he
dialog: actually welcomes a visitor -- though he'd never admit it.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (RE: MIDORI)
dialog: Looks like pee but I'm hooked. You
dialog: want?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, thanks. Not...on the job.
text: Peter scratches avidly at his crotch.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Leather, it doesn't breath. You
dialog: know? Fucking rashes are killing
dialog: me... So I'm your expert, huh?
dialog: For your vampire thing.
speaker_heading: (BITTER)
dialog: They're all the rage, huh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. I guess... So -- say I want
dialog: to kill one. But really. How how
dialog: would you do it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Depends. You got fire, beheading.
dialog: Or go classic -- stake through the
dialog: heart. Bam!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So all that actually works?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How the fuck do I know.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I thought you're--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I read books, man. You think I'm
dialog: hanging out with Dracula and the
dialog: Easter Bunny?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sorry. No.
text: Charlie realizes he has no choice. He has to reveal more.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I -- I have a personal interest in
dialog: this story.
dialog: (off Peter's look)
dialog: A friend's missing, actually. I
dialog: think one of them got him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Them, meaning a "vampire."
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Jerry. He lives next door to me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: "Jerry?"
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: But it's no joke. If you look at
dialog: these clips, you'll see. They take
dialog: some time to load but...
text: Charlie moves to Peter, shows him his phone. Digs into his
dialog: pocket.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: And I printed up some photos I
dialog: took. In his place. Or lair...
text: Charlie put the photos in front of Peter on the table.
text: Peter's expression closes. He stands, pissed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Arthur!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, come on, I'm--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're a nutjob. Arthur!
text: Charlie deflates -- his desperation showing again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Listen to me. I saw it. I saw him
dialog: kill a girl. She burned up in my
dialog: hands. You have to tell me how to
dialog: stop him.
text: Arthur enters.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Get this loser out of my sight.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know what I saw.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No you don't. See this guy?
text: He gestures to ARTHUR.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: My cousin, Art. He's "me" on
dialog: stage. That's how I teleport.
dialog: People see what they want to see.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (URGENT)
dialog: This is what you've been looking
dialog: for, I promise. I can take you to
text: him, to his place.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: In Clark County Nevada. A hot bed
dialog: of supernatural activity.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes! It's genius. A transient
dialog: population. A town where people
dialog: work all night, sleep all day...
speaker_heading: PETER
text: A town full of con-artists.
dialog: (not buying it)
dialog: No. You're working me, or
dialog: somebody's working you.
text: Charlie's getting angry now.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He already got my friend! I know
dialog: how I sound. But I'm not crazy. I
dialog: didn't want this. I don't want to
dialog: know this. Just tell me what to
dialog: do!
text: Peter feels Charlie's sincerity. For a moment he looks
text: genuinely conflicted. But his expression hardens.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Run.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You heard me.
text: He moves away. But Charlie is on his heels. Peter looks to
text: ARTHUR, nods.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So I save my own skin so he can
dialog: keep killing!? I won't. We have
dialog: to kill him! Please!--
text: Arthur THROWS Charlie out, the door closed firmly behind him.
scene_heading: INT. PETER VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE -- OUTER HALL -- DUSK
text: Charlie stands, shut out. What the hell is he going to do
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE/JERRY'S HOUSE -- DUSK
text: Moving in on the Brewster home, an odd sight is revealed.
text: Every window is draped with strings of GARLIC.
text: Charlie's revealed in his window -- hammering up another long
dialog: rope of the stuff.
text: His gaze falls on JERRY'S HOUSE and we follow it.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- CHARLIE'S ROOM -- DUSK
text: Now we find that Charlie's entire room is decked out in anti-
text: vamp decor. Not just the garlic but crosses and other
dialog: religious pictures, etc.
text: Charlie LOOKS at the clock -- night coming too quickly. He's
text: grimly focused as he starts sharpening a STAKE.
text: A knock. Jane doesn't enter this time. Another knock.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
text: Jane walks in. Takes in the decor.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The whole house looks like that
dialog: show Dark Shadows.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's a gag. For Amy. Long story.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (takes this in/then)
dialog: You like her a lot, don't you?
text: A moment when they could connect. But Charlie just nods.
dialog: Jane's disappointed. Then--
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't use tape on the walls.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Oh. Ed's parents left a few
text: messages, looking for him.
text: Charlie looks up at this. Pained.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay.
text: He goes back to his work. Jane looks at him for a beat, then
text: she starts to go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
text: THE DOORBELL RINGS. Before Jane can really react, Charlie
text: pushes past her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: DON'T. Don't open it.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- DUSK
text: Charlie races downstairs. Stops. AMY is standing in the
dialog: living room.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How'd you get in?!
speaker_heading: AMY
text: It was unlocked.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: MOM! You have to lock the door!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Okay, whatever, listen. You're
dialog: flipping out. Punching out your
dialog: friends and blowing everything off
dialog: and is that a stake?
text: A beat. He forgot he was holding it. He hides it behind his
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No.
text: Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room
text: is decked in more anti-vamp decor.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Look. Even if you're losing it --
dialog: you don't get to blow me off. You
dialog: don't go from something to nothing
dialog: overnight.
speaker_heading: (EMOTIONAL)
dialog: You're not nothing to me, Charlie.
dialog: Whatever's happening, just -- talk
dialog: to me.
text: Charlie takes this in, emotional. But--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can't let you get hurt. You need
dialog: to forget about me for a while.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What? How am I going to get hurt?
dialog: Tell me. Charlie--
text: Now there's another KNOCK at the door. Jane comes downstairs-
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I got it--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: NO. Don't answer it.
text: A tense moment. Another knock.
scene_heading: INNERCUT WITH
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- DUSK
text: JERRY stands at the door. Quietly enraged.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: This is ridiculous--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Jane. It's Jerry from next door--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm telling you, don't answer it!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: This is my house. I'll answer the
dialog: door if I want to.
text: She starts to move to the door again. Charlie blocks her
text: way, desperate.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mom. He murdered Ed and Adam. And
dialog: I have proof.
text: Jane is stunned, at a loss. From the other side of the door--
speaker_heading: JERRY (O.S.)
dialog: Jane? I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Just-- Hold on!
speaker_heading: JERRY (O.S.)
dialog: Now. Your son is harassing me!
text: He pounds on the door. Jane examines Charlie closely.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Charlie. What's happening?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Whatever he says, don't--
speaker_heading: JERRY (O.S.)
dialog: He broke into my house. I'd rather
dialog: not take this to the authorities.
dialog: But I will! He's sick, deluded--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mom.
text: A tense beat... Finally--
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (YELLS/ANGRY)
dialog: Get the authorities! My son is a
dialog: good kid!
text: Charlie sags with relief. A brief look of appreciation
text: passes between Charlie and Jane.
speaker_heading: ON JERRY
text: As he backs away from the door. His expression goes cold.
text: He disappears into the dark.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Charlie races to a window. SEES JERRY MOVE out of sight.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Shit, shit...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What? What is he doing?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Whatever it is, it's not good.
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- FRONT YARD -- NIGHT
text: Jerry stands back, intense. He's got to take care of this
dialog: problem NOW.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Charlie's running from window to window now, trying to see
dialog: what's going on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just -- if we stay in here -- he
dialog: has to give up. He can't get in
text: without an invitation.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: OH--
speaker_heading: (GETTING IT)
dialog: Oh... Really? Like a--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Vampire. Really.
text: Amy and Jane are blown away. Charlie's going crazy.
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT
text: Jerry carries a SHOVEL and A SMALL SAW. He stalks into the
text: Brewster's backyard, where he's hidden from the street.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Jane follows Charlie, worried.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Think about what you're saying--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I have. I've "processed," believe
dialog: me.
text: Jane takes this in. Then SMILES.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Ooooh. This is the gag! For Amy.
dialog: I can't believe you got Jerry to go
dialog: along with it!
text: Charlie stops. Fuck.
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- NIGHT
scene_heading: CLOSE ON JERRY
text: As he starts to DIG UNDERGROUND -- amazingly strong and
dialog: swift.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Charlie hands Amy and Jane both CROSSES on CHAINS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Take these. Put them on. Just do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (HUMORING HIM)
dialog: Okaaaay. Vampire protection!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't think this is funny.
text: But she puts it on.
scene_heading: EXT. BREWSTER BACKYARD -- NIGHT
text: Jerry pulls up the NATURAL GAS LINE that leads to the
text: BREWSTER'S HOUSE. He SAWS IT OPEN AND LIGHTS THE END ON
speaker_heading: FIRE.
scene_heading: INT. BREWSTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM/VARIOUS -- NIGH
text: Hisssssssssss. A strange sounds coming from under the floor.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: WHAT'S THA--
text: BOOM!! The GAS FIREPLACE EXPLODES, the STOVE EXPLODES, THE
text: WATER HEATER ALL EXPLODE at once!!
text: WINDOWS BLOW OUT as Charlie JUMPS on Jane and Amy, dragging
text: them to the ground.
text: The room starts to BURN.
text: Charlie, Amy and Jane are in a panic. They try to put the
dialog: fire out, but it's no use.
text: Charlie stops. A CHILLING SIGHT:
text: Jerry stands on the other side of the blown-out windows. His
text: expression dark. Through the flames he says--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Don't need an invitation if there's
dialog: no house.
text: A beat. Charlie GRABS Amy and Jane and they RUN through the
dialog: house.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BREWSTER GARAGE/STREET - NIGHT
text: y, Charlie and Jane race into the garage
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I can drive--
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I drive!
text: They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Gun it Mom! Go!!!
text: Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it.
text: She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk
text: as she takes off.
text: Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into
text: an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!!
text: They narrowly avoid a head-on collision with a FIRE TRUCK.
speaker_heading: ON JERRY
text: As he sees the dirt bike in the driveway. He jumps on.
dialog: Tries to start it. NO GO. Fuck.
scene_heading: INT. JANE'S CAR -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What did we do!? What does he
dialog: want!?
text: They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING
text: THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW of the car, nearly taking Amy's head
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: HOLY--
text: Everyone reacts. Then the BIKE STARTS - the wheels spinning
text: wildly in the back seat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Amy!
text: Amy's hair gets caught in the spokes - it's horrible as it
text: YANKS part of her hair out.
text: Charlie grabs her away from the bike -- she falls into his
text: arms, crying as JERRY's BIG PICKUP appears in the rear
dialog: windshield.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He's coming!
text: THEY SWERVE OUT THE SHADOW HILLS GATES
scene_heading: EXT. MAJOR STREET -- NIGHT
text: Jane speeds down the street, which is wide and not heavily
dialog: trafficked here.
dialog: Unlike the planned community of Shadow Hills -- now we can
text: see we're surrounded by great expanses of empty DESERT.
text: JERRY'S TRUCK SMASHES REPEATEDLY into JANE'S.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: My brother has a gun!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good to know! Is he here?!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Call the police! Anybody--
text: Jane manages to evade Jerry until --
text: The TRUCK SKIDS in a long arc in front of them and BLOCKS
text: THEM. Jane screeches to a halt.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh hell.
text: In a flash, Jerry is out of the truck and coming for them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: GO! Go! Don't stop!! Go--
text: Charlie steps on the accelerator, grabs the wheel and AIMS
scene_heading: THE CAR AT JERRY.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Charlie!!
text: They RUN JERRY OVER WITH A TERRIBLE THUDDDD!!! Amy and Jane
text: scream. Jane is aghast, stops the car.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God!!
text: Charlie steps on her accelerator foot, the CAR ZOOMS FORWARD.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Are you nuts!? You can't kill that
dialog: guy!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You have no idea.
speaker_heading: (TO JANE)
dialog: It's him or us. Mom. MOM.
text: Jane looks at him -- can feel that he's telling the truth.
text: Charlie's looking around as they speed down the highway, in
text: the rearview. NO JERRY anywhere.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is he? Where'd he go?
text: Everybody looks UP. The roof of the car.
text: BAM! Jerry's hand SHOOTS up through the FLOORBOARD under
text: Jane's feet.
dialog: Jane and Amy SCREAM!
text: CLOSE ON THE FLOOR OF THE CAR
text: JERRY'S EYE glares through the small hole. It's all BLACK.
dialog: No pupil. Freaky.
text: He's TEARING THROUGH METAL from the undercarriage of the car,
text: where he's clinging -- face up.
text: The more he rips away -- the more he reveals his face.
text: His veins and eyes are BLACK. His nose snout-like. And his
text: fangs emerge from lethal rows of jagged teeth, like a SHARK.
dialog: It's shocking, horrible.
text: ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR
text: As Jerry drags over the highway, the pavement grinding away
text: at his clothes and flesh.
text: He reaches through the hole he's made and SLAMS his fist down
text: on the FLOOR BREAK. The car SCREECHES to a sudden halt.
scene_heading: ON CHARLIE, AMY and JANE
text: Screaming even after the car has stopped. Then -- BAM!! The
text: car is REAR-ENDED by another vehicle. It's a MINIVAN.
text: JANE's car is SLAMMED -- the back is a crush of glass and
dialog: metal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: A GRIM MOMENT -- only the sound of hissing air and groaning
text: steel as everyone assesses the damage.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh... Are you-- Jane?
text: Jane is woozy. Hurt.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm okay...
text: Charlie sees that the other car is drivable. The guy inside,
text: a FAMILY MAN, is stunned and pissed. Gets out of his car--
speaker_heading: FAMILY MAN
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing!--
text: Charlie gets out of the car too. Yells, urgent--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: NO! Hey man, stay in your--
text: But it's too late. The guy is met by a HORRIFIC Jerry,
text: hideously torn and bleeding, who appears from UNDER JANE'S
speaker_heading: CAR.
text: In a flash, Jerry grabs the guy and VAMPS, ripping the family
text: man's NECK OUT.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MINIVAN
text: As those "cute" stick figure family decals are splattered
text: with BLOOD.
speaker_heading: AMY AND JANE
text: Now out of the car, react. JERRY IS A FUCKING VAMPIRE.
text: Jerry drops the business man, who's dead as he hits the
text: ground. He moves toward them.
dialog: Charlie looks at Amy and Jane. I told you so.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Charlie urgently grabs them. Shoves them down the highway.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out of here. Run. Run!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: BUT--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Go! I'll catch up! She's hurt,
dialog: get out of here!
text: They back off.
text: Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it
text: as he walks toward Jerry. Jerry keeps his distance, taunting
speaker_heading: HIM--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Let them run. Just makes them
dialog: easier to kill when I'm done with
dialog: you.
text: Ding, ding, ding -- the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the
text: warning bell rings over and over...
text: CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry,
text: backing him off.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I repel you with the power of
dialog: Christ the Lord.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Do you? Really? When did you take
dialog: your last confession?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Get back...
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: That's a mighty big cross you have
dialog: there. Question is -- do you
dialog: actually know how to use it?
text: Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's
text: open car door.
text: But Jerry's on him -- hands BURNING as he rips the cross from
text: Charlie and shatters it with his hand.
text: Then he TOSSES Charlie, who flies and hits JANE'S CAR, then
text: crumples to the ground.
text: Jerry gets Charlie around the neck -- holds a sharp,
text: splintered end of the broken cross against Charlie's chest.
text: The wood still burns into Jerry's hand, but Jerry holds on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ever take one of these in the
dialog: chest? I have.
text: Charlie struggles, terrified.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: But they missed the heart.
dialog: Rigggght... . here. Easy
dialog: measurement.
text: Jerry positions the "stake" right over Charlie's heart.
text: Charlie winces. Terrified and overpowered.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shouldn't have been so nosey.
text: Jerry's about to plunge the STAKE through Charlie's heart
text: when a THICK WOOD STAKE comes through Jerry's SHOULDER.
text: Jerry HOWLS, falls off Charlie and we see that he's been
text: staked by the business end of a REAL ESTATE SIGN.
text: JANE stands over them, quaking with fear and adrenaline.
text: Amy's right behind her with a CROWBAR.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Leave my kid alone.
text: Jane collapses, and we see that there's a lot of BLOOD on the
text: back of her head.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Mom!
text: Jerry's in agony as he stumbles away, pulls the sign post out
text: of his shoulder.
text: Charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car.
text: Amy dives into the car with them.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on come on come on...
text: IT LURCHES forward, then goes. Metal scraping the ground,
text: raining glass... but it RUNS.
text: They start to bolt when BAM! JERRY STANDS UP right in front
text: of the car, LUNGES AT THEM. CHARLIE RUNS OVER JERRY'S BODY
text: AGAIN. They speed off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72
text: Jerry writhes in the middle of the road. But even as he
text: does, he HEALS. His body knitting itself back together...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Charlie's giving a report to a pair of uniformed cops.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: So a gas leak caused the fire at
dialog: your home and...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: My mom didn't feel right, we were
text: trying to get her to the hospital.
dialog: It was stupid to let her drive.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Yeah it was. And driver who rear-
dialog: ended you, you get the exact make
dialog: and name of the van?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It wasn't there when you got there?
speaker_heading: COP #2
text: Hit and run. Happens all the time.
text: Charlie stifles his surprise. Nods.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON AMY
text: On her cell, pacing as she eyes Charlie with the cops.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We won't stay up all night. Bee
dialog: and Cara need help with Trig --
dialog: it's not a party. Okay. Okay...
speaker_heading: (THEN/EMOTIONAL)
dialog: Mom? I love you.
text: She stops at the open door of a hospital ROOM. Her gaze
scene_heading: FALLING ON--
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Who lies motionless in a bed. A doctor checks her chart.
text: AMY hangs up. Charlie, finished with the cops, joins her.
text: They're both pained as they look at Jane.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe you should have said
dialog: something to the police.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Like what? A vampire moved next
dialog: door, borrowed some beer, ate a
dialog: stripper and then blew up our house
dialog: because we wouldn't invite him in?
text: Amy looks at him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Okay.
text: The DOCTOR approaches.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You should get some rest.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She's going to wake up, right?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Assuming the swelling is minimal, I
dialog: hope so.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But you don't know.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Not yet. We need to give it time.
text: The doctor puts a hand on Charlie's shoulder, leaves.
text: Charlie turns away, upset. Amy watches, feeling helpless.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/LIBRARY -- NIGHT
text: Peter, in a bathrobe, looks out his floor-to-ceiling windows
text: at the lights of the strip.
text: The ASSISTANT from the show toddles out on high heels and a
text: ridiculous mini-dress. Her hair is messy, post sex.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Bye babe. Good show tonight.
text: He's barely paying attention.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You were late again on "The Devil's
dialog: Torture Chamber."
text: But she's gone.
text: A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he
text: does he notices the PHOTOS Charlie took at Jerry's place.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
text: Absently, he sifts through them. Stops.
text: He picks up the one of the INSIGNIA.
text: Peter reacts. Stunned. This means something to him.
text: He goes to a WALL SAFE. Opens it. Hidden inside are a bunch
text: of personal items. Some from his childhood. Old photos of
dialog: his mother and father...
text: And a hand-drawn sketch, in a youthful scrawl, of THE
text: INSIGNIA. He puts the two side by side. They MATCH.
text: Off PETER, looking at the sketches. Haunted.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL -- JANE'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Charlie and Amy sit on a tiny couch. Both are scared and
dialog: regretful.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is my fault.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You didn't make any of it happen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Ed came to me. I turned my back on
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: How were you supposed to believe
dialog: him? None of it makes sense.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He did talk a lot of demented crap.
dialog: (but.. )
dialog: He was my best friend. He asked
dialog: me, begged me, to believe him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: People change. Everybody--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah they do. I turned into a
dialog: dick. I figured my dweeb past, not
dialog: big with the ladies.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (WRY)
dialog: So you're saying this is my fault.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I wanted you to like me. I tried
dialog: to erase Ed -- all of it. I know
dialog: how that feels.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I knew you were a dweeb.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: You think I want a "dude" like Mark
dialog: or Ben? I like that you're
dialog: different... It didn't hurt that
dialog: your skin cleared up.
text: She smiles, takes his hand. A sweet, connected moment. Then
text: something alarming occurs to Amy:
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't believe we didn't have sex.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: AMY-
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No, seriously. I'm going to die a
dialog: virgin? Me? How did this happen?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We're not going to die--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But what if we do? Let's do it.
dialog: Now. The bathroom. Charlie.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think we should kill the vampire
dialog: first. I'll perform much better.
text: They laugh -- trying not to cry. Then:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh my God, Charlie. What are we
dialog: going to do?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We're going to fight.
text: Then Charlie's phone rings. He answers.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INNERCUT WITH:

scene_heading: INT. PETER'S VINCENT'S PENTHOUSE -- LIBRARY -- NIGHT
text: Peter stands with the photo of the insignia in hand.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I can help you. My place. One
dialog: hour.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY
text: A few minutes later. Charlie and Amy move out of Jane's
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: The Peter Vincent?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Under-whelming, believe me. But
dialog: he's what we've got.
text: They close Jane's door and we see that it's COVERED in
text: CROSSES of every shape and size. It's quite a spectacle.
text: A nurse passes, looks at Charlie and Amy quizzically.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: My mom is very religious.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/LIBRARY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
speaker_heading: A MIDORI cocktail
text: WIDEN to reveal that PETER is pouring himself a whopper. Amy
text: and Charlie sit nearby.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'll tell you what I know, but
dialog: that's it. Don't expect me to join
dialog: your Scooby gang.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Anything. I'll take it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I found the origin of that insignia
dialog: you showed me. It's a species that
dialog: originated in the Mediterranean.
dialog: They nest in the earth -- explains
dialog: that hole you saw. And they kill
dialog: slowly, keep their victims alive
dialog: for days.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (GRIM)
dialog: "Snackers."
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So -- they turn all of them?
dialog: (off Amy's look)
dialog: Make their victims into vampires.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know. I read.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: No. It takes a while before they
dialog: complete the change. They usually
dialog: finish them off before that.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So how do you kill these guys, this
dialog: "tribe"?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Usual stuff. But it's a strong
dialog: breed. You need a plan--
text: A VOICE interrupts over an intercom. It's ARTHUR, Peter's
dialog: assistant.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (O.S.)
dialog: Delivery. Guy says you need to
dialog: sign for something.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Send him in.
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: I order things when I've had a few
dialog: cocktails. It's a--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (ALARMED)
dialog: Wait. You get deliveries this
dialog: late?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't know. Maybe--
text: Charlie stands.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. You said he could come in.
dialog: The delivery guy. That's--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What? Charlie--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
text: An invitation, airhead.
text: They turn and see EVIL ED, in one of Jerry's "uniforms."
text: It's clear he's changed. A glint in the eye, more muscular.
text: Charlie takes Ed in, pained. Ed grins at him.
text: Ed flips open a cell phone. Dials.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Looking at them now. Yes sir.
dialog: (hangs up/then)
text: He's modern, Jerry, dispensed with
dialog: all that "master" stuff.
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: Hey bud.
text: Charlie steps in front of Amy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You've got a problem, keep it with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Problem? You let him get me, man.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (ANGUISHED)
speaker_heading: I KNOW--
text: Ed is CREEPING TOWARD Charlie.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: CHARLIE--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You let him turn me into this.
text: At that, ED VAMPS. Black eyes, black veins. Those teeth.
dialog: It's terrifying.
text: SMASH!! One of the cabinets shatters. Ed, Charlie and Amy
text: spin to see PETER standing by the open collection case. A
text: SMALL NAIL in his hand. He's shaking like a leaf.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Stay away, demon.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (amused/queens accent)
dialog: "Stay awaaaay, demon!"
text: Ed closes in on Peter. Peter looks to Charlie. It's real.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatcha got there? Itsy bitsy
dialog: little stakey?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Crucifixion nail. Lethal to you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Old school. Nice. Got to get
dialog: pretty close to use it, though.
text: Peter looks at the short piece of metal in his hand. Fuck.
text: HE BOLTS down the nearest hallway.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh uh. No you don't.
text: ED BOLTS AFTER PETER. Charlie and Amy race the other way.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The elevator!
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Peter pushes a BUTTON on a doorway, bolts into a PANIC ROOM.
text: Ed is on his heels, but JUST MISSES grabbing Peter before the
text: door closes.
text: The POWERFUL DOOR CLOSES ON ED'S ARM, crushes it. ED HOWLS
text: as his arm SEVERS. The door LOCKS.
text: But what doesn't kill him makes him stronger and crazier.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: A panic room!? You better panic,
dialog: loser! You better watch your neck!
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Peter's in shock -- watching Ed's severed arm twitch on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: Prince of darkness is a little baby
dialog: man! I love it! All the fat
dialog: chicks in your fan club are gonna
dialog: be so bummed!
text: He hears ED flipping out, but ED DOESN'T SHOW UP ON THE
scene_heading: SECURITY SCREEN.

scene_heading: INT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- ENTRY AREA -- NIGHT
text: Charlie runs with Amy to the ELEVATOR. The CONTROL BOX has
text: been ripped from the wall. They're trapped.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh my God, oh my God...
text: Amy's starting to lose it. Charlie grabs her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look at me. Stop.
speaker_heading: (SHE DOES)
dialog: There's another way out of here.
dialog: And there are a million things to
dialog: fight with in here. Understand?
dialog: We're going to make it.
text: Amy pulls herself together. Nods. They RUN.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM" LIBRARY -- VARIOUS -- NIGHT
text: CHARLIE AND AMY race through the ROOMS of Peter's extensive
dialog: collection.
scene_heading: INNERCUT WITH ED
text: Tracking them -- not far behind, his stub of an arm bleeding
text: and HEALING as he goes.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Give it up, Chuck! You're dead.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: If you hadn't ended up such a dick,
dialog: I might have tricked you out. We
dialog: could have rocked this evil shit!
dialog: But you blew it. Nothing but the
dialog: big dirt nap for you and your lady.
speaker_heading: AMY AND CHARLIE
text: Round a corner -- it's a dead-end. They see a large antique
text: CONFESSIONAL at one end of the room.
speaker_heading: ON ED
text: As he comes around the same corner a moment later. AMY and
text: CHARLIE are NOWHERE to be seen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S HIGH RISE LOBBY -- NIGHT
text: Jerry enters, his appearance different. Healing from the car
text: incident has taken it out of him.
text: He's pale and weakened -- and still has lots of cuts and
dialog: bruises.
text: He's also changed into new clothes, jeans and a SWEATER.
text: We see THE SAME GUARD that Charlie spoke to earlier.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sign in, please.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I know where I'm going.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Sign in. No exceptions.
text: Jerry ignores him, keeps moving toward the elevator.
speaker_heading: GUARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! I'm talking to you. Sign in,
dialog: or you're not going nowhere.
text: Jerry turns. Slow and deliberate. Expression cold.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/CONFESSIONAL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Ed is MOVING IN ON the CONFESSIONAL. Sees MOVEMENT behind
text: the curtain.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I expected more of a fight. Girl's
dialog: made you lazy in the head.
dialog: Pussy'll do that.
text: ED YANKS the curtain on the confessional open.
text: ARTHUR hides there, terrified.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at that. Vincent's got a
dialog: Vincent.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: A large cabinet on the other side of the room. AMY AND

text: SCREAMS as Ed rips ARTHUR apart.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
text: CHARLIE holds AMY close, muffling her sobs.
text: Blood seeps across the floor, under their feet...
speaker_heading: ON ED
text: His face bloodied. Eyes wild. The trembling body of ARTHUR
text: on the ground at his feet.
text: Ed turns Arthur over. Arthur's still breathing, reaches for
text: something around his neck. A cross? No, it's a chain with
text: PICTURES of sweet-faced children on silver charms.
speaker_heading: HE PLEADS--
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: .I have ...kids ...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Had.
text: Ed lifts Arthur off his feet and chokes him with one hand...
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't take it personal. I'd eat
dialog: you -- but I'm saving my appetite.
text: Arthur's turning a horrible purple, eyes bulging... Ed
text: breaks his neck with a HORRIBLE WRENCHING CRUNCH. Drops him.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
text: Dinner with an old friend.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: A door to a STAIRWELL opens, Jerry steps into a hall. He
text: looks healthy again. Robust.
text: He wipes a small smear of blood from his mouth.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/CONFESSIONAL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: AMY AND CHARLIE hold their breath as ED looks around the
text: room. Arthur is motionless at his feet now.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know you're here. I can hear you
dialog: breathing. It's totally cool.
text: He laughs, hyper. Excited.
text: CHARLIE EYES A CASE WITH A BATTLE AXE
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Sooo, I take out the prom king and
dialog: queen? Embarrassment of riches!
text: CHARLIE SHOVES the case he hides behind with Amy over ONTO
text: ED. Yells to Amy--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: GO!
text: Amy bolts from the room as Charlie punches the glass out on
text: another case that holds the battle axe. He grabs the weapon.
text: Ed SHOVES the cabinet off him with his good hand, stands.
text: Charlie and Ed face off.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mano e...one mano. Piece of cake.
dialog: Cause I'm a God Damned killing
dialog: machine, and you're like all the
dialog: Clark High big shots -- nothing.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: You picked the wrong side, man.
text: Ed lashes out, slicing CHARLIE on the arm with his SHARP
text: NAILS. Charlie yells, but holds his ground.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I didn't pick--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You didn't think.
text: Charlie's wrecked about what he has to do.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know. I'm sorry.
text: Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING
text: around the room, avoiding Charlie's swings as he clings to
text: walls and, impossibly, THE CEILING.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Steeeerike! Call that a swing,
dialog: Slugger?
text: Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him.
text: Finally, Charlie connects with ED'S NECK. Blood flies,
text: Charlie can't look -- anguished.
speaker_heading: ED (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on! You're not even trying.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
text: Charlie looks back, Ed's HEAD is only HALF OFF. He's
text: grinning even as he bleeds everywhere. It's macabre,
dialog: horrible.
text: Ed SLASHES Charlie again with his claw-like nails. Charlie
text: cries out.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S LIBRARY/"MUSEUM" -- NIGHT
text: Amy can hear Charlie yell.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Charlie!
text: She smashes into one GLASS CABINET after another, pulling out
text: and pocketing everything she can find to fight ED. Finds a
text: GUN loaded with silver bullets...
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You are something, aren't you?
text: Amy spins. Jerry's closing in on her. Beautiful, seductive.
text: She's shaking, terrorized. BAM, BAM, BAM!!
text: She empties the GUN into JERRY anyway. It knocks him back,
text: but he's still standing. He picks a silver bullet out of his
text: shoulder, unimpressed.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Werewolves.
text: Amy FLINGS holy water in his face.
text: JERRY SCREAMS, burns.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Vampires.
dialog: She RUNS.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S "MUSEUM"/CONFESSIONAL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: ED is already starting to heal as he and Charlie continue to
text: fight. But his head still flops hideously to one side.
speaker_heading: ED
text: Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles.
dialog: Hard to cut.
text: Charlie takes another swing with his axe. Ed jumps out of
dialog: the way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
text: Ed manages to get Charlie in a one-arm embrace of sorts,
text: positions himself so he can BITE HIS NECK.
speaker_heading: ED (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this weird for you too? I feel
dialog: like such a homo--
text: Charlie FLIPS ED -- they are wrestling when Charlie sees AMY
text: approaching with A SPIKED MACE. Charlie DUCKS and AMY
text: smashes ED in the head. Hard.
text: Charlie grabs a long, sharp piece of the shattered wooden
dialog: cabinet.
text: Ed is on the ground. Moaning, laughing. Charlie has his
text: shot. But he hesitates.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Do it. Charlie!
text: Charlie's frozen.
text: Ed starts to get up, his head a mess. It's now or never.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Wow. Bimbo has some juice--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Jerry's here. He's coming!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Ed/pained)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: WHAP, Charlie stakes ED in the heart. Ed looks at Charlie
dialog: with surprise...
text: Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment --
text: he looks like himself again.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I wasn't even a badass vamp. I was
dialog: his Renfield. Funny if you--
text: Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY, his WHOLE BODY moving so
text: impossibly fast he's little more than a BLUR...
text: Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
text: Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt.
text: Amy grabs him. Pulls him out of the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I found the stairs. Come on.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: JERRY, VAMP-FACED and recovering from the holy water, sees
text: AMY and CHARLIE running up ahead.
text: He sprints after them. Charlie sees him and TOPPLES A GIANT
text: FIGURINE in his path, as well as cabinets, etc...
text: They slow Jerry down enough to get slightly ahead.
speaker_heading: AMY
scene_heading: OVER HERE--
text: She flings the door to the stairwell open and they RACE DOWN
text: THE STAIRS.
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Peter sits huddled in a corner, ashamed and shaking.
text: The SECURITY CAMERA flicks through different rooms, until it
text: lands on his dead cousin, ARTHUR.
text: It's like Peter's looking at his own mutilated corpse.
text: OFF PETER, terrified.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO -- NIGHT
text: Amy and Charlie emerge from the stairway.
text: They find themselves ON THE FLOOR of a HARD ROCK TYPE CASINO,
text: which is on the bottom of the building where Peter lives.
text: Amy slows as they fold into the crowds. Relieved.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Stop. Stop, I need to--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not now. He's coming for us.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: He can't kill us, not here--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who's going to notice? Who's going
dialog: to care? Amy, look around--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
text: Amy takes in the people on the floor. Drunk, oblivious. Two
text: guys YELL and FIGHT at a craps table. A couple makes out in
text: a dark corner, etc. It's loud, chaotic.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, God...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Keep moving. Come on.
text: Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now, moving
text: toward them in the crowd. They meet eyes.
text: Charlie grabs Amy, scans for someplace to hide. He spots a
text: nightclub -- "REFLECTIONS".
text: The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit
dialog: diamond.
speaker_heading: ON JERRY
text: Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club.
scene_heading: INT. REFLECTIONS - NIGHT
text: The inside of the club is made up of MIRRORS AND WINDOWS.
text: The dance floor is PACKED. All writhing bodies and sweaty
dialog: abandon.
text: It's dizzying, disorienting.
text: Charlie sees JERRY enter, look around for them. The best bet
dialog: to get lost is to dive into the crowd.
text: Charlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the
text: different levels of the club are like a maze. Glass
text: staircases lead to mirrored balconies...
text: A hopped-up DJ climbs up on a balcony, starts throwing t-
text: shirts into the crowd.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Tequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh!
text: The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward...
text: Someone bumps Amy and Charlie and they lose hands.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Charlie!
text: Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way -- tries to
text: dance with him. He pushes past her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Amy? Amy!
text: Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over
text: again in a series of mirrors -- the infinity effect.
text: It's dizzying, disorienting.
text: THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd,
text: disappearing behind mirrored columns, reemerging...
text: Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESN'T REFLECT in the mirrors
text: around them. Instead the crowd parts as if by magic.
text: Jerry's heading straight toward--
speaker_heading: AMY
text: who's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd. She's
text: spinning, looking desperately for Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Amy!
text: Charlie's frantically pushing toward her. But the CRUSH of
text: people makes it nearly impossible to gain ground.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON AMY
text: As a HAND slips into hers. She turns, relieved, to find--
speaker_heading: JERRY
text: Holding her with a firm grip.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No. No!
text: Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from
text: CHARLIE, toward ramp that leads to another dance floor.
text: Jerry laughs, throws her over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Help!!
text: A GUY in the crowd high-fives him. All part of another crazy
dialog: night in Vegas.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Go get her, man!
text: AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror -- she
text: appears to be FLOATING above the people.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Help me! Help!!
text: CHARLIE can SEE HER, but can't get to her. The crowd is
text: indifferent to her cries.
text: Charlie grabs his cell -- hits a button. It dials, then--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Peter! We're in the casino, the
dialog: club! Jerry's got Amy! He's got
speaker_heading: HER--
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Peter's holding his cell. It's ringing.
text: He hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. REFLECTIONS -- SECOND STORY -- CONT.
text: Jerry, hidden away from Charlie now, puts Amy down. She
text: tries to run, but he holds her tight.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Charlie's coming, he'll find me--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm counting on it.
text: Amy SPITS on him. Jerry reacts -- a flash of RAGE and he
text: exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
text: He grips her harder, sways with her to the music. Leans
text: close to her ear, seductive.
text: His predatory skills in high gear.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You just need a taste. You'll see.
dialog: It can be like a dream.
text: Jerry draws a nail over his wrist, draws a line of blood. He
text: puts his mouth over the cut, bloodying it.
text: He forces her into a DEEP KISS. She struggles mightily --
text: but then her body relaxes, as if she's been sedated.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's it... Good girl.
text: JERRY looks up sees CHARLIE coming toward them.
text: But Amy's altered now. Staring into Jerry's eyes like a
dialog: child.
text: CHARLIE'S GETTING CLOSER when--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Amy! No!--
text: BAM! A hand falls on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: A DOORMAN
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: How'd you get in here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You have to help me. That guy,
dialog: he's going to kill her, he's a
speaker_heading: KILLER--
text: The doorman glances at JERRY and AMY. Jerry stokes Charlie's
text: anguish -- running his hands over Amy's ass, kissing her
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Yeah? Then she's liking it.
text: Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You don't understand!--
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: ID. Then you can tell me your
dialog: whole sad story--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No! There's no time-- Amy!!
text: Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the
text: doorman has a good grip, pulls him back.
speaker_heading: JERRY
text: Sees that CHARLIE is restrained.
text: Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs
text: exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman -- and enjoying it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: No! NO!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE'S POV
text: As he's being dragged away -- JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY.
dialog: It's a nightmare.
text: Charlie loses it, screaming and flailing. But there is no
text: helping her.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S HIGH RISE -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Peter packs a bag, getting out of town.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (O.S.)
dialog: I see you got my message.
text: Peter turns. Sees Charlie standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How'd you get in here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Security's a little lax. Everybody
dialog: got their throat ripped out.
text: Peter backs away as Charlie moves in.
text: Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a
dialog: decade in one night.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You too? He change you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look at your monitor.
text: PETER turns to a security monitor in his closet. Charlie
text: SHOWS UP ON THE SCREEN.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know if Amy's alive or dead
dialog: or turned -- but he's got her. My
dialog: mom may not make it. And Ed...
speaker_heading: (COLD)
dialog: I'm going to end him, or he's going
dialog: to end me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: One way or the other, that's how
dialog: it's going to be and you're going
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't you get what this is?
text: There's no fighting. There's only
dialog: surviving, if you're lucky--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You call this surviving? If you
dialog: live and we all die, you think
dialog: you'll ever be able to get us out
dialog: of your head?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know I won't. I never could --
dialog: not after the first time.
text: This stops Charlie.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I told myself I probably made it
dialog: up. I was a kid. Maybe it was
dialog: easier to believe in monsters...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Made what up?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The vampire who killed my parents,
dialog: my brothers. But not me. I hid.
text: Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense.
text: Peter continues, haunted--
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't collect all this stuff for
dialog: fun. I thought maybe I could find
dialog: the tribe, "avenge" my people.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So do it. We'll go in at dawn.
dialog: He's got to rest sometime--
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (HARD)
dialog: It's not like that. When I was a
dialog: kid, I hid because I wanted to
dialog: live. I still do! This isn't the
dialog: comics. You want to be a dead
dialog: hero. Good for you. But I'm out.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I'm a coward. I'm just a
dialog: realist.
text: Moment of hesitation for Charlie. Has he been affected by
dialog: Peter's words? Then--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So you bail on people, erase them.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I don't want to make it to
dialog: tomorrow, not if you're the kind of
dialog: man I have to be.
text: A moment. Peter is full of self-loathing, but resolved.
text: Charlie turns to leave.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Wait.
text: Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from
text: WHITE WOOD. He hands it to Charlie.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Blessed by Saint Michael. Kill a
dialog: vampire with it -- it's supposed to
dialog: turn his victims back. If Amy's
dialog: changed, you can still save her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (RE: STAKE)
dialog: If it's for real.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who knows what's for real any more.
text: Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him--
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: There's no guarantee he'll be
text: asleep during the day. He's
text: housebound, not hibernating.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll figure it out.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, you need a plan. To stake him,
dialog: you have to get close -- he's
dialog: stronger than you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Holy water?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Slow him down. Won't stop him.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Torch him, you'll have a few good
text: minutes before he really goes up.
dialog: Believe me, a vampire on fire isn't
text: thinking clearly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But if he's on fire, how do I get
dialog: close enough to stake him?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Fuck.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (POINTED)
dialog: You just worry about yourself.
text: With that, Charlie leaves.
text: Off PETER. Disgusted with himself.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT/DAY
text: Charlie sits by Jane's bedside. She's still comatose.
text: We move closer and see that Charlie's drawing a MAP OF
text: JERRY'S HOUSE on some scrap paper -- laying it out from
dialog: memory as best he can.
text: He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA
text: As Charlie plots, he talks to Jane -- his silent confidante.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Those rooms upstairs, that's
dialog: probably where he's got Amy.
dialog: I get her out, assuming she's--
speaker_heading: (NOT DEAD)
dialog: Then I have to get him on the
dialog: ropes.
text: He thinks... Then looks up, an idea occurring. Jane lies
text: there peacefully.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to go.
text: More energized, Charlie stands and gathers his things.
text: He stops, contemplates his mother for a moment -- regretful.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm coming back for you, Mom.
scene_heading: INT. ARMY/NAVY STORE -- DAY
text: Charlie buys FIREPROOF CLOTHING, a small open-flame lighter,
text: and a SPRAY CANISTER like the kind an exterminator uses.
text: The guy at the counter looks Charlie up and down. Charlie
text: takes this in. Finally, Charlie's like -- fuck it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
text: Going to kill a vampire.
text: The guy looks at him. Then--
speaker_heading: STORE GUY
dialog: Good for you.
text: The store guy waits. Charlie hands over his money.
scene_heading: EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE - DAY
scene_heading: ON JERRY'S HOUSE
text: LOOMING, silhouetted against early morning light. Next to
text: it, Charlie's house stands in charred ruins.
text: CHARLIE stands on the front lawn, contemplating the houses.
text: He wears fireproof clothes, has stakes and crosses strapped
text: to him, holsters made out of duct-tape...
text: Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister. And he holds
text: a crowbar in a free hand. He looks like something out of one
dialog: of Ed's graphic novels.
text: Before he enters, Charlie DOUSES HIMSELF IN HOLY WATER.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let's do this shit.
text: He swallows hard, scared but determined.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- FIRST FLOOR -- DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE ON WET FOOTPRINTS
text: Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house.
text: The blacked-out windows give the place a gray, stifled air.
text: Behind Charlie, we see that the front door has been broken
text: open with the crow bar.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: Charlie anxiously looks around for Jerry -- fully expecting
text: him to jump out and go for his throat...
text: He takes the stairs up to the second floor, two at a time.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Charlie moves down the hall, stops at some of the small
text: rooms. Looks in.
speaker_heading: NO AMY
text: Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the
text: door for yet another room.
text: AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's
text: not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: AMY--
text: Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns...
text: And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck -- she looks
text: normal. She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down.
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: CHARLIE--
text: She reaches through the window. They link hands, emotional.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You shouldn't be here--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't know. He dumped me here.
dialog: I'm bait. He said so--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'll survive. Please get out of
dialog: here. He's too strong--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm stronger.
speaker_heading: (WAVERING)
dialog: In a nerd power way. You know...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: He reaches into his jacket, pulls out a CROSS.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take this. It should--
text: He looks up. AMY IS GONE. Disappeared.
text: Charlie, reacts. Calls out in a hushed panic--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Amy? Amy!?
text: Nothing. It's like she vaporized.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- DAY
text: Charlie races down a hallway, looking for ANY.
text: He tries door after door that won't open.
text: He finally finds one door that's unlocked, rushes through --
text: almost FALLS through an open floor in an unfinished portion
dialog: of the house.
text: Jerry's building more cells.
text: Charlie backs out of the doorway, turns a corner and BAM!
text: He runs into JERRY. No, wait -- it's PETER.
text: He's not wearing his wig, etc. But he's cleaned up and
text: standing tall. Dressed all in black.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Shit! You--
speaker_heading: PETER CHARLIE
dialog: Sorry-- How'd you--
text: A beat. Then:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Guess I don't want to be a man like
dialog: me either.
text: Peter opens his leather coat -- it's loaded with weapons.
text: And a flask. Peter grins.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's kill something.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (RE: FLASK)
dialog: You reek. Midori?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Don't get greedy. I'm here.
speaker_heading: (THEN/PROUD)
dialog: And I found something else. From
dialog: my collection. Powerful shit.
text: From around his back, he reveals A DOUBLE-BARRELLED SHOTGUN
text: with a CROSS MOUNTED ON THE BARREL.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wooden bullets? Nice.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, you think I'm fucking MacGyver?
dialog: Bullet, bullets. They'll buy us
dialog: some time.
text: Charlie is grateful, but now's not the time for man hugs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We have to find Amy. She was in a
dialog: room upstairs, then she just
dialog: disappeared. This house--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What do you mean she "disappeared?"
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: She was there. I looked away,
text: looked back -- she was gone.
text: Peter takes this in.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Show me where.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- AMY'S ROOM -- DAY
text: Peter and Charlie pry open the door to the room where Amy was
text: held. Peter walks over the floor -- finds a TRAP DOOR.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Floor trap. I use it all the time.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where does it go?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Only one way to find out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: Peter lowers himself into the hole under the trap door--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wait -- you're going in?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: See that? Like a great date. Get
dialog: me drunk and I'll try anything.
text: Peter lets go and FALLS. Charlie steels himself, goes in
text: after him.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY
text: THUD! Charlie and Peter land painfully on a dirt floor.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Ow, crap...
text: They look around -- eyes adjusting. There's barely any
text: light.
text: They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt
text: and the main story of the house is held up by numerous
scene_heading: SUPPORT POSTS.
text: At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to
dialog: another room/storage area.
speaker_heading: ON CHARLIE
text: As he sees something. Stops.
text: A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave.
text: Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You uncover him. I'll light him
text: up, then stake him.
text: Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face.
text: Peter looks at him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Flame retardant.
text: They're standing over the grave now. Both nervous.
text: Charlie nods to Peter. Peter does his best to hold the
text: shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his
text: free hand. He's shaking.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
text: After a moment Peter UNCOVERS PART OF THE BODY. Then he
text: moves up toward the face...
text: Charlie douses the body with liquid from the canister.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO PETER)
dialog: Gas.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You should be a magician.
text: As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches
dialog: for his STAKE--
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop! No--
text: CHARLIE stops JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO TOSS the match.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is that?
text: IT'S ADAM, sleeping in a shallow dirt grave.
text: Charlie reacts. Holy shit. He pushes his mask back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Adam. I know him. Knew him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Shh. Don't wake him up, for
speaker_heading: CHRIST'S--
text: Peter stops. He's looking over Charlie's shoulder,
text: horrified.
text: In the dirt behind CHARLIE are MORE GRAVES. Eight or ten at
text: least. Charlie turns. Sees the graves.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: You know them too?
text: Charlie reacts, stunned.
text: Peter moves to another grave, uncovers another sleeping face.
text: And then another. A hulking man, a suburban mom...
text: Charlie uncovers another body. Stops, chilled.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ms. Granada. My geometry teacher.
speaker_heading: (RUEFUL)
dialog: She was hard up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How about we go back to my "run
dialog: away" plan?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (IGNORING HIM)
dialog: We can't burn Jerry out. There's
dialog: no way we'll get all these people
dialog: out if the house goes up.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I thought you're here for Amy.
dialog: (off Charlie's look)
dialog: Great. Right. Save the Geometry--
text: A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin -- it's
text: coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat.
text: They're both petrified as they move toward the door.
text: Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along
dialog: with the stake.
text: They creep toward the door.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON CHARLIE
text: Charlie puts his hand on the doorknob... Turns it...
text: WHAMP! -- Charlie's VIOLENTLY SHOVED THROUGH THE DOOR into
speaker_heading: the STORAGE AREA
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S STORAGE AREA -- DAY
text: Charlie hits the dirt hard.
text: The door SLAMS SHUT AND LOCKS BEHIND HIM. He's in a smaller
text: room with a LARGE DIRT GRAVE in the middle. Jerry's grave.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY
text: Peter's confronted by JERRY. Who smiles darkly.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You look bigger on TV.
text: Peter fires the shotgun, BLAM!
text: But he misses Jerry and the power of the blast sends PETER
text: HURTLING BACKWARD.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE AREA -- DAY
text: Charlie reacts to the blast -- but sees that ST. MICHAEL'S
text: STAKE has fallen from his hand and rolled to the edge of the
dialog: grave.
text: He cautiously moves to retrieve it...
text: He stops as he sees A FIGURE emerge from the dark. AMY.
text: Her clothes are torn now, a thin trickle of blood runs down
text: her neck. She looks impossibly sexy. Her hair, her eyes,
text: her lips -- all shining and full.
text: Forgetting himself, he goes to her. Pulls her into his arms.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Amy, God...
text: She clings to him, near tears.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Charlie.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY
text: Peter scrambles on the ground, SHOTGUN trained on JERRY --
text: who moves toward him calmly. The cross on the gun the only
text: thing holding him back.
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: Peter fires again -- grazes JERRY.
speaker_heading: JERRY
text: In pain, he TRANSFORMS and VAMPS before our eyes with a blood-
text: curdling yell. It's chilling.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON GRAVES
text: One by one, the TRIBE of vampires wake. ADAM, MS. GRANADA...
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE AREA -- DAY
text: Amy pulls away from Charlie -- says:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You should have run with me while
dialog: we had the chance. You should have
dialog: saved me, Charlie.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
text: Charlie takes this in, pained. Then--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: It's not too late.
text: She brings her lips close to his ear. Rasps...
speaker_heading: AMY
text: It is. He's inside me now.
text: Her EYES GO DARK -- fingernails grow SHARP and dig into
text: Charlie. He feels the change.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: AMY--
text: Charlie shoves her off, hard. But she holds him tight -- and
text: they TUMBLE INTO THE GRAVE.
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY
text: JERRY, backed by ADAM, MS. GRANADA and a handful of other
text: vampires, closes in on PETER.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It's over, guy. Charlie -- his
text: girl's having her way with him.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
text: She's way out of his league anyway.
text: Peter, trapped, won't be able to keep them at bay much
dialog: longer.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Stop! Stop!
text: Desperate, he BLASTS them again. Hits one on the shoulder.
dialog: But it's not stopping them.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: And your aim--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You don't get it! I'm on your
dialog: side.
text: Peter smiles a little. Shows his rows of SHARP FANGS.
text: Jerry and the others stop. What?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE AREA -- DAY
text: Amy and Charlie struggle. He reaches for his cross -- but
text: she throws him off her with a violent HISS.
text: Charlie gets his first look at AMY in full VAMPIRE glory.
text: She's even more freaky looking than Jerry or Ed. Her face is
text: nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp
text: teeth. Her eyes are crazed and blood-red.
text: It's gruesome and terrifying.
text: Charlie sees THE STAKE at the lip of the hole. Dives for it.
text: Amy's on him in a flash. She throws him to the ground. He's
text: got the STAKE in hand. Ready to strike.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You wouldn't.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Try me.
text: She STRADDLES HIM, sexual and raw. Charlie's repulsed,
dialog: terrified.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'll be the best you ever had. The
dialog: only you had.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Charlie. We can be together
dialog: forever.
text: She leans in, licks his neck seductively...
speaker_heading: AND GASPS.
text: She sits back, the STAKE IN HER CHEST. She falls away,
text: shuddering.
text: Charlie pulls the stake out -- scrambles out of the nest.
text: He looks back at her, anguished.
text: A beat. AMY, in terrible pain, LAUGHS. Nothing's happening.
dialog: No kablooey.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Missed. You missed.
text: Charlie BREAKS THE DOOR OPEN with his crowbar.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know.
text: He backs away from her. Into--
scene_heading: INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT -- DAY
text: The basement where Jerry and the THE TRIBE are CIRCLED around
text: a body as MS. GRANADA feeds.
text: ON PETER, who's pale and shaking...
text: Charlie attacks them with THE CROWBAR.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Get off him!
text: He hits MS. GRANADA off Peter. Manages to hold off JERRY for
text: a beat. Spins and HITS ADAM in the head.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Dude!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sorry.
text: AMY enters from the other room -- already healing. Jerry
text: sees her -- holds up a hand and backs the others off.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'll finish this.
text: Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie.
text: Charlie sees Peter, barely alive, spit out his FAKE VAMP
text: teeth. Peter meets his gaze, wry and weak. Done for.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Worth a shot. "Master of
dialog: illusion."
text: Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He
text: dives for it, but Jerry steps on it -- kicks it away.
speaker_heading: JERRY
speaker_heading: (TO CHARLIE)
dialog: You think that's going to stop me?
dialog: Time to man up.
text: Jerry brutally kicks Charlie, sends him sprawling.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JERRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now. I'm going to kill your girl --
dialog: make you watch. I'll take my time
dialog: with you. And once you're dead,
dialog: I'll finish your mother.
speaker_heading: (RE: AMY)
dialog: Too bad about that one. She sucked
dialog: me dry. Like a pro.
text: Amy smiles a little. Jerry GRABS CHARLIE, lifts him off his
speaker_heading: FEET--
text: Charlie, enraged, SPRAYS JERRY WITH GAS FROM the CANISTER --
text: right in the eyes.
text: Jerry recoils, HISSING. Adam and the OTHER VAMPS MOVE IN.
text: Jerry's over it. He's on CHARLIE in a flash, FANGS BARED.
text: About to RIP HIS NECK OUT.
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: PETER has the gun again -- has managed to pull himself up
text: into a sitting position.
text: He BLOWS away ONE OF THE SUPPORT BEAMS.
text: BLAM! And ANOTHER.
text: BLAM! And ANOTHER.
text: BLAM -- he misses.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Fuck.
text: BLAM! AND ANOTHER.
text: Charlie DIVES for SAFETY as the CEILING COLLAPSES in part of
text: the basement. SUNLIGHT STREAMS in -- forcing JERRY, AMY and
text: the other vamps into a corner.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO JERRY)
dialog: Fuck yeah! Nice sweater, loser!
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: Another BEAM collapses. BURYING JERRY, AMY and the others
text: under DEBRIS from the floor above.
text: A stunned beat.
text: Peter slumps, exhausted from the effort.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
text: Charlie looks at him -- amazed.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (WEAK)
dialog: I'm better with stationary targets.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah you are.
text: Peter looks at him, sad.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Get out of here. We don't have
text: much time before they dig out.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (RE: STAKE)
dialog: I can save you. I have to kill him
dialog: with this.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're a brave mother, I get it.
dialog: And you were right. This is how I
dialog: had to go... But we didn't count
text: on an army.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He'll kill you both, he said--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We're already dead.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Go now, you live to fight another
dialog: day. Stay -- there won't be one.
text: Charlie stops. Swayed. Pained.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON CHARLIE
text: Accepting it. It's what he has to do.
text: He starts DIGGING.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Charlie!
text: But Charlie ignores him, determined. Pulls his MASK DOWN
text: over his face again.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
text: WHAM! JERRY BURSTS OUT OF THE RUBBLE, attacks Charlie.
text: Charlie falls back, PULLING JERRY with him into THE LIGHT
text: Jerry BURSTS INTO FLAME -- but holds Charlie tight
text: AMY and the other vamps start to claw their way OUT of the
text: rubble.
text: Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly ENGULFED IN FLAMES now
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Charlie!
text: Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help.
text: Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle.
text: Finally, Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the
text: ground as they fight. Trying to put out the flames.
text: Jerry starts to DISINTEGRATE -- he's about to EXPLODE into
text: bits. Charlie's stake is now ON FIRE.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: NO!
text: A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to
dialog: burn away.
text: HE STAKES JERRY.
text: AMY suddenly SCREAMS - she's burning inside, DYING. Or so it
text: seems. The vampire is being burned out of her.
text: PETER cries out too, reacting less violently. But in pain.
speaker_heading: JERRY
text: Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in
text: his CHEST. Right through the heart.
text: He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster, just like
text: Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR.
text: For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air...
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Blow me.
text: THEN HE BLOWS INTO A MILLION PIECES.
scene_heading: ON CHARLIE AND PETER
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
text: Thinking fast, PETER tackles CHARLIE -- who is still in
text: flames. They tumble into one of the open graves.
text: DIRT pours in around them, extinguishing the fire.
speaker_heading: ON AMY
text: Transformed and healed. Herself again. She rushes to the
text: edge of the open grave.
scene_heading: ABOVE THE OPEN GRAVE
text: Peter pulls Charlie's mask back. Charlie is burned,
text: unconscious.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Charlie!
text: She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms.
speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Charlie...
text: Amy starts to cry. Peter looks on, concerned. Finally,
text: Charlie opens his eyes. Says weakly...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Blow me? Seriously?
text: Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Those are his last words? What a
dialog: tool.
text: We pull away, leaving this tableau...
text: UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe
text: emerge from the rubble. Disoriented, freaked.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MS. GRANADA
dialog: Let's agree to never talk about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Charlie, Amy, Jane and Peter are in Peter's penthouse. It's
text: a glittering night, a spectacular view.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
text: Jane, released from the hospital, looks healthy and glowing.
text: She smiles at Peter, who also looks more together.
text: She has a glass of wine -- he's drinking a COKE.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Think you'll ever feel the same
dialog: about a nighttime sky?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Same as what? I was always
dialog: terrified.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Right. We're just catching up.
scene_heading: ON AMY AND CHARLIE
text: Charlie sees the connection between Peter and Jane.
dialog: Shudders.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm not seeing that.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: She deserves some fun. Your mom
dialog: fully cheated death.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (SUGGESTIVE)
dialog: You too. You deserve fun.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, I plan on it. Now that you've
dialog: killed your first vampire...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I am so going to perform.
text: Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's
dialog: different, they're different. The childish part of them long
dialog: gone.
text: He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close.
text: SOMETHING BEEPS, talks...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: "Frak!" "Frak!"
speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (PULLS BACK)
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Charlie, a little sheepish, shows her. He's wearing a
scene_heading: BATTLESTAR GALACTICA wrist watch.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Battlestar.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It was Ed's.
text: Amy smiles a little, softens.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Frak?
text: PETER is passing. Hears this. Is down with it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Frak! Right on.
speaker_heading: (TO AMY)
dialog: Perfect Woman, can I get you a
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'll take another. Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (TO PETER)
dialog: I'll give you a hand.
text: Charlie follows PETER into the DINING ROOM, where a BAR CART
text: is set up. Peter moves to it. Pours himself a Midori.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought you were on the wagon.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: It's dark.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I'm on the "day" wagon.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thanks for inviting us.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We should celebrate. Being alive.
dialog: Your mom's clean bill of health.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You wanted to put the moves on her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What? No. What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just -- I'm watching you. I've got
dialog: to look out for her.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah you do. So here's what I'm
dialog: thinking. We faced the beast and
dialog: we won. Can you imagine the
dialog: possibilities if we had got that
dialog: shit on film?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
scene_heading: VAMPIRES DON'T--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Show up on film, yeah. But
dialog: werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get
dialog: proof, catch something -- we could
dialog: build a stage act around that, you
dialog: wouldn't believe. We'd blow those
dialog: Cirque bitches away!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: An act? Seriously? What about
dialog: saving people from evil? What
speaker_heading: ABOUT--
text: A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And
text: somehow familiar.
text: Peter nods to his COLLECTION CABINETS.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It happens. All this stuff...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ever think about collecting
dialog: something else? Snow globes or--
text: Charlie stops, catches sight of something MOVING IN THE
scene_heading: REFLECTION ON THE FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOW.
text: Just a wisp, a phantom. The face - is it ED? His features
text: twisted in a grimace of fear and pain... It's CHILLING.
text: Charlie's spooked. But he looks again and the face is gone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, definitely get new stuff.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
text: Peter leads CHARLIE OUT, back to the ladies in the other
text: room. Still on about his idea...
text: WE HOLD ON THEIR REFLECTION IN THE WINDOW
speaker_heading: PETER (O.S.)
dialog: I'm serious, man. Do you know how
dialog: much we could make? Think about
dialog: how much people pay to see a tiger,
dialog: or boobs, right? What if we had a
dialog: tiger, boobs -- and a zombie!
dialog: After they've gone we linger on the window. Is that Ed's
text: eerie reflection again?, barely visible...
text: AS WE GO TO BLACK
speaker_heading: ED (0.S.)
dialog: You're so coooool Brewster!!
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
