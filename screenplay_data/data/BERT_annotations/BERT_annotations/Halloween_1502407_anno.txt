dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY
dialog: 
text: A cold brick building. Isolated. Surrounded on all sides by
text: barbed-wire fencing.
dialog: 
text: A RENTAL CAR pulls up to the SECURITY GATE. A SECURITY GUARD
text: checks the credentials of the driver. The Guard nods to the
text: GUARD BOOTH. The GATE OPENS. The rental car drives through.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY STATION. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: A HAND holding a MICROPHONE. The hand cranes the
text: mike around the to pick up sounds of maniacal laughter
text: echoing from the corridor.
dialog: 
text: INSERTS of the corresponding inspiration of these sounds.
dialog: 
text: REVEAL: DANA HAINES (30's), activating a TAPE RECORDER. She's
scene_heading: with AARON JOSEPH-KOREY (40); both scholarly, British. Aaron
text: signs some documents at a CHECK-IN DESK. They look to each
text: other. Aaron speaks into her microphone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Check, check.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Testing, testing. One, two, three.
dialog: 
text: Among the SECURITY GUARDS, a NURSE works behind the security
text: desk of what looks to be a minimum security institution. The
text: nurse places a needle on a record player. A joyous song from
text: a 1930's musical plays.
dialog: 
text: Aaron looks through the security window and sees a DOCTOR
text: writing something down and speaking to a PATIENT and a guard,
text: KUNEMAN. His ballpoint pen runs out of ink. He shakes it,
text: discards it and then reaches into his lab coat pocket for a
text: more elegant pen to complete his prescription and signature.
text: He glances through the glass at his visitors.
dialog: 
text: Dana raises her mic to the door. WE HEAR SOUNDS through
text: warped distortion. THEN: A loud BUZZER snaps us back to
text: reality as a ward activates the door lock.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The mechanics of the security locks, bars, etc.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A GREEN LIGHT FLASHES as the door opens and DR. RANBIR
text: SARTAIN appears. A psychiatrist with a thick accent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Ranbir
dialog: Sartain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Thank you for taking the time to
dialog: meet with us. We were hoping to
dialog: have this chance before he is
text: transferred to the new facility.
dialog: Glass Hill is far less
dialog: accommodating.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Glass Hill is the pit of hell.
dialog: Underfunded and short staffed. For
dialog: years he has been kept here to be
dialog: studied. I suppose the state has
dialog: lost interest in discovering
dialog: anything further.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Well... That's why we're here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Do you mind if I record this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
speaker_heading: (A SMILE)
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
dialog: 
text: A loud BUZZER as the door shuts. Sartain escorts Aaron and
text: Dana down a hall. Disturbed faces of PATIENTS pass. Many
text: behind bars, others with CLINICAL ESCORTS. Dana records
text: Sartain as they walk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: How long have you been working with
dialog: him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: I've examined every case file
dialog: written on him. I was a scholar of
text: Dr. Loomis before he passed away.
dialog: Then I lobbied the University of
dialog: Illinois to be assign to Michael
dialog: myself.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Any progress?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: He has been seen by over 50
dialog: clinical psychiatrists. And with
dialog: each, many different opinions.
dialog: Loomis reasoned that he was nothing
dialog: more than pure evil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Any you agree with this diagnosis?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Evil is not a diagnosis. Under my
dialog: care, we implemented a holistic
dialog: form of therapy. Since that time,
dialog: his tendency for violence has
text: essentially been erased.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: His response to your specific
dialog: treatment has been effective?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: We left two kitty cats in his cell
dialog: overnight and both remained
text: unharmed.
speaker_heading: (A SMILE)
dialog: I hate to disappoint you.
dialog: 
dialog: Aaron stop walking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: So you're telling us that there is
dialog: no similarity between the murderous
dialog: maniac that made newspaper
dialog: headlines in 1978 and the amenable
dialog: patient of this institution?
dialog: 
text: Sartain laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Michael Myers is an evolving, aging
dialog: creature like we all are. And
dialog: although we have worked very
dialog: closely with him, these halls
dialog: display the limitations of my
dialog: analysis. Loomis saw Michael as a
dialog: beast in the wild. He witnessed
text: human behavior at its most primal,
dialog: while the rest of us only have the
dialog: opportunity of observation in
dialog: captivity.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sartain uses a key to open a heavy door that leads into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD. SMITH'S GROVE STATE HOSPITAL. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Sartain walks them into an outside courtyard. A few
text: DISFIGURED or DISABLED RESIDENTS roam about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Our patients get fresh air and
dialog: sunshine, a view, proper exercise,
dialog: a healthy diet. It pains me to see
dialog: him transferred to a less than
dialog: desirable' facility.
speaker_heading: (POINTING)
text: There he is. He can speak. He
dialog: just chooses not to.
dialog: 
text: Aaron and Dana look. WE FIND THE SHAPE OF A MAN sixty feet
text: away standing shackled to the ground in the middle of the
text: concrete yard. A YELLOW PAINTED SQUARE creates a twenty foot
text: frame around him. Tall, strong, aged, dressed in white.
dialog: 
text: TWO SECURITY OFFICERS stand watch. SIX OTHER PATIENTS stand
text: scattered through the yard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I'd love to stand near him and get
dialog: a sense of his awareness... Or lack
dialog: of awareness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Make no mistake. He is aware. He
dialog: was watching you as you arrived.
dialog: When he's not out here in the
dialog: courtyard, he walks from this
dialog: window to that window, to the
dialog: other. Observing things.
dialog: 
text: Aaron and Dana look curiously to each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO AARON)
dialog: And perhaps you'd like to tie your
dialog: left shoelace. Mr Tovoli, the
text: gentleman with the umbrella, has a
dialog: fixation for such things.
dialog: Underestimate no one.
dialog: 
text: A patient holding AN UMBRELLA in the sunshine bites a
text: fingernail and smiles at them. Embarrassed, Aaron bends down
text: to tie his clean white sneaker.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Step up to the yellow line. No
dialog: further. Do not pass the line under
dialog: any circumstance.
dialog: 
text: Sartain looks to the security guards for reassurance and then
text: walks Aaron and Dana to the yellow line on the concrete.
dialog: 
text: The Shape stands with his back to them. Sartain calls out:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Michael. I have some people who
dialog: would like to meet you.
dialog: 
text: Aaron clears his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Michael. My name be Aaron. I've
dialog: followed your case for years, and I
dialog: still know very little about you. I
dialog: want to know more about that night.
dialog: About those involved.
dialog: 
text: The Shape is motionless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think of them? Feel guilt
dialog: about their fate?
dialog: 
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
text: Aaron looks back to Dana with a shrug. She hesitantly steps
text: forward to join her partner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you remember Laurie Strode?
dialog: 
text: The Shape stretches his fingers and then rests his hand at
text: his side. Sartain notices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Does she remind you of your sister,
dialog: Michael? Is that why you chose
dialog: her?
dialog: 
text: The Shape half turns, as if he's going to respond... but then
dialog: doesn't.
dialog: 
text: Aaron looks back to Sartain. He nods to Aaron to go ahead.
text: Aaron looks to Dana. She unzips her bag.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: I borrowed something from a friend
text: at the Attorney General's office.
dialog: Something I'd like you to see.
dialog: 
text: Aaron's hand goes inside Dana's shoulder bag and pulls out a
text: portion of a WHITE HALLOWEEN MASK. Familiar.
dialog: 
text: Sartain looks to see this exchange. Aaron holds the mask out
text: before him. The Shape makes no movement. The other patients
text: become restless. Pacing madly. Dana looks around, concerned.
text: Aaron doesn't lower the mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: You recognize this, don't you,
dialog: Michael? How does it make you feel?
dialog: Say something.
dialog: 
text: A few of the patients start screaming. Testing their
text: restraints like rabid animals.
dialog: 
text: Dana looks to Sartain. He is concerned.
dialog: 
text: More patients join in, stomping and screaming, getting louder
dialog: and louder.
dialog: 
text: Aaron shouts back to The Shape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Say SOMETHING!
dialog: 
text: The courtyard has been worked into a frenzied chorus of
text: madness, but The Shape remains still.

speaker_heading: HALLOWEEN
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET. NELSON HOUSE. EARLY MORNING.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA inside a closet with thin wooden slats. A beautiful
text: girl, ALLYSON NELSON (17), appears as the door opens. Her
text: face has a soft innocent quality. Eyes are bright and alive.
dialog: 
text: She pulls the closet light switch string. The LIGHT BULB
text: flickers but doesn't turn on. She pulls the switch again;
dialog: nothing.
dialog: 
text: She rummage through the shirts and picks out a workout
text: jacket, closing the closet door behind her.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALLYSON'S BEDROOM. NELSON HOUSE. MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Allyson makes her bed. The decor of her room is that of a
text: young woman with artifacts of childhood lingering.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. SUNRISE.
dialog: 
text: Allyson goes for a jog.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEND IN ROAD. NEIGHBORHOOD. MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Allyson jogs past a chain link fence in front of a house. A
text: DOG BARKS ferociously. A little startled, she takes a deep
text: breath and continues down the street.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COMMUNITY GARDEN. MORNING.
dialog: 
text: Allyson jogs by a residential community garden. Flowers,
text: vegetables, etc. Much of it dead. A BANGLADESHI WOMAN wraps a
dialog: plant to protect it from the weather of the off season.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NELSON HOUSE. MORNING.
dialog: 
text: RAY NELSON, 45, opens up a kitchen cabinet and sets a mouse
text: trap with peanut butter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You see this? I switched from
text: marshmallow fluff to peanut butter.
dialog: We'll see if the little devil
text: snatches it.
dialog: 
text: SHANAH NELSON, 38, makes breakfast. She lives life. The
text: beauty and heart behind her eyes is hidden.
dialog: 
text: Allyson enters trying to fix a broken zipper on her school
text: bag. The traffic plays on a radio with lighthearted DISC
text: JOCKEYS. Competing with that, a television is on with an
scene_heading: INFOMERCIAL.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANAH
dialog: I rescheduled my last session, so
dialog: I'll be able to make it tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: You didn't have to do that. It's
dialog: not that big of a deal.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Of course it is. You got into
dialog: National Honor Society. It's a very
dialog: big deal.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I was top of my shop class, made
text: ashtrays and birdhouses.
dialog: 
text: Ray loads up another mouse trap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANAH
dialog: And I'm looking forward to meeting
dialog: Cameron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I know his father Lonnie and his
dialog: uncle James. The entire Elam family
dialog: has a... reputation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANAH
dialog: (shoots a look)
dialog: Ray, c'mon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What?! You know about his
dialog: situation, right? It's a relevant
dialog: factor. The whole household is--
dialog: 
text: The mouse trap snaps in Ray's hand, smashing his finger. Ray
text: jumps, startled. His finger bleeds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: That's not fair, dad. Cameron isn't
dialog: like that. He's a nice guy
dialog: 
text: Ray walks to the sink to wash his finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'm not saying he's not nice. It's
dialog: just- You're too smart to go out
dialog: with troublemakers and dip shits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: You're right.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Did you guys invite Grandmother
dialog: like you said you would?
dialog: 
text: Shanah looks to Ray. They make eyes.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANAH
dialog: I did. Talked to her yesterday.
dialog: She's not going to be able to make
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Allyson zips up her back-pack and give her mom a look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
text: Ray kisses his hurt finger and gives Shanah a nervous look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANAH
text: She's agoraphobic. In serious need
dialog: of cognitive... Um... behavioral-

text: A buzzer RINGS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: Vicky's here. I gotta go.
dialog: 
text: Ray turns off the sink and stare awkwardly at his wife.

dialog: 
text: CLOSE on a JACK-O-LANTERN.
dialog: 
text: DAVE (17) takes a hit off a joint and blows smoke through the
text: top. It billows through the eyes. Dave get a coughing fit and
text: hustles to keep up with his friends.
dialog: 
text: VICKY (17) walks in front of him. She's an outspoken
dialog: intellectual. Doesn't take any shit. Allyson walk with them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: My mom is a liar. She told me she
dialog: invited my Grandmother tonight but
dialog: she didn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: She never even called her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That's bullshit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: What's your mom's deal? Why would
dialog: she say that?
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: She just tries to keep me away from
text: her. Says she turns into a nutcase
dialog: this time of year.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Your grandmother is Laurie Strode.
dialog: If I were her I wouldn't celebrate
dialog: either. I'd put up a Christmas tree
dialog: instead. Just skip over all the
dialog: spooky Halloween shit, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (STONED RAMBLING)
dialog: Jumping to Thanksgiving would make
dialog: sense. Puritans, cornucopias,
dialog: plagues, starvations, slaughtering
dialog: the Indians. That stuff isn't
dialog: creepy at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Does she ever talk around it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: Pretty much all she talks about. It
dialog: defines her life. She's been in
dialog: shock ever since. You should see
dialog: her house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Freaky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wasn't it her brother that killed
dialog: those baby-sitters?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: No. I think people made up the bit
dialog: about them being related because it
dialog: made them feel better. Like it
dialog: couldn't happen to anyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: To have a bunch of your friends get
dialog: slaughtered by some random crazy
dialog: person... how awful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Is it though? I just feel like the
dialog: universe has way worse shit now.
dialog: One dude just kills a few people, I
dialog: don't know.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Her grandmother is a bad ass and
dialog: was almost fucking murdered, Dave!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And she escaped! And he was caught!
dialog: He's like super incarcerated right
dialog: now. It's not like the worst thing
dialog: that has happened to a person. By
dialog: today's standards.
dialog: 
text: Vikcy stops and turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Shut up, Dave. Stop talking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm sorry. I sensed myself going on

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cool if I explode this pumpkinhead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKY
dialog: Yes, please.
dialog: 
text: Allyson takes the top off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: Go for it.
dialog: 
text: Dave lights A firecracker, stuffs it into the jack-o-lantern

dialog: Wooooo! happy Halloween!
dialog:

dialog: 
text: GROUPED SHOTS strike WITH PRECISION in THE HEART OF A TARGET.
dialog: 
text: Holding a smoking gun, years of anxiety cut through a
text: beautiful face. The dark circles under the eyes show a life
text: filled with lidless nights. This is LAURIE STRODE (57), for
dialog: better or worse.
dialog: 
text: She's surrounded by wilderness except for the sack with
text: barrels and targets and department store mannequins.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She sets the gun down, pulls a bottle of pills out of her
text: pocket and taps one into her mug of coffee. She drinks, wipes
text: her mouth, picks up a different gun. A high power semi-
text: automatic weapon.
dialog: 
text: She fires at the staged mannequins. Their heads and bodies
text: erupt into shrapnel.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE. LAURIE'S PROPERTY. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Laurie drives an ATV. It rolls to the farm house with a flat

text: the glass for security. Wind chimes give a tranquil feel to
dialog: the fortified compound.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS: Laurie disassembles and cleans her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: What is it we're after?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: To see the animal inside its
dialog: environment. I fear there has been
dialog: no rehabilitation. In this case it
dialog: seems one monster created another.
text: A victim locks herself away.
dialog: Imprisoned by her own fear. Our
dialog: goal is to get them in a room
dialog: together. Can we find a form of
dialog: rehabilitation if she faces him
dialog: again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: DANA (CONT'D)
dialog: You might want this.
dialog: 
text: She holds out an envelope of cash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Journalists don't pay for

dialog: two people in this world that care
dialog: about her and they're both in this
dialog: car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (noting her file)

scene_heading: INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. DAY.
dialog: 
text: Dirty dishes are overflowing in the kitchen. The rest of her

dialog: 
text: Laurie cleans a Smith and Wesson revolver. She opens the
text: cylinder and see a SINGLE fastball inside. She takes out the
text: bullet and considers it. She puts it back and spins the
text: cylinder. Engaged. She cocks the hammer.
dialog:

speaker_heading: DANA
speaker_heading: (LEANING OVER)

text: and steps in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Aaron and I have made several award
dialog: winning public radio exposes. Our
dialog: last project shed fresh light on a
dialog: murder case from twenty years ago.
dialog: We like to re-examine incidents
dialog: with an unbiased lens. When people
dialog: are willing to face a thing in a
dialog: different light over time, new
dialog: truths can sometimes emerge. I
dialog: believe there is a lot to learn
dialog: from the horror you experienced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: There's nothing to re-examine.
dialog: Nothing to learn from something
dialog: that happened forty years ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: So is he real?

speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Who?

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Allyson. Come here!
dialog: 
text: Her head shakes "no". He nods "yes". She shakes "no". He

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: What are you doing? What was that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: ALLYSON

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: That was nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yeah. Every time I turn around,
dialog: you're in your phone. Looking at
text: it, texting with people, talking
dialog: with people. It sucks. And I didn't
dialog: do anything with Kim. She came up
dialog: to me. Gave ME a kiss. Don't cry
dialog: about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: You're drunk. Oscar got you fucked

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: Don't.
dialog: 
text: Her phone vibrates. She looks: "Mom". Cameron looks pissed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: See! This piece of shit.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: The back door is open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: Haddonfield Sheriff's department.
text: Responding to a domestic
dialog: disturbance!
dialog: 
text: He holds his gun with arms outstretched.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: I repeat! This is Officer Hawkins.
dialog: Please respond!
dialog: 
text: The kitchen is empty. He hears the sound of the television

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Hawkins stands in the door of Julian's room. The glowing of

dialog: 
text: In the middle of the room sits a figure with a white sheet

scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: Hawkins aims...
dialog: 
text: Hawkins carefully pulls the sheer off- REVEALING VICKY in the

scene_heading: EXT. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: Laurie arrives. She uneasily scans the neighborhood;
text: surveying the street, the shadows, pumpkins on porches.
dialog: 
text: A firecracker POPS and she flinches.
dialog: 
text: She turns and sees the silhouette of a small WITCH standing
text: way down the street, lighting firecrackers-- POP POP.
dialog: 
text: Two more silhouettes join the Witch, a SKULL HEAD and a
text: PUMPKIN HEAD, and they turn and run with their candy bags.
dialog: 
text: Laurie shifts her eyes... looks upstairs.
dialog: 
text: A light turns on in the bedroom window. Hawkins is in the
text: window of the crime scene.
dialog: 
text: She turns to the window of the next room.
dialog: 
text: The Shape stands staring at Laurie. The sight of him makes
text: Laurie's heart drop. She GASPS. The look between the two has
dialog: forty years of tension.
dialog: 
text: Laurie raises her gun and fires. It's a direct hit at her
text: target, but it is revealed that it represents just the
text: reflection of The Shape in a mirror.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: Hawkins jolts at hearing the gunshot. He sees The Shape
text: walking down the stairs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: Stop or I'll fire!
dialog: 
text: The Shape continues and Hawkins open fire-- BAM! BAM!
dialog: 
text: The Shape disappears.
dialog: 
text: Hawkins chases downstairs after him.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: Hawkins glances around the corner. He sees a trail of blood
text: on the floor.
dialog: 
text: He steps into the living room. He sees DAVE-- DEAD-- a large
text: knife pins him through the neck with his face smashed into
text: the wall like a ceremonial slaying. The blood from Dave's

dialog: 
text: Hawkins is horrified and slips on the bloody floor.

scene_heading: EXT. BABY-SITTER'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS.

dialog: 
text: The Shape appears around the corner of the house, walking

dialog: 
text: Laurie raises her gun. She fires-- PAP.
dialog: 
text: The Shape is hit in the back of the shoulder and falls
text: forward out of frame around the corner of the house.
dialog: 
text: Laurie runs toward to the corner, gun still aimed. She turns
dialog: the corner.
dialog: 
text: He is gone.
dialog: 
text: Just then, Hawkins appears and whispers to Laurie.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: Where is he?!
dialog: 
text: Laurie is started, turns and punches Hawkins in the face with
text: her fist. He drops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Fuck! Jesus! What the fuck?!
dialog: 
text: Hawkins sits up and rubs his bruised jaw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE (CONT'D)

dialog: punched.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS

speaker_heading: LAURIE

scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: Sure. Sure. You get a license for

scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS

text: visible pain and discomfort.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: The bus lost control after Michael
dialog: overtook the first guard, then the
dialog: driver. He is no longer dormant. I
dialog: saw him kill with my own eyes. He
dialog: only knows how to keep moving and
dialog: to keep killing and he will kill

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BARKER
dialog: What I want to know is why he
dialog: didn't kill you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: I tried to hide, but he found me.
text: Locked me to a seat. He looked down
dialog: at me. I closed my eyes and when I
text: opened them, he walked away.
dialog: 
text: Barker looks to Hawkins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BARKER
dialog: Hawkins, come talk to me for a

text: The Sheriff and Hawkins walk away speaking discretely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BARKER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's an asset.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: He's not an asset, he's a
dialog: liability.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BARKER
dialog: You're going to take him. He knows
dialog: Myers better than anyone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: You want me to take this injured
dialog: civilian to search for a
dialog: psychopathic serial killer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BARKER
dialog: You were right. I was wrong. We're
text: clearing the streets. Patrol cars
dialog: on every corner. I'm going
dialog: statewide with this. Let's find
dialog: this son of a bitch. You hear me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE (O.S.)
dialog: Sheriff Barker, Officer Hawkins?
dialog: 
text: They look back. Laurie is walking over.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: We don't need your help right now,

dialog: 
text: Sartain sees Laurie and approaches. He recognizes her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Excuse me, officers.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF BARKER

dialog: Sartain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: You're the new Loomis. I can tell
text: by the classy accent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: I've read everything about you in
dialog: his case files. Do you know our
dialog: friend Mr. Hawkins here was the
dialog: responding deputy when Michael was
dialog: apprehended in 1978?
dialog: 
text: Barker glances curiously at Sartain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: He lawfully stood between doctor
text: Loomis' vindictive tirade and the
dialog: right to a fair trial.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Loomis calling for his execution
dialog: didn't persuade you?
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: I used to believe that due process
dialog: balanced the power of the law of
dialog: the land. I'm not so sure anymore.
dialog: 
text: Sartain turns and walks to the passenger seat of Hawkins'
text: car, leaving Laurie standing with Hawkins and Barker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: I prayed everyday that he would
dialog: escape.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: What the hell did you do that for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: So I could kill him.
dialog: 
text: The Sheriff shakes his head. Hawkins considers this for a
dialog: moment.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: Well, that was a dumb thing to pray
dialog: for...
dialog: 
text: As he gets into his car...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Will you come with us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Listen. I had too much gin. I told

scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: What side is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: The core of the victimizer. This is

dialog: is he emotionally driven? Triggered
text: by something. Some unheard marching

speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy Halloween, Mr. Elrod. Cool
dialog: mask. Sorry... I'm not trying to
dialog: trespass on your shit, I was just
dialog: talking to this pretty girl over
dialog: there. It's just... I guess, I
dialog: always kind of liked her. And I
dialog: know she's bummed out about Cameron
dialog: so I thought maybe... Stupid,
dialog: right?
dialog: 
text: The Shape stands. No response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: All right. Peace. Thank you.
dialog: 
text: THE LIGHT GOES OUT.
dialog: 
text: AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE YARD, Allyson makes it to the six foot
text: BLACK IRON FENCE and starts to climb. She grabs one of the
text: sharp metal spikes that jut from the top and pulls her hand.
text: It's slightly precarious but she's careful to avoid the iron
text: spikes as she climbs over. She drops to the other side and
text: walks down an alley. Disappointed.
dialog: 
text: ON OSCAR as THE LIGHT COMES BACK ON.
dialog: 
text: Oscar looks around and sees no one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Yo! Where'd you go, bro? You're
dialog: acting super sketchy right now.
dialog: 
text: He's confused and looks over his shoulder as he walks again
text: to cross the yard. He runs straight into THE SHAPE and gasps.
dialog: 
text: He drops his beer as A KNIFE RAISES. Oscar put his arm up.
dialog: 
text: THE LIGHT TURNS OFF. TOTAL BLACKNESS.
dialog: 
text: ON ALLYSON DOWN THE STREET as she hear A SCREAM. She stops.
text: Looks back.
dialog: 
text: THE LIGHTS TURN BACK ON.
dialog: 
text: Oscar runs as fast as he can. He's bleeding from his forearm.
dialog: 
text: The Shape walks behind him.
dialog: 
text: Oscar gets to the fence and leaps for the top bar. He gets
text: halfway over and snags his cape.
dialog: 
text: Oscar sees The Shape drawing closer with his knife raised. He
text: stabs Oscar in the back and grabs at his feet.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Oscar struggles to hang on as he SCREAMS.
dialog: 
text: THE LIGHTS TURN OFF.
dialog: 
text: We faintly see Oscar as he loses the battle. His jaw gets
text: impaled by the sharp iron spike of the fence.
dialog: 
text: TOTAL BLACKNESS.
dialog: 
text: ON ALLYSON as she walkway cautiously toward the scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Oscar?!! Oscar?!
dialog: 
text: In the darkness, she arrives at the fence.
dialog: 
text: THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON.
dialog: 
text: SHE SEES OSCAR. His face has been pierced from the chin
text: through his mouth by one of the iron spikes at the top of the
text: fence. He chokes and gags, gargling blood.
dialog: 
text: Allyson starts to hyperventilate and turns her head to see
text: the yard. For a split second she sees The Shape standing ON
text: HER SIDE of the fence, holding a knife.
dialog: 
text: THE LIGHTS GO OFF. She screams and runs like hell.
dialog: 
text: Allyson runs faster than she's ever run before... Out of the
text: darkness into the open neighborhood.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: EXTREME WIDE SHOT OF THE STREET. Allyson looks to a house

dialog:

dialog: Officer! I saw him. My friend was

dialog: Laurie?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: I saw your mousetraps, Ray. Peanut
dialog: butter and marshmallow fluff?
dialog: 
text: Shanah takes a pensive moment before she twists the kitchen

speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: What's this?

speaker_heading: SHANAH

scene_heading: INSIDE THE SHELTER:

dialog: 
text: Shanah climbs down the ladder and feels the wave of her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Pick your poison. Do you need small

dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
speaker_heading: (CALMLY)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN

scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS

text: He clicks it nervously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not going to ask you again,
dialog: Doctor. Stand back!
dialog: 
text: Sartain slides the clip of his pen to the side. The ink point
text: retracts, and A SHARP, TWO-INCH BLADE flicks out.
dialog: 
text: Sartain grips the blade, turns around, quickly grabs Hawkins
text: gun hand and stabs the steel straight into Hawkins' neck!
dialog: 
text: THE GUN GOES OFF AND DROPS.
dialog: 
text: Sartain sharply slashes his throat.
dialog: 
text: Allyson's eyes go wide. She can't believe what she's seeing.
dialog: 
text: Sartain inhales the feeling of his kill. He pulls the pen out

text: -- the blade retracts.
dialog: 
text: Hawkins drops.
dialog: 
text: Sartain turns to Allyson looking at him from the car. He

scene_heading: INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR, Allyson watches Sartain through the

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD. CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: Sartain squats, looking at his patient passed out. The Shape

scene_heading: INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. CONTINUOUS.
dialog: 
text: Allyson sees him stand back up at the hood of the car.
text: Sartain is wearing THE MASK.
dialog: 
text: Allyson huddles down, SCREAMING.
dialog: 
text: Sartain screams in the mask with her, banging on the hood of
dialog: the car.
dialog: 
text: Allyson SCREAMS, trapped in the backseat.
dialog: 
text: Sartain stops moving. He stands still looking at Allyson,
dialog: silent.
dialog: 
text: Allyson is crying now. Pleading:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: Please... Don't.
dialog: 
text: Sartain walks up to her window. He stares at Allyson and
text: makes a "shush" finger on the mask, then walks over to The
dialog: Shape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: This is a dream.
dialog: 
text: Allyson watches out the window. She panics.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: No! please no! Please!
dialog: 
text: Sartain awkwardly lifts the unconscious Shape into the back
text: seat with Allyson. He struggles with the pain of his wounded
text: arm . His body slumps over leaning on her. She sees THE
text: SHAPE'S greasy hair touch her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Make room, my dear. Mindful of my
dialog: patient.
dialog: (to The Shape)
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you with us, Michael? Are you
dialog: listening?
speaker_heading: (TO ALLYSON)
dialog: I don't believe he hears
dialog: everything.
dialog: 
text: Allyson pushes The Shape off of her.
dialog: 
text: Sartain takes off THE MASK and throws it in. It lands on the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: NO! GET ME OUT OF HERE! HELP!
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR (MOVING). NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: IN BACK, Allyson cowers against the door opposite The Shape.
text: His face is shrouded in shadow, lit briefly as they pass
text: under street lamps.
dialog: 
text: Allyson whimpers as The Shape jostles in his seat. He slowly
text: starts SLIDING DOWN TOWARDS HER. She uses her feet to push
text: his body away and back onto his side.
dialog: 
text: She crawls against the door watching The Shape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: Michael, I see why you are who you
dialog: are. The sensation is obvious. The
text: thrill is exhilarating. Loomis was
dialog: a coward. He was afraid to travel
dialog: to such depths for you. But I love
dialog: you and I know you feel the same
dialog: way. I freed you from those
dialog: unwilling to understand you. Those
dialog: of archaic mind.
dialog: 
text: Allyson is desperate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: (weeping to herself)
dialog: Let me go. Please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: The look on your face when you saw
dialog: freedom? And then the carnage and
dialog: confusion we created?
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She looks at Sartain's eyes in the rearview mirror watching
text: her, cold, calculating, perverse. She looks down at THE MASK
text: sitting on the seat between her and The Shape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm glad we're together, Michael.
dialog: 
text: Allyson wipes her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
speaker_heading: (DESPERATE)
dialog: Please... Where are you taking me?!
dialog: 
text: Sartain chuckles and keeps driving.
dialog: 
text: Allyson looks back down. POV: the seat is empty-- NO MASK.
dialog: 
dialog: PAN UP FROM THE SEAT:
dialog: 
text: THE SHAPE IS WEARING THE MASK LOOKING AT HER!
dialog: 
text: Before she can scream, The Shape grabs Allyson's hair and
text: throws her into the passenger side door.
dialog: 
text: He scoots back and lifts his leg; KICKS HIS WINDOW WITH HIS
speaker_heading: BOOT.
dialog: 
text: The car starts to swerve out of control as he fractures the
dialog: glass.
dialog: 
text: The car jerks right and Allyson slams against the door...
dialog: 
text: The car skids to a stop at a slight angle in the middle of a
dialog: rural road.
dialog: 
text: The Shape goes into a fit in the back seat.
dialog: 
text: Sartain remains calm. He looks at THE POLICE CRUISER that is
text: guarding the gate to Laurie's compound a hundred yards away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The Shape kicks the window in the back seat while Sartain
text: sits calmly in the front.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: What greater spectacle than to
text: reunite two old friends. Michael
dialog: Myers and Laurie Strode. A
dialog: historical reunion.
dialog: 
text: The back seat settles. All is quiet until...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Michael. She's been waiting for
dialog: you. Are you ready?
dialog: 
text: SUDDENLY, the barrier from behind Sartain is thrust with
text: brute strength inward. Its velocity pins Dr. Sartain against
text: the steering wheel.
dialog: 
text: Allyson screams as the cage slams Sartain until he is still.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The cops look at the car ahead. They can't see the commotion
text: because of the glare of the lights. They turn off their

speaker_heading: OFFICER RICHARDS
speaker_heading: (INTO RADIO)

scene_heading: INT. HAWKINS' SQUAD CAR. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The Shape is out. Allyson panics in the back seat as The
text: Shape grabs Sartain by the feet and drags him out of the car.
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: His head hits the concrete hard. Sartain struggles. He is not
dialog: unconscious yet.
dialog: 
text: The Shape takes a knee and gags Sartain against the pavement.
text: He hears the loudspeaker from the police car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: OFFICER HAWKINS
dialog: (over P.A.)
dialog: Hawkins, please respond.
dialog: 
text: As The Shape stands to see the approaching police car,
text: Allyson makes an escape and dashes into the woods.
dialog: 
text: The Shape watches her go and then looks down to an injured
text: Sartain at his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN
dialog: But you said I could watch.
dialog: 
text: The Shape lift HIS BOOT OVER SARTAIN'S HEAD. Sartain looks at
text: his own reflection in the metal side of the vehicle. A sick
text: grin on the doctor's face--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. SARTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it.
dialog: 
text: The SHAPE STOMPS DOWN ON DOCTOR SARTAIN'S HEAD. HIS SKULL
text: CAVES IN-- BRAINS SHIT OUT.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Allyson looks back and sees The Shape-- staring down at his

text: Allyson runs as fast as she can.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD/POLICE CRUISER. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Richards and Francis have their guns draw as they step toward

dialog: 
text: They throw hand signals then move about either direction of

dialog: 
text: They take a beat to find their courage and step to the other

dialog: 
text: THE SHAPE IS GONE. Just the gruesome remains of Doctor

dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Allyson moves quickly through the woods. Bloody, tired,

dialog: 
text: She sees the disturbing SILHOUETTES OF MANNEQUINS that Laurie

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Ray plays with the untangled yo-yo that Laurie had at the

dialog: 
text: He sees a police cruiser slowly rolling up to the front of
text: the house. It hits a couple of garbage cans and then stops.
dialog: 
text: Curious, he gets up and goes to the front door. The door has

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

dialog: 
text: Ray moves toward the car, knocks on the window and then opens
text: the driver's side door.
dialog: 
text: What he sees is a mind-blowing moment of horror: Officer
text: Richards has his throat slit and Doctor Sartain's pen blade
text: jammed through his ear. AND- in his lap sits Officer Francis'
dialog: head...
dialog: 
text: CARVED LIKE A JACK O' LANTERN WITH TRIANGLE EYES CUT OUT, A

text: WITH A BLADE. A FLASH LIGHT POINTS UP THROUGH THE NECK
scene_heading: ILLUMINATING THE ENTIRE NIGHTMARE.
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ray loses his balance and takes a step back. He hears the

dialog: 
text: Ray turns slowly and sees THE SHAPE step up behind him and
text: instantly wrap the chain of the wind chime around Ray's neck.
dialog: 
text: He chokes and wheezes and swings his arms wildly trying to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE

text: Laurie turns back toward the window with her shotgun to keep
text: an eye along The Shape. Before she gets a glance, the glass
text: of one window smashes.
dialog: 
text: THE SHAPE'S RIGHT ARM reaches through and grabs her by the
text: side and then slides to her throat. Her weapon is useless as
text: he pulls her into the door.
dialog: 
text: THE OTHER ARM punches through the other window and reaches
text: desperately for her.
dialog: 
text: She spins around until her back is to the door. Her left hand
text: reaches up and grabs hold of The Shape's spastic hand.
dialog: 
text: With her right hand, Laurie PUMPS HER SHOTGUN and points it
text: toward The Shape's LEFT HAND. He grabs hold of the barrel and
text: she pulls the trigger. HIS LEFT HAND EXPLODES. TWO FINGERS
text: disintegrated by the blast. His thumb and two others remain.
text: He lets go and his arms retreat.

scene_heading: INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. BASEMENT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Shanah hears footsteps above her. She looks and considers the
text: overwhelming arsenal beside her: A crossbow, a semi-automatic
text: rifle, a shotgun and a small handgun, etc.
dialog: 
text: She grabs the smallest firearm on the wall and walks to the
text: base of the ladder as footsteps pace above her.
dialog: 
text: She hears the island move aside and the hinges of the door
dialog: lift open.
dialog: 
text: She's nervous, but the gun is ready. She pulls the trigger-
speaker_heading: CLICK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: It only works if you load it,
dialog: Sweetheart.
dialog: 
text: She's relieved to see her mother who climbs quickly down with
text: her shotgun to join her.
dialog: 
text: Laurie walks to the wall and exchanges her pump-action
text: shotgun for a rifle.
dialog: 
text: She flips a circuit breaker to turn the lights off upstairs
text: and then flips a switch to slide the island back into place.
dialog: 
text: They listen quietly as Laurie loads rounds into the rifle.
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The sound of the front door opening. FOOTSTEPS above them.
text: Dust falls from the ceiling.
dialog: 
text: Laurie tracks the steps with the site of her gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE (CONT'D)
text: He's right there.
dialog: 
text: Laurie fire three rounds into the ceiling at the position she
text: suspects The SHAPE to be. All goes silent.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Allyson approaches and sees the house through the trees, face
text: full with both fear and relief.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE on Laurie as she rises from her basement door with her
dialog: rifle ready.
dialog: 
text: She looks around the dark living room and sees no sign of The
text: Shape. Her senses are on high alert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Michael?!
dialog: 
text: She hears a noise, turns and fires. Blasts a hole in the wall
text: of the living room. The muzzle flash lights the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Michael?! Come out.
dialog: 
text: Another sound. BLAM! She fires at a shadow.
dialog: 
text: A tree branch hits the window.
dialog: 
text: She turns, blasts the kitchen pantry.
dialog: 
text: Laurie walks to the living room. Blasts the staircase
dialog: upstairs.
dialog: 
text: She disappears into a back room. We hear a three more blasts.
dialog: 
text: She comes back out and looks toward a living room closet. She
text: shoots a hole in it. Listens. Hears weeping in the distance.
dialog: 
text: She looks out the broken window of the front door and sees
text: Allyson crying. Her granddaughter kneeled over the body of
dialog: her dead father.
dialog: 
text: Laurie switch gears from a predator to the protector.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Allyson, you can't be here.
dialog: 
text: She run to her upset granddaughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm so sorry. It's not over. You
dialog: need to run. Run and hide. Go to
dialog: the road and don't look back. Get
dialog: help. Save yourself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: I'm not leaving without you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: You must. Go now. I love you.
dialog: 
text: Allyson gets up and walks backwards. She look to the front
text: door and sees The Shape standing on the porch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: Grandmother?!
dialog: 
text: Laurie turns and instinctively aims the gun toward The Shape
text: and fires. The bullet blasts directly over The Shape's
text: shoulder. A porch light shatters.
dialog: 
text: -- Miss. She's out of bullets.
dialog: 
text: Laurie quickly drops the gun and pulls a large hunting knife
text: out of a sheath on her belt. The Shape stands with a kitchen
text: knife in his hand. A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN.
dialog: 
text: He steps off the porch toward her. Laurie looks back and sees
text: Allyson stumbling backwards.
dialog: 
text: With the mind-set of a mamma bear, Laurie turns back to The
text: Shape and charges him.
dialog: 
text: Their blades meet. Limbs entangled. The Shape loses blood
text: from his missing fingers, but his momentum is relentless. He
text: drives his knife into Laurie's chest. She swings and slices
text: his arm.
dialog: 
text: Allyson screams.
dialog: 
text: On THE PORCH: We see Shanah slowly opening the front door
text: with the POINT OF A HIGH TECH CROSSBOW.
dialog: 
text: After a brief struggle, The Shape twists his knife and forces
text: Laurie to the ground. He pulls the blade out.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Shanah's eyes swell with fear. Her jaw shakes as she takes
text: aim. She considers the shot but instead lowers the crossbow
dialog: in defeat.
dialog: 
text: Then Laurie catches her eye from the ground. A neutral
text: expression of control that says everything.
dialog: 
text: The Shape lifts his knife back for the deathblow, and before
text: it falls, Shanah raises the crossbow and pulls the trigger,
text: RELEASES HER ARROW.
dialog: 
text: It penetrates The Shape from behind. Underneath his right
text: shoulder. The point and beak jut out by inches.
dialog: 
text: The Shape DROPS HIS knife and pulls the pointer and slides it
text: back and forth. He gets to his feet and struggles to remove
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Allyson walks toward them and grabs the fallen knife.
dialog: 
text: She keeps The Shape at bay as she grabs her grandmother under
text: her arms and drags her back through the yard.
dialog: 
text: The Shape stumbles forward into the woods.
dialog: 
text: Shanah runs to Allyson and Laurie. They help her to her feet
text: as she bleeds. Nearly unconscious. They put pressure on the
dialog: wound.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAURIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: In a flurry of motion and panic, Shanah and Allyson run with
text: Laurie. As they struggle down the long, dark wooded
text: driveway, they breathe heavily, exhausted physically and
text: emotionally. Feet drag, bodies strain. The effort is arduous.
dialog: 
text: Laurie looks back at The Shape disappearing into the trees.
text: She is in and out of consciousness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Kill it. Kill it. It must die.
dialog: 
text: Her whispers fall on deaf ears.
dialog: 
text: Shanah and Allyson miss it in the strain of their efforts.
text: They reach the gate which has been broken open.
dialog: 
text: Shanah holds Laurie while Allyson steps into the road and
text: looks both ways.
dialog: 
text: Hawkins' abandoned squad car in one direction and a pair of
text: headlights in the other direction.
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Allyson waves her arms as the headlights approach.
dialog: 
text: A PICK-UP TRUCK pulls over.
dialog: 
text: Shanah lifts Laurie toward the truck. Allyson helps.
dialog: 
text: THE DRIVER drops the gate of the bed of the truck.
dialog: 
text: The driver helps the severely injured Laurie into the truck.
dialog: 
text: Her daughter and granddaughter get in, sit beside her and
text: hold her tight.
dialog: 
text: The truck ROARS INTO DRIVE and speeds down the road.
dialog: 
text: The woman rest, stunned and numb and reflective of the night
text: behind them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS. NIGHT.
dialog: 
text: The Shape, wounded. He pulls the arrow from his chest and
text: moves through the forest.
dialog: 
text: SIRENS WAIL in the distance. His WHITE mask catching the
dialog: moonlight.
dialog: 
text: The Shape comes to a clearing. He turns and looks back in the
text: direction of Laurie's house. He watches, BREATHING...
dialog: 
text: He touches his chest. Feels his wounds; his missing fingers.
dialog: 
text: We reveal that he is standing among the shattered artificial
text: faces of mannequins.
dialog: 
text: The Shape walks to a tree and takes a seat. His head tilts
text: back as his hand presses into his blood stained clothing. His
text: breathing deepens.
dialog: 
text: Exhausted, or possibly his last.
dialog:
