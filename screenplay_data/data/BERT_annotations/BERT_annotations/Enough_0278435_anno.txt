scene_heading: NOTE ON TITLES:
text: GRAPHIC TITLES pop up throughout. Some are chapter titles,
text: others more like the explanatory arrows found in cartoons.
text: Sometimes the words present themselves in normal fashion. At
text: other times, they're loosely spaced or sharply angled or
text: individual words flash up one after another. i.e., titles
dialog: ought to be wilder and less uniform than I suggest on the page.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEY
text: HER FACE. FLASHES . She looks gorgeous, then ordinary,
text: sloppy, white waitress uniform, gorgeous again, dishes stacked
text: in her arms, turning, looking, happy, tired. INTERCUT TITLES.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Hi, can I help you?
dialog: What would you like?
dialog: Want a menu?
dialog: Hey Billy.
dialog: Hey Tom.
dialog: You take care, Rosie.
dialog: We get a sense of her: 23, smart, good attitude, proud to be on
text: her own and supporting herself even if the job is menial. She
text: moves quickly, physically, with an almost athletic grace -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Sure thing, Annie. Have a good one.
dialog: That's two straight up.
dialog: You're good to go.
dialog: Morning.
dialog: Hey there.
dialog: Morning to you.
dialog: (beat, embarrassed)
dialog: What?
text: (looks down, sees she's
dialog: carrying lunch food)
dialog: Right. Afternoon.
text: A sense of the diner too. 50's-style joint: hip, lively; a fun

text: FLURRY OF MOVEMENT, WAITRESSES setting up for lunch, Slim
text: joking with GINNY (28, knocked around but still spirited; two
text: kids at home from different guys; she somehow maintains a good
text: attitude). Slim views Ginny as her idol: for her attitude, not
text: her life. Catch them in mid-conversation, Ginny slightly
dialog: offended, working-class accent:
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Why not? My grandfather was a
dialog: lawyer... Plus: I have a logical
dialog: mind...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: And you're only like 299 thousand
dialog: short of what you'd need for law
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: FAST RIFF:
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: I Piece of cake -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Piece of pie -
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Piece of ass. So what would you do?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: GINNY
speaker_heading: LIAR -
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: I'm also thinking... well ...I could
dialog: go back to school.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: In what? I thought you hated -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Psychology maybe, I don't know.
dialog: I know it's not cool to say so, but
dialog: I'd like to contribute something to
dialog: society, even if - (it's just)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: We contribute. We give 'em food,
dialog: energy, so they can go out and
dialog: save Western Civilization -
text: A bell rings, a CUSTOMER comes in, and the owner of the place,
text: PHIL (45, Syrian, also the cook) sticks his head between them:
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Ladies, please. Am I paying you?
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Not that we noticed.
speaker_heading: (SEES CLOCK: 11:15)
dialog: Oh my God, speaking.of time -
text: The lunch rush is coming; they start working triple speed -
scene_heading: INT. "ORCA." LATER.
text: Ginny and Slim converge carrying dirty dishes, piling them up
text: for the BUSBOY, TEDDY (21, Hispanic). They haven't stopped
text: moving for two hours, but now they can take a breath, survey
text: the scene. Slim notices Ginny has a wet spot under her arm.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Ever try the rock, hey?
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: The deodorant thing. It's salts or
dialog: something, it comes in like a...it
dialog: looks like some kinda hippie crystal.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: You're saying I sweat.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Perspire, Ginny. You lightly -
speaker_heading: (PERSPIRE)
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: (a vow to get even)
dialog: I'll remember that.
dialog: (as someone comes in)
dialog: Your turn, I'm sweatin' too much.
text: Slim gives her a look, grabs a menu, goes over to where the new
dialog: customer, whom we will call for the moment OUR HERO, is seated.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4
text: When she reaches his booth, she notices he's got a book and a
text: long-stemmed red rose. She hands him a menu -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Waiting for somebody?
text: He shakes his head. She can't help noticing he's very
dialog: handsome.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.
dialog: Something to drink?
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: Just water, thanks.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I'll give you a minute to look over -
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: That's okay. I was in yesterday...
dialog: (reads her nametag)
dialog: Slim.
text: She nods, slightly uncomfortable. He hands her his menu.
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: What's your real name?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: Hmm. I like it, but don't you think
dialog: it's kinds negative?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No, I don't tell my name.
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: Okay. Coke and a turkey burger,
dialog: coleslaw no fries, couple extra
dialog: slices tomato. I write books.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: You read books?
text: She kind of half-nods half-shrugs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5
speaker_heading: OUR HERO (CONT.)
dialog: What're you reading now?
text: She stares at him...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Finneaan's Wake by James Joyce. A
dialog: friend told me it's the hardest book
dialog: in the English Language. Not the
dialog: hardest hardest, just the hardest
dialog: one it's actually possible to read,
dialog: and I figure if I can get through
dialog: that one, I can do the others.
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: How long you been reading it?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Six years. I'll be back with your
dialog: TB.
text: She leaves, goes back puts the order in, mutters to Ginny:
speaker_heading: SLIM {CONT.}
dialog: Asshole.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Wanted to find out how smart I was
dialog: so I told him I was reading the
dialog: hardest book in the English language.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: He likes you.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I think he's just a dick.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Slim...he was in yesterday -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I know -
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: And he's back today with a rose,
dialog: he pulls you into conversation.
dialog: Honey, if you can't tell he likes
dialog: you, you need to study psychology.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Okay, so he likes me.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Do you like him?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don't know him.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: What's that got to do with it?
dialog: Slim: he is a major piece of
dialog: cake/piece of pie.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I didn't notice.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Trust me. Carrot cake. And when
dialog: a guy like that - cuter than you? -
dialog: he actually likes you -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: He's cuter than me??
text: tinny gives her a long stare; this is obviously a favorite
speaker_heading: ROUTINE:
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Hey. Wise up, huh? No-one is
dialog: ever gonna go for you 'cause of
dialog: your looks.
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (NODS SOBERLY)
dialog: That is bad news, 'cause my
dialog: personality bites.
text: Ginny grins. Slim writes up a check for a CUSTOMER at the
text: counter. When she finishes, the turkey burger is up.
text: She carries it to the table:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: TB, coleslaw, and so forth. You
dialog: don't really write books, do you?
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don't read Finnecan's Wake either.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: I'm goin' into law. Enforcement.
text: She nods. This is more like what she expected.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Who's the rose for?
text: He shrugs.
text: She's busy, so she starts to go:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Enjoy your grub, huh?
text: She's seven feet away when she hears:
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
speaker_heading: HEY -
text: Sheturns back toward him -
text: He smiles, offers the rose:
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: You.
text: She smiles back-their eyes meet... a sudden utterly magical
dialog: moment. This is also the moment to.note OUR HERO should be
text: played by a famous actor doing a cameo. Because at this
text: instant the scene changes.
text: The man (MITCH) in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we haven't
text: noticed because all we've seen is the back of his head - turns
text: and looks at Slim. Stands. Looks down at Our Hero...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How much did you settle on?
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: Excuse. me?
text: Slim frowns, steps closer so she can overhear:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: The bet. How much is it?
text: Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face -
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: You and your friend. Yesterday.
dialog: Was it 200 or 500 or - ?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (TO MITCH)
dialog: What're you -
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: He bet his friend he could get in
dialog: your pants in less than twelve
dialog: hours, starting noon today.
text: Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest, which
dialog: looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger -
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: Is this your business?
dialog: (right in Mitch's face)
dialog: What are you, the morals police?
text: He pushes again and Mitch,s hand shoots out like a snake
text: striking. Grabs him by the collar. Lifts him. A frozen
text: moment, more violence just a breath away, and a sense of things
text: about to spin out of control... Our Hero's eyes are popping;
text: he tries to hide his fear:
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: Take it easy, M...man. She and
dialog: I were just having some fun -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: (to our Hero)
dialog: Was it two hundred or five?
speaker_heading: (VERY CALM)
dialog: I want to know what I'm worth.
dialog: Our Hero gestures to Mitch: would you mind putting me down?
text: Mitch reluctantly obliges.
text: Our Hero does his best to recollect his dignity. Looks at
text: Slim. Drops a ten on the table and smirks:
speaker_heading: OUR HERO
dialog: The bet was two, but now that I
dialog: know you? Way too high.
text: A pained look flashes across Slim's face -
text: Our Hero starts toward the door, but Mitch steps in his path.
text: Speaks quietly but with authority; there's a physical power in
text: his words. Since he's protecting Slim, the power is
speaker_heading: COMFORTING:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Don't come back here, buddy. Ever.
text: Our Hero nods nervously.
text: Mitch steps back 3 inches, just far enough to let our Hero
text: leave. Which he does with considerable relief.
text: Slim's leaning vs. the counter, shaken, tears in her eyes -
text: Mitch tugs his baseball cap, mutters as he heads for the door:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Sorry to get in your business.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No. Hey. Thank you.
text: He nods, keeps going.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: (blurts out, grateful:)
dialog: I... I can't believe you actually
dialog: said something.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (turns, shrugs)
dialog: If I'd kept my mouth shut, I'd'a
dialog: felt bad later.
dialog: Good luck, huh?
text: She nods.
text: He ambles out the door. A touch of the cowboy in him.
text: She shakes her head, looks at Ginny.
text: Ginny gestures as if to say, well?
text: At first Slim doesn't get it.
dialog: Ginny gestures more urgently: Come on. What're you waiting
text: for? She looks toward the door -
text: Slim follows her look. PUSH IN ON SLIM'S FACE as she tries to
dialog: work up the courage...
text: Just as she starts toward the door, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: BRIDE AND
scene_heading: EXT. OLD PASADENA ESTATE. NIGHT.
speaker_heading: FLASHES:
dialog: Wedding photos. Mitch has lots of (surprisingly upper crust)
text: family, Slim has a few friends. The more photos FLASH, the
text: more pronounced (and sad), the contrast. FLY RIGHT INTO:
text: Bacchanalian DANCING. French Champagne has flowed; shoes and
text: inhibitions were abandoned hours ago. THE CAMERA weaves
dialog: through the DANCERS to find:
text: Slim and Mitch, dancing close, never quite touching, every move
text: intense, physical, like subtle public sex. Their eyes are
text: locked; she runs her veil down his body, his hand lightly
text: touches her ass; they slow down and stand, lips a millimeter
text: apart but not quite kissing, the sexual tension building...
dialog: We see how crazy they are about each other, how completely
dialog: physically involved - and how much fun they have.
text: Watching them is Phil, with Mitch's parents, MRS. TYLER (58,
text: confident, at ease with her power and family money, and
dialog: likeable despite monstrous flaws) and MR. TYLER (someone Mrs.
text: Tyler married in a moment of cupidity).
speaker_heading: MRS. TYLER
dialog: Mitch was kind of.. .evasive. Is her
dialog: father dead too?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Dead to her. He left when she was
dialog: two.
speaker_heading: MRS. TYLER
dialog: Oh. Well, I'm happy to pay for the
speaker_heading: WEDDING -
speaker_heading: MR. TYLER
dialog: Yes, we're very happy -
speaker_heading: MRS, TYLER
dialog: (ignoring Mr. T.)
dialog: It's a way to build bridges... Not
dialog: that you can... (repair all the
dialog: damage) When there's such a vast
dialog: body of water...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You don't get along with your son?
text: She gives him a look. She's both offended by, and appreciative
text: of, his bluntness. Looks out at Mitch:
speaker_heading: MRS. TYLER
dialog: He's like my father. Which means, I
dialog: guess, that he'll do very well.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: He's done well to get Miss Slim.
speaker_heading: MRS. TYLER
dialog: Yes, he has, hasn't he? He's married
dialog: down, but he's gotten value.
text: As Phil reacts, he notices his wife, SALIMA, has joined him.
text: With her are two kids (5 and 2).
text: Salima's looking out at the floor: not at Slim, but at Ginny
text: and her dance partner. We see a thought cross her mind. She
text: bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids.
text: They whoop their response, run out to Ginny (who looks quite
text: uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress).
scene_heading: FIVE YEAR OLD SON
dialog: Mom! Mom! Mom! Can we spend the
dialog: night at Phil and Salima's house?
text: Ginny looks over, winks at Salima, and kisses her kids:
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Don't eat at their ice cream, huh?
text: They squeal with pleasure and run off.
text: Ginny turns back, resumes dancing with JOE (24, handsome in a
dialog: casual way, a good guy):
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: So this was during college or after?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: During.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: What was wrong with you?
dialog: (off his puzzled look)
dialog: I mean-why'd you and Slim break
dialog: up?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh. Well. I'm terrible in bed.
dialog: (lets this hang for a moment
dialog: for shock value, then:)
dialog: Plus, I don't know: we just sort
dialog: of.. . evolved into being friends.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Evolution? You were going the
dialog: wrong direction, bud.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's kinda what .1 thought, but I
dialog: guess I was so totally pathetic -
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Why am I not believing this?
speaker_heading: (INTRIGUED)
dialog: Can I take you home right now?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If you've got a sense of humor.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: My kids are out for the night, and...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Another thing: I live in Chicago;
dialog: women always want the possibility of
speaker_heading: LONG-TERM -
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: I didn't propose, huh?
dialog: I just want to have...
dialog: (looks at him...)
text: a brief and completely unsatisfying
dialog: sexual encounter.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hey. I'm your guy.
text: She pulls him into a kiss, and...well: he's not a bad kisser...
text: We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving. Suddenly:
text: tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You sure,you love me?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Uh-huh...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: For ever and ever?
text: He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You're safe with me, Slim. You're
dialog: safe, and it's okay to be happy.
dialog: We deserve it.
text: They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over,
dialog: waits. When they break:
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'm sorry, I gotta get up five
dialog: o'clock to buy green beans.
text: He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand:
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: In my country, it's tradition to
dialog: give money to groom. You don't
dialog: need it, but...
text: Slim shakes her head, touched, as:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's very sweet -
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (HUGGING PHIL)
dialog: Thanks for giving me away, okay?
dialog: You're the best substitute Dad a girl
dialog: could possibly have.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No substitute. I am real thing.
text: She kisses him, and he goes. They look after him.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: He really loves you.
text: She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of
dialog: course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away.
text: Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top
text: of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is
text: this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You gonna give me babies?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Oh yeah.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How soon?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: How soon can we get out of here?
text: He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor.
dialog: Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You
dialog: have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CONQUERING HERO
scene_heading: EXT. SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE WITH GROUNDS. DAY.
text: Slim (4 months pregnant) stands'on the walkway leading up to a
text: large, simple,' beautiful house. Mitch is knocking at the door.
text: The man who answers the door is 62, white-haired, vigorous.
text: Looks like he walked out of a Viagra ad.
speaker_heading: HOME OWNER
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hi. We've been driving around,
dialog: and my wife has completely fallen
dialog: in love with your house.
speaker_heading: HOME OWNER
dialog: It's great, isn't it?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We want to buy it.
text: The Home Owner's jaw drops as Mitch gestures toward his bulging
speaker_heading: WIFE:
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: My wife wants it for our family.
speaker_heading: HOME OWNER
dialog: (polite but firm)
dialog: Well...we're not selling.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Sure you are.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15
text: Mitch hands him a slip of paper. Totally amiable:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's the price. Don't worry, it's
text: well over-market.
speaker_heading: HOME OWNER
dialog: (stunned, a little scared)
dialog: You... You're out of your mind.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I know. That's just it. So before
dialog: you say no again, think how miserable
dialog: one determined crazy person can make
dialog: you. Miserable today, miserable
dialog: tomorrow, miserable for every single
dialog: day until the day you sell.
text: We glimpse the Home Owner's will just starting to crumble...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: Your kids are grown, you'll be
text: happier in a smaller place.
text: MOVE OFF the Owner's face... SLOW PAN TO the window of the house
dialog: .the SENSE that time is passing... and when we reach the
text: window, we see SLIM inside. MOVE THROUGH the window...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY.
text: Six weeks later. She's happily putting away groceries.
text: Whistling to herself. What we can see of the house feels good:
text: the furnishings are simple, casual, friendly.
text: She's putting a bottle of oil up on a shelf. . .but it never
text: quite gets there. Her face changes. Something's happened.
text: The hand holding the oil lowers... the oil bottle slips through
text: her fingers and smashes on the floor...
text: Oil spreading across the floor...
text: She stares at it.
text: Claws the air, grabbing the cordless phone as she plops down on
text: a kitchen barstool. Starts to cry. Punches the autodialer.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It's Slim, is he there?
text: Water is flooding down the barstool; she's miscarried.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: Well, will you please just... Just
dialog: tell him I'm sorry, okay?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SECOND PREGNANCY
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S OFFICE. DAY.
text: A central area with large offices surrounding it, GUYS IN
scene_heading: SUITS, GUYS IN CONSTRUCTION GEAR, ARCHITECTS, ATTRACTIVE YOUNG
text: WOMEN. . .all moving quickly, purposefully. TWO UNIFORMED COPS
text: come out of a room putting envelopes into their pockets.
dialog: Projects everywhere. Models, photos, charts and timelines:
dialog: when the concrete's going to be poured, when the inspector
text: comes, etc. Mitch is building mini-malls.
text: In the center of this activity, Mitch moves from one locus of
dialog: energy to the next: answering questions, making suggestions.
text: Gradually we perceive something, motion slower than the rest of
text: the office. Slim. Coming toward him. He sees her. Sees her
text: expression. She stops. He realizes:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You saw the doctor?
text: It's so obvious from her face that she barely needs to'say it:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I lost this one too.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: B A B Y L O V E
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL. DAY.
text: Slim lies in bed. Very pale, a light dust of sweat. We assume
text: she's between contractions. Mitch's face inches from hers;
text: smothering her with kisses.
text: The Nurse brings the baby in, starts to give her to Slim -
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Can I hold her?
text: The Nurse looks at Slim,. who nods, and gives Mitch the baby.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 17
text: He kisses her head, dances with her.
text: Slim looks adoringly at father and daughter: the sight is
text: almost unbelievably sweet.
text: His cell phone rings. He keeps dancing, ignoring it.
text: After one ring, it stops.
text: He's kissing the baby's head over and over, just like he kissed
text: Slim, and staring into the infant's eyes -
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: She looks just like my baby
dialog: pictures.
text: His cell phone rings again. As if the previous call had been a
dialog: signal.
text: Slim looks at him as the phone keeps ringing.
text: With some difficulty, juggling the baby, he turns the phone
dialog: off.
text: But he doesn't look at Slim.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't know. Who cares? Some
dialog: construction thing, I guess.
text: She stares at him.
text: He stares at the baby.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Isn't she the most beautiful
dialog: thing you ever saw in your life?
text: Slim nods cautiously.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: THE MOMENT YOU KNOW
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE. DAY.
text: Remains of a picnic. Slim's playing with their daughter,
text: GRACIE, now 4. Says something and Gracie laughs. Slim laughs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IS
text: Keeps laughing, which really gets Gracie going. Mitch looks
text: on, tries to join in, but it's forced-and besides that:
text: they're not even looking at him, not inviting his laughter;
dialog: it's all between the mother and child.
text: So he stops trying. Just watches them. And before his eyes,
text: they become - for an instant - strangers. As this reaction,
text: and the subtle hostility it engenders, flicker across his face,
text: Slim looks up at him -
text: For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf
dialog: between them...
text: Then Gracie says something. Slim turns back toward her, the
text: "girls" are laughing again...and Mitch is not.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM/BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: SHOWER STALL. Glass, opaque, streaked with water and soap so
text: as to give a slightly freaky aspect. Someone inside.
text: Slim watching. Smiles. Starts to take off her clothes.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (FLIRTATIOUS)
dialog: Should I join you?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm about to get out.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: (down to her panties)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I have to go to back to work, I'm
dialog: just doing this to wake myself up.
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (DISAPPOINTED)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (starts to go)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (CALLS)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
dialog: Yeah. (Me too.)
text: She's in the bedroom now. It's underlit, full of shadows. In
text: scary-movie nomenclature, she's exposed, vulnerable; it feels
text: like someone's going to leap out and attack her at any -
text: Not this time. She throws on shorts and a t-shirt -
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT.
text: She looks in on Gracie, sleeping peacefully. Consoling image.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
text: She's washing dishes, bored, humming to herself. The counter's
text: covered with take-out food containers: she didn't cook.
text: A noise. Pager. Not beeping, just humming slightly: she
text: wouldn't even hear it except it's on the tile counter.
text: Sounds vaguely like a vibrator. Lying there, just a few feet
text: from her. With Mitch's wallet and keys, his cell phone.
text: She looks at it. .knows she shouldn't... decides not to...
text: Can't resist. Dries her.hands methodically on a dishtowel.
text: Picks up the pager. Reads: 33.
text: She stares, realizing: it's code.
text: She looks at the cell phone. Wonders whether...
text: Looks toward the hall. We HEAR the shower still running...
text: She picks up his cell phone. Tentatively - she's not sure this
text: will work - she presses: RECALL 33.
text: The phone flashes NAME, but instead of a name there's: .
text: She stares at this, glances again down the hall-takes a deep
text: breath.. .and presses SEND.
text: Waits... listens nervously...

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
speaker_heading: (FLIRTATIOUS)
dialog: Hello there.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You just paged my husband, right?
speaker_heading: (HALF BEAT)
dialog: Mitch.
speaker_heading: (HALF BEAT)
dialog: Who are you, what's your name?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: I'm sorry, I -
speaker_heading: SLIM
text: It's too late to deny it.
dialog: Tell me your - (name)
text: A rustle on the other end -
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: Don't hang upl Don't be a cowardl
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: Just your name. That's the least
dialog: you could do, don't you think?
text: A simple plea, one woman to another...
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: I'm...Darcelle.
text: Not only the name. Now we hear it in the accent: she's French.
dialog: Dialtone.
text: Slim goes into slow motion. How oddly her arm moves downward.
text: She looks at the phone. Blinks. Presses OFF.
text: Scans the room as if she's never seen it before.
text: One of Gracie's toys lies on the floor. Slim stares at it.
text: Reaches down to pick it up, but instead of the toy moving up,
text: her body moves down. She slumps to the floor. Sits. Stares.
scene_heading: WIDER ANGLE. MINUTES LATER.
text: Slim sitting on the floor. Frozen. Head bowed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21
text: Mitch comes out, dressed, sees her.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hey.
text: She doesn' t say anything.
text: He approaches her. Some instinct keeps him from speaking. He
text: sees she's holding his phone, the silly toy...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: How can you do this to Gracie?
text: He doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: Darcelle paged you. That' s where
dialog: you're going, right?
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: Yeah. Wow. Mitch? Can you please?
dialog: Can you sit here with me?
dialog: He does.
dialog: She doesn't know where to start, how to talk about it...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: She's French?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: She isn't important.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You're important.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: And Gracie.
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Mitch?, I can't... I couldn't stand
dialog: for this to... (destroy our lives)
dialog: I'm happy, I've really been happy,
dialog: and I don't want to - (give that up)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You won't have to. Believe me.
dialog: She's nothing, she's no-one -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You... Damn it! You said I was
dialog: safe with you!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You are, Slim. You are. I promise.
text: They fall into an embrace. We feel how keenly they need each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
text: They're hugging. Begin TIGHT on them. At first it seems like
dialog: this is the same embrace shot from a different angle. Then we
text: see we're in the kitchen, his briefcase is at his side; their
dialog: clothes are different.
speaker_heading: SING A SAD SONG
text: We watch Slim's expression slowly change. From pleasure. To
text: confusion. Pain. Outrage. She whispers:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I smell her.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Her perfume. Darcelle or whoever.
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: SLIM -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: (intense, sad)
dialog: How many, Mitch? How many are there?
dialog: How many have there been?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What does it matter?
text: A stunning statement. Even more stunning because of the casual
dialog: way he says it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: ID I mean what're you saying here, that
dialog: I don't deserve to get laid? Please.
dialog: I'm a man, Slim. With the
dialog: pregnancies, Gracie, you don't have
dialog: time and energy like you used to, and
dialog: I understand that, I really do. Men
dialog: and women have different needs, and
dialog: that's okay. Darcelle is willing to
dialog: take care of it, and maybe that's
dialog: better for everybody.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Including you?
text: He contemplates his answer...and shrugs.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No! No! No!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Calm down, Slim -
text: Wild, violently invading his space and assaulting his authority,
text: screaming at him, her face just inches from his:
dialog: I
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I can't do this anymore! I can't!
dialog: Just take it, and take it, and take
dialog: it!? I'm not strong enough! I don't
dialog: know who would be. I love you, okay?
dialog: I love you and I'm your wife and you
dialog: can't do this! You understand me?!!!
dialog: No more! No more!
text: With the same speed he attacked "Our Hero" at the diner,
text: Mitch's hand shoots out like a snake striking. Slaps her.
dialog: A warning: stop it and stop it now.
text: Her face: shock. Confusion. Outrage. She raises her hand to
text: her cheek. Touches her skin where his fist landed...
text: He reads her expression and is almost amused:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What, I can't hit you?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: (low, strong)
dialog: No. You can't.
text: He hits her again, this time with a closed fist.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24
text: Knocking her to the ground.
text: Stands over her like a boxer.
text: Sees rase flare across her face -
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You want to fight? I'm a mom,
dialog: honey; it's no contest.
text: She's silent, but we see (very small) her reaction: Oh yeah??
speaker_heading: MITCH {CONT.}
dialog: You have to understand, Slim.
dialog: I thought you did: make the money
dialog: here, so I set the rules, right?
dialog: It's my rules.
text: He waits for her response, but again she's silent.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You with me?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It's your rules.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah.
text: She keeps her voice meek so as not to offend:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: And if I don't like the rules??
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: If you don't "like" them?!
text: She nods cautiously.
speaker_heading: MITCH {CONT.}
dialog: Come on. Life isn't onl stuff we
dialog: like. We take the good with the bad,
dialog: right? That's what life is, what
dialog: marriage is. So maybe, for you,
dialog: today is a bad day.
dialog: Tomorrow may be great.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Tomorrow may be great.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Tomorrow will be great. (Without
dialog: you . )
text: He appears to miss her inference.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah. Today is the price you pay
dialog: for having such a good life.
text: She stares at him.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm going out.
text: She says nothing.
speaker_heading: MITCH {CONT.}
dialog: This is gonna be better, don't you
dialog: think?
text: She just cannot process the absurdity of this statement.
speaker_heading: MITCH {CONT.}
dialog: I don't have to sneak around, pretend
dialog: I'm going to work. I can just say:
dialog: "I'm going to Darcelle's, I'll be
dialog: back in a few hours."
text: Her face is completely blank.
text: He bends down, gives her a kiss on the head. We feel her skin
dialog: crawl.
text: She watches him go.
dialog: Waits.
text: Hears the front door close.
text: She gets up, walks to the window, watches him walk toward his
dialog: car.
text: She turns away, looks at the room. We HEAR his car start.
text: She goes to the phone. Thinks.
text: Starts to dial-slowly, deliberately...
text: Shock: RAP AT THE WINDOW! He's there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26
text: She reacts with guilt, but he doesn't look angry now. Behind
text: him is his idling Mercedes convertible, driver's door open...
text: He motions for her to open the window.
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Who you calling?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Your mother.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What're you gonna tell her?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I'm supposed to bring Gracie
dialog: tomorrow. Maybe I better cancel.
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: I was thinking. You...you know
dialog: that I adore you, but if you ever
dialog: want...if you want out...
text: For a second he can't talk. He's choked up.
text: She watches coldly. His emotion appears real, but who cares?
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: .I'll understand. I really will.
speaker_heading: (ALMOST TENDER)
dialog: But there's one thing: you can't
dialog: have Gracie. She's my daughter.
dialog: Don't even think about taking her.
text: Slim stares at him. He adds calmly:
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: If I see that thought even cross
dialog: your mind, I'll kill you.
text: There. He's said what he needs to. He walks toward his car.
text: She shuts the window.
text: Stares after him.
text: In an odd and defiant way, she starts to whistle. Loudly.
text: To herself. Almost daring him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27
text: He keeps walking.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OUTTA HERE
scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAY.
text: Emotional, impressionistic. CLOSE ON her face, almost inside
text: her skin: a visual symphony. The countryside behind her is out
text: of focus, a blur. She pulls up at a gate, punches in a code.
text: Drives up a long a driveway to:
scene_heading: EXT. PASADENA ESTATE. DAY.
text: FOUR JAGUARs lined up. At a respectful distance sit an old
text: Toyota (the maid's car) and a pick-up (the gardener's truck).
text: Slim parks near the truck.
text: Her hand moves to the door handle, but she can't bring herself
text: to open it. She sits... paralyzed, a failure.
text: In this prolonged pause, Mrs. Tyler bursts out of the house -
speaker_heading: MRS. TYLER
dialog: You're late, you're late, I was
dialog: worried you wouldn't comet
dialog: (looks, realizes)
dialog: No Gracie?
text: Slim shakes her head.
text: Mrs. Tyler is clearly disappointed, but quickly covers it up:
speaker_heading: MRS. TYLER
dialog: Well then, you and I will have a
text: girls' luncheon and gossip about
dialog: simply everybody!
text: She's about to hurtle into the gossip when Slim turns her head
text: and Mrs. Tyler sees (and we see for the first time) the result
text: of Mitch's brutality: a nasty bruise on Slim's cheek.
text: Mrs. Tyler's face falls as she realizes what this means.
text: Underneath it all, she's a warm person; she hugs Slim:
speaker_heading: MRS. TYLER
dialog: Oh baby. Oh baby, I'm so sorry...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28
text: HOLD a moment; like a mother-daughter tableau... Her tone
text: stays sympathetic, not at all accusatory:
speaker_heading: MRS. TYLER (CONT.)
dialog: What did you do? What'd you
dialog: say to him?
text: Slim freezes. On her sad, shocked reaction -
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. "ORCA" DINER. KITCHEN. DAY.
text: Ginny in the middle of an intense rap. She and Slim are wedged
text: in a corner booth. The off-season lunch rush has died down...
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Men are land mines. Some you trigger
dialog: the first week, others it's years in.
dialog: Problem is: you want a man man,
text: meaning his veins run thick with
dialog: testosterone, which is good 'cause
dialog: he can fuck your brains out but he
dialog: can also turn around, no warning,
dialog: and beat your brains out too.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I never touch Salima.
text: Ginny waves at him: of course not.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: But the other part, first part:
dialog: I can - (do that)
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Relax, Phil. Nobody's talkin' about
dialog: your dick here, okay?
text: Phil brings Slim an iced tea and slice of pie:
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You went to cops, I hope?
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: (Don't be stupid.) Mitch is in
dialog: construction, Phil.
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (NODS)
dialog: He knows every cop in the city.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Even if he didn't. My aunt? She got
dialog: a restraining order? When it was up,
text: this slimeball beat her into a coma.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: If he wants to put her in coma,
dialog: why worry restraining order?
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: 'Cause he's a man, Phil! He's
dialog: psychotic!
dialog: (calmly, to Slim)
dialog: You're leaving him today. Right now.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: (shakes her head, trapped)
dialog: I gotta pick up Gracie at pre-school.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PRE-SCHOOL. DAY.
text: THREE 4-YEAR-OLD GIRLS running toward a car, squealing.
text: They're all blond and adorable, and it takes a moment for us to
text: realize none of them is Gracie.
text: Slim sits in her car in the pick-up line. The Four Girls get
text: in the Volvo station wagon in front of her.
text: The Volvo pulls out, and Slim moves to the front of the line.
text: The very hip PRE-SCHOOL DIRECTOR smiles at Slim:
speaker_heading: PRESCHOOL DIRECTOR
dialog: Your husband got her.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What??
speaker_heading: PRESCHOOL DIRECTOR (CONT.)
dialog: Gracie was totally psyched. I told
dialog: him he should do it more often.
text: Slim nods with feigned casualness and pulls away. Slight smile
text: frozen on her face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HER HOME. DAY.
text: She pulls in. No other car there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30
scene_heading: INT. HER HOME. DAY.
text: She looks around. Nothing abnormal except the quiet. As if
dialog: they've gone and are never coming back.
text: She digs out her cell phone, punches the first number on the
text: automatic dialer. Presses SEND.
text: Thinks. After one ring, she disconnects.
text: Immediately presses RECALL, then SEND.
speaker_heading: HE ANSWERS:
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
speaker_heading: (FOR DARCELLE)
dialog: How is my little croissant?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It's your loaf of bread.
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: (cheerful, no guilt)
dialog: Oh. Hi. How's it going?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: Zoo.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Why didn't you tell me you were
dialog: going to - (pick up Gracie)
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: I called you at home, left messages -
text: He's interrupted by a LOUD SQUEAL from Gracie, followed by a
dialog: question, which he answers:
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE (CONT.)
dialog: Your Mom.
speaker_heading: GRACIE'S VOICE
dialog: Hey Moml The elephants are peeing!
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: (pleased with himself for
dialog: being a good Dad)
text: She's a little excited.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: When are you coming home?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT.
dialog: Dinner. It's scary that Mitch will have this conversation in
text: front of Gracie, who's playing at their feet:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It made me nervous when I
dialog: couldn't reach you.
text: Slim shrugs.
text: He stares at her. Smiles. His voice so soft and calm:
speaker_heading: MITCH {CONT.}
dialog: Do you have any idea how bad
dialog: things can get?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Educate me.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (embarrassed to say it)
dialog: Slim. I'm a determined person. I
dialog: was determined to have you, and I
dialog: did. This house...the company...I
dialog: am, and always will be, a person who
dialog: gets what he wants. You can either
dialog: share in my success or leave us
dialog: (meaning him and Gracie)
dialog: right now. Which way you wanna go?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I want to be happy.
text: He's not sure of her subtext, but he's willing to give her the
dialog: benefit of the doubt :
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Good.
text: With a sudden shock, Slim sees Gracie staring at Mitch: the
text: girl has picked up on his tone.
text: Slim glances at Mitch to see if he notices Gracie's expression.
text: He doesn't.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32
text: Slim looks back at Gracie: still staring at Mitch. If she
text: already senses what's happening, how long before she's affected
dialog: by it? How long before she sees Mitch become violent?
text: Slim's jaw tightens slightly; her resolve grows stronger.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: Mitch asleep, Slim awake, listening. His breathing deep,
text: rhythmic, slight hint of a snore.
text: In the distance, a DOVE coos.
text: She looks at her clock: 2:15.
text: She eases out of bed.
text: Goes into the bathroom. We hear the sound of her peeing.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM.
text: She's no peeing. A BOTTLE is propped up, running water into
text: the toilet as Slim gets dressed. Quickly, silently.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: She leans out the bathroom doorway, sees: he's still asleep.
text: She moves quickly, bathroom to hall.
scene_heading: INT. GRACIE'S ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Gracie's fast asleep. Slim lifts her up, piles her prized
text: teddy bear on top.
scene_heading: INT. HALL. NIGHT.
text: Slim carries Gracie toward the entrance. We MOVE with her.
text: She's silent, terrified. Glances over her shoulder -
dialog: No one there.
text: She keeps walking. The eerie sense of a house that's awake
text: rather than asleep. The almost imperceptible but anxiety-
text: provoking SWOOSH of her footsteps... EXTEND the suspense as
dialog: long as we possibly can...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33
text: She reaches the front door.
text: Waits to make sure all is quiet.
dialog: It is.
text: She turns, looks back down the hall.
dialog: Empty.
text: Reaches toward the doorknob... hand closer, closer... she starts
dialog: to turn it -
scene_heading: EXT. SLIM'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Ginny, Phil, and Teddy are clustered under a tree, staring at
text: the house. Waiting. Their VAN is parked down the road.
text: We expect the front door to open any instant.
dialog: It doesn't.
text: They wait. Casually. Not knowing where Slim was.
dialog: But we know. Did something go wrong? Slim was right at the
dialog: door.
text: In a casual way, her rescuers start to wonder.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
text: Maybe she didn't hear the signal.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: She heard it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No. Teddy's right. She could still
dialog: be asleep -
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: She's not asleep, okay? She's coming
dialog: out any second.
text: Phil nods.
dialog: They wait.
text: She does not come out.
text: Ginny shakes her head, looks at her watch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Do it again.
text: Teddy nods. Cups his hands, coos like a dove...
text: They wait again.
dialog: Beat.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Slim still frozen in exactly the same spot. Still carrying
text: Gracie, still with her hand on the knob. Listening. Turning
text: her head this way-that way. She hears the COOING DOVE NOISE
text: come again from outside.
text: That settles it. She pulls the door -
scene_heading: MITCH FLYING AT HER -
text: Grabs her, catches her, catches Gracie, pulling Slim's hair
text: hard, leading her away from the door -
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: The three rescuers still wait.
dialog: Frozen.
text: Phil shakes his head. We see a baseball bat in his hands.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We better go in.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: It'd be crazy to wake him. If
dialog: anything's wrong, she'll flick
dialog: the lights. .Right?
text: Phil nods skeptically, and Ginny herself doesn't seem so sure.
dialog: They look at the house-and wait. . .and wait... We want to
text: scream: "GO IN! GO! SAVE HER!"
text: Suddenly something. Subtle. Was that A SOUND from inside???
text: They go on alert. . .step forward... listen more closely...
dialog: But hear nothing unusual.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35
text: Phil. looks at Ginny, shrugs -
text: Ginny shrugs back -
text: FLASH OF LIGHT, then darkness. The signal.
text: They run toward the house -
text: SCREAM. Slim. Intense horrible spit of sound, replaced by an
text: even more horrible silence. Deadly silence. CLOSE ON GINNY as
dialog: they run: as if we've lost Slim and Ginny's.our new
text: protagonist. As we near the house, we realize: it's not
text: silence. There are sounds from inside: almost inaudible THUDS.
text: Sound of a beating. On Ginny's horrified reaction -
text: Baseball bat. Phil smashes a window.
text: They climb through the hole into the house -
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Silence. They move quickly, carefully toward the living room;
dialog: it's very dark, we can hardly -
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Another step and you're dead.
text: Mitch emerges from darkness. Light glints off his pistol.
text: Thirty feet behind him: Gracie's sleeping on the couch.
text: Mitch moves and they stare in horror. Lying at his feet is
text: Slim's body..
text: Pain springs from Ginny's throat, she rushes to Slim -
text: Mitch rams the gun into her head:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Didn't you hear me?i
text: Ginny feels Slim's pulse, says to Phil:
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: She's alive -
speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sir. We are three people. If you
dialog: kill us all, you will go sure to
dialog: electric chair.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I could give a shit.
text: Slim makes a SOUND as Ginny strokes her head...
text: Mitch FIRES the gun into the wall over Ginny's head. Muffled
text: sound: silencer. But he has everyone's attention now:
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: This is your last chance.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We are happy to leave, Sir: with
dialog: Miss Slim and Gracie.
text: Ginny's helping Slim to her knees.

text: Mitch stares at Phil. Walks to him. Is he going to hit him?
text: Shoot him? Mitch leans in, gun to Phil's head, and whispers:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't want to say this in front
dialog: of the group, but you're just a
dialog: rug-head, nobody'll believe you.
dialog: You go to the cops, it's her word
dialog: against mine. They'll find drugs
dialog: in her bureau...
dialog: (before Phil can laugh)
dialog: Or her car, whatever.
speaker_heading: (VERY STRONG)
dialog: Trust me on that.
dialog: (casual, confident)
dialog: I'll have custody of Gracie by the
dialog: end of the week.
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (SKEPTICAL)
dialog: And if we take them away, you will
dialog: shoot all four of us??
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's right.

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (VERY SOFT)
dialog: (This is no good.) You're
text: humiliating him.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: (a little louder)
dialog: He'll come after me and kill me.
text: Mitch overhears this, smiles.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You hear that? That's why she
dialog: loves me.
dialog: (off their horrified looks)
dialog: Nobody cares like I do.
text: The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: See you soon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VAN. NIGHT.

speaker_heading: CHECK, PLEASE
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE. DAY.
text: Gracie asleep, Slim holding her. Blinds down, movie playing.

scene_heading: EXT. NAVY PIER (CHICAGO). EVENING.

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Wow ... whattaya think, Toots?
speaker_heading: GRACIE
dialog: It's a big ocean!
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S CAR. NIGHT.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Coming up, whattaya say?!
speaker_heading: GRACIE &amp; SLIM
speaker_heading: (A GAME)
dialog: Bobbing for apples!
text: Slim (front seat) and Gracie (back) both drop their heads so

text: Joe turns the corner, presses a garage door opener, and drives
text: into the basement garage of a nice-looking 4-plex.
scene_heading: INT. JOE'S 4-PLEX. NIGHT.
text: They come in from the garage, throw off their coats. All the

text: He goes to the door, looks through the peep hole.
text: Sees a LARGE MAN IN A SUIT.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: FIRST FBI MAN
dialog: FBI. Can we talk?
text: He holds up an I.D. Not readable through the peep hole.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: FIRST FBI MAN
dialog: Would you mind opening up?
text: Joe glances over his shoulder: no sign of them. He opens the
text: door, but not far enough to let the man in. Behind the large
text: man are TWO OTHER MEN IN SUITS.
speaker_heading: FIRST FBI MAN
dialog: We're investigating a kidnapping;
dialog: we'd like to look around.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You got a search warrant?
speaker_heading: FIRST FBI MAN
dialog: Oh, we got a warrant all right.
text: He slaps a paper and pushes past Joe; the other men follow...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can I she the warrant?
text: First FBI Man ignores this.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: Who're you looking for?
text: The FBI Man gives him a sarcastic glance.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: A mother taking her own child isn't
dialog: kidnapping. I don't think you're
dialog: FBI at all.
text: This elicits no response. Joe moves to where he can see the
text: other two guys. Looks down the hall toward:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
text: SECOND FBI MAN searching the pantry, looking around.
text: He opens the door to the garage and vanishes -
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: THIRD FBI MAN looks under the bed, in the closets... yanks
dialog: clothes aside. At any moment we expect him to find them...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Mister: unless you leave right now,
dialog: I'm calling the police.
speaker_heading: FIRST FBI MAN
dialog: Oh...jeez...that's a scary thought.
text: Joe picks up the phone -
text: First FBI Man slams it down.
speaker_heading: FIRST FBI MAN
dialog: I marri a cop, okay? I'm not in
dialog: the mood.
text: Joe accepts this. . .but only for the moment.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE. NIGHT.
text: Second FBI Man looks in the car, under the car... isn't this the
dialog: logical place for them to hide???
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Third FBI Man returns from the bedroom emptyhanded, starts to
dialog: search the living room:
speaker_heading: THIRD FBI MAN
dialog: I'll look around here?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.
text: The Second FBI Man returns from the garage, starts to search...
text: We're scared with every cupboard he opens that he'll find them.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: Third FBI Man searches the room.
text: SUDDENLY we go to SLIM'S POV...she and Gracie are in a cabinet,
text: looking out through a narrow horizontal slit. Watching the
text: Third FBI Man makes his way methodically in their direction.
text: First FBI Man stands over Joe, keeping him silent.
text: Joe watches the Third FBI Man search the room...
text: And then Joe blinks. Moves his eyes, and looks right in Slim's
text: direction. He realizes where they must be hiding.
text: The Third FBI Man's getting closer and closer to them...
text: Joe realizes he has to do something. Abruptly Joe stands:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: That's enough.
speaker_heading: (VERY FORCEFUL)
dialog: You hear me? It's time to go. Now.
dialog: (off First FBI's. shocked look)
dialog: I know who you are, okay? I know who
dialog: hired you.
text: First FBI Man whirls. Suddenly he's got a knife in his hand.
text: Definitely NOT FBI. Putting the. knife to Joe's throat:
speaker_heading: "FIRST FBI MAN"
dialog: Yeah? You know what it feels like
dialog: to have a knife hit your carotid?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (trying not to move)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42
text: Inside the cabinet, Gracie gasps. Slim puts a hand over her
text: mouth. But Slim herself has to fight the impulse to burst out
dialog: of there to save Joe -
speaker_heading: "FIRST FBI MAN"
dialog: You know what it's like to bleed
dialog: out in less than two minutes?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No.
scene_heading: "THIRD FBI MAN"
dialog: (stopping his search)
dialog: Oh please, John Boy. Not the shiv
speaker_heading: AGAIN -
speaker_heading: "FIRST FBI MAN"
dialog: I'm just going to cut him a little -
text: Slim's eyes bulge -
scene_heading: "THIRD FBI MAN"
dialog: You are not going to cut him!
speaker_heading: "FIRST FBI MAN"
dialog: I sure as hell am!
text: Slim's on the verge of bursting out when "Second FBI" enters:
speaker_heading: "SECOND FBI MAN"
dialog: John Boy, this is not listed on the
dialog: program. Come on, they're not here;
dialog: let's ride.
speaker_heading: "FIRST FBI MAN"
dialog: Can't I just - (cut him a little}
speaker_heading: "SECOND FBI MAN"
dialog: No! No slice and dice!
text: They head for the door.
text: As he goes, "First FBI Man" (a.k.a. John Boy) runs his knife
text: along the couch, spilling out its contents...
text: .passes the tv set and stabs the tube...
text: .runs his knife along the wall, making a vicious scary mark.
text: And they vanish. We hear the door SLAM.
text: The horizontal band through which Slim was looking widens -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43
text: The cabinet door falls open, Slim and Gracie come out.
text: Gracie's crying. Slim hugs her, says to Joe:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Jesus, are you okay?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I guess.
dialog: (feels his neck)
dialog: I needed a shave, anyway.
text: The phone rings.
text: They look at it. It can't be who they think it is...
text: it rings again. Joe goes to it. Hesitates. Answers:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: This is Mitch Tyler, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hello, yes, how are you?
text: Joe points at phone: "It's him." He nods toward Gracie,
text: indicating Slim should take her into the next room. Slim does.
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: (calm, friendly)
dialog: I assume Slim's called you.
text: Joe thinks for a split second, then:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: Will you give her a message?
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: If she calls again, I mean.
text: Slim and Gracie are in the next room, but Slim's looking
text: through the door back at Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't know. I'm on her side
dialog: here, not yours.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: Her side? Come on, Joe, you're a
dialog: smart person. Let me say two words,
dialog: okay? "Lug nuts." You don't want to
dialog: worry they're loose every time you
dialog: get in your car. And how 'bout the
dialog: windows to your apartment: are they
dialog: still locked? A person could go
dialog: crazy thinking about stuff like that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Goodbye, Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH'S VOICE
dialog: Tell her to call her friends.
text: Joe hangs up. Slim comes back out.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Wow. Charming.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: He scare you?
text: Joe shakes his head - more at Mitch than in answer to her
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: SLIM {CONT.}
dialog: I shouldn't be here -
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sure you should -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I'm dangerous to know right now.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (calm, forceful)
dialog: Slim. You can be here anytime.
text: She nods. They both know what he's saying: if he's willing to
dialog: take this kind of risk, he's either a very good friend (which
text: he is) or he's still in love with her (which he is, also).
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: Oh. He said you should call your
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: At the restaurant?

scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER.
text: Slim on the phone, listening as the phone rings. And again,

speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Awright already! Orcal
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Hey. Gin. You okay?
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: We had to clear the customers out,

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. "ORCA" RESTAURANT. NIGHT.
text: Ginny on the cordless; Phil working nearby -
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Yeah, right during dinner. Like

speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: What about you and Phil, did you -
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: You know Phil. He won't leave his

speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: Get out.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: I got a bad feeling, Gin.
speaker_heading: GINNY

dialog: You got a bad husband.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: I know! That's what I'm saying! Get

dialog: Screw the police, we're outta here.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: Run, okay?t Ginny?! Runt
scene_heading: EXT. "ORCA." NIGHT.
text: They step out. The restaurant is at the end of a long pier.
text: Ginny turns skeptically to the overweight Phil -
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Can you run?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Like Michael Jackson!
text: As they sprint, sort of, toward the boardwalk:
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: It's Michael Johnson, Phil.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I know. But I run like Michael
dialog: Jackson.
text: And he kind of does: arms flailing, not quite connected to his
dialog: body. Just as when we're enjoying this comic sight -
text: EXPLOSION behind them -
dialog: They're thrown TOWARD CAMERA -
text: Debris flying everywhere -
text: They lie on the. ground. Not moving. Are they dead or just
text: stunned? Slowly they raise their heads. Blink.
dialog: Look back at the restaurant:

scene_heading: INT. JOE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.

text: She presses redial, and we hear THE PHONE start to ring...
text: She- goes to the window, parts the curtain: OUTSIDE in the

dialog: (off his blank look)
dialog: You want me dead?

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You are my Dad, Jupiter. When Mom

dialog: I didn't have enough money to bury
dialog: her, that was really fun.
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: Don't look at me, I didn't kill her.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No, you had help.
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: That's a stupid thing to say. What
dialog: do you want, money?.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I thought you should meet your
dialog: granddaughter.
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: (perfunctory, to Gracie)
dialog: Hi.
text: Gracie looks at him skeptically, nods.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: And yes, we need money. To survive.
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: Look sweetheart. From '68 to like '72,
dialog: I had maybe 5 kids. Different women.
dialog: It was like a joke to me.
speaker_heading: Â¢ SLIM
dialog: It's like a joke to me too.
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: You're the third to show up here with a

speaker_heading: SLIM

text: Slim nods again. Looks at Ginny...who's been working up to:
speaker_heading: GINNY

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: This is American law??l
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: I called my cousin, he's some shit-

text: n "Erin" blinks... looks around frantically... OTHER KIDS in gym or
dialog: dance gear, but no "Queen E."...and the knowledge of what's
text: happened is hitting her...her eyes're dilating, breathing
text: becoming frantic. Betty turns back as "Erin" mutters:
speaker_heading: "ERIN"
dialog: I should've! ... I should've known!,
dialog: he did it before!
text: She rams the car in gear, rockets out of the pick-up line -
text: Almost hits a TEACHER and 4 YEAR OLD KID -
text: Slams the breaks, calls:
speaker_heading: "ERIN"
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I... I...
text: Freaked out, frantic, she pulls to the side of the road, yanks
text: up her brake, grabs her cell phone. Auto-dial #2.
speaker_heading: T.T.'S VOICE
dialog: Double "A" Rent
speaker_heading: "ERIN"
dialog: Did Queen Elizabeth call?!
speaker_heading: T.T.'S VOICE
dialog: No, of course - (not)
speaker_heading: "ERIN"
dialog: Anyone else?!
speaker_heading: T.T.'S VOICE
dialog: Nobody called, Erin; are you - (okay?)
text: "Erin" presses STOP, then Auto-dial #1, waits, looks around.
text: Betty staring at her like she's crazy, walking toward her car -
speaker_heading: "ERIN'S" VOICE
dialog: Hi. Leave a message.
speaker_heading: "ERIN"
dialog: Gracie, are you there?! Is anyone
dialog: there?! Please? Pick up!
text: No one picks up. Silence.
text: She beats the wheel in frustration... lowers her head.
text: For one long second, she seems completely beaten...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74
text: A KNOCK on her window -
text: She looks up, sees Betty.
text: Betty's talking, but it's as if "Erin" has gone crazy. For a
text: moment there's no sound, and then the sound is there but
text: unintelligible, and finally the words and sounds come together:
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: .what I've been trying to tell
dialog: you...
text: "Erin" nodding now, beginning to grasp the words...
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT.)
text: At the end of dance class, the teacher
text: lets them go hide, and for a minute no
dialog: one could find her -
text: "Erin" looks past Betty, sees "Queen E." in her tutu and leaps
dialog: out of her car -
speaker_heading: "ERIN"
dialog: Thank you, thank you, I... I'm
dialog: sorry. I'll explain later, I...
text: She rushes forward, wraps "Queen E." in a big, not quite
text: appropriate hug. "Queen E." looks at her as if to say, "This
dialog: is nice, Mom, but will you please tell me what gives?"
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RENT-A-CAR. NIGHT.
text: From a distance, we watch "Erin" and "Queen E." trudge toward
text: their Taurus. The end of the day; they're tired.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. "ERIN'S" HOUSE. KITCHEN. MIGHT.
text: Making meat loaf. "Erin" consults the cookbook, seems
text: confused, puts meat, breadcrusts, eggs, sauces, onions, etc. in
text: a bowl. "Queen E." mooshes them with her fingers - a
text: disgusting tactile job which she adores. IMPROVISE DIALOG to
text: make the scene utterly mundane, two "girls" having fun... The
dialog: normalness of it makes us exceedingly nervous.
scene_heading: INT. "ERIN'S" HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: "Queen E." sleeping peacefully in her bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75
text: "Erin" also sleeping peacefully. We OBSERVE her from a slight
text: distance, to the left of the bed as we face it. Slowly the
text: CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE. . .down the bed...to the foot ...to the
text: other side.. .back again on "Erin" sleeping peacefully... and
text: the CAMERA RISES to show Mitch seated at her side.
text: He seems calm and utterly content. It would be, hard to imagine
text: a more terrifying attitude.
scene_heading: INT. HER BEDROOM. DAWN.
text: "Erin" wakes with a start, sits up, looks around -
dialog: Everything's normal. Peaceful. No Mitch.
text: "Erin" shakes her head, as if clearing away a dream.
text: As she looks again around the room, her nostrils flare
text: slightly. . .as if she smells him. She rubs her nose.
text: Touches her wrist, and we notice something she's worn the whole
text: time she's been Erin: a colorful elastic bracelet, probably a
dialog: Swatch.
text: She gets out of bed and looks out the window -
dialog: Cold morning -
text: She goes toward the hall...
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY.
text: Moving down the hall... each open door feels like a trap ready
dialog: to spring...
text: She glances into "Queen Elizabeth's" room... We half expect
text: some sort of reaction or exclamation - "Queen E." may be gone -
text: but instead "Erin" keeps right on going...
text: Vanishes into the bathroom.
text: HOLD the empty hall. HEAR the sound of her peeing...
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. DAY.
text: From the doorway, we see her on the potty... The window over
text: her head is open slightly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76
text: As she pees, she stares at the shower curtain-it rustles
text: slightly in the wind from the window.
text: She wipes herself.
text: Still staring at the curtain...
text: She stands, pulls up her pajamas...
text: Stares.
text: Yanks the shower curtain aside -
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY.
text: She goes into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY.
text: She puts on the kettle.
text: Drinks a little o.3 from a carton.
text: Walks back down the hall -
text: In every moment of this, the tension is excruciating...
scene_heading: INT. HALL. DAY.
text: Facing her as she comes down the hall, passing the living room
text: doorway.. .we wait for Mitch to leap out at her -
text: He doesn't.
dialog: She keeps coming, past "Queen E's -
text: HE JUMPS OUT OF THE DOORWAY -
text: " Erin" starts to scream, looks toward "Queen E." and stifles
dialog: the sound.
text: They wrestle. Silently. Grim pantomime. The only sounds are
text: GRUNTS, BANGING vs. the walls.
dialog: He's far too strong for her -
text: They slam against one wall, the other, CRASH to the floor -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Wanna know a secret?
text: Whispering to her, his hands moving to her neck...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: Cops need a body. Without your body,
dialog: they'll think you disappeared again.
text: Her hands at his hands, clawing, trying to pry them loose -
speaker_heading: MITCH {CONT.}
dialog: Which is kind of true.
text: One of her hands moves-away from his hands to that Swatch or
dialog: whatever it is on her wrist -
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT. )
dialog: 'Cause where you're going, they
dialog: will never... ever... find you.
text: She turns the gizmo so it points away from her face...
text: Toward his face...
text: At the last instant he realizes what she must be doing -
text: But it's too late. She presses a button -
text: Orange spray hits his face, eyes -
text: He screams and releases her -
text: She leaps up - and Sees "Queen E." standing in her doorway.
text: Staring, mute and horrified. How long was she watching?!
text: "Erin" grabs "Queen E." and runs down the hall. Mitch writhes
dialog: on the floor -
scene_heading: EXT. "ERIN'S" HOUSE. DAWN.
text: "Erin" bursts out the back door, whirls, pulls a rope -
text: - Causing a slab of 2-by-4 to slide over the door: primitive
dialog: locking device -
text: She sprints for her Taurus. Still in her pajamas, still
dialog: carrying "Queen E." -
text: Her car has a number pad on the driver's door. She punches
text: numbers, opens the door, puts "Queen E." in -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78
text: Pulls a key from under the mat -
text: Fires the car up, rockets away -
dialog: Down the block, so far back we're not even sure it means
text: anything, a CHEVY SUBURBAN pulls away from the curb...
scene_heading: EXT./INT. MALL/TAURUS DAWN.
text: Parked in back, near dumpsters. "Erin" jumps out of the
text: Taurus, runs around to the trunk, pulls out a small suitcase.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER.
text: "Erin" and "Queen E." pulling clothes from the suitcase,
text: getting dressed. A FRANTIC BLUR of pajamas and underwear and
dialog: suitcase and the last thing we expect to see:
text: KNOCK at the window. Robbie. "Erin" whirls, looks. For an
text: instant TIME SLOWS as she stares at him...
text: FLASHBACK TO THE DINER, HIS FACE: she recognizes him -
text: And realizes: he's with Mitch. Which means: Mitch was phony
dialog: from the moment she met him -
text: Robbie reaches for her door handle -
text: She rams the accelerator, leaving Robbie behind -
text: The car rockets forward, toward the dumpsters -
text: She spins the wheel; the car swerves, kisses off the dumpster -
text: Robbie running for his car, and now we see the Chevy Suburban,
text: hidden behind some nearby bushes -
text: The Taurus pogos over the concrete/grass divider, rockets
text: across the next parking lot...
text: Robbie jumping into his Suburban -
text: "Erin" half in, half out of her clothing, trying to drive,
text: trying to see, sticking out her arm to keep "Queen E." (not in
text: her seatbelt) from flying through the windshield.

scene_heading: EXT. CITY. MORNING.
text: Three brief FLASHES of -"Erin" being chased out of the city.
text: Freaked out to drive so fast, "Queen E." screaming, etc.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. MORNING.
text: Robbie's Suburban right behind them, closer, closer... finally
text: slams into their Taurus, knocking them half off the road. He
text: pushes them off again, again, "Queen E." covering her eyes,
text: "Erin" coming back onto the road, fighting to keep control, and
text: the road narrowing more and more, down to one tight lane. This
text: looks like totally the wrong place to be leading someone.
scene_heading: "QUEEN ELIZABETH"
speaker_heading: (WORRIED)
dialog: Mom?
text: Up ahead is a one-lane covered bridge crossing over a stream.
text: The bridge is very narrow.
scene_heading: "QUEEN ELIZABETH"
dialog: Mom, are you sure...?!
text: Quite sure, thank you. "Erin" guns the accelerator.
text: Robbie's FACE... driving, confident, full of blood lust, and
text: then his expression changes. Eyes widen. He realizes - shit!

text: "Queen E." looks back through the rear view mirror... looks at
dialog: her mother ...back and forth...
scene_heading: "QUEEN ELIZABETH"
dialog: That was dangerous.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. MORNING
text: Different country road. Parked ahead is a `78 Oldsmobile.
text: "Erin" pulls in behind it.
text: They get out of the Taurus. Using her keys, "Erin" unlocks the
text: trunk of the Olds. Two large suitcases inside. "Erin" throws
text: their small suitcase in on top.
text: "Erin" reaches up under the driver's seat and pulls out a
text: wallet. Checks the contents: cash, credit cards.
text: "Queen E." pulls a red wig out of the glove compartment.
scene_heading: INT. OLDSMOBILE. MORNING.
text: They're on a lightly travelled two-lane highway. "Erin" (now a
text: redhead) looks in her rear-view mirror: no cars.
speaker_heading: "ERIN"
dialog: Okay, Toots. We can talk.
text: "Queen E." stares at her mutely.
scene_heading: "ERIN" {CONT.}
dialog: Want me to tell you what happened?
text: "Queen E." blinks twice, shakes her head.
scene_heading: "ERIN" {CONT.}
dialog: Fair enough.
dialog: One thing, though: Erin's over.
scene_heading: "QUEEN ELIZABETH"
dialog: (Too bad.} I liked Erin.
text: Slim nods sadly: she liked Erin too.
speaker_heading: SLIM

dialog: Maybe something normal this time.

dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: SLIM

scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE. DAY.
text: Slim in line at a COUNTY RECORDER'S desk. The person in front

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I need the best lawyer in town.
speaker_heading: (QUICKLY)
dialog: I know you can't give names, it's
dialog: against the law or whatever, but I
dialog: really need help, and I can see
dialog: you're a decent person.
text: She slides a paper and pencil across the desk:
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: Please. Just a name.
scene_heading: INT. NICE LAWYER'S OFFICE. RECEPTION AREA. DAY.
text: Slim comes in, sits Gracie down and whispers:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Watch how it's done.
text: 117 Slim goes to the Receptionist's desk:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Hi. Is Mr. Toiler with someone?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: No, but he's -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I'm not a crazy person.
text: She walks past the Receptionist -
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Wait a minute! You can't
text: Slim opens the big door, enters:
scene_heading: INT. JIM TOLLER'S OFFICE. DAY.
text: The moment we see JIM TOILER we know Slim's okay. The actor
text: playing him is one of those cranky avuncular types who pisses
text: and moans but always comes to the rescue and outsmarts the bad
text: guys. As we expect, he starts out disliking her:

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: JIM TOLLER
dialog: I don't know where you learned
dialog: manners, young lady, but this is
dialog: not the way to get my attention.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I know, but I'm desperate.
dialog: (digging into purse)
dialog: My husband keeps trying to kill me,
dialog: and I need to talk to somebody who's
dialog: smart, okay?, smarter than me at
dialog: least.
dialog: (pulling out cash)
dialog: This is all the money I have - well,
dialog: all but twenty - it's almost 500, and
dialog: I'll give you all of it if you'll
dialog: just listen to what... (happened)...
dialog: just two minutes, okay? Please?
text: She's so charming and intense and discombobulated, he can't
dialog: help but give in.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: LATER.
text: He's staring at her. Good poker player; we can tell nothing
text: from his expression. His voice very quiet and calm:
speaker_heading: JIM TOLLER
dialog: Pardon my French, dear, but I hope
dialog: you got pleasure from it, 'cause you
dialog: have really fucked yourself. You had
dialog: two chances to file a complaint with
dialog: the police and put his violence on
dialog: record. You ignored them. Which tells
dialog: him to keep comin' till he kills you.
text: Slim reacts to this.
speaker_heading: JIM TOLLER (CONT.)
dialog: As for Gracie: his next move... he'll
dialog: initiate a custody hearing.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: He...he already did.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: JIM TOLLER
dialog: If you don't show up, the judge'll rule
dialog: against you, you become a fugitive from
dialog: the law. If you do show, Mitch will,
dialog: as you say, portray you as a drug
dialog: addict. For all I know you are one:
dialog: you break in here, uninvited. I'd say
dialog: your husband has a good chance for
dialog: sole custody. Now if you don't mind:
dialog: (pushes the money back at her)
dialog: I'd like to go back to my work.
speaker_heading: SLIM
text: (stares at him in disbelief)
dialog: .That's all?
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: You're not gonna help me?
speaker_heading: JIM TOLLER
dialog: No one can help you, lady.
text: She nods. Stares at him. And does not go. After a moment we
text: see him have a thought... hesitate... look up at her...
speaker_heading: JIM TOLLER
dialog: The custody hearing, if he pushes
dialog: for it, is just a trick.
text: She says nothing. Listens. Watches as:
text: He plucks a $20 bill from her stack of funds. Obviously he's
dialog: giving her a valuable piece of advice:
speaker_heading: JIM TOLLER (CONT.)
dialog: It's a way to get you to a
dialog: particular place at a particular
dialog: time... so he can kill you.
text: He pockets the $20.
text: She stares at him. Blinks. Of course. He's right...-
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OLDSMOBILE. NIGHT.
text: Late. Few cars. Slim drives. Gracie curled up in the front

speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I gotta make you a solemn
dialog: promise, Grace.
text: Gracie is, of course, fast asleep.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: Ever since you were born ... well-one
dialog: day I started to think of all the
dialog: awful things that were gonna happen.
dialog: People you'd love who'd die, or leave
dialog: you, betray you, break your heart...
dialog: .Physical injuries: broken bones or
dialog: sickness or guys who hurt you some
dialog: way... And I thought that if I could
dialog: protect you even once, from any of

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT. DAY.

speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: This is the most ridiculous thing
dialog: I've ever done.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: Oh yeah? How 'bout Horace?
text: Ginny glances at one of her kids, evidently Horace's child.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Okay, this is the second most -
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: What're you... (doing here?)
dialog: I thought we were... (driving to Reno)
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I had to make sure you weren't
dialog: followed.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: (re Slim's hair)
dialog: I like it.
dialog: (not so sure)
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: (SEES GRACIE)
dialog: Hey, Graceland.
text: Gracie slips out from behind Slim, goes and hugs Ginny as Slim
text: holds up a wallet:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: There's a credit card and cash. It's
dialog: on me, but make no calls home, or to
dialog: Phil. Think of it as a vacation till
text: the Orca reopens. Toots?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87
text: This to Gracie, who started to climb into the car. Gracie
text: looks at Slim and again tries to climb in - she wants }}g part
text: of saying goodbye - but Slim pulls her back into a hug.
text: Slim holds her for as long as Gracie can possibly tolerate.
text: When Slim is done, Gracie climbs into the car with Ginny's
text: kids. Slim has tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Take care of her, okay? Extra ice-
dialog: cream and... and if you need to reach
dialog: me...
dialog: (hands her a cell phone)
dialog: Just don't call your friends.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Oh great. I'll call strangers.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: In an emergency, I'm #1 on the auto-
dialog: dialer. Or I'll call you.
dialog: Any calls between us must run is
dialog: seconds or less. Cake?
speaker_heading: GINNY
speaker_heading: PIE -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Ass.
dialog: (re the vacation)
dialog: Enjoy it, huh?
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: The custody hearing's end of next

speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: Deadline for what?

speaker_heading: THE KNOWLEDGE
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: You ready?
text: She nods. CAMERA CONTINUES BACK, we see more of her face.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Sure?
text: Another nod. Perspiration streaming from her pores, running
text: down her face. And a look we haven't seen before.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Can you lose?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Can he hurt you?
text: She barely dignifies the question with another shake. We're
dialog: now far enough back to see we are:
scene_heading: INT. GYM. DAY.
text: Slim in a leotard.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Even though he's bigger?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: (v. quiet)
dialog: He's a lot bigger.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Even though he's stronger?
text: Finally see her INSTRUCTOR (6'4", 235 pounds, African-American,
dialog: 0.4% body fat).
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: He's a lot stronger.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: So if he hits you -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: No way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Say it.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It takes.twice as much energy to
dialog: swing and miss as to swing and hit.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: After he misses, what do you do?
text: She answers him with an intense look.
text: He nods and moves after her. Slow, strong, powerful: predator.
text: She backs up. Her movements simple, graceful, economical but
dialog: athletic: they remind us of the easy way she moved around the
text: restaurant in the first scene...
text: Scattered over the mat are old-fashioned plastic SANTAS that
text: kids use as punching bags. He backs her toward one...
text: .then another. As she nears them, she slides deftly to the
text: side: like she has eyes in the back of her head...
text: He maneuvers her toward a desk-her back to it...
text: Rushes at her -
text: For a moment she seems trapped -
text: But as he reaches her, she slips to her left, tosses him over
text: the desk and onto the mat.
text: She moves quickly to an attacking position, standing over him.
text: He pats the mat beside him.
text: She sits.
text: He makes a motion and she closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: One last thing. The hardest lesson:
dialog: we can't control the universe.
text: She listens.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR (CONT.)
dialog: The unexpected may happen.
text: He slides his hand over the mat, an order. She lies down.

speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR (CONT.)
dialog: Suddenly his maid enters, you're
text: distracted for an instant, and
dialog: he hits you...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: That's not possible -
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR 4
dialog: We must prepare even for the
dialog: impossible.
text: She stirs slightly, uncomfortable with this idea.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR (CONT.)
dialog: We bend the universe to our will,
dialog: but it will only go so far.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You're saying -
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
speaker_heading: (STANDING UP)
dialog: That's right -
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: For the sake of this exercise, he
dialog: hits me.
text: He's standing over her. She looks completely vulnerable.
scene_heading: VERY TIGHT ON HER AS:
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR
dialog: Yes.
dialog: And you lie there as if dead.
dialog: But hear me.
dialog: Hold onto my voice.
text: She nods almost imperceptibly.
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR (CONT.)
dialog: He's standing over you, he thinks

text: He draws his foot back as if to kick her...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JUPITER'S OFFICE. (San Francisco) DAY.
text: Slim strides through the office unapologetically interrupting
text: various conversations. Finally she spots Jupiter, walks over,
text: and without saying a word, demands his attention -
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Ah. Just a sec, I'll be right back.
dialog: (to her, irritated}
dialog: I thought I made it clear you
dialog: weren't supposed to come here.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I don't care what you want.
text: This almost makes him smile; he's getting to like her.
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: You're a different person.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: How's that black guy I .set you
dialog: up with?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: Did he teach you how to think?
dialog: It's not the question she expected; it's more interesting and
dialog: complicated.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: .I hope so.
dialog: (before he can speak)
dialog: The English guy is good too.
speaker_heading: (ALL BUSINESS)
dialog: But that's not why I'm here. I need
dialog: a woman who looks like me. Someone
text: who can handle herself: an off-duty
dialog: cop or something.

speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: Tonic ? That's awful short notice;
dialog: I don't know if I can -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: What? I thought Jupiter was like
dialog: all-powerful, king of the Gods?
dialog: Oh yeah. One more thing. At some
dialog: point.. .not right now 'cause it'd be
dialog: phony ...I need you to acknowledge
dialog: that I'm your kid.

text: his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELECTRONICS STORE. DAY.
text: Slim is signing the credit card slip as the CLERK puts the

dialog: Of course, Miss Slim. My pleasure.
text: Slim hangs up, goes into a. bagel shop.
scene_heading: INT.. BAGEL PLACE. LATER.
text: Slim sits at a table with a cup of coffee. A short guy, 28,
text: built like a fireplug, dressed in sweater and jeans and wool
text: cap, enters, walks to her, and says in an English accent:
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Today, hon, you graduate.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Alex and Slim are across the street from a strip joint.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: It's closed?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Till six, eh?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: And I'd guess whoever owns it
dialog: isn't a very nice person.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's a safe one.
text: Slim starts walking toward the shop. As they go:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Why here?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You've got soft hands, you've worked
dialog: hard. The tricky part now is nerves.
text: They reach the entryway; Slim takes out her tools.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: People on the street?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah. And you have to go in when
dialog: his alarm's turned off -
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (NODS)
text: Meaning he's inside.
dialog: (has tools out)
dialog: I'm ready.
text: Alex moves slightly to block the view as Slim bends over and
text: slips her tool into the lock...
text: Slim working quietly, concentrating...
dialog: Alex looking. around...
text: A SHADY CHARACTER noticing them. Hesitating. Coming over..
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We got company, doll...
dialog: Slim still working...
text: The Shady Character has almost reached them...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Forget it. You're too slow.
text: She opens the door -
text: Alex glances down, nods -
text: She closes the door again and stands just as:
speaker_heading: SHADY CHARACTER
dialog: Hey. What're you guys up to?
text: Slim stares at him.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: We were hoping to see some action,
text: but it looks like they're closed.
text: The Shady Character stares back. He is ve skeptical.
text: He watches Slim and Alex walk off down the block. Alex mutters
dialog: under his breath:
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: "Action?"
dialog: Off her grin -
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: MRS. TYLER'S VOICE
dialog: And where is Gracie?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: She's coming day after tomorrow,
dialog: then we're flying to L.A. I was
dialog: thinking after the hearing, maybe I
dialog: could bring her by.
scene_heading: MRS. TYLER'S VOICE
dialog: Tell me something. Why is this call
dialog: different? You were always worried
dialog: about how long we talked -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I was out in the country, Mrs. T.
dialog: I'm in a big city now, meeting with
dialog: my lawyer, so there're lots of cell
dialog: phones. No one can trace this.
scene_heading: EXT. BEAUTY PARLOR. DAY.
text: Slim exits in a long gray coat.
text: Stops outside for one moment, glances around -
text: Sees a guy in a GREEN TRENCHCOAT across the street.
text: She walks hurriedly away.
text: Glances over her shoulder, sees Trenchcoat following her.
text: She smiles slightly, to herself.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SLIM'S HOTEL. DAY.

text: Trenchcoat is standing across the street.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY.
text: Slim enters her suite.
text: Sitting by the window is TOVA. As Slim walks over, Tova pulls
text: on a wig which matches Slim's haircut. There is now a strong
dialog: resemblance.
speaker_heading: TOVA
dialog: I'm Tova Steinberg.
text: Slim stares. Tova's voice is an octave lower than Slim's.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Say something else.
speaker_heading: TOVA
dialog: I was a cop. I got shot, took
dialog: the benefits.
text: Slim thinks about Tova's voice. Takes out her cell phone.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: They have to think I'm still here,
dialog: so use my cell phone, tomorrow, to
dialog: call my dad. Autodial 2.
text: Slim presses the autodial number, then SEND, and motions for
text: Tova to put on Slim's gray coat. It fits Tova perfectly.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)

dialog: Hey, it's me.
speaker_heading: JUPITER'S VOICE
dialog: What happened to your voice?; you
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: SLIM

speaker_heading: JUPITER'S VOICE
dialog: Otherwise everything's okay?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: JUPITER'S VOICE
dialog: Get some rest, huh?
text: She presses END, says to Tova, back to normal voice:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Tomorrow stay in, order room service.
dialog: Call him twice. Keep it brief.
dialog: "Hello, I don't feel well..."
speaker_heading: TOVA
dialog: And tonight?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Go around the corner, eat at Guido's.
speaker_heading: TOVA
dialog: I'll be followed?
speaker_heading: SLIM
text: Green trenchcoat.
text: Tova nods and Slim takes off her own wig. Short dark hair.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: Wish me luck, huh?
speaker_heading: TOVA
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Luck has nothing to do with it.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SAN PEDRO STREET. NIGHT.
text: Slim parks, looks across at a warehouse converted into lofts.
speaker_heading: BATTLE OF THE
text: She takes a duffle from the back seat. Steps into the shadows,
text: stares at the warehouse:
text: Brick building, modern door and light fixtures.
speaker_heading: SEXES
dialog: She looks both ways:
text: The street's dark. Deserted.
text: She hoists her duffle, takes a deep breath.
text: And crosses the street.
text: Goes up the stairs to the stoop. Looks at the alarm panel on
text: the door: green.
text: Crouches, starts to work on the lock.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE/LOFT. SLEEPING AREA. NIGHT.
text: Mitch in bed, sleeping. Peaceful.
text: A SOUND, Off.
text: He stirs slightly.
scene_heading: ANOTHER SOUND.
text: He sits up. Frowning... dazed.
text: Cocks his head. Listens...
text: The SILENCE seems to have texture. He gets up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99
text: We glimpse: a beautiful brick warehouse converted inside into
text: an open, loft-like space filled with bird'seye maple, metal
text: beams, etc. Modern, glistening, expensive.
text: He walks around the place in the dark.
text: In his boxer shorts and t-shirt. He looks vulnerable...
text: SLIM'S POV... From one corner. Observing him. She has become
dialog: the stalker.
text: HER EYES, watching...
text: He decides everything's okay and goes back to the semi
dialog: partitioned sleeping area...
text: He gets back into bed - next to a YOUNG BLOND WOMAN, 22.
text: She turns over, mutters something, goes back to sleep.
text: He lies there, eyes open. Stays very still. Listening.
scene_heading: JARRING CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SAME WAREHOUSE. MORNING.
text: Bright light. Mitch in his bathrobe making coffee. The Young
text: Blond Woman comes out, fully dressed...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BLOND
dialog: I gotta get home, change for work.
text: He nods, gives her a perfunctory kiss:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'll call you.
text: She stares at him a second.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BLOND
dialog: You want my number?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Sure.
text: She sees how "eager" he is to talk to her again. Irritated,
text: she scribbles the number quickly, hands.it to him -
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Thanks for everything.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100
dialog: For the sex, in other words. She gives it right back to him:
speaker_heading: YOUNG BLOND
dialog: You too. I really appreciate it.
text: He's too self-centered to notice her ironic tone.
text: She lets herself out.
text: The instant she does, we go to a HIGH ANGLE looking down at
scene_heading: Mitch. Alternate NORMAL and HIGH ANGLE during:
text: Mitch pours coffee, goes back into his "dressing area" and
text: pulls on some clothes as he talks into his cell phone:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Janie? Hey.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Yeah, I was working late.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No, tonight's no good either. I've
dialog: got a morning flight to San
dialog: Francisco.
text: Slim in therafters, listening.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: If it was pleasure, you'd be going
dialog: too. No, I'm going down to get my
dialog: daughter.
dialog: Slim's reaction to this...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: Sure, the custody hearing's here next
text: week, but it looks like Gracie's
dialog: being brought to San Francisco and
dialog: my ex-wife ...well, seems like she
dialog: completely vanished.
text: ON SLIM. His words echo his threats when he was trying to
text: strangle her in her hallway.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
text: Right off the face of the earth.
dialog: I doubt they'll ever find her
dialog: this time.
text: Slim's jaw tightens.
text: When we come back to Mitch, he's dressed and packing his
dialog: briefcase.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: Yeah, I want her to meet you.
dialog: We'll call when we get in.
speaker_heading: (FAKE TENDER:)
dialog: You too.
text: He hangs up, takes a sip of coffee.
text: HIGH ANGLE SHOT looking down on Mitch as he heads out the door.
text: Slim waits in the rafters until the alarm system beeps: it's
dialog: armed.
text: She climbs down, walks into the kitchen.
text: Notices his Mr. Coffee machine is still on.
text: Hesitates, turns it off.
text: Opens the fridge to find something to eat -
text: The alarm beeps again.
text: Slim drops silently to the floor.
text: SOUND of the KEY IN THE LOCK -
text: Slim scuttles away as we hear:
text: FRONT DOOR OPENING. FOOTSTEPS coming toward her.
text: She slips around the edge of the counter just as:
text: Mitch enters the kitchen. He goes to the Mr. Coffee... Looks
dialog: at it... Frowns. Didn't he leave it on...?
text: Slim in the foreground, crouched down, Mitch 15 feet away. He
dialog: looks around. Is something wrong? Is someone here?
text: Slim frozen, trying not to breath.
text: Mitch listening. Wondering: should he search the place?
dialog: She looks for a place to hide -
text: He looks at his watch. He's late.
text: He walks right toward Slim, curls around the counter -
text: But she's not there any longer.
text: He heads for the front door -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 102
text: Goes out. HOLD ON the hall, where she was, where he walked.
text: EMPTY. The alarm beeps again as he resets it.
text: One silent beat, then Slim rises in the kitchen. (She did a
dialog: 360.)
text: She sighs. Pours herself some coffee, replaces the liquid with
text: water. Auto-dials her cell phone.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I'm in.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Can you stay off the phone?
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: For you, honey? (Anything.)
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I hope so.
text: She hangs up.
text: Retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out
text: tools, equipment, etc. Picks up a screwdriver and starts
text: searching the apartment, checking the phone line, following it
text: to the place where it enters the apartment.
text: MONTAGE INTERCUT WITH FLASHES of Slim' a face: a running tab
dialog: on her emotions. Intensity, focus, determination, fear,. ..and,
text: as the sequence builds: concern about what she doing...
speaker_heading: MONTAGE IMAGES :
text: She disconnects the phone line.
text: Finds the electrical box, opens it, finds the main switch.
text: Removes all the knives from the kitchen... hides them...
text: Walks the apartment-familiarizing herself with every inch of
dialog: it-occasionally she moves a piece of furniture slightly... we
text: realize: she's assessing fighting spaces. angles...
text: She looks from one piece of furniture to another, back and
text: forth, gauging the distance between them.
text: She eats a snack from his refrigerator...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 103
dialog: I
text: Looks out the back (bedroom) window... and sees the water of the
speaker_heading: J
text: San Pedro harbor below her.
text: Uses a metal detector to search the apartment:
text: in a drawer of the night table beside his bed, she finds a
text: pistol. Removes it. There are papers in the same drawer,
text: notes or something. She throws these in the trash.
text: She takes out three letters. As the CAMERA sweeps over one of
dialog: them, we hear her voice:
speaker_heading: SLIM (V.0.)
dialog: ". .thanks for letting me come talk
dialog: about Gracie. And I'm glad you're
dialog: willing to admit your temper, and -
dialog: let's not mince words - the physical
dialog: abuse you subjected me to."
text: And glances at SECOND LETTER:
speaker_heading: SLIM (V.0.)
dialog: "Perhaps with your new attitude,
dialog: we can really work something out.
dialog: Per your last letter, I'll see you
dialog: the evening of..."
text: She puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was.
text: They're not in envelopes; they're loose, open.
text: She picks up the metal detector, resumes her search.
text: The machine beeps insistently around his desk. She can't find
text: anything. Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the
text: drawers: a second gun is in there.
text: With the gun are papers: reports from private detectives
dialog: looking for her, an assessment of his custody rights...
text: She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper.
text: Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie. Rips it up.
text: Puts the metal detector back in the duffle.
text: Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants.
text: Takes the distinctive red bag (from the electronics store) out
text: of the duffle. There's a machine inside. She plugs it in,
text: tucks it behind the couch.
text: Puts her cell phone beside it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104
text: She makes one last check: every wall, surface, every drawer.
text: Barefoot, she begins to glide around the space. Backing up.
text: Moving with ease and grace, sliding deftly to the side as she
text: approaches a couch, desk, chair. She's building on her earlier
dialog: reconnaissance: learning where the furniture is and how to
dialog: navigate around it...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: LATER. MAGIC HOUR.
text: Light fading toward darkness. She's still moving backward,
text: only now her sliding is smooth, graceful; almost a dance.
text: As if hearing a distant signal, she slows to a stop.
text: For a long moment she stands perfectly still. Poised. Like an
text: animal in the forest.
text: There's a chair facing the front door. She glances at it. No.
text: She walks behind the couch, turns off the machine, picks up her
text: cell phone and auto-dials.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Hey.
dialog: Slim says nothing.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE (CONT.)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Say it again.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Say what?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You know. What you told me.
text: Beat. On Slim's face as:
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Oh. You have a divine animal right
dialog: to protect your own life and the
dialog: life of your offspring.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
text: She hangs up, turns the machine back on and stashes her cell
dialog: phone.
text: With simple ease, she lowers herself onto the chair. Facing
text: the door. Waiting in the fading light...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
text: Mitch walks down the street.
text: Up the steps, punches in his alarm code.
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S PLACE. NIGHT.
text: Mitch enters, closes and locks the door.
text: Turns on the light.
text: He walks back to the rear of the space, hangs up his coat.
text: Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket.
text: The lights go out.
text: Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness.
text: He looks out the window, sees:
text: The neighboring buildings still have light and power.
text: He cocks his head, listening.
dialog: Silence.
text: Walks to the door of the bedroom area. Waits.
dialog: Take two more steps -
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: It's me.
text: He nods slowly.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah. (I thought so.)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106
text: He moves quietly to the bed... to the night table where Slim
text: found the pistol. Covers this by talking:
speaker_heading: MITCH {CONT.}
dialog: This morning too?
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: You always did forget to turn off
dialog: the coffee.
text: He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters
text: Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to
text: be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor -
scene_heading: SLIM'S VOICE {CONT.}
dialog: I found it, Mitch.
text: His hand leaves the drawer.
dialog: He thinks.
text: Picks up the phone, listens. Dead.
text: Looks around... can't see her...
text: Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes
text: out his cell phone. We see the GLOW of its dial.
text: He punches 911 and pressed SEND.
text: The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on.
text: He stares at it.
text: Tries again. 911, SEND.
text: Again it goes dead.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
text: It's a machine. Knocks out cell
dialog: phones.
text: He throws the cell phone onto the bed.
text: Walks out of the bedroom area.
text: Looks around the vast space.
text: Spooky. Slanting light and dense shadow.
text: He doesn't see her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107
text: Walks toward his desk.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: I found that gun too.
text: He stops. Doesn't know where to go. or what to do.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: Scared?
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (FUCK YOU)
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: Now is when you decide, Mitch.
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: Whether you're a coward. If you
dialog: are, you can run. I won't stop you.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (meaning the match is unfair:)
dialog: You have my guns.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: Threw 'em away.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Then someone's here with you.
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: You're alone?
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: 'Cause it'd be stupid.
text: Silence is her answer.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: You're sayin' this is man to man?
speaker_heading: SLIM'S VOICE
dialog: Woman, Mitch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's what I meant: man against
dialog: woman - you sure that's fair?
text: The lights go back on.
text: Slowly Slim comes out from hiding...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Fair to whom?
text: As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area
text: between two couches.
text: She has no weapon.
text: She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms
text: just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny.
text: He moves toward her.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: This is what you wanted, right?
dialog: What you were going to San Francisco
dialog: for: the chance to get me alone?
text: He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses.
text: He begins to stalk her.
text: And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in
dialog: the way she was practicing.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't understand, Slim.
dialog: How does this work for you?
text: She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants
dialog: to know where he's going to attack.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: I mean: this is carefully thought
dialog: out, right?
text: She does not respond.
text: He throws three punches. None of them hits her.
text: He's unfazed, keeps stalking...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: But say you succeed - beat me up
dialog: or whatever. You're not going to
dialog: murder me... (CONT.)
text: Her expression remains neutral, focused.
text: He takes this to be agreement.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: So all you've done is further
dialog: piss me off.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Self defense is not ,murder.
text: This stops him cold.. He lowers his hands a moment. Stares at
dialog: her, trying to assimilate this new information...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You don't have the guts.
text: She just looks at him.
text: He blinks, worried for an instant. Covers it with a smile:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It's not self-defense when you
dialog: break in here and attack me.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: So far you're attacking me.
text: He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in -
text: She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps
text: over the couch to avoid being hit.
text: He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good,
text: and she's waiting for him as he stumbles -
text: With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose.
text: He goes down. Stays there. For the first time it occurs to
dialog: him: this might not be easy.
text: He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You see? I'm just defending myself.
text: He resumes stalking her. Only he's angry now, and it's scary.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: If you fail, you can count on this:
dialog: you'll never see Gracie again.
dialog: She reacts -
text: He sees it, rushes her -
text: Punching as he goes. From the standpoint of pure physics, he
dialog: makes a terrifying force. Until:
text: She steps back, grabs his arm, whips him vs. the brick wall -
text: He hits it, bounces off.
text: Cut on his forehead, blood streaming down his face.
text: He stares at her... breathing hard... trying to put it together:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You really (think) ...you think you'll
dialog: kill me and get away with it?l
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I told you. Self-defense. I came
dialog: here, as arranged in our letters, to
dialog: talk about Gracie -
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Letters? There are no -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: In the drawer where your pistol was.
dialog: You just left prints all over them.
text: He stares at her, stunned in every way. Touches his forehead,
dialog: feels the blood...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: You attacked me, I fought back. And
dialog: of course if you never touch me...
speaker_heading: (SWEET SMILE)
dialog: I'll have to give myself bruises...
text: He goes berserk. Leaps at her, covering ground quickly with
text: his long stride, swinging his massive arms. This is the most
text: terrifying form of combat: a huge person attacking a tiny one.
dialog: If he should hit her even once, a glancing blow, she will go
dialog: down, she will break, it will be over.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: III
text: But he misses, and misses again. Sometimes his punches are
text: wild, almost comical. Others come so close we hear-the wind,
dialog: feel their power, feel his sweat on her...
dialog: CONTINUE this terrifying choreographed dance with destruction
dialog: for as long as it will hold. At every instant, we fear for her
text: bones and her life. Sometimes she leans back like Muhammad Ali
text: to barely slip a punch, and we see terror on her face, married
dialog: to determination. She knows the score. and the odds.
text: Finally, in frustration at so many misses, he grabs an ashtray,
text: hurls.it at her -
text: it flies over her head -
text: He punches again and again, wildly.
text: She remains untouched.
text: He stops. With all the blood, he looks like a wild animal.
text: He makes a great effort to pull himself together...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: This doesn't bother me, Slim.
dialog: I don't care how long it takes.
dialog: We both know: Ionly have to hit
dialog: you once. Once, and it's over.
text: She laughs at him.
text: This is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can
text: stand. He rushes at her again, fast -
dialog: She starts left -
text: He blocks her way -
dialog: She starts right -
text: Again he's blocking her -
text: She lunges to the left, through a narrow space -
text: He punches, grazing her hair; punches again, just missing, and
dialog: a third time. We feel the awesome power behind these blows.
text: She's in the clear again. Smiles casually. Clearly part of
dialog: her strategy is to keep him angry:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I'm confused, Mitchy. Aren't you a
dialog: man?
speaker_heading: (QUOTING HIM)
dialog: I thought it was "no contest?"
dialog: I mean, can't you hit me even once?
text: He grabs a lamp, yanks out the cord, wields it like a club.
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
speaker_heading: (AMUSED)
dialog: A weapon?
text: He smashes the lamp down, just missing her head -
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: It's a martial-arts cliche, honey.
dialog: A weapon throws you off balance -
speaker_heading: SWISH -
speaker_heading: SWIPE -
speaker_heading: SLAM -
text: He misses her three times, the last time smashing the lamp into
text: the wall so hard that the impact hurts his hand. He yelps -
speaker_heading: SLIM (CONT.)
dialog: You see?
text: He turns toward her, pain on his face, holding his hand -
text: And she truly attacks for the first time. Smashes her fist
dialog: against his head -
text: He flies back, bounces vs. the wall.
text: As he comes off it, she punches him again -
text: He roars with rage, lunges at her, head first, great speed -
text: She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed -
text: Right into the opposite wall.
text: The top of his head hits the wall.
text: He shudders like someone in a cartoon: a spasm running head to
speaker_heading: TOE -
text: He drops.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113
dialog: Face down.
dialog: Does not move.
dialog: At all.
text: She stares at him.
text: Goes to him. Wary.
dialog: Gives him a reflex test -
text: No reaction. He's unconscious.
text: She tests his neck for a pulse.
text: Apparently he's still alive, because she raises her hand
text: over her head.
text: Her palm vertical, like a knife.
text: She's about to deliver a karate chop.
text: To his neck.
dialog: it will break his neck.
dialog: It will kill him.
text: Her hand stays there, poised. CAMERA PLUNGES IN ON HER FACE.
speaker_heading: FLASHES:
dialog: - Mitch hitting her the first time -
text: - Midwest house, Mitch leaping out from Gracie's doorway -
text: - Mitch beating her as she crawls across the floor of
dialog: their house. (Something we didn't see before.) She reaches
text: up, flicks the light switch; Mitch jumps on her back -
dialog: - Mitch: "You'll never see Gracie again."
dialog: - Earlier: "She's My daughter. Don't even think about
dialog: taking her."
dialog: - Strangling Slim, whispering: "...where you're going,
dialog: they will never... ever... find you."
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114
speaker_heading: BACK TO SLIM
text: Face contorted in rage, confusion -
text: She brings her hand down -
dialog: Misses. him.
text: Intentionally.
text: Turns away, tears in her eyes.
text: She retrieves her cell phone, turns off the cell-phone blocker,
text: presses redial.
text: Stares out the window. We see the turmoil on her face, hear it
dialog: in her voice:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I can't, Gin.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: 'Re you okay?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: You're okay?!, you beat him?!
speaker_heading: SLIM
speaker_heading: YEAH -
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: It worked?!
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Listen to me! I did it, but I can't
dialog: do it! I can't kill him!
text: Behind Slim, out of focus: movement, a soft blur...
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE (CONT.)
speaker_heading: (URGENTLY)
dialog: Slim. He'll come after you -
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I know -
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE (CONT.)
dialog: He'll come after Gracie -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 115
text: An indistinct shape, something rising over her head...
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: I know all that!
dialog: I have to, but I can't!
dialog: I'm not a killer!
dialog: I'm not him!
text: Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp.
text: She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side -
text: - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull.
text: Still sends her crashing to the floor.
text: Now she does not move.
text: He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but
text: triumphant.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Hello? Slim? You there?
text: The lamp moving in his hand. He's rotating it. A simple
text: menacing image... . and we realize: he' s aoinq to hit her again.
scene_heading: GINNY'S VOICE {CONT.}
dialog: Should I call the cops?!
dialog: Answer me?!
text: He's distracted by Ginny's voice. Picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Listen to me, bitch.
text: Ginny's silent.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT.)
dialog: if you value your children, don' t
dialog: call anybody.
dialog: It's over, okay? It's all over.
text: He throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward Slim,
text: lamp clenched tight in his fist.
text: SMASH IN CLOSE ON HER FACE.
text: CLOSER STILL. We're almost inside her head as we hear:
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR'S VOICE
dialog: Hold onto my voice...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116
text: Is that the hint of a smile on her face?
speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR'S VOICE (CONT.)
dialog: You're ready...
text: Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it -
dialog: Rage.
text: He pulls his foot back to kick her -
text: Her eyes are open, just a slit -
text: His foot swinging forward...
text: As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it -
text: He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her -
text: But she's already rolling, out from under him... and up -
text: Coming to her feet -
text: He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug...
text: SLOW MOTION. She's ready. Her face alert. Center of gravity
text: low. Arm low,.fist low... As her motion unfurls:
dialog: Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly
dialog: executed, is the most difficult,
text: powerful, and beautiful of punches.
dialog: Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of-
text: gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin -
text: as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the
text: central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely.
text: Mitch flies backward...
text: There's a table behind him.
text: His head cracks on the table.
text: His neck snaps.
text: He lands on the floor: twisted, broken.
text: Slim stares at him.
dialog: There's no way a living man could assume the position now
text: occupied by her former husband.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117
text: She stares in disbelief.
text: Though she knows the answer, she feels his carotid artery.
text: Her face registers what she feels. Horror, relief.
text: She walks slowly to her cell phone, picks it up.
dialog: Listens: no one there.
text: She presses redial, waits...
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: (in a panic)
dialog: H o?d
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Oh thank God you're alive.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Gin, he's ...he hit his...he's not
dialog: breathing.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: oh.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Well: I called the cops, they're on
dialog: their way.
text: Slim nods.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: Slim... can you hear me?, this is
dialog: important.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Okay.
text: As Ginny talks, Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the
text: duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building.
speaker_heading: GINNY'S VOICE
dialog: You're not him, okay? You're not
dialog: him, and you never will be.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 118
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: See you soon.
text: She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the water.
text: Then the duffle. They both sink.
scene_heading: EXT. BROWNSTONE.
text: She comes out, sits on the steps. A siren is audible.
text: Cop cars speed down the street, screech to a stop.
text: TWO COPS LEAP OUT OF THE CAR, run toward her.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: You okay?
text: She looks at him, considering the question.
text: Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: Where is he?
text: She makes a slight motion to indicate that Mitch is inside, and
text: the OTHER COP runs into the apartment.
text: Slim lowers her head.
text: First Cop looks at her, sees the blood on her scalp.
speaker_heading: FIRST COP
dialog: Looks like you're one of the lucky
dialog: ones.
text: She looks up, stares at him, and starts to cry.
scene_heading: SMASH INTO:
scene_heading: CREDIT SEQUENCE CREDITS OVER FLASHES:
scene_heading: INT. LAX. DAY.
text: Slim jumping up and down and generally making a fool of herself
text: as Gracie runs off the plane into her arms. Ginny follows with
text: her own kids; hugs all around -
speaker_heading: WHIP PAN TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 119
scene_heading: ANOTHER GATE AT THE AIRPORT. DAY.
text: Slim looking... waiting... seeing: Joe. He hurries to her -
text: and picks up Gracie instead, gives Gracie a big hug.
text: Joe lingers in the hug as Slim waits...and waits...
text: Finally he turns to Slim, hint of a smile:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What rules are we playing by now?
text: She answers him with the kind of kiss you can get away with at
text: a bar or airport and almost nowhere else.
speaker_heading: WHIP PAN TO:
scene_heading: ANOTHER GATE AT AIRPORT. DAY.
text: Jupiter comes off the plane, is hugged by Ginny, shakes hands
text: with Joe. As he turns to Gracie, Slim says:
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: This time be nice to her.
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: Is it gonna be like that?
speaker_heading: SLIM
dialog: Yeah.
text: Jupiter smiles, shakes hands with Gracie:
speaker_heading: JUPITER
dialog: I hope I can work into being
dialog: your grandfather, okay?
text: Gracie shrugs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW "ORCA" RESTAURANT. DAY.
scene_heading: SIGNS all over: OPEN AGAIN AFTER BOMBING1 SAME GREAT FOOD!
scene_heading: SAME BEAUTIFUL WAITRESSES! SAME TERRIBLE JOKES!

speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: So whattaya say, Slim-girl, you
dialog: comin' back to work?
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: (passing by, overhears and
speaker_heading: JUMPS IN:)
dialog: After all I do for her... ?
dialog: She better not!
text: Ginny gives him a look -
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: She has to go back to school, make
dialog: big success. Sigmund Freud, yes?!
speaker_heading: (PATS JUPITER)
dialog: Don't worry, Mr. Moneybags will pay.
text: Jupiter gives Phil a playful look: thanks a lot.
dialog: Phil whispers to Gracie:
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: But don't let her cook, huh Gracie?
dialog: You eat here all the time.
text: Gracie nods thanks, whispers back:
speaker_heading: GRACIE
dialog: Call me Queen Elizabeth.
text: RUN TITLES ON THE REST OF THEIR MEAL. The longer it runs, the
