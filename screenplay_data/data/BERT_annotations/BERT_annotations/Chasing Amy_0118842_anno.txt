scene_heading: INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - DAY
text: A pile of COMIC BOOKS are on a shelf next to myriad
text: others. The most prominent one is called BLUNTMAN AND
text: CHRONIC'. A hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame.
text: HOLDEN opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his
text: head. BANKY looks over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Felt Like this fucking day would never
dialog: come. Issue two - on the shelf.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yippee.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Don't start, alright! This is a cool
dialog: moment, and I'd appreciate you not
dialog: trying to ruin it. How often does
dialog: a guy get the opportunity to purchase
dialog: something with his name on it!
dialog: (points to name on cover)
dialog: Banky Edwards- right!
dialog: (points to the other)
text: Holden McNeil.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I know my name.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: C'mon, sour puss. We got the rest of
dialog: our lives to be artists. But it's
dialog: supply and demand. And right now,
dialog: the unwashed masses demand this.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (off comic)
dialog: This is easy, alright! And right now
dialog: it pays the bills. Just don't forget
dialog: that we're better than this.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I'll tell you who we're better than:
dialog: these two fags right here.
text: They approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store
text: manager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (lays books on the counter)
dialog: Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from
dialog: the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up.
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Well, well,well, Walt Did you see who
dialog: it is! The local celebrities. Quick -
dialog: get them to autograph one of their
dialog: books so we can sell it for triple
dialog: it's value.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I'm not that in need of fifteen cents
dialog: right now.
text: They snicker and high-five one another. Holden rolls his
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: You guys operate the smallest, ladies'
dialog: bridge circle I've ever seen.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: For your information, we're playing
dialog: Crimson Mystical Mages' - an
dialog: overpower card game. Not that either
dialog: of you would give a shit about
dialog: something as advanced	as this -
dialog: there are no dick or poopie jokes
dialog: involved.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: I don't think they're fans.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: No, we're not. You're both a couple
dialog: of fucking no talents that got lucky.
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: And obviously your handlers or hangers-
dialog: on convinced you that your first comic
dialog: was good which it was not it was
text: thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky
dialog: bits of dialogue. And when you get
dialog: your foot in the door of the business,
dialog: what do you do! You turn out a piece
dialog: of shit like Bluntman and Chronic'.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Tell him, Steve-Dave.
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: (off comic)
dialog: Bluntman and Chronic'. Pah.
dialog: What was that thing the little stoner
text: pulled on the villain in the last
dialog: issue!
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: The Stinky-palm.
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: Stinky-palm. You give comics a bad
dialog: name I tell all my customers not to
dialog: buy it, to spend their money on a real
dialog: comic book.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Fucking one hit wonder, dime-store
dialog: Frank Miller's.
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: This is the reality at Comic-Toast -
dialog: you're not going to get your ass
dialog: kissed here, because both me and Walt
dialog: think you suck.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: And me.
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: I said that.
text: Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then
text: goes back to playing his game with Walt. Holden and
text: Banky stare, shocked. Banky nudges Holden and they both
text: exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to
dialog: playing.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: I've got a dragon card - forty power-
dialog: ups and twelve life points! Ha! I
dialog: get your elf card!
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: You're such a bitch! But thankfully,
dialog: I've saved a dark forces Shaman card
dialog: for just such an occasion.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: You suck! Eighty six life-power
dialog: points to my twenty two!
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: I schooled their asses, now I'm
dialog: schooling your's.
text: Suddenly. A trash can crashes through the front window.
text: Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering
text: one another. They look up slowly. Steve-Dave leaps to
text: his feet and looks at the shattered mess. He pulls
text: something off the garbage can and reads it.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: You know it was those two fucks!
dialog: Let's call the cops and have them
dialog: busted! I know where their studio is!
dialog: Or better yet, let's sue! You can sue
dialog: them, Steve-Dave!
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: (still reading note)
dialog: That won't be necessary.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: What?! Why the hell not!
scene_heading: STEVE-DAVE
dialog: (holds up check)
dialog: Because this is a check for three
dialog: times what that window cost.
dialog: (reading note)
dialog: Dear critics - thanks for the
dialog: insight. But like my grandmother
dialog: always said - Fuck 'em if they can't
dialog: take a joke.. and break their window.'
dialog: Kiss it,		Banky the Hack.
dialog: P.S. - Your card game blows.
speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: He said Kiss it!
speaker_heading: CREDITS
scene_heading: INT. COMIC BOOK: CONVENTION SIGNING BOOTH - DAY
text: A physically large FAN - sweaty brow, tote bag bursting
text: with comics - leans forward, smiling.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Could you sign it To a really big
dialog: fan!
text: Holden sits at a table. Across from the barely-managing-
text: to-stand Fan. He offers him a patronizingly kind, half-
dialog: smile in return,
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You bet.
dialog: We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book-
text: signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding
scene_heading: HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS -
text: CREATORS OF BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large
text: mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner
dialog: super-heroes who bear a
text: striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly
dialog: neighborhood drug
text: dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: I love this book man! This shit's
dialog: awesome. I wish I was like these guys
dialog: - getting stoned, talking all raw
dialog: about		chicks and fighting
dialog: supervillains! I love these guys!
dialog: They're like Cheech and Chong' meet
dialog: Bill and fed'!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I like to chink of them as
text: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet
dialog: Vladimir and Estragon'.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Who!
text: BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR.
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: So you draw this!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (signing the comic)
dialog: I ink it and I'm also the colorist.
text: The guy next to me draws it. But we
dialog: both came up with the characters,
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: What's that mean - you ink it'!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Well. It means that Holden draws the
text: pictures in pencil, and then he gives
dialog: it to me to go over in ink
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: So you just trace!
text: Banky freezes up. He composes himself and continues
dialog: signing.
speaker_heading: BANKY
text: It's not tracing. I add depth and
text: shading to give the image mere
text: definition. Only then does the drawing
dialog: really take shape.
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: You go over what he draws with a pen -
dialog: that's tracing.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (hands book back to
dialog: Collector)
dialog: Not really.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Next!
text: A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers.
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: Hey man. If somebody draws something
dialog: and then you draw the same thing right
text: on top of it, not going out-side the
dialog: designated original art what do call
dialog: that!
speaker_heading: LITTLE KID
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don't know. Tracing?
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: (to Banky)
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: BANKY
text: It's not tracing.
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: Oh, but it is.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (to Little Kid)
dialog: Do you want Lour book signed or what?
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: Hey - don't get all testy with him
dialog: just because you have a problem with
dialog: your station in life.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I'm secure with what I do.
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: Then say it - you're a tracer.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (grabbing Little Kid's book)
dialog: How should I sign this?
speaker_heading: LITTLE KID
dialog: (grabs book back)
dialog: I don't want you to sign it, I want
text: the guy that draws Bluntman and
dialog: Chronic to sign it. You're just a
dialog: tracer.
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: Tell him, Little Shaver.
text: Holden accepts a comic from another Fan.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (off comic)
dialog: Who do I sign it to!
text: Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard. He
text: looks to his left and freaks.
text: Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table.
text: The Collector attempts to fight him off. SECURITY GUARDS
text: pull them apart. Holden grabs Banky.
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: Jesus! All I did was call him a
dialog: tracer!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (to Collector)
text: I'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR
text: DEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK?!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (to Security Guard)
dialog: Could you get him out of here!
text: The Security Guards drag the collector away.
speaker_heading: COLLECTOR
dialog: Hey, wait a sec! He jumped me! And
dialog: you're dragging me away!!
dialog: (exiting)
dialog: Fucking tracer!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (calling OC)
dialog: YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Can I explain the audience principle
dialog: to you! If you insult and accost
dialog: them, then we have no audience.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: He started it! Fucking cock-knocker!
dialog: He's lucky I didn't put my pen through
dialog: his thorax!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Need I remind you...
dialog: (holds up watch)
text: Curtain's in ten minutes.
scene_heading: INT. COMIC BOOK CONVENTION LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: HOOPER fills the frame. He comes off like a typical, pro-
dialog: black/anti-white homeboy.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: For years in this industry whenever an
dialog: African-American character - hero or
dialog: villain - was introduced usually by
dialog: white artists and writers - they got
dialog: slapped with racist names that singled
dialog: them out as negroes: Black Panther,
dialog: Black Lightning, Black Goliath, Black
dialog: Mantra, Black Talon, Black Spider,
text: Black Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat..
scene_heading: VOICE FROM CROWD
text: She's white.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: She is?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well bust this - regardless.
text: We're at a panel discussion. The room is full. Five
text: creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in
text: front of them.
text: (One of them is a very striking Girl.) The banner behind
text: them reads WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS'.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (holds up comic)
dialog: Now my book, White-Hating Coon',
dialog: doesn't have any of that bullshit. The
dialog: hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a
dialog: descendant of the black tribe that
dialog: established the first society on the
dialog: planet, while all you European mother
text: fuckers were still hiding in caves and
dialog: shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a
dialog: strong role model that a young black
dialog: reader can look up to, Cause I'm here
dialog: to tell you - the chickens are comin'
dialog: home to roost, ya'll: the black man's
dialog: no longer gonna play the minstrel in
dialog: the medium of comics and Sci-
dialog: Fi/Fantasy! We're keeping it real,
dialog: and we're gonna get respect -
dialog: by any means necessary!
text: During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up
dialog: front.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Bullshit! Lando Calrissian was a
dialog: black man, and he got to fly the
dialog: Millennium Falcon!
text: Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of
dialog: the comment
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Who said that?!?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (standing)
dialog: I did! Lando Calrissian is a positive
dialog: black role model in the realm of
dialog: Science Fiction/Fantasy.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Fuck Lando Calrissian! Uncle Tom
dialog: nigger! Always some white boy gotta
dialog: invoke the holy trilogy'! Bust this -
dialog: those movies are about how the white
dialog: man keeps the brother man down - even
dialog: in a galaxy far, far away. Check
dialog: this shit. You got cracker farm-boy
dialog: Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy -
text: blond hair, blue eyes.
dialog: And then you've got		Darth
dialog: Vader: the blackest brother in the
text: galaxy. Nubian God.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What's a Nubian?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Shut the fuck up! Now Vader, he's a
dialog: spiritual brother, with the force and
dialog: all that shit. Then this cracker
text: Skywalker gets his hands on a light-
text: saber, and the boy decides he's
dialog: gonna run the fucking universe - gets
dialog: a whole Klan of whites together, and
dialog: they're gonna bust up Vader's hood
dialog: the Death Star. Now what the fuck do
dialog: you call that!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Intergalactic Civil War!
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Gentrification. They're gonna drive
dialog: our the black element, to make the
dialog: galaxy quote, unquote safe' for white
dialog: folks.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: But Vader turns, out to be Luke's
dialog: father. And in Jedi, they become
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Don't make me bust a cap in your ass,
dialog: yo! Jedi's the most insulting
dialog: installment, because Vader's
text: beautiful,		black visage is
text: sullied when he pulls off his mask to
text: reveal a feeble, crusty white man!
dialog: They're trying to tell us that deep
dialog: inside, we all want to be white!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Well isn't that true!
text: Hooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his
text: belt, draws on Banky and fires. Banky goes down, falling
text: forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to
text: scatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists
text: in the air.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
text: BLACK RAGE! BLACK RAGE!! I'LL KILL
text: ANY WHITE FOLKS I LAY MY MOTHER
text: FUCKIN' EYES ON!!!
text: The crowd-is gone. Holden sits in his chair, laughing.
text: Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off
text: the floor.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (breaking character)
dialog: What's a Nubian!' Bitch, you almost
dialog: made me laugh!
dialog: Hooper sounds different Actually, he sounds gay.
text: Actually - he is. Banky smiles.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Well what about you! You didn't tell
dialog: me you were going to scream Black
dialog: Rage'. I nearly pissed myself.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: How do you manage to get away with
dialog: this all the time? Shouldn't cops be
dialog: busting your head open right about
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Wrong coast.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (off gun)
dialog: Well this right here - she full of
dialog: blanks, okay. And Opiate gets all
dialog: sorts of legal clearances before I go
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Your publisher condones these
dialog: theatrics!
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Condones? Honey, they insist. I need
dialog: to sell the image to sell the book
dialog: Would the audience still buy the
dialog: Black Rage' angle if they found out
dialog: the book was written by a.. a...
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Faggot.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: When you say if it sounds so sexy...
text: (he kisses Banky full on the
dialog: lips)
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (wipes his lips)
dialog: Hey, hey! I'll play your victim, but
dialog: not your catcher.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: How is it that you sound like Minister
dialog: Farakhan when you're on stage..
text: They turn to see...
text: A beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her
text: purse in a circle. Her name is ALYSSA. She's the
text: striking Girl from the panel who didn't get to say much.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: ...and the King of Pop when you're
dialog: nor.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Look out, boys - this kitten has a
dialog: whip.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: (shoves and slaps him)
dialog: Always before I get to speak! I swear
dialog: - the next con I attend and they ask
dialog: me to be on the minority panel, if I
dialog: see your name anywhere near the List,
dialog: I'm passing.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (defending himself)
dialog: Holden. Banky - this pile of P.M.S.
dialog: is Alyssa Jones. She does that book
dialog: Idiosyncratic Routine'. This is the
dialog: fourth panel we've been on together,
dialog: and even though she knows my publisher
text: sets this up and pays for the event.
text: She still gets mad when it ends with
dialog: my act.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I just wish I was the one who gets to
dialog: shoot you.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: That's what my father said when I came
dialog: - nay - leapt out of the closet
dialog: (off guys)
dialog: These boys do Bluntman and Chronic',
dialog: which outsells both of our books put
dialog: together, hence they're never on a
dialog: panel with the likes of us. They
text: slumming right now.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I've read your book. It's cute.
dialog: Chick stuff, but cute.
text: Holden hits him.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: (shoots him a look; to
dialog: Alyssa)
dialog: Sorry about him. He's dealing with
dialog: being an inker.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (to Banky)
dialog: Oh. You trace!
text: Banky seethes.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (shaking her hand)
dialog: I really enjoy your book I'm surprised
dialog: we've never met at any other Con's
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Lose the dick or change your skin tone
dialog: and we can get to know each other on
text: panel after panel while the Pink Black
dialog: Panther here plays Chuck D. for the
dialog: fanboys.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Hey, jealousy.
dialog: (to the Boys)
dialog: I told Alyssa I'd buy her a post-rave
dialog: drink. Do the Garden-Staters have to
dialog: sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel, or can
dialog: you stay for a round in the big, scary
dialog: city!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: We're gonna take off soon...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: We'll go.
text: Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance. Then he nods to
dialog: Hooper.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: We'll go.
scene_heading: INT BAR - NIGHT
text: Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table
text: drinking, talking, and smoking.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Archie, alright! Archie and the
dialog: Riverdale gang were a pure and fun-
dialog: lovin' bunch. You can't find
dialog: dysfunction in those comics, because
dialog: they were just flat out wholesome.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
text: Archie and Jughead were lovers.
dialog: (sips his drink)
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Shut the fuck up.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: It's true. Archie was the bitch and
dialog: Jughead was the butch - that's why
text: Jughead wears that crown-looking hat
dialog: all the time: he the king, of queen
dialog: Archie's world.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Man, I feel a hate-crime coming on
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: He's got a point. Archie never did
text: settle on Betty or Veronica.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Because he wanted them both at the
dialog: same time, you assholes! He never
dialog: chose one because he was trying to get
dialog: both of them into a three-way!
speaker_heading: HOOPER
text: (pulls out a dollar and hands
dialog: it to Banky)
dialog: Here. I want you to go down to the
dialog: corner store and buy yourself a clue.
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Eat it. Urkel.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: I told you to watch it with that Urkel
dialog: shit. Face it, girl - Archie's a
dialog: sister.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (getting up; to Hooper)
dialog: That's it. You.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Moi?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: You are marching back across the
dialog: street with me, and we're going to
dialog: pick up a shit load of Archie books, I
dialog: am going to prove to you - beyond the
dialog: shadow of a doubt that Archie was all
dialog: about pussy. Come on.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (sliding out of booth)
dialog: This boy is conflicted, I shall play
dialog: mother-therapist for him. You two sit
dialog: tight. We shall return promptly.
text: Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at
text: the table.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Is he always Like that!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: For years now. Started back in third
dialog: grade - a nun was teaching us about
text: the Blessed Trinity. She's going on
dialog: about the three persons in one God
dialog: thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and
dialog: he just goes ballistic. I guess it
text: was too big for him to grasp. They
dialog: got into this huge fight.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Please. How bad could it have been!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You ever seen a nun call a small child
dialog: a fucking cunt-rag'? Wasn't pretty,
dialog: Shit like that's bound to happen when
dialog: you make a kid wear a matching tie and
dialog: slacks everyday.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And your parochial school
dialog: misadventures!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass.
dialog: Turned me into a grade school
dialog: alcoholic altar boy. I couldn't tell
dialog: you how many mornings after serous
dialog: benders		I'd wake up next
dialog: to strange priests.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Aren't you the sharp wit!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Sharp! No. I'm just a fan of clergy-
dialog: molestation humor. Probably why the
dialog: extended family quit inviting me to
dialog: First Communion parties.
text: Alyssa laughs. Holden smiles.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (looking OC)
dialog: You play darts!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Not professionally. You know - only
dialog: in bars.
text: AT THE DART BOARD
text: A dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the
dialog: board.
text: Alyssa winds up with another dart. Holden watches. Her's
dialog: always hit. His never do.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: So your new book seems to be selling
dialog: like mad.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It goes back to something my
dialog: grandmother told me when I was a kid.
dialog: "Holden," she said "The big bucks are
dialog: in dick and fart jokes." She was a
dialog: church-goer.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a
dialog: real artist trapped in commercial hell
dialog: - pitying his good fortune. I'm sure
dialog: you can dry your eyes on all those fat
dialog: checks you rake in.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm sorry - did I detect a note of
dialog: bitter envy in there!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Nope. I'm happy my stuff gets read at
dialog: all. There's very little market for
dialog: hearts and flowers in this spandex-
text: clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns
dialog: field. If I sell two issues, I feel
dialog: like John Grisham.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (looking out window)
dialog: It's all about marketing. Over- or
dialog: underweight guys who don't get laid -
dialog: they're our bread and butter. People
dialog: like those two outside should be
dialog: yours.
text: Through the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the
text: hood of a car.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: And sadly, there are more of our core
dialog: audience out there than yours.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Look at that, though - kind of gives
dialog: you a little charge, to see two people
text: in love. And all over Banky's car, no
dialog: less. That car's seeing more action
dialog: right now than it's seen in years.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Bubbly guy like that, it's hard to
dialog: figure out why.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: (still looking at OC Couple)
dialog: You've gotta respect that kind of
dialog: display of affection. It's crazy,
text: rude, self-absorbed - but it's love.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: That's not love.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Says you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: That out there! That's fleeting.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: Fleeting.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Uh-huh. You wanna hear about love!
dialog: Oh, I'll tell you about love.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: A story?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: The story. The original love story.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: 'Doctor Zhivago'.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Nope. My mother's uncle. He was a
dialog: millionaire.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Get out.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I kid you not.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Explain.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: All through high school, he dated this
text: one girl. They were inseparable.
dialog: And when they graduated, she went off
dialog: to Carnegie Mellon...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: In Pittsburgh.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm impressed. So he stays in the
text: home town, and they begin their long-
dialog: distance relationship. The plan is,
dialog: on the third Sunday of every month,
dialog: he'll train out, spend a week then
dialog: train back They do this for four
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: That is love.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Not nearly finished. Two months
dialog: before she's going to graduate, he's
dialog: got this job digging graves, and he
dialog: comes across...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: A stiff.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: A steamer trunk containing silver
dialog: ingots.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Get out of here.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Many, many silver ingots. Now, my
dialog: mother's uncle being quite the
text: ingenious chap - he buries the trunk
text: again and heads up to the main office,
text: where he proceeds to purchase a
dialog: cemetery plot. Guess which one?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Clever.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: So now he owns the plot and all of its
dialog: contents. Two days later, my
dialog: mother's uncle is worth three million.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: At which time he marries the high
text: school sweetheart and lives happily
dialog: ever after.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: Not even close. Inside the steamer
text: trunk, stenciled into the wood, or
dialog: something like that, is a curse.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Someone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new
text: steamer trunk.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Not that kind of curse. A cryptic
dialog: curse "Great fortune means great loss"
dialog: it said.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What kind of asshole writes that
dialog: inside a steamer trunk!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: The same kind of asshole that buries
dialog: silver ingots. The day my mother's
text: uncle is heading out to see the girl,
text: he stops at his accountant's to grab
text: some cash, and winds up missing his
dialog: train. So he has to take the next one
text: - which he does - and he gets there an
dialog: hour later than his usual time of
text: arrival, whereupon he sees lights.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: A hero's welcome for the new
dialog: millionaire.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: It seems that while she was standing
text: on the platform waiting that extra
dialog: hour for my mother's uncle to show up,
text: the girl was dragged into the bushes
text: by an unknown assailant, raped and
text: gutted.
text: Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: The assailant was never apprehended.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's a love story!!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle
dialog: rode that train every day for the rest
text: of his life. One day up, the next day
dialog: back. Did that 'till the day he died.
dialog: He donated the fortune he'd acquired
dialog: to the train station in Pittsburgh, to
text: have a well-lit terminal built.
dialog: The train line let him ride for free
dialog: after that.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I should hope so. Jesus, that's the
dialog: saddest tale I've ever heard.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: That's my love story.
text: Alyssa tosses her last dart. Holden seems a bit dazed.
text: He looks out the window.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: Those two aren't on the hood of
dialog: Banky's car anymore.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I told you It wasn't love.
dialog: (grabs her purse)
dialog: I gotta split. It was really nice
dialog: meeting you. I wish you the best of
dialog: luck with your book.
dialog: (shakes his hand)
dialog: Tell Hooper I'll call him later. And
dialog: tell your friend to calm down.
text: Alyssa exits to the night. Holden stares after her. Two
text: beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an
dialog: 'Everything's Archie' comic between them.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: You're insane. Archie is not fucking
dialog: Mister Weatherbee!
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Deny, deny, deny.
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: Where's Alyssa?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Huh! Oh. She left. She said she'd
dialog: call you later.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (off comic)
text: He's just offering to help Archie with
dialog: his homework!
speaker_heading: HOOPER
text: Read between the lines.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (shoves book at him)
dialog: Fuck this.
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: Let's go. Traffic.
dialog: (no response from Holden)
dialog: Holden!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (looking out window)
text: D'jou see that dent in the hood of
dialog: your car!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (looking out window)
dialog: What the...! Son of a bitch!
text: Banky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Let me guess: you like her!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Miss Alyssa Jones.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: She's alright.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: As long as that's all.
dialog: (finishes drink)
dialog: Maybe you can convince that partner of
dialog: your's to drop me off downtown before
dialog: you scurry out the tunnel!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mister Weatherbee wasn't really trying
dialog: to fuck Archie, was he!
text: They begin exiting.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Hell no. Weatherbee was Reggie's
dialog: bitch.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - DAY
text: We're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment. It's a
text: rented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors
text: and sparse furnishings. There are posters on the walls,
text: a sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big TV. (with all
text: the trimmings - VCR, Laserdisc player, Sega, SNES), a
text: huge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent
text: desks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils,
text: paints, erasers, etc.) - at which sit Holden and Banky.
text: They're working. Some music plays.
text: C.U. OF HOLDEN PENCILING - over his shoulder, we see
text: Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch-
text: nemesis - the Giggler. Holden erases a line and re-
dialog: draws.
text: C.U. OF BANKY INKING - over his shoulder, we see Banky
text: outlining a pre-penciled page. He traces Bluntman
text: swinging from a street light.
text: The two work in silence. Then...
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: This is one of the best street lights
dialog: you've ever drawn.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It's the one across from the post
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Looks just like it.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you wanna do tonight!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Get a pizza. Watch 'Degrassi Junior
dialog: High'.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (erases)
dialog: You got a weird thing for Canadian
dialog: melodrama.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I've got a weird thing for girls who
dialog: say 'aboot'.
text: The phone starts ringing. Holden answers it, while still
dialog: drawing.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Bank-Hold-Up.
text: CROSSCUT between Holden and Hooper. He's on a phone in a
speaker_heading: CLUB.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Hooper here. Listen, I know how you
dialog: burb-fiends hate the city, but there's
dialog: a club shindig going down that I think
dialog: you'd get into.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Place called Her-sterectomy - I'm
dialog: tempting as bar-keep.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I don't know, Hoop. We're prepping
dialog: the next issue, and we've got our big
text: M-TV meeting in the morning.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: I told her you wouldn't be interested.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Told who?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Alyssa.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Alyssa from last night Alyssa?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: How do you begin and end a question
dialog: with the same word like that? You got
dialog: skill. Yes, that one. She asked me
dialog: to invite you. Now here's the part
dialog: where you say...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'll be there.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
text: Thought so. Ten o'clock. Later.
dialog: (both hang up)
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Hooper. He invited me to a club.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: When's that faggot going to learn -
dialog: you like chicks.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Not that kind of a club.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: So when we leaving?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: 'We'? You can't go. He's setting me
text: up with Alyssa.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: And I don't want you messing it up.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Like I care about your shit. Maybe
dialog: I'll hook up myself.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (pulling on coat)
dialog: I just told you - it's not that kind
dialog: of club.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: How does one man get to be so funny!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (throws him his coat)
dialog: How are you going to get home if I
dialog: hook up!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Like that'll happen.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Let me explain something to you, my
dialog: witless chum the other night in that
dialog: bar, we two - Alyssa and I shared a
dialog: moment, alright!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Oh, you had a moment!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (brings his two pointer
dialog: fingers together)
dialog: We shared a moment. And in that
dialog: moment, one thing was made abundantly
dialog: clear: this girl loves me, my friend.
dialog: Loves-me.
scene_heading: 6.	INT. HER-STERECTOMY - NIGHT						6.
text: It's a club - people are mingling, a band is playing,
text: it's loud. But something's fishy. Hooper's tending bar.
text: He hands a GUY a drink. The Guy sips it.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: This is so watered down. It's
dialog: terrible. Why is it you can never get
dialog: a decent drink in these places!
text: Hooper looks around in a very exaggerated fashion.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: What are you doing!
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Trying to find you a tissue.
text: The Guy shoots Hooper an angry glare, Banky enters.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Alright - bring on the free hootch.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: As long as you don't bitch about how
text: little alcohol is in the drink.
dialog: (hands Banky a drink; to Guy)
dialog: You owe me five sixty.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: (off Banky)
dialog: And I suppose you're going to make
dialog: your friend here pay for his drink
dialog: right!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Hey, I befriended a guy in a position
dialog: of authority so I could abuse that
dialog: authority and get free shit. You want
dialog: to do the same? There's a lonely
text: Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the
dialog: street. Get in tight with him.
text: The Guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the
dialog: bar.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I work at that '7-11'!
dialog: (storms away)
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: Wanna be friends!
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Where's your better half!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Taking a piss. Guy's got a bladder
text: like an infant.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: That's funny - he says you're hung
text: like an infant.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Must his mother tell him everything!
text: Holden enters.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What'd you do - fall in love?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Over there...
text: ON THE DANCE FLOOR - in the middle of a thrall of people -
text: dances Alyssa. She moves like a cat and she's looking
dialog: very sexy.
speaker_heading: OC HOOPER
dialog: Been dancin' for an hour. Hasn't
dialog: stopped yet.
text: Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare OC.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: She ain't no Denny Terrio, I'll say
dialog: that.
text: Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Wait. wait, wait - there's something
dialog: you should know.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: She's got a boyfriend.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Well.. no.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Then what's to know?
text: Holden exits; They watch him go. Banky looks around.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: There're a lot of chicks in this
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: 'Chicks'. You're such a man.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He didn't really say that about my
dialog: dick, did he!
text: ON THE DANCE FLOOR - Holden slips into the crowd and
text: dances up to Alyssa. He intentionally bumps into her.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (fake rage, dancing)
dialog: Hey, hey, hey - you fucked up my
dialog: cabbage-patch!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Well, well, well - Bluntman himself.
dialog: Or should I call you Chronic!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Call me flattered. I heard you sent
dialog: me the invite to this little soiree'.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: From a former home-town girl, to
dialog: Mister Home-Town himself.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You're saying you're from the 'burbs!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Middletown, N.J.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Get out of here! I'm from Highlands!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I know. Hooper told me.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: How is it that we never ran into one
dialog: another?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You graduate from Hudson?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yeah. Eighty eight.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I went to North. Also eighty eight.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What a small fucking world. So you
dialog: know the tri-town area!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Quiz me.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Miller Hill?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I wrote my name on the wall.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Sandy Hook?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Lost my virginity there.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: This is so cool. The mall!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Eden Prairie of Menlo Park!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Wait - here's the big test: Quick
dialog: Stop!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: My best friend fucked a dead guy in
text: the back room.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You know that girl!!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I did. Before she was committed.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You know what this is! This is fate.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (regarding her move)
dialog: No, this is the 'Rog'.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I was talking about us meeting - what
dialog: are the chances!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Pretty slim. I haven't been back to
dialog: the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: The Quick Stop girl died!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: Another friend - Julie Dwyer. She
dialog: died in the..
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Y.M.C.A pool! Damn! You knew her
dialog: too!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: So well.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: One friend in an asylum, the other
dialog: friend in the grave. You're a
dialog: dangerous person to know.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: But I can tap.
dialog: (does an impromptu tap dance)
dialog: That was the Buffalo Two-Step.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Very solid.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: That's what six years of tap lessons
dialog: yields.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: Two towns away from each other for
dialog: years and we had to meet in New York.
text: The Sand stops playing. People clap.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Coulda been worse - we could have not
dialog: met at all.
text: Holden looks at her.
speaker_heading: OC SINGER
dialog: Thank you. Thanks.
text: The SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone.
speaker_heading: SINGER
dialog: A long time ago, we used to have this
dialog: bass player who took off one day to
dialog: draw funny books or something. Maybe
dialog: you've seen her stuff - it's called
dialog: 'Idiosyncratic Routine''
text: The crowd applauds. Alyssa shakes her head, smiling.
text: Holden pokes her.
speaker_heading: SINGER
dialog: But what a lot of people don't know is
dialog: that she used to harbor these
dialog: delusions that she could sing. And
dialog: she used to subject us to these
text: throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson
dialog: tunes and shit, insisting that we let
dialog: her front on a few numbers. Well, we
dialog: didn't and she quit.. and then she got
dialog: famous, the bitch.
dialog: (crowd laughs)
dialog: But she's here tonight, and I think if
dialog: we all begged, or maybe offered her
dialog: some X, she'd get up here and treat us
text: to some of her vocal stylings.
dialog: (crowd applauds)
dialog: What do you say, Alyssa?
text: Alyssa shakes her head no. The crowd urges her. Holden
text: pushes her forward.
speaker_heading: SINGER
text: She's shy.
dialog: (yelling)
text: GET UP HERE AND SING, BITCH!!
text: The crowd thunders. Alyssa offers the Singer an
text: embarrassed half-smile. She looks at Holden, who claps
text: along with the others and nods toward the stage. Alyssa
text: shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd
text: Banky and Hooper stand at the bar.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: This is so queer.
dialog: (he exits)
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You don't know the half of it.
text: Alyssa jumps on stage, hugging the Singer. She takes the
text: mic, shaking her head. The crowd is applauding.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: She is such a twat.
text: The crowd cheers. Alyssa laughs. She turns to the band
text: and says something which they nod. She turns back to the
dialog: crowd.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Alright. I should dedicate this,
dialog: right?
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: This is for that special someone our
dialog: there.
text: Holden smiles. Banky joins him. Holden glances at him.
text: Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile.
text: The band starts playing. Cross cutting begins.
text: Alyssa launches into a torchy tune. The song is
text: extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making
dialog: direct eye contact with...
text: Holden. Or does she! Holden is smiling, being seduced,
text: Banky rolls his eyes. Beside Holden, stands a pretty
text: GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's
dialog: performance.
text: Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out
dialog: there.
text: The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at.
text: It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur
text: of whom! At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but
text: Alyssa's preoccupied. She points to someone in the
text: crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion,
text: urging whoever it is to join her. She jumps off the
dialog: stage.
text: Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-
text: shucks style. At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps
text: forward. Banky's eyes widen. Holden looks up and is
text: suddenly taken aback.
text: Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall
text: into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss.
text: Holden's eyes bug. Banky allows a smile to creep across
text: his face. The crowd applauds. Banky looks around, and
text: for the first time, we get the distinct impression that
dialog: this is a lesbian bar...
text: There are a lot of chicks in this place. Gay chicks.
text: Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Now that, my friend, is a..
text: (brings his fingers together,
dialog: mimicing Holden)
dialog: ...shared moment
text: Holden continues to stare - mouth agape.
text: Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss.
scene_heading: INT. HER-STERECTOMY - LATER
text: Banky, Holden, Alyssa and the Girl from the dance floor
text: sit around a table. Alyssa and the Girl continue to make
text: out. Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed. Banky
text: stares a little harder. Holden hits him.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: That's rude.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Man, when are we ever going to get a
dialog: chance to see this kind of shit live
dialog: without paying for it?
text: Alyssa and the Girl break their kiss.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Uh-oh - better knock it off: we're
text: getting a man excited.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Sorry. It's just... new to him.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Oh, and you're an old hand at this.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No, I should apologize. I don't
dialog: usually get all mushy in public. But
dialog: it's been awhile since I've seen Kim
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: (formerly the Girl)
dialog: Tell me you didn't set that gross
dialog: display up with the band just so you
dialog: could nail me.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Like I'd have to go through that much
dialog: effort
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You know what! I want to dance.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Go ahead. I'll watch from here.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: (tugging at her arm)
dialog: No. I want to dance with you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Don't be such a rag. I have to sit
dialog: here and work up the desire to fuck
dialog: you later.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Please.
text: Kim exits. Banky is smiling ear-to-ear. Alyssa looks at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: You said 'fuck'. To that girl. You
dialog: said you'd 'fuck' her.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: How can a girl 'fuck' another girl!
dialog: Were you talking about strap-ons or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (hits him)
dialog: Would you shut up!!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What!!? It's a valid question. You
dialog: know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse
dialog: Letters section is written by guys -
dialog: this is our chance to get the inside
dialog: scoop.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (to Alyssa)
dialog: I don't know how many times I can
text: apologize for him.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: It's okay. Secretly, all I really
dialog: want is to be the center of attention.
dialog: (to Banky)
dialog: I've never used a snap-on.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Then what's with saying 'fuck?
dialog: Shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at
dialog: least modify the term 'fuck' with
dialog: something like 'fist'?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Let me ask you a question - can men
dialog: 'fuck' each other!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Ask Hooper.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: In your estimation.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: So for you, to 'fuck' means to
dialog: penetrate. You're used to the more
dialog: traditional definition - you inside
dialog: some girl you've duped, jack-hammering
text: away, not noticing that bored look in
text: her eyes.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Hey - I always notice the bored look
text: in their eyes.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: 'Fucking' is nor limited to
dialog: penetration, Banky. For me it
dialog: describes any sex when it's not
dialog: totally about love. I don't love Kim,
dialog: but I'll fuck her. I'm sure you don't
dialog: love every girl you sleep with.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Some of them I downright loathe.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: But I'll bet it's different with the
dialog: ones you love. I'll bet you go the
dialog: full nine when it's not just a quick
dialog: fix - like you go down on them longer
dialog: or something.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I don't do that.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What?!?!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I stopped dropping. It got to be too
dialog: frustrating.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: As stupid as you usually come off
dialog: during this diatribe of your's, you're
dialog: going to come off ten times as stupid
dialog: on this occasion.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What?! I lost my tolerance for the
dialog: bullshit baggage that comes with
dialog: eating girls out. What's the big
dialog: deal?!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: If you say the smell, so help me, I'll
dialog: slug you.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Not the smell - the smell is good.
dialog: I'm talking about not being able to do
dialog: it property. And my mother brought me
dialog: up to believe that if I can't do
dialog: something
dialog: right I shouldn't do it at all. Of
dialog: course, my father told me she gave
dialog: lousy head, but that's beside the
dialog: point.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: At least you blame yourself for your
dialog: sexual inadequacies.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: No, I blame them. Chicks never help
dialog: you out. They never tell you what to
dialog: do. And most of them are self-
dialog: conscious about that smell factor, and
dialog: so most of the time they just lay
text: there, frozen like a deer in the
dialog: headlights, right? Not for nothing,
dialog: but when a chick goes down on me. I
dialog: let her know where to go, and what the
dialog: status is. You gotta handle it like
dialog: CNN and the Weather Channel - constant
dialog: updates.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You're such an idiot.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No, he's got a point. That's how I
dialog: was in high school - I was nervous,
text: and inhibited about being eaten out.
dialog: But by the time I got to college, that
dialog: all changed. I loosened up. Not only
dialog: did I learn to communicate - I learned
dialog: to be bossy.
dialog: I was like one of those guys at the
dialog: airport with those big flash lights -
text: waving them this way, directing them
dialog: that way, telling them when to stop.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: And that's all I'm saying, it'd be
dialog: different if chicks helped out -
text: pointed a guy in the right direction.
dialog: Then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted
dialog: time, and no chance for permanent
dialog: injuries.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Permanent injuries?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Sure. You wanna see something
dialog: permanent!
dialog: (pulls our front tooth)
dialog: I got this from Nina Rollins,
dialog: sophomore year. I'm going down on
text: her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps
dialog: on her stomach. She does this big ol'
text: pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in
dialog: half, sends it down my throat. I had
dialog: to get a crown for the stub.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: I got that beat.
dialog: (to Banky)
dialog: I got that beat.
dialog: (half-turns and lifts chin)
dialog: Sophomore year. I'm going down on
text: Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after
dialog: we went club-hopping. I'm totally
dialog: drunk, and in the middle of it, I fall
text: asleep - right there in her lap. She
text: got so mad, she digs her heel into my
dialog: back, right there.
dialog: (points to scar)
dialog: That's permanent.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: You see this!
dialog: (moves neck slightly right)
dialog: That's the farthest I can move my neck
dialog: to the right Sophomore year, I'm going
dialog: out with Maria Bennert, and for six
dialog: months, I'm going down on her, and not
dialog: a damn thing's happening.
dialog: Then one night, I change a position,
dialog: or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly
text: it's a whole new world. She's moving
text: around, convulsing, breathing heavy.
text: And her legs are pressing against my
text: ears so tightly that I don't hear her
text: father come into the room. He grabs
dialog: my hair...
text: (grabs his own hair and pulls
dialog: back)
text: ...and he pulls me way back, hard.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: (throws up her leg, and rolls
dialog: up pants)
dialog: Senior year. Spring Formal. I'm
dialog: eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's
text: car. She's laying across the back
text: seat, and I'm half-hanging out of the
text: car, my knees on the ground. She's
text: flailing around, and she knocks the
text: parking brake off. The car starts
text: rolling down the hill, and my right
text: knee is cut up all to shit like a
text: kiddy's scissor class cut it up for
dialog: paper dolls.
text: Banky and Alyssa laugh. Holden looks at a small scar on
text: his arm and thinks better about mentioning it. Then Kim
text: re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (off Banky's watch)
dialog: Holy shit, is that the time. We've
dialog: gotta beat traffic.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What traffic - it's one thirty in the
dialog: morning!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (getting up)
text: And rush hour starts in six hours.
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: (to Alyssa)
dialog: Thanks for inviting us out. It was...
dialog: educational.
text: Alyssa waves at him as he exits. Banky slides out of the
dialog: booth.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (to Kim)
dialog: Since you like chicks, right..
dialog: do you just look at yourself in the
dialog: mirror all the time?
text: Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out. Alyssa watches
text: them go, then turns and kisses Kim.
scene_heading: INT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: Holden looks preoccupied. Banky flips through magazines,
text: biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing. He
text: sticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks
text: up another one and then repeats the whole process. A
dialog: Receptionist types.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (off Holden's look)
dialog: You're still dwelling on the dyke,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Lower your voice.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What'd I tell you - she just needs the
dialog: right guy. All every woman really
dialog: wants - be it mother, senator, nun -
dialog: is some serious deep-dicking.
text: The Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky,
text: shocked.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: Don't give me that look - I heard Adam
dialog: Curry say worse.
text: The Secretary goes back to typing. Banky shrugs at
dialog: Holden.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: That's why I can't buy lesbians.
dialog: Everyone needs dick. See, I can buy
dialog: fags. Bunch of guys that need dick -
dialog: just plain need it? That I get.
dialog: Dykes? Bullshit posturing. But -
dialog: live and let live, I guess.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm sure the gay community appreciates
dialog: your support.
text: JOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: Please tell me you haven't blown this
dialog: deal already.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Sloss like a mother fucker.
dialog: (slaps his hand)
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: Hey, every mother but your's - a
dialog: shyster's gotta have his standards.
dialog: Shall we?
scene_heading: INT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The EXECS are a casual couple of guys, sitting on couches
text: across from our trio.
speaker_heading: EXEC 1
dialog: We just want to start off by saying
dialog: that it's a pleasure to finally meet
dialog: you. While it's been - shall we say -
dialog: an experience dealing with Sloss here,
dialog: one of the main reasons we started
dialog: this whole thing was to meet the guys
dialog: that do 'Bluntman and Chronic'.
speaker_heading: EXEC 2
dialog: (points at them)
dialog: 'Snootchie Bootchies'.
text: The Execs and Sloss laugh. Holden and Banky politely
text: join in. Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots'
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: EXEC 1
dialog: Which brings us to our proposal: we
dialog: are extremely interested in doing
text: twelve, half-hour 'Bluntman and
dialog: Chronic' cartoons. The age of Beavis
dialog: is coming to a close, and we're
dialog: looking for something... something...
speaker_heading: BANKY
text: Even more retarded and juvenile to
dialog: sate the voracious, intellectually-
dialog: challenged miscreants that make up
dialog: your key demographic.
text: The Execs laugh hard. Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and
text: gives the thumbs up.
speaker_heading: EXEC 1
dialog: (composes himself)
dialog: So what do you say! Are we in
dialog: business!
text: Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful
text: face. He looks to Holden, then to Sloss. Sloss nods in
dialog: understanding.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: Jim, Sean - could we have a few
dialog: minutes!
speaker_heading: EXEC 2
dialog: (looks to Exec 1)
dialog: Uh... absolutely. We'll just..
speaker_heading: EXEC 1
dialog: Uh...wait outside
text: The Exec's smile and head our, closing the door behind
text: then. Sloss turns to Banky.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: So? Did I do good?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: You did better - you sold us out!
text: They clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: Do you know how much you'll make on
dialog: merchandising alone!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (as Simon Bar Sinister)
dialog: Money and Power, and Money and
dialog: Power...
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: (joins in)
dialog: Money dnd Power, and Money and...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I don't think it's a good idea.
text: Banky and Sloss freeze. They stare at Holden.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What's not a good idea! Please don't
dialog: say the cartoon, please don't say the
dialog: cartoon...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: The cartoon.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: What?!? Are you out of your fucking
dialog: mind!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: John, let me handle this.
dialog: ( to Holden)
dialog: You are out of your fucking mind,
dialog: aren't you!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Is this how you want to be remembered!
dialog: As the guy who created Bluntman and
dialog: Chronic!
text: Banky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through
dialog: the guy's stuff.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: No, I'd like to be remembered as the
dialog: filthy rich guy who created Bluntman
dialog: and Chronic.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: But it'll be all glossy and main-
dialog: stream. We'll lose any artistic
dialog: credibility we ever had.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: (to Banky)
dialog: Is it me! I don't see the problem.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (to Sloss)
dialog: He just has to get over this crush of
dialog: his.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again!
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: Holden - she's not really a Princess.
speaker_heading: BANKY
text: (opening drawer with a letter
dialog: opener)
dialog: Not on her; on Alyssa Jones - the
dialog: chick that does that comic book
dialog: 'Idiosyncratic Routine'. You ever
dialog: seen it?
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: Please. Like I even read your comic,
dialog: let alone anyone else's,
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: I'm not limited to offering you legal
dialog: counsel only, my friend. I'm also
dialog: learned in the ways of the heart, and
dialog: can offer you this advice - nail her,
dialog: get it out of your system, and move
dialog: on. Like we say at Sloss Law - good
dialog: fences make good neighbors.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: She'd never let him in her yard. The
dialog: chick's gay.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: She's gay? You fell for a gay, comic-
dialog: book writing chick? Holden, you poor,
dialog: poor man!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wait a sec - does she have
dialog: representation!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Always working, you.
text: (holds up a Polaroid of a
dialog: naked woman)
dialog: Look at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a
dialog: string of pearls hanging our of her
dialog: ass,
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: Would you leave his stuff alone!
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: You can break her resolve, killer.
dialog: All it takes is one good man. But if
dialog: it takes two good men, don't hesitate
dialog: to call me. That being said, in
dialog: regards to the more pressing issue, I
dialog: suggest you leave art to the museums
text: and grab on with both hands to the
dialog: big, fat check.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'll give it some thought
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (holding up Polaroid)
dialog: I'm taking this as a precaution - just
dialog: in case they give us any shit about
dialog: pussy's decision delay.
dialog: (glaring at Holden)
dialog: You'll 'give it some thought'. You're
dialog: so retarded
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm retarded! This from the guy who
dialog: only forty five minutes ago paid fifty
dialog: bucks for what's supposed to be a boot-
dialog: leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers'
text: with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel
text: wearing a French Tickler.
speaker_heading: SLOSS
dialog: How'd you fall for that!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: The guy who sold it to me had an
text: honest face.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - DAY
text: There is a door. There's a knock at the door. Holden
text: opens it and Alyssa is standing there.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Somebody told me that they make comic
dialog: books here, and I've got an idea for
text: this story about a guy who comes to a
text: club and high-tails it when he finds
dialog: out this girl is pay. Any interest in
dialog: a story like that!
text: Holden smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERFRONT PARK - DAY
text: Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: M-TV?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Twelve episodes.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: That's great, isn't it?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: Banky seems to think so.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: But you don't.
text: They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I don't know if that's the perception
dialog: I want people to have of our stuff. I
dialog: know this sounds pretentious as hell,
dialog: but I like to think of us as artists.
dialog: And I'd like to get back to doing
dialog: something more personal - like our
dialog: first book.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Well when are you going to do that?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As soon as we have something personal
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Do you know how pretty you are?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You're a pretty man.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Uh... thanks.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Oh. I get it. I'm into girls, so I
dialog: have to find all men repulsive or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Aren't there some men that you find
dialog: attractive? Granted, not enough to
dialog: sleep with, but still - just handsome
dialog: or something!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Sure. Harrison Ford. And our mail-
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Well it's the same thing. I look at
dialog: you and just find you really handsome.
dialog: And you know, it has very little to do
dialog: with your look, per-se. Your look is
dialog: fine, don't get me wrong. But it's
dialog: more your outlook. The things you
dialog: say, the way you see things. It's...
dialog: I don't know... attractive,
text: Holden looks away, embarrassed,
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I weirded you our the other night
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Huh! No, not really.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's just that we've.., I mean, I've
dialog: never seen that kind of thing up close
dialog: and personal. It just took awhile to
text: process, longer than usual.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Do you want to talk about it!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Um. If you want to.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I like you. I haven't liked a man in
dialog: a long time. And I'm not a man-hater
dialog: or something. It's just been some
dialog: time since I've been exposed to a man
dialog: that didn't immediately live-into a
dialog: stereotype of some sort. And I want
dialog: you to feel comfortable with me,
dialog: because I want us to be friends. So
dialog: if there are things you'd like to
dialog: know, it's okay to ask me.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why girls?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why men?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Because that's the standard
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: If that's the only reason you're
dialog: attracted to women - because it's the
dialog: standard..
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It's more than that.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: So you've never been curious about
dialog: men?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Curious about men? Well... I always
dialog: wondered why my father watched 'Hee-
dialog: Haw'.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Why not!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: No interest.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Because...?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Girls feel right.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And that's how I feel. I've never
dialog: really been attracted to men. I'm
dialog: more comfortable with the idea of
dialog: girls.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Wait, wait, wait - you're still a
dialog: virgin?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: But you've only been with girls.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You're saying a person's a virgin
dialog: until they've had intercourse with a
dialog: member of the opposite sex?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Isn't that the standard definition?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Again with the standards. I think
dialog: virginity is lost when you make love
text: for the first time.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: With a member of the opposite sex.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Why? Why only then?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Because that's the standard.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: So if a virgin is raped, then she's
dialog: still a virgin?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: But rape is not the standard. So
dialog: she's had sex, but not the standard
dialog: idea of sex. Hence, according to
dialog: your definition, she'd still be a
dialog: virgin.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Okay, I'll revise. Virginity is lost
text: when the hymen is broken.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Then I lost my virginity at ten,
dialog: because I fell on a fence post when I
dialog: was ten, and it broke my hymen. Now I
dialog: have to tell people that I lost it to
dialog: a wooden post I'd known my whole young
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Second revision - virginity is lost
dialog: through penetration.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Physical penetration or emotional?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Emotional?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Well, I fell in love hard with Caitlin
dialog: Bree when we were in high school.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Physical penetration.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: We had sex.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yeah, but not real sex.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I move to have that remark stricken
dialog: from the record. On account of it
dialog: makes you come off as completely naive
dialog: and infantile.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Well where's the penetration in
dialog: lesbian sex.
text: Alyssa holds up her hand.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: A finger? Come on. I've had my
dialog: finger in my ass but I wouldn't say
dialog: I've had anal sex.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Did I hold up a finger?
dialog: (waves her hand)
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat; then he gets it)
dialog: You're kidding?!?!
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: How...?!?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: Our bodies are built to pass a child,
dialog: for Christ's sake.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: But doesn't it hurt?!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Sure. But in a good way. And it's
dialog: only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved
dialog: for really special occasions.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What about not-so-special occasions?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Tongue only.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: But how can that be enough? I mean,
dialog: let's be real - how big can a tongue
dialog: even get?
text: Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her
text: tongue, which is just huge. Holden is transfixed.
text: Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Let's go.
text: She exits. Holden remains in the swing. Alyssa comes
dialog: back in.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Just...uh... just give me a moment.
scene_heading: INT AIRPORT - DAY
text: Holden enters. Banky tries to balance way-too-much
dialog: luggage.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Look at you. It's a two day trip.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I got the Sega in one bag, my clothes
dialog: in the other, and two months worth of
text: unread comics in this one.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: We're going to a convention, for the
dialog: love of God. We'll be busy from ten
dialog: 'till eight each day.
dialog: When are you possibly going to have
dialog: time for any of that shit? In fact,
dialog: fuck it - you're leaving some of this
dialog: shit here in a locker. Come on - give
dialog: me the two that aren't clothes.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Hold on.
text: (starts rifling through one
dialog: bag)
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I just have to get something.
text: (pulls out a huge stack of
dialog: porno books)
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt?
dialog: What are you going to do with all of
dialog: those?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Read the articles. What do you think
dialog: I'm going to do with them? They're
dialog: stroke books.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You've got like thirty books there!
dialog: We're only there for two days!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (leafing through mags)
dialog: Variety's the spice of life. I like a
dialog: wide selection. Sometimes I'm in the
dialog: mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I
text: like them arty and air-brushed. Some
dialog: times it's a spread brown-eye kind of
dialog: night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl
text: time. Sometimes a steamy letter will
dialog: do it, sometimes - not often, but
dialog: sometimes - I like the idea of a chick
text: with a horse.
text: A beeping sound is heard. Holden checks his beeper.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Go check us in. I've gotta call
dialog: Alyssa.
speaker_heading: BANKY
text: His master's voice.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Put that stuff away.
text: Holden exits. Banky starts packing his mags up. A
text: little KID enters, staring at him.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What are those?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (looks at kid then books)
dialog: Do you Like horsies?
text: Holden finishes dialing the phone. Cross cut between him
text: and Alyssa at home.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I hope for the sake of the women
dialog: you've dated that you're only this
text: quick in returning calls.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What's up? I'm about to get on a
dialog: plane.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Ohhh. Why!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: My sister's at my parents'. I was
dialog: gonna go see her.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: The one that wrote the book?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Yeah. But I was staying all weekend,
dialog: and I wanted to hang our with you.
dialog: This sucks.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You didn't get invited to the Con'?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I don't do southern con's - all the
dialog: chicks have that annoying drawl. You
dialog: know how hard it is nor to laugh when
text: someone moans "Fuhhk me"?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Well this sucks.
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: You know - both of us don't have to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yeah. Banky can go by himself. It's
dialog: not like we're on a panel. It was
text: just a signing appearance.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: If you come pick me up, I'll be your
dialog: best friend.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where's your apartment?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm not there. I'm at a friend's - in
dialog: the Village. Corner of Houston and
dialog: Mercer. Number eighty six, apartment
dialog: 6-D.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'll be there in half an hour.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You're so easy.
text: They hang up. Holden reacts to something OC and exits
dialog: quickly.
text: C11. Banky points to pictures in the book. The kid looks
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: ...And then Black Beauty couldn't take
dialog: it any longer, and he finally did some
text: of his own mounting.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (off book)
dialog: Wow.
text: Holden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (waving to kid)
dialog: I think I want kids of my own one day.
dialog: They're fun.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Listen to me - I'm not going. You're
dialog: going to have to do this one by
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Alyssa's coming down for the weekend,
dialog: so I want to hang out with her. You
dialog: don't need me for this.
dialog: (taking his excess baggage)
dialog: Meantime, I'll take this stuff home.
dialog: You can keep the filth. I'll pick you
dialog: up at nine Sunday night, alright?
dialog: Don't forget to plug the Annual and
dialog: don't mention the t.v. show, okay?
dialog: Call me if you get bored.
text: And he's gone. Banky stands there, open-mouthed. A
text: check-in FLIGHT ATTENDANT comes up to him. His name-tag
dialog: reads 'Frank'.
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Checking in, sir!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (still watching Holden go)
dialog: Hunhh!
dialog: (looks at F.A.)
dialog: Yeah. But this is carry-on.
dialog: F.A.
dialog: Federal aviation security law requires
dialog: me to ask if you've been given any
dialog: strange gifts or parcels to carry-on
text: since arriving at the airport today.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Not this trip. But one time, when I
dialog: was using curb side check-in, this sky-
dialog: cap gave me a cock ring and a set of
dialog: anal ben-wa balls. I always thought
dialog: that was pretty strange. He said his
dialog: name was Frank.
text: (looks closely at him)
dialog: Hey! You're name's Frank!
text: Banky storms away. The Flight Attendant watches him go.
dialog: F.A.
dialog: Fucking kids.
scene_heading: EXT APARTMENT 6-D - DAY
text: Holden knocks at the door. It opens. A WOMAN is
text: standing in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up
text: and down and smirks.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Let me guess - 'the right man'?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You've got it in your head that
dialog: Alyssa's not really into chicks - that
dialog: she just hasn't met the right man.
dialog: And you believe you're it. You're
dialog: going to treat her right, fuck her
text: like a stud, and 'straight-jacket' her
dialog: back from the land of the lost. And
dialog: the sad truth is that you'll
dialog: accomplish none of that and wind up as
dialog: either an even more bitter misogynist
dialog: or a reverse fag-hag.
text: Holden's at a loss. Alyssa slips past the Woman,
text: carrying an overnight bag.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Don't mind her. That's just her way a
dialog: saying hello.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Actually, it's just my way of saying
dialog: "Give it up."
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (to Woman)
dialog: You're such an asshole.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: When you file the date-rape charges,
dialog: don't say I didn't warn you.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (holding out hand)
dialog: I'm Holden, by the way.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm the voice of reason that Miss
dialog: Bitch is having such a hard time
dialog: listening to.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Look, we're just friends.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: That's what every guy says before he
dialog: tries purring your hand on his dick.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: And how do you know men so well?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Because I lapdance for a living, dick-
dialog: head.
text: She slams the door. Holden looks to Alyssa.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Ohhh - you look so cute!
text: She heads down the stairs.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Just an occasional friend.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Why would you want to hang our with
dialog: someone bitter as that?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (stops)
dialog: Remember this!
dialog: (sticks out huge tongue)
text: Her's is even bigger than that.
text: She smiles and continues on. Holden looks back up at the
text: door. He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his
dialog: fingers.
scene_heading: EXT TURNPIKE - DAY
text: The car sits in traffic.
scene_heading: INT CAR - DAY
text: Holden sighs. Alyssa plays with the radio.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You were raised Catholic, right?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yeah. You?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Baptist.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Really? Did you have a strict
dialog: upbringing?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Please There was no time to be bad -
dialog: we were too busy saying 'Jesus'.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You think your upbringing had
dialog: something to do with your lifestyle
dialog: choice?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: Somewhere along the line. It's a
dialog: gradual transition to make - from
dialog: doing what the majority does to taking
dialog: a leap of faith and doing what feels
dialog: more natural. Everything helps - from
dialog: the way you were handled as a kid, to
dialog: the way the boys acted in third grade,
dialog: to the shoes you wore at your freshman
dialog: prom.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Shoes?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Well they were really tight.
scene_heading: HANGING OUT MONTAGE BEGINS
text: With the requisite music, over which we hear a
text: conversation between Holden and Alyssa.
text: 1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating. Holden's
text: talking. The Waitress walks past and drops her pad. She
text: bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in
text: the process. Alyssa stares at her ass. Holden stops
text: talking and stares at her. Alyssa looks over at him and
text: offers a caught smile.
text: 2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE,
text: throwing various things into the basket. Alyssa comes up
text: with a box of Tampons and throws them in. Holden glances
text: at them, a bit flushed. Alyssa catches him, picks up the
text: box, and pulls one out. She proceeds to demonstrate
text: their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming
text: insertion. Holden puts up his hands in the "I know, I
dialog: know," fashion.
text: 3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to
text: Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes
text: to light it. It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having
text: trouble. Holden grows a little frustrated. Finally, he
text: grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with
text: his teeth. Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.
text: Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke. He
text: then continues with his display.
text: 4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE. Steve-Dave
text: and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously. Alyssa pays for a
text: comic. Steve-Dave glowers at Holden. He gives Alyssa
text: her change and they exit. Steve-Dave goes back to his
text: card game with the Fan-Boy. Suddenly, a garbage can
text: comes crashing through their window. Steve-Dave rips a
text: check off the garbage can and punches the counter. The
text: Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly,
text: 5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking.
text: She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder.
text: Holden smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN V.O.
dialog: Let me ask you something - we get
dialog: along, right?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA V.O.
dialog: Famously.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN V.O.
dialog: We have a definite chemistry?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA V.O.
dialog: So it would seem.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN V.O.
dialog: But we're both into girls.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA V.O.
dialog: I'm into women.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN V.O.
dialog: But you weren't always gay.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA V.O.
dialog: When I was nine I had a crush on Scott
dialog: Baio.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN V.O.
dialog: So If we'd met a long time ago, say in
dialog: high school...
speaker_heading: ALYSSA V.O.
dialog: ...I'd still be muff-diving, yes.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN V.O.
dialog: Thought so.
scene_heading: INT STUDIO - DAY
text: Holden and Banky play EA Sports Hockey on Sega. There's
text: a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Come in.
text: Alyssa enters and stands besides them, smiling at their
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I read somewhere that guys who play
dialog: hockey are merely making up for penile
text: deficiencies by carrying big sticks.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I thought you lived in the city? This
dialog: is like the umpteenth time I've seen
dialog: you here. Isn't that grounds enough
dialog: for the little pink mafia to throw you
dialog: out of their club?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (hits Banky; to Alyssa)
dialog: I'll be ready in a second.
dialog: I just have to school this mouthy
dialog: second-stringer.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Bitch, you're schooling no one.
text: They play. Cut back and forth between the game and
text: Banky, Holden, and Alyssa.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (off game)
dialog: What? Do something!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (off game)
dialog: You fucking cock-teaser. I'll knock
dialog: your fucking teeth out and pass all
dialog: over your ass.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Look at how slow you are. Christ, you
text: move like a geriatric.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (screaming at screen)
dialog: Fuck! You Fucking cock-sucker, man!
dialog: These faggots won't do what I tell
dialog: them to!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Oh. It's the controller, right? It's
dialog: always the controller.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: No, it's these... fucking queers on
dialog: blades that can't accept a fucking
dialog: pass to save their lives! What period
dialog: is this?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Final sixty of the third.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Fuck! Look at your fucking guys,
dialog: they... FUCK!!!
dialog: (whips controller)
text: FUCKING COCK SUCKER, MAN! I SWEAR TO
dialog: GOD!
text: Banky storms away. Alyssa looks at Holden,
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Imagine if I'd only beaten him by one
text: instead of thirty.
scene_heading: INT SKEE-BALL ARCADE - DAY
text: Holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine.
text: Alyssa looks on.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Explain this again.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: How could you have grown up down the
dialog: shore and never played skee-ball?
dialog: What did you do with your youth?
text: They head toward the skee-ball runs.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Not your grade school years; your high
dialog: school years.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (off skee-ball run)
dialog: This looks complicated.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (Inserts coin and pulls
dialog: lever)
dialog: The premise is very basic - you roll
text: the ball up the ramp at varying
text: speeds, in an effort to pop it into
dialog: the score circles. The higher the
dialog: score, the more prize tickets you get.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What do you do with the prize tickets?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Trade them in for prizes that aren't
dialog: worth nearly as much as you paid to
dialog: play the game.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Then what's the point?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It's fun.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And you question my lifestyle.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Observe.
text: Holden rolls the ball. It pops into a twenty point
dialog: circle.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: See? It's just that simple.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Why not just walk up there and put it
dialog: in the fifty every time?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Where's the skill in that?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Oh, this is a skill? I'm sorry, I had
dialog: no idea.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Just toss one.
text: Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it
text: overhand. It pops off one of the circles and shoots back
text: at them, missing them as they duck. An OC knock and an
text: "OW!" is heard. Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (to OC guy)
dialog: I'm sorry, man. She's new at this.
text: Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head.
text: He gets up.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (to OC)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (hands Alyssa another ball)
dialog: Underhand. Throw it underhand.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: This is where you take straight chicks
dialog: on dates?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It's like Spanish Fly. This'll
dialog: probably be the first time I don't
dialog: score afterwards.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I don't know. I'm starting to get a
text: tingle in my bottom.
dialog: (tosses a ball)
dialog: Ten.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (grabs a ball)
dialog: So what'd you do last night?
dialog: (prepares to throw)
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Got laid
text: Holden whips the ball in surprise. It ricochets off the
text: ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine.
text: Alyssa laughs. Holden looks around, nervously.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Some more of that skill you were
dialog: telling me about?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Maybe we should just leave before
text: somebody gets hurt.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No way. I want a cheap prize.
dialog: (throws a ball)
dialog: So your friend's quite the homophobe.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: He just feels left out, I think.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm not talking about his infantile
dialog: hang-up with me. I'm talking about
dialog: when you two were playing that game.
dialog: Everytime he swore - when his players
dialog: messed up, he called them cocksuckers,
dialog: he referred to the players as queers,
dialog: he called you a cock-teaser...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I thought he was talking to you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I know you think it means nothing, and
text: it may in fact be unintentional, but
dialog: it's ugly all the same.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: He was just pissed he was losing.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: So he slams the gay community?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: C'mon. Don't get all p.c. on me.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm not. But what is that saying?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: It says he gets too easily frustrated.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: It's passive/agressive gay-bashing.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: How do you figure?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: How casually did it roll off his
dialog: tongue? And that's how he expresses
dialog: his anger? By calling people faggots?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I think you're reading too much into
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I think you're just so used to it that
dialog: it rolls off your back. I've heard
dialog: the two of you play your little rank
dialog: out game where one insists the other
dialog: is gay.
dialog: (as the boys)
dialog: "You're a faggot. No, you're a
dialog: faggot." It's cute and all to watch
dialog: you go at it like grade-schooler, but
dialog: it's also offensive - labeling and
dialog: ducking the label of being gay as if
dialog: it were the scarlet fucking letter.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You're blowing this way out of
dialog: proportion. We live in a more
dialog: tolerant age now. You refer to
dialog: yourself as a dyke. Hooper calls
dialog: himself a faggot all the time...
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Yeah, but that's what's known as
dialog: empowerment/disempowerment. I call
dialog: myself a dyke so it's not too
dialog: devastating when some throwback
text: screams it at me as I'm leaving a bar
text: at night.
dialog: Same for Hooper - by calling himself a
text: faggot, he steals the thunder away
dialog: from the mouthy jerks of this world
dialog: who'd like to beat him to it. But the
dialog: difference between us having it and
dialog: your friend saying it is miles wide.
dialog: We say it to mask the pain - you say
dialog: it for lack of a better expression at
dialog: any given moment. No Holden, we do
dialog: not live in a more tolerant age. And
dialog: if you think that's the case, then
dialog: you've been in the suburbs way too
text: long to be resuscitated.
text: Holden kind of sulks. Alyssa notices.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: But you know what?
dialog: (picks up his face)
dialog: I have more faith in you than that.
dialog: (rips her tickets off)
dialog: Come on - I want my cheap prize.
scene_heading: INT STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Holden enters. Banky's still playing Sega. Holden sits
text: next to him.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (off screen)
dialog: How bad do you suck!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: How was your pseudo-date?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Leave it alone.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: That chick bugs me.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: (rubs his head; in baby-talk)
dialog: Aww. Everyone bugs you.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Get off.
dialog: (off game)
dialog: Fucking faggot! Did you see that?!
dialog: Your dyke courting ass just got me
dialog: scored on!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, you should watch that. If
dialog: you're going to get all bent out of
dialog: shape while playing the game, so much
dialog: so that you need to curse the t.v.,
dialog: try not to gay-bash it, alright.
dialog: You're nor that kind of guy.
dialog: (gets up)
dialog: And don't call her a dyke, alright?
dialog: She's a lesbian.
text: Holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat.
text: Banky sits there, shocked. He puts the controller down
text: and crosses to the drawing table.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What the fuck is going on here?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (pulling out pencil)
dialog: I'm starting a new page.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (smacking pencil away)
dialog: Not with this shit! With you. What
dialog: the fuck is going on with you and that
dialog: girl?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: We're friends.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: She's programming you.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I beg your pardon? Programming?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Yeah. And apparently, you don't even
dialog: realize it. What does it matter if I
dialog: refer to her as a dyke, or if I call
text: the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the
dialog: privacy of my own office, far from the
dialog: sensitive ears of the rest of the
dialog: world?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing;
dialog: and I know you're not really
dialog: prejudiced at heart. You should just
dialog: find some other way to express your
dialog: anger, is all I'm saying.
text: Holden starts drawing. Banky stares at him. Then he
text: grabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to
text: the side. He starts drawing something.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What the fuck are you doing!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Bear with me here. I just want to put
dialog: you through this little exercise.
dialog: (drawing feverishly)
dialog: Okay, now see this? This is a four
dialog: way road, okay?
text: Banky draws a four-way stop. He illustrates according to
text: his voice-over.
speaker_heading: BANKY V.O.
text: And dead in the center, is a crisp,
dialog: new, hundred dollar bill. Now at the
text: end of each of the streets, are four
dialog: people, okay? You following? Up
dialog: here, we got a male-affectionate, easy-
dialog: to-get-along-with, no political agenda
dialog: lesbian. Okay? Now down here, we
dialog: have a man-hating, angry-as-fuck,
dialog: agenda-of-rage, bitter dyke. To this
dialog: side, we got Santa Claus, right? And
text: over to this side - the Easter Bunny.
text: Banky finishes drawing. Holden's shaking his head
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Which one's going to get to the
dialog: hundred dollar bill first?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What is this supposed to prove?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I'm serious. This is a serious
dialog: exercise. It's like an S.A.T.
dialog: question. Which one's going to get to
dialog: the hundred dollar bill first - the
text: male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating
dialog: dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter
dialog: Bunny?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat; then pissed)
text: The man-hating dyke.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Good. Why?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (wildly crossing out the
dialog: other three)
scene_heading: BECAUSE THESE OTHER THREE ARE FIGMENTS
text: OF YOUR FUCKING IMAGINATION!
text: Holden storms away. Banky follows.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I don't need this. I'm going home.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: She's fucking with your mind, man!
dialog: She knows you've got this schoolboy
dialog: crush and she's using it to sway your
dialog: way of thinking!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: And why would she need to do that?
dialog: What is she Mata fucking Hari?! What
dialog: does she gain?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Maybe she thinks you'll get her comic
text: picked up by Contender. Or maybe she
dialog: thinks you'll change the content of
dialog: our book to something more political
dialog: and message oriented. Or, gee - I
dialog: don't know - maybe because that's just
dialog: what dykes like to do: fuck around
dialog: with straight guys' heads, just so she
text: can go back to her little rug-muncher
dialog: club and have a good laugh with all
text: her man-hating harpy cronies about how
dialog: fucking stupid and easily duped men
dialog: are!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You're so out of line right now..,
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: You don't even know this girl! Big
dialog: deal, she's from Middletown and she
dialog: went to North! All the girls at North
dialog: were bitches and sluts anyway! And
dialog: this one's got them beat by a mile
dialog: because she's a bitch/slut/dyke!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Watch your fucking mouth, is all I'm
dialog: going to tell you..
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Oh why? Do you get my back when she
dialog: bashes me? Because I know she does.
dialog: And do you know why she does? Because
dialog: I won't play her fucking game!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious
dialog: bullshit is amusing. Sometimes it's
dialog: just fucking annoying as piss!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What is it about this girl? You know
dialog: you have no shot at getting her into
dialog: bed! Why do you bother wasting time
dialog: with her? Because you're Holden
dialog: fucking McNeil - most persistent
dialog: traveller on the road that's not the
dialog: path of least resistance!
dialog: Everything's gotta be a fucking
dialog: challenge for you, and this little
dialog: relationship with that bitch is a
dialog: prime example of your fucking
dialog: condition. Well I don't need a
dialog: fucking magic eight ball to look into
dialog: your future; you want a forecast?
dialog: Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa.
text: (shakes and looks at
dialog: imaginary ball)
dialog: What a shock - "Not fucking likely"!
dialog: This relationship of your's is
dialog: affecting you, our work and our
dialog: friendship, and the time's going to
dialog: come when I throw down the gauntlet
dialog: and say it's me or her! And then
dialog: what're you going to say?!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think you should let this one go.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: No, what would you say? Would you
dialog: trash twenty years of friendship
dialog: because you've got some idiotic notion
dialog: that this chick would even let you
text: sniff her panties, let alone fuck
dialog: her?!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Let it go...
speaker_heading: BANKY
text: What the fuck.. WHAT THE FUCK MAKES
text: THIS BITCH ALL THAT IMPORTANT?!?!
text: Holden looks at Banky for a long beat.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm in love with her, man.
text: Banky stares at him. Holden stares back. Banky looks
text: into Holden's eyes. Suddenly, he softens a bit. He
text: drops his head.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Fuck.
text: Banky walks away. Holden watches him go and exits.
scene_heading: INT DINER - NIGHT
text: Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth. Alyssa picks through
text: her food. Holden looks at the check and pulls money from
text: his wallet.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I wish you were the one being pursued
text: by M-TV.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Oh really?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Sure. Then you could sell our and
dialog: maybe pick up the check once in
dialog: awhile.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: (drops her fork and wipes her
dialog: hands)
dialog: We're leaving!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Well it's not like this is a bed and
dialog: breakfast,
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I've got a little business to conduct.
text: She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth. Holden
text: watches her, then follows.
text: A23. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does
text: Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug. Alyssa offers the
text: 'just wait' finger. The CASHIER turns to her.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Are you an authorized deal-maker in
dialog: this establishment? Do you have the
dialog: power to negotiate.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: You wanna haggle over the price of
dialog: your French Dip?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I want to haggle over the price of
dialog: fine art.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (pointing OC)
dialog: There. By the kitchen. That
dialog: painting.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: The price tag says seventy five.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: So!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (to Alyssa)
dialog: Tell me you're kidding!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'll give you fifty.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (to OC)
dialog: Manuel! Bring, me the Dyksiezski off
text: the wall.
dialog: (to Alyssa)
dialog: All my years in the diner business,
dialog: I've waited for this day - the day
dialog: when someone wanted to buy one of the
dialog: pictures.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (holds out hand)
dialog: Alyssa Jones. Pleased to meet you.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: You say you want to haggle, but you
dialog: don't know rule one about haggling,
dialog: which you just broke: you never give
dialog: your name. The name is power, and to
dialog: give the opponent that piece of you is
dialog: to give away victory.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm only trying to conduct a
dialog: transaction. We're not opponents.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (accepting painting from
speaker_heading: BUSBOY)
dialog: Oh, but we are - if you think I'm
dialog: letting this beautiful piece go for
dialog: fifty.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Ah-ha!
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: Now we're haggling.
scene_heading: 24. INT CAR - NIGHT									24.
text: It's drizzling outside. Holden drives. Alyssa hugs her
text: painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield,
text: making footprints.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I've always wondered what kind of
dialog: people buy those things. I can't
dialog: believe you talked him down to twenty
dialog: five!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: It was looking shakey when he told me
text: the artist was a blind cripple with a
text: hump-back, but I held my ground.
dialog: There's no room for sympathy in the
dialog: buyer's market.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Where are you going to hang it?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm not. You are.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You want me to hang it for you? You
dialog: better hope it doesn't get out to the
dialog: girl-nation that you needed a man to
dialog: help you hang a picture.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You're going to hang it in your house.
dialog: I bought it for you.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: I'm serious.
text: Holden stares at her.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: Because it's captured the moment.
dialog: It'll be a constant reminder - not
dialog: just of tonight, but of our
dialog: introduction, the building of our

scene_heading: EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT
text: The car pulls to the side of the road. The rain is a bit

scene_heading: INT CAR - NIGHT
text: Holden throws the car into park
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Why are we stopping?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Because I can't take it.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Can't take what?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You love me.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I love you. And not in a friendly
dialog: way, although I think we're great
dialog: friends. And not in a misplaced
dialog: affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm
dialog: sure that's what you'll call it. And
dialog: it's not because you're unattainable.
dialog: I love you. Very simple, very truly.
dialog: You're the epitome of every attribute
dialog: and quality I've ever looked for in
dialog: another person. I know you think of
dialog: me as just a friend and crossing that
dialog: line is the furthest thing from an
dialog: option you'd ever consider. But I
dialog: can't do this any longer. I can't
dialog: stand next to you without wanting to
dialog: hold you. I can't look into your eyes
dialog: without feeling that longing you only
text: read about in trashy romance novels.
dialog: I can't talk to you without wanting to
dialog: express my love for everything you
dialog: are. I know this will probably queer
dialog: our friendship - no pun intended - but
dialog: I had to say it, because I've never
dialog: felt this before, and I like who I am
dialog: because of it. And if bringing it to
dialog: light means we can't hang out anymore,
dialog: then that hurts me. But I couldn't
dialog: allow another 	day to go by without
dialog: getting it out there, regardless of
dialog: the outcome, which by the look on your
dialog: face is to be the inevitable shoot-
dialog: down. And I'll accept that But I know
dialog: some part of you is hesitating for a
dialog: moment, and if there is a moment of
dialog: hesitation, that means you feel
dialog: something too. All I ask is that you
dialog: not suppress that - at least for ten
dialog: minutes - and try to dwell in it
dialog: before you dismiss it.
dialog: There isn't another soul on this
dialog: fucking planet who's ever made me the
dialog: person I am when I'm with you, and I
dialog: would risk this friendship for the
dialog: chance to take it to the next plateau.
dialog: Because it's there between you and me.
dialog: You can't deny that. And even if we
dialog: never speak again after tonight,
dialog: please know that I'm forever changed
dialog: because of you and what you've meant
dialog: to me, which - while I do appreciate
dialog: it - I'd never need a painting of
dialog: birds bought at a diner to remind me
dialog: of.
text: Holden stares at Alyssa. She stares back. Then she gets
text: out of the car.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Was it something I said?
scene_heading: EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT
text: Holden gets out of the car. It's raining pretty hard
text: now. Alyssa's hitching up the road. Holden reaches her.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Get back in the car and get out of
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You're going to hitch to New York?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Y'ep.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Aren't you at least going to comment?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Here's my comment fuck you.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: That was so unfair. You know how
dialog: unfair that was.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It's unfair that I'm in love with you?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No, it's unfortunate that you're in
dialog: love with me. It's unfair that you
dialog: felt the fucking need to unburden your
dialog: soul about it. Do you remember for a
dialog: fucking second who I am?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: So? People change.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Oh, it's that simple? You fall in
dialog: love with me and want a romantic
dialog: relationship, nothing changes for you
dialog: with the exception of feeling hunky-
dialog: dorey all the time. But what about-
dialog: me? It's not that simple, is it? I
dialog: can't just get into a relationship
dialog: with you without throwing my whole
dialog: fucking world into upheaval!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: But that's every relationship!
dialog: There's always going to be a period of
dialog: adjustment.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Period of adjustment?!?
dialog: (hitting him)
text: THERE'S NO 'PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT'
text: HOLDEN! I'M FUCKING GAY! THAT'S WHO
dialog: I AM! AND YOU ASSUME I CAN TURN THAT
text: AROUND JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A
dialog: CRUSH?!?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: If this is a crush... then I don't
dialog: know if I could take the real thing if
dialog: it ever happens.
text: She looks at him, rain drenching the pair. She shakes
text: her head ruefully.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Go home, Holden.
text: She walks away. Holden stands there, at a loss. Then he
text: turns and heads back to his car.
text: As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her,
text: Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with
text: him, big time. He drops his keys and embraces her.
text: And there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched
dialog: kissing.
scene_heading: EXT STUDIO - DAY
text: Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys
text: with the other. He jams them into the lock, opening the
text: door. He picks up the mail on the floor.
scene_heading: INT STUDIO - DAY
text: He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the
text: kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering
text: forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each
text: other's arms. The place looks a mess - Like a couple of
dialog: people were engaged in some tremendous fucking. Banky is
text: oblivious. He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls
text: out a chocolate milk. He opens it, sticks a straw into
text: the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail.
text: He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the
text: couch, near Holden's head. He looks down at the sleeping
text: couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats.
text: Then he freezes. He looks down again, and drops his jaw
text: and his carton of choco. It hits the floor with a pop.
text: Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to
text: focus. They look at one another, then at the
text: flabbergasted Banky. Banky blinks. Then he shuffles
text: toward the door again and lets himself out.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (off Holden's reaction)
dialog: I take it that's not good.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Stay here.
text: (he kisses her and exits)
scene_heading: EXT STREET - DAY
text: Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden
text: saunters up and sits beside him. He follows Banky's
dialog: gaze.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Catholic school girls.
text: Across the street, the Catholic High School is letting
text: out. Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters
text: smoke, frolic, wait for their bus.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: The uniform is what does it for me. I
dialog: wish I'd have went with more Catholic
dialog: school girls when I was a kid. As it
dialog: stands. I have no "...and then she
text: unzipped her jumper..." stories.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You looked weirded out back there.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: That's my couch you were fucking on.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I wanted to watch some TV. Hard to do
dialog: when your best friend's wrapped around
dialog: a naked rug-muncher on your couch.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: She had boxers on.
text: Banky shoots him a glare. He goes back to staring at the
dialog: OC girls.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: This is all going to end badly.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You don't know that.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I know you. You're way too
dialog: conservative for that girl. She's
dialog: been around and seen things we've only
dialog: read about in books.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: But we have read about them. So we're
dialog: prepared.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: There's no 'we' here. You're going to
dialog: have to go through this alone. And
dialog: it's one thing to read about shit, and
dialog: something different when you're forced
dialog: to deal with it on a regular basis.
dialog: When you guys are walking in the mall
dialog: and both your heads turn at a really
dialog: nice looking chick, it's going to eat
dialog: you up inside. You'll spend most of
dialog: your time wondering when the other
dialog: shoe's going to drop. Because for
dialog: you, this isn't about cool weird sex
dialog: stuff, it's about love.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Maybe it is for her as well.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Somehow I doubt it.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Everyone's not out to get someone in
dialog: life. Bank.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Everybody has an agenda. Everyone.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yourself?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: My agenda is to watch your back.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: To what end?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: To insure that all this time we've
dialog: spent together, building something,
dialog: wasn't wasted.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: She's not going to ruin the comic.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I wasn't talking about the comic.
dialog: (gets up)
dialog: I'm going to gel a bagel. Clean off
dialog: my fucking couch so I can watch TV.

speaker_heading: DALIA
dialog: From what I understand, when you sign

speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And miss these last minute cram

speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I know. I know -I feel like such a

dialog: such a great time together.
speaker_heading: DALIA
dialog: Who is it? Don't even tell me it's

dialog: kill you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA

speaker_heading: NICA
dialog: That chick you left the restaurant

speaker_heading: ALYSSA

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: TORY

speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: For your information, they don't have

speaker_heading: DALIA
dialog: Why are you playing the pronoun game?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What? What are you talking about?
dialog: I'm not even.
speaker_heading: DALIA
dialog: You are. "I met someone." "We have a

speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Don't even tell me you want to do it
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Why me - you know? Why now?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Because you were giving me that look,
dialog: and I got wet...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You know what I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Why not You?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm a guy. You're attracted to girls.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I see you've been taking notes.
dialog: Historically, yes that's true.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Then why this?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I've given that a lot of thought, you
dialog: know? I mean, now that I'm being
dialog: ostracized by my friends, I've had a
dialog: lot of time to think about all of
dialog: this. And what I've come up with is
dialog: really simple: I came to this on my
dialog: terms. I didn't just heed what I was
dialog: taught, you know? Men and women
dialog: should be together, it's the natural
dialog: way - that kind of thing. I'm not
dialog: with you because of what family,
dialog: society, life tried to instill in me
dialog: from day one. The way the world is -
dialog: how seldom you meet that one person
dialog: who gets you... it's so rare. My
dialog: parents didn't really have it. There
dialog: was no example set for me in the world
dialog: of male/female relation ships. And to
dialog: cut oneself off from finding that
dialog: person - to immediately half your
dialog: options by eliminating the possibility
dialog: of finding that one person within your
dialog: own gender... that just seemed stupid.
dialog: So I didn't. And by leaving my
dialog: options open, I was branded 'gay',
dialog: which to me was no big deal - labels
dialog: are labels, you know? They define
dialog: what you do, not who you are, I guess.
dialog: But 		then you come along. You -
dialog: the one least likely; I mean, you were
text: a guy.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Still am.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And while I was falling for you, I put
dialog: a ceiling on that, because you were a
dialog: guy.
dialog: Until I remembered why I opened the
dialog: door to women in the first place - to
dialog: not limit the likelihood of finding
dialog: that one person who'd compliment me so
dialog: completely. And so here we are, I was
dialog: thorough when I looked for you, and I
dialog: feel justified lying in your arms -
dialog: because I got here on my terms, and
dialog: have no question that there was
dialog: someplace I didn't look. And that
dialog: makes all the difference.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Well, you took the luster our of it.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: What luster?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (joking - in case you didn't
dialog: get it)
dialog: Of how I brought you back from the
dialog: other side. How all you needed was
dialog: the right man to turn you around.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You're not the right man.
dialog: (kisses him)
dialog: You're just the one.
text: She snuggles into him and closes her eyes. Holden stares
text: at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Can I at least cell people that all
dialog: you needed was some serious deep-
dialog: dicking?
text: She hits him with her pillow.
scene_heading: THE BIG OL' FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE BEGINS
text: 1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various
text: directions, shaking her head accordingly. Then she puts
text: up her hands to stop. Cut to Holden, hanging the
text: picture. Alyssa gave him.
text: It hangs at a severely crooked angle. He looks back to
text: her and shakes his head 'no'.
text: 2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game. Banky
text: plays as well. Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL
text: '96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things
text: on the screen). She presses the reset button, over and
text: over. Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.
text: Alyssa sticks her tongue at him.
text: 3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon
text: off the shelf. He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's
text: reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick
text: porno. An old WOMAN stares at her. Holden nods to the
text: old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands,
text: putting it back on the shelf. He ushers her away. The
text: old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the
dialog: tape herself,
text: 4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the
text: park, her crotch against the back of his neck. He's
text: talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up. She
text: begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.
text: He pulls her off and put her down. She's laughing. He's
text: flushed with embarrassment. The same Old Woman from the
text: Video store passes by with her husband. Holden shrugs.
text: 5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the
text: waving, then putting up her hands to stop. Cut to Holden
text: again, this time with the painting hung completely upside
text: down. He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze.
text: 6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table. There
text: are penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging
text: out with Alyssa today. Holden". Banky crumples it up
text: and throws it across the room.
text: 7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then
text: that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.
text: She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile
text: crawling across her face, and closes her eyes. We pull
text: back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her,
text: eating her out (no, we don't see anything!).
scene_heading: INT OFFICE - DAY
text: Holden draws. A book is thrown in front of him. He
text: looks up. Banky stands there.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Check out page forty eight.
text: Holden looks down at that book. It's the Nineteen Eighty
text: Eight yearbook from Middletown North. He shakes his head
text: at Banky and flips it open.
text: On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo. Under her
text: name is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Did you see the nickname?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: 'Finger Cuffs'.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: And...?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: And... she had a weird nick-name.
dialog: What's your point?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Do you know why it's 'Finger Cuffs'?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I suppose you do.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I do.
dialog: (takes a seat)
dialog: You remember Cohee Lundin? Left
dialog: Hudson and went to North our senior
dialog: year?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Well, I ran into him at Food City the
dialog: other day, and we got to talking, and
dialog: I mentioned that you were dating

dialog: Alyssa Jones? Shit. I know Alyssa
dialog: Jones. I mean, I know Alyssa Jones,
dialog: you know what I'm saying?
dialog: Me and Rick Derris used to hang our
dialog: with her for awhile, right? Just
text: hanging around her house after school,
dialog: 'cuz her parents were like never home,
dialog: and shit. And one day, Rick just
text: whips it out, and starts rubbing it on
text: her leg and shit; chasing her around
dialog: the living room - I was dying. But
dialog: you know what the crazy bitch did?
text: She fucking drops to her knees, and
text: just starts sucking him off right in
dialog: front of me! Like I wasn't even there
dialog: man! I almost died! But that's not
dialog: the fucked up part - the fucked up
dialog: part was Rick, man - right in the
text: middle of it, he turns to me and he's
text: pointing at her and he says "Cohee."
dialog: Just like that - "Cohee." So I'm like
dialog: I'll give it a shot. And I start
dialog: pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz
dialog: I figure any second she's gonna turn
text: around and belt me in the mouth,
dialog: right? But yo, check this shit out -
dialog: she's all into it man! She don't try
dialog: to stop me or nothing! She's
dialog: all wet and shit, and I just went to
dialog: work, know what I'm saying? Me and
dialog: Rick are going to town on this crazy
dialog: bitch, and she's just loving it, all
dialog: moaning and shit! It was fucked up!
dialog: So Rick's the one that came up with
dialog: the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had

dialog: cuffs!
text: BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN

speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Cohee's a lot of things, but an
dialog: exxagerator he's not. The dude's
dialog: Catholic.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: She's never even been with a guy.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: That's what she says. But I say her
text: on her hands and knees getting filled
dialog: out like an application constitutes
dialog: 'being with a guy'.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: He's pulling your chain. And the fact
dialog: that you even bought it for a second
dialog: makes you look like an idiot.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I'm getting your back, asshole!
dialog: People don't forget shit like 'Finger
dialog: Cuffs'. And if it got out that she's
dialog: queer as well, how do you think it's
dialog: going to make you look?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I give a shit what people think.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Alright, forget about that; what if
dialog: she's carrying a disease? That was
dialog: just one story - what if there's more?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (grabs his coat)
dialog: You're such a fucking asshole.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: What? Oh, it's not possible that
dialog: she's all crudded up? Cohee I can
dialog: vouch for as clean - the dude never
dialog: got laid in high school. But Derris
dialog: is an arch fucking bush-man! Name me
dialog: one chick in our senior class that
dialog: Rick Derris didn't nail, for Christ's
dialog: sake!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Would you let this go? I'm telling
dialog: you - she's never even been with a
dialog: guy, let alone those two zeroes.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: And I'm telling you, the bitch could
dialog: be a bigger fucking germ farm than
dialog: that monkey in 'Outbreak'!
text: Holden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Give it a rest! Do you hear me?! I'm
dialog: tired of this shit! She's my goddamn

dialog: her a little fucking respect!
dialog: And if you ever even so much as
dialog: mention that Alyssa looks a little
dialog: peaked from now on, I'll put your

speaker_heading: BANKY

speaker_heading: HOOPER

dialog: wrong we if he wants to split you up,
dialog: isn't he? He's not going to make you
dialog: see the error of your ways by pointing
dialog: out how truly gay she's not
dialog: (holds up a disc)
dialog: This one?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Have it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Actually, it's kind of gotten to me.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Banky's not known for believing
dialog: misinformation. He's got a pretty
dialog: good bullshit detector.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: So, what if it is true? Would that
dialog: bother you?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Sex with multiple partners?
text: Hooper lets our a faux-shock shriek.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: At the same time.
text: Again, even louder, hands slapped against his cheeks.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Thanks for being so comforting.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: So what do you care?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Well that's the thing, isn't it? I
dialog: shouldn't.. but it gets to me.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't think
text: she's been in the middle of an all -
dialog: girl group-grope?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You see - that doesn't bother me. But
dialog: the thought of her and guys... Uh!
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Oh Holden, I beg you - please don't
dialog: drop fifty stories in my opinion of
dialog: you by falling prey to that latest of
text: trendy beasts.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Lesbian chic. It's oh-so acceptable
dialog: to be a gay girl nowadays. People
dialog: think it's cute, because they've got
dialog: this fool picture in their heads about
dialog: lipstick lesbians - like they all
dialog: resemble Alyssa - while most of them
dialog: look more like you.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Do I detect a little inter-subculture
dialog: cattiness?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Gay or straight - ugly's still ugly.
dialog: And most of those boys are scary.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I thought fags were all supposed to be
text: super-supportive of one another.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Screw that 'all for one' shit. I
dialog: gotta deal with being the minority in
dialog: the minority of the minority, and
dialog: nobody's supporting my ass? While the
text: whole of society is fawning over girls-
dialog: on-girls, here I sit - a reviled gay
dialog: man, and to top that off, I'm a gay
dialog: black man - notoriously the most
dialog: swishy of the bunch.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: Three strikes.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Hey, hey! There's a line.
text: A young BLACK KID approaches Hooper, holding a comic
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Are you Hooper X?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (in militant mode)
dialog: A-salaam Alaikum, little brother.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Could you sign my comic?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: (signing comic; nods to
dialog: Holden)
dialog: See that guy there? He's the devil,
dialog: you understand? Never take your eye
dialog: off the Man. Our people took their
dialog: eyes off him one time, and he had us
text: in chains in two shakes of his snake's
dialog: tail.
text: The Kid offers Holden an angry look. Hooper gives him
text: back his comic.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Fight the power, little 'G'.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Word is bond
text: The Kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Look at what I have to resort to for
dialog: professional respect. What is it
dialog: about gay men that terrifies the rest
dialog: of the world.
dialog: (shakes his head)
text: As for this hang-up with Alyssa's
dialog: past, maybe what's really bothering
dialog: you is that your fragile fantasy might
dialog: not be true.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Holden - don't even try to come off
dialog: like you don't know what I'm saying.
dialog: Men need to believe that they're Marco
dialog: fucking Polo when it comes to sex -
dialog: like they're the only ones who've ever
dialog: explored new territory. And it's hard
dialog: not to let them believe it. I let my
dialog: boys run with it for awhile - feed
dialog: them some of that "I've never done
dialog: this before..." bullshit, and let 'em
dialog: labor under the delusion that they
dialog: rockin' my world, until I can't stand
dialog: them anymore. Then I hit 'em with the
dialog: truth. It's a sick game. The world
dialog: would be a better place if people
dialog: would just accept that there's nothing
dialog: new under the sun, and everything you
dialog: can do with a person has probably been
dialog: done long before you got there.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I can accept that.
speaker_heading: HOOPER
dialog: Honey, that almost sounded convincing.
dialog: Do yourself a favor - just ask her
dialog: about her past, point blank. Get it
text: out of the way, before it gets too big
dialog: for both ya'll to move.
dialog: (spotting something OC)
dialog: Oooh! 'Myra Breckinridge'!
text: Hooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his
text: hands. Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely
text: clad, making out. The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do
dialog: Girls - All XXX Action.'
scene_heading: INT HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT
text: On the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and
text: back, checking galore.
text: In the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches
text: the game with a large degree of enjoyment. Sitting
text: beside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Since most of these people are rooting
dialog: for the home team, I'm going to cheer
dialog: for the visitors. I'm a big visitors
dialog: fan - especially the kind that make
dialog: coffee for you in the morning before
dialog: they go.
dialog: (smiles at Holden; no
dialog: response)
dialog: That was a joke. A little wacky
dialog: wordplay?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What do you mean, 'visitors'?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Was I being too obscure? The kind
dialog: that - until recently - had no dicks
dialog: and would spend the night.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: So that was until recently!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Oh, yeah.
dialog: (shouting; to ice)
dialog: Hey - foul! Foul! He was traveling
dialog: or something!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: So nobody bur me has stayed the night
dialog: at your place since we got together?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Something on your mind, Holden?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: No, I was just wondering,
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: If I've been 'faithful' or something?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Look, I was just asking.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (toucher his face)
dialog: Oh, sweetie. I only have eyes for
dialog: you.
dialog: (to ice)
text: CALL THAT FUCKING SHIT, REF!! THE GUY
text: ON THE SKATES TOTALLY SHOVED ONE OF MY
dialog: GUYS!!
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: I told you I was great at sporting
dialog: events. Imagine what a bitch I could
dialog: be if I knew what was going on?
text: ON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS.
text: One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off.
text: The other Player gives chase.
text: Alyssa's very into the game. Holden shakes his head
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: That'd make Banky half right.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: He said all the girls from North were
text: bitches and sluts.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Really. I'm sorry - you two left high
dialog: school behind how many years ago?
text: (grabs his face and kisses
dialog: his cheek)
dialog: Can I put some of my books in your
dialog: locker?
dialog: (goes back to watching game)
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: How about your yearbook.
text: ON THE ICE - The Player giving chase slashes the Player
text: with the puck.
text: Alyssa jumps to her feet.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (to ice)
text: IF YOU DON'T START USING THAT WHISTLE
text: I'M GONNA JAM IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR
dialog: ASS!!
dialog: (to guy next to her)
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What's with 'Finger Cuffs'?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (sitting back down)
dialog: 'Finger Cuffs'?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yeah. In your senior yearbook your
dialog: nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'. What is
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: It was? Shit, damned if I can
dialog: remember. I'd look it up, but I threw
dialog: all that shit our years ago?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where'd you see a North yearbook?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Do you know Rick Derris?
text: ON THE ICE - The Players skid into the corner where
text: Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard.
text: Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his
dialog: gloves.
text: The crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Rick? Sure. We used to hang out in
dialog: high school.
dialog: (to ice)
text: PUNCH HIM IN THE FUCKING NECK, NUMBER
dialog: TWELVE!!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Did you go out with him or something?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (eyes on the ice)
dialog: Date Rick Derris? No. We just hung
dialog: out a lot.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Just... you and him?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No. Me, Rick, and... um... what was
dialog: that guy's name...?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Cohee?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Yeah! Cohee Lundin. God, I haven't
dialog: thought about that name in years.
text: ON THE ICE - The Players square off. Player Two pulls
text: Player One's helmet off and punches him in the face.
text: Holden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his
text: companion. Alyssa's into the game.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I remember those guys'd come over
dialog: almost everyday after school. They'd
dialog: bug my sisters, look for porno tapes
text: in my dad's closet, raid our fridge.
dialog: They really took advantage of my
dialog: parents never being home.
text: ON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and
text: gut punches him. Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's
text: anger, so enthralled with the action is she.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (starts laughing)
dialog: This one day... Rick pulled out his
dialog: dick and chased me around the house
dialog: with it! Right in front of Cohee! I
dialog: couldn't believe it! Guys are weird -
dialog: I thought the whole size hang-up made
dialog: you all terrified to show your dicks
dialog: to each other?
text: ON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly
text: rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a
text: barrage of his own punches. Blood sprays across the ice.
text: Holden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking. Alyssa's
text: still in the game.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Rick pulled his dick out? Really?
dialog: What'd you do?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (looks him dead in the eye)
dialog: I blew him while Cohee fucked me.
text: ON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming
text: his fist into Player Two's nose. The blood shoots out
text: like a geyser, and Two goes down hard.
text: Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted. The crowd around
text: them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in
text: their midst, shocked. Alyssa fumes.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Excuse me!?!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: That's what you wanted to hear, isn't
dialog: it? Isn't that what this little cross-
dialog: examination of your's is about? Well
dialog: try not to be so obvious about it next
dialog: time, there are subtler ways of
text: badgering a witness.
dialog: (to Bystander)
dialog: Am I right?
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: Jeez, even I knew what you were
text: getting at.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (gathering her stuff)
dialog: If you wanted some background
dialog: information on me, all you had to do
dialog: was ask - I'd have gladly volunteered
dialog: it. You didn't have to play Hercules
dialog: fucking Poirot!
text: She storms away. Holden chases after her. The Bystander
text: watches them go.
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER
dialog: (to companion)
dialog: I told you these were good seats.
scene_heading: INT RINK LOBBY / EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat. Holden
text: catches up to her. We track with them our into the
text: parking lot.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: So it's true?!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Yes Holden! In fact, everything you
dialog: heard or dug up on me was probably
dialog: true! Yeah, I took on two guys at
dialog: once! You want to hear some gems you
dialog: might not have unearthed - I took a
dialog: twenty six year old guy to my senior
text: prom, and then left halfway through to
text: have sex with him and Gwen Turner in
text: the back of a limo! And the girl who
dialog: got caught in the shower with Miss
dialog: Moffit, the gym teacher? That was me!
dialog: Or how about in college, when I let
dialog: Shannon Hamilton videotape us having
dialog: sex - only to find out the next day
dialog: that he broadcast it on the campus
dialog: cable station?! They're all true -
dialog: those and so many more! Didn't you
dialog: know? I'm the queen of urban legend!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: How the hell could you do those
dialog: things?!
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Easily! Some of it I did out of
dialog: stupidity, some of it I did out of
dialog: what I thought was love, but - good or
dialog: bad - they were my choices, and I'm
dialog: not making apologies for them now -
dialog: not to you or anyone! And how dare
dialog: you try to lay a guilt trip on me
dialog: about it - in public, no less! Who
dialog: the fuck do you think you are, you
dialog: judgemental prick?!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: How am I supposed to feel about all of
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: How are you supposed to feel about it?
dialog: Feel what ever the fuck you want about
dialog: it! The only thing that really
dialog: matters is how you feel about me.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I don't know how I feel about you now.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Why? Because I had some sex?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Some sex?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Yes, Holden - that's all it was: some
dialog: sex! Most of it stupid high school
dialog: sex, for Christ's sake! Like you
dialog: never had sex in high school!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: There's a world of fucking difference
dialog: between typical high school sex and
dialog: two guys at once! They fucking used
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I used them! You don't think I
dialog: would've let it happen if I hadn't
dialog: wanted it to, do you?! I was an
dialog: experimental girl, for Christ's sake!
dialog: Maybe you knew early on that your
dialog: track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but
dialog: unlike you I wasn't given a fucking
dialog: map at birth, so I tried it all! That
dialog: is until we - that's you and I - got
dialog: together, and suddenly, I was sated.
dialog: Can't you take some fucking comfort in
dialog: that? You turned out to be all I was
dialog: ever looking for - the missing piece
dialog: in the big fucking puzzle!
dialog: (tries to calm down)
dialog: Look I'm sorry I let you believe that
dialog: you were the only guy I'd ever been
dialog: with. I should've been more honest.
dialog: But it seemed to make you feel special
dialog: in a way that me telling you over and
dialog: over again how incredible you are
dialog: would never get across.
text: She touches his face. He pulls back. She stares at him,
text: hurt and pissed.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Do you mean to tell me that - while
dialog: you have zero problem with me sleeping
dialog: with half the women in New York City -
dialog: you have some sort of half-assed,
text: mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent
dialog: antics, that took place almost ten
dialog: years ago? What the fuck is your
dialog: problem?!?
text: Holden's eyes are downcast. Alyssa waits for a response.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I want us to be something that we
dialog: can't.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: And what's that?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (beat)
text: A normal couple.
text: Holden skulks off. Alyssa stares after him, and then
text: starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally
text: slumping to the ground. She cries.
scene_heading: INT STUDIO - DUSK
text: Holden sits on the couch, alone in the dark. The door
text: opens and Banky enters. He stands there, sizing up
text: Holden's mood.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: The girl?
text: Holden nods. Banky nods back. He stands there for a
text: beat. Then he sits beside Holden. He opens his arms.
text: Holden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying
text: on his shoulder. Banky pats his back. Pull back on a
text: man in pain and the comfort of a friend.
scene_heading: INT DINER - NIGHT
text: Holden sits alone at a booth. He stirs his iced tea.
speaker_heading: OC VOICE
dialog: Yo, look at this morose mother fucker
dialog: here..
text: Holden looks up. JAY and SILENT BOB stand above him.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Smells like somebody shit in his
dialog: cereal.
text: Holden offers a half-smile. The pair slide into the
dialog: booth.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What took you so long?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: We were at the mall. You bring the
dialog: salad?
text: Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it
text: to Jay. Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills,
text: along with the latest issue of 'BLUNTMAN and CHRONIC.'
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Man, this likeness rights shit is more
dialog: profitable than selling smoke.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: How'd a dirt merchant like you ever
dialog: learn about likeness rights?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (hands envelope to Silent
dialog: Bob)
dialog: We deal to a lot of lawyers. Speaking
dialog: of which...
dialog: (pulls out a dime bag)
dialog: Little signing bonus and shit!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'll pass. Take a look at the issue.
text: Silent Bob thumbs through the comic. Jay looks over his
text: shoulder, as he begins rolling a joint.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Yeah. When you gonna get some pussy
dialog: in that book, man! Throw some super-
dialog: villain in with big fucking tits that
dialog: shoot milk or something, and I just
dialog: drink her dry, bust some moves on
dialog: her...
dialog: (demonstrates)
dialog: ...and then she has to fuck me.
dialog: (Silent Bob hits him)
dialog: Fuck us.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
text: A WAITRESS joins them.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: What can I get you.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Nothing, thanks.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Yo Flo - tell Mel to whip me up a
text: toasted bagel and cream cheese.
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: You want one too?
dialog: (Silent Bob nods)
dialog: Make that two. And kiss my grits.
dialog: Noonch.
dialog: (the Waitress leaves; to
dialog: Holden)
dialog: D'jever watch 'Alice'? That show's
dialog: good as hell.
dialog: (continues rolling)
dialog: So why the long face, Horse? Banky on
dialog: the rag?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: When is he not? No - I'm just having
dialog: some girl trouble.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Bitch pressing charges? I get that a
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: No. I'm just at a point where I don't
dialog: know what to do.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Kick her to the curb. Girls get to be
dialog: too much trouble, there's always the
dialog: 'band of the hand'.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Can't do it, g. I'm in love.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Ah, there ain't no such thing. You
dialog: gotta boil it all down to the
dialog: essentials. It's like Cube says -
dialog: life ain't nothing but bitches and
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Just what I needed - advice from the
dialog: 'hood
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Who is this girl?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I don't think you know her.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Come on man - I'm people who know
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You sound like Barbra Streisand.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: That's 'cause I got this tubby bitch
dialog: playing her greatest hits tape in my
dialog: ear all the time. You should see him:
dialog: she starts singing 'You Don't Bring Me
text: Flowers', this faggot starts crying
text: like a little girl with a skinned knee
dialog: and shit. It's embarrassing. I got
dialog: the only muscle in the world with a
dialog: weakness for ballads.
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: You big fucking softie.
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: So what's this skirt's name!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm telling you, you don't know her.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I ain't playing. Tell me her name,
dialog: Mysterio.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Alyssa Jones.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Finger Cuffs?
text: Holden rubs his eyes.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You're dating Finger Cuffs? Wait a
dialog: minute I thought she was all gay and
dialog: shit!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: She is. Or was. I don't know.
text: The Waitress returns with the order.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: And you go out with her? Shit, man -
dialog: you're a lucky dog. She bring other
dialog: chicks to bed with you, get a little
dialog: of that filet o' fish sammich going
dialog: on?
text: The Waitress stares wide-eyed and offended at Jay.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (off the Waitress' look)
dialog: Yeah - you know what I'm talking
dialog: about, baby.
dialog: (Waitress leaves; to
dialog: Holden)
dialog: So - four tits, or what?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It's not like that.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Well what's it like then?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Right now?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't know. I love her. But she
dialog: has a past
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I'll say. Stuffin' two guys, eating
dialog: chicks out. Yo - I heard one time,
dialog: she had this dog...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Eat your fucking bagel already!
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Look at this touchy mother fucker
dialog: right here.
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: So, if you're all in love with her,
dialog: what's the problem?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: The problem is shit like that. It was
dialog: one thing when it was just girls -
dialog: that was weird enough. But now you
text: throw guys into the mix - two guys at
dialog: once, no less. All that
dialog: experience...What am I supposed to
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You think good; because now she'll be
dialog: all true blue and shit. The girl's
dialog: tasted life, yo. Now she's settlin'
dialog: for your boring, funny-book-makin'
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Settling. That's comforting, Jay.
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: That's what I'm here for.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm lust having a problem with all of
dialog: it I can't get it out of my head these
text: visuals of her doing all this shit.
dialog: And I don't know why I can't let it
dialog: go. Because I'm crazy about her, you
dialog: know? I look at this girl, I see the
dialog: future. I see kids. I see grand-
dialog: kids.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You're scaring me.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm scaring myself. Because I think
dialog: so much of her, and then I can't get
dialog: over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I don't know what I'm doing.
text: Holden looks out the window. Jay continues to roll his
text: joint. There's silence. Then...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're chasing Amy.
text: Holden's head snaps forward. He stares, wide-eyed at
dialog: Silent Bob.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What..what did you say?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're chasing Amy.
text: Holden stares, shocked. He looks to Jay, who's still
text: rolling his joint.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What do you look so shocked for? He
dialog: does this all the time. Fat bastard
dialog: thinks just because he never says
dialog: anything, that it'll have some huge
text: impact when he does open his fucking
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Why don't you shut up? Jesus! Always
dialog: yap, yap, yapping all the time. Give
dialog: me a fucking headache.
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: I went through something like what
dialog: you're going through. Years ago.
dialog: Same kind of thing with a girl named
dialog: Amy.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: A couple of years ago.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What'd she 'Live in Canada' or
dialog: something? Why don't I remember this?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What you don't know about me I can
dialog: just about squeeze into the Grand
dialog: fucking Canyon. Did you know I always
dialog: wanted to be a dancer in Vegas?
text: Jay and Holden look at him. Silent Bob busts a move with
text: his hands.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hunhh? Bet you didn't know that?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Just cell your fucking story so we can
dialog: get out of here and smoke this.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: So there's me an Amy, and we're all
dialog: inseparable, right? Just big time in
dialog: love. And then about four months in,
dialog: I ask about the ex-boyfriend. Dumb
dialog: move, I know, but you know how it is -
dialog: you don't really want to know, but you
dialog: just have to... stupid guy bullshit.
dialog: Anyway she starts telling me all about
dialog: him - how they dated for years, lived
dialog: together, her mother likes me better,
dialog: blah, blah, blah - and I'm okay. But
dialog: then she tells me that a couple times,
dialog: he brought other people to bed with
dialog: them - menage a tois, I believe it's
dialog: called. Now this just blows my mind.
dialog: I mean, I'm not used to that sort of
dialog: thing, right? I was raised Catholic.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Saint Shithead.
text: Silent Bob backhands him. Jay raises his fist as if to
dialog: strike.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Do something.
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: So I get weirded out, and just start
dialog: blasting her, right? This is the only
dialog: way I can deal with it - by calling
text: her a slut, and telling her that she
dialog: was used - I mean, I'm out for blood I
dialog: want to hurt her - because I don't
dialog: know how to deal with what I'm
dialog: feeling. And I'm like "What the fuck
dialog: is wrong with you?" and she's telling
dialog: me that it was that time, in that
dialog: place, and she didn't do anything
dialog: wrong, so she's not gonna apologize.
text: So I tell her it's over, and I walk.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Fucking a.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, idiot. It was a mistake. I
dialog: wasn't disgusted with her, I was
dialog: afraid. At that moment, I felt small -
dialog: like I'd lacked experience, like I'd
dialog: never be on her level or never be
dialog: enough for her or something.
dialog: And what I didn't get was that she
dialog: didn't care. She wasn't looking for
dialog: that guy anymore. She was looking for
dialog: me. But by the time I realized this,
dialog: it was too late, you know. She'd
dialog: moved on, and all I had to show for it
dialog: was some foolish pride, which then
text: gave way to regret. She was the girl,
dialog: I know that now. But I pushed her
dialog: away...
text: Everyone's silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So I've spent every day since then
text: chasing Amy...
text: (takes a drag from his smoke)
dialog: So to speak.
text: They sit there for a beat. Jay pockets the rest of his
dialog: dime-bag.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Enough of this fucking melodrama. My
dialog: advice - forget her, dude. There's
dialog: one woman in the world. One woman,
text: with many faces.
dialog: (to Silent Bob)
dialog: Get up, bitch
dialog: (to Holden)
dialog: We gotta book. We're catching a bus
dialog: to Chi-town.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What's there?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Business, yo. How many more of those
dialog: phat envelopes do we got coming to us?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I don't know. I don't know if the
dialog: book's going to be around much longer.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Yeah? Good. I'll be glad as shit
dialog: when it's gone.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Are you kidding me? There's millions
dialog: of people out there that'd love to see
text: themselves in a comic book.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I know. I spend every fucking waking
dialog: hour with one of them. But it ain't
dialog: like us at all - all slapsticky and
dialog: shit - running around like dicks,
dialog: saying... What's that shit you got me
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Snootchie-bootchies.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: 'Snootchie-bootchies'. Who talks like
dialog: that? That's baby-talk.
dialog: (slaps his hand)
dialog: It's a big world, g - but we're bound
dialog: to run into you again. Until then -
dialog: keep your unit on you.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'll try.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Do, or do not - there is no ay.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (slaps him)
dialog: Knock it off! Get your fat ass moving
dialog: - we got a bus to catch.
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Jedi-bitch.
text: Exit Jay and Silent Bob. Holden remains in the booth,
dialog: thinking.
scene_heading: MONTAGE - AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE
text: 1) Holden sits at his drawing table, tapping his pencil
text: up and down.
text: 2)Alyssa sits in a club, getting talked at by some women.
text: She's not present in the conversation.
text: 3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes
text: the contracts at him, and Banky makes the "I know, I
dialog: know," face.
text: 4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him.
text: 5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone. She hangs up,
dialog: angrily.
text: 6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked
text: through. He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture. He
text: closes the book and sighs. Then, an idea hits him. He
text: jumps up and dashes out of the park.
scene_heading: INT STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch. Holden paces in front
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I know you're wondering why I asked
dialog: you both here tonight, at the same
dialog: time, knowing that we have shit to
text: settle between us, separately.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: I just figured you wanted to kill two
text: birds with one stone by telling her to
dialog: fuck off with me here so you didn't
dialog: have to go through the story again
dialog: later on.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Not even if you let me videotape it.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Enough!
text: (they both look at him)
dialog: I've been going through things, over
dialog: and over. And I dissected it all, and
dialog: looked at it a thousand different
dialog: ways. Banky - there's friction
dialog: between us for the first time in our
dialog: lives. You hate me dating Alyssa and
dialog: you want me to sign off on this M-TV
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: How perceptive.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because
dialog: I don't know how to deal with... your
dialog: past, I guess.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: That's a nice way of putting it. I'd
dialog: have said the whole double-stuff
dialog: thing...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (right in his face)
dialog: I'm only going to say it once: shut
dialog: up.
dialog: (back to pacing)
dialog: Now - I know I'm to blame one way or
dialog: the other on both accounts. With you,
dialog: Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel
dialog: inadequate. Because you've had so
dialog: much experience, had such a big life;
dialog: and my life's been pretty small in
dialog: comparison.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: That doesn't matter to me...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Please. I have to get through this.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And with you Banky - I know why you're
dialog: having such a hard time with Alyssa,
dialog: and it's something that's been obvious
dialog: forever, but I guess I just didn't
dialog: acknowledge it.
dialog: (takes a deep breath)
dialog: You're in love with me.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (makes a face; beat)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You're attracted to me. Just as, in a
dialog: way, I'm attracted to you. I mean, it
dialog: makes sense - we've been together so
dialog: long, we have so much in common...
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Well, I've got to get home and catch
text: the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5',
dialog: so I'll be...
text: Holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes
text: him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts. Banky - wide-eyed
text: and speechless - looks away.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: It's something you're going to have to
dialog: deal with. Bank. You may very well
dialog: be gay, which explains your homophobia
dialog: and why you're so jealous of Alyssa,
dialog: and your sense of humor as well.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection
dialog: coward dick jokes...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Bank. Stop. Deal with it. You'll
dialog: feel much better.
text: He grabs a chair from the side of the room.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Now - at this point, you may be asking
dialog: yourself the question that I've been
text: going over and over in my head for the
dialog: last few days: what does one have to
dialog: do with the other?
text: Alyssa's face drops. She subtly shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: And when I did some serious soul-
text: searching, it came at me from out of
dialog: nowhere, and suddenly it all made
dialog: sense - a calm came over me. I know
dialog: what we have to do. And then you -
dialog: Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us...
dialog: can finally be... alright.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (again, under her breath)
dialog: Please don't say it.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
text: (sits in the chair; takes a
dialog: long beat)
dialog: We've all got to have sex together.
text: The room is silent. Holden Lights a cigarette. Banky's
text: eyes nearly bug. Alyssa's head drops.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Don't you see? That would take care
dialog: of everything. Alyssa - I wouldn't
dialog: feel inadequate or too conservative
dialog: anymore. I'll have done something on
dialog: par with all the experience you've
dialog: had. And it'll be with you, which'll
dialog: make it that much more powerful. And
dialog: Banky - you can cake that leap that
dialog: everyone else but you sees that you
dialog: should take. And it'll be okay,
dialog: because it'll be with me - your best
dialog: friend for years. We've been
dialog: everything to each other but
dialog: intimates. And now, we'll have been
dialog: through that together too. And it
dialog: won't have to be a total leap for you,
dialog: because a woman will be involved. And
dialog: when it's over, all that aggression
dialog: you feel toward Alyssa will be gone.
dialog: Because you'll have shared in
dialog: something beautiful with the woman I
dialog: love. It'll be cathartic. A true
dialog: communion. We have to do this. For
dialog: me, for both of you... for all of our
dialog: sakes. This will keep us together.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you say?
text: Banky stares forward, wide-eyed. He leans back into the
text: couch and lets out a huge sigh. Then shrugs.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Sure.
text: Holden smiles at his friend. Then he looks at Alyssa.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You know I need this. You know it'll
dialog: help.
text: Alyssa looks at him, sadly.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No.
text: Holden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: No? I... I thought you'd be into
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You did? What does that say about me?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: But you've... you've done... stuff...
dialog: like this. This should be no big deal
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: You don't want this.
dialog: (lights her cigarette)
dialog: You really don't want this. Trust me.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I need this. This has to happen. Why
dialog: can't you see that? And how can you
dialog: not? What does that say about me?
dialog: You can take it from two guys whose
dialog: names you can barely remember, but I
dialog: ask you to share an experience like it
dialog: - where it's about intimacy - and you
dialog: say no?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
text: (inhales from her cigarette,
dialog: takes a beat)
dialog: I can't.
text: Holden moves to her side of the couch.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You can. I'll be there. And when
dialog: it's over, we'll be the strongest
dialog: we've ever been because we got through
dialog: some nasty shit together. And we'll
text: finally be on the same level together.
dialog: And then there'll be nothing we can't
dialog: accomplish.
text: A tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and
text: touches his face.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Oh Holden.
dialog: (trying to compose herself)
dialog: That time is over for me. I've been
dialog: there. I've done it. And I didn't
dialog: find what I was looking for in any of
dialog: it. I found that in you - in us.
dialog: Doing this won't help you forget about
dialog: the things you're hung up on. It'll
dialog: create more.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: No it won't. I thought about all of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: No, it will. Maybe you'll see me
dialog: differently from then on - maybe
dialog: you'll despise me for going along with
dialog: it, once you're in the moment. Maybe
dialog: I'll moan differently and then you'll
text: resent Banky, and become suspicious of
dialog: us. Or you'll alienate him because of
dialog: it, and then grow to blame and hate me
dialog: for the deterioration of your
dialog: friendship. Or what if- I sincerely
dialog: doubt it, but what if - I saw
dialog: something in Banky that I never saw
dialog: before, and fell in love with him and
dialog: left you. I've been down roads like
dialog: this before; many times. I know you
dialog: feel doing this will broaden your
dialog: horizons and give you experience. But
dialog: I've had those experiences on my own.
dialog: I can't accompany you on your's. I'm
dialog: past that now.
text: (touches his face; stares to
dialog: cry)
dialog: Or maybe I just love you too much.
dialog: And I feel hurt and let down that
dialog: you'd want to share me with anyone.
dialog: Because I never wanted to share you
dialog: (holds it in; gets up)
dialog: Regardless I can't be a part of this.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or you. Not anymore
dialog: (hugs him)
dialog: I love you. I always will. Know
dialog: that.
text: She releases him, then slaps him.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: But I'm not your fucking whore.
text: Alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: He's your's again.
text: She walks our of the studio. The door closes behind her.
text: Banky and Holden stand there, silently. Cut to black.
scene_heading: INT COMIC BOOK SHOW - DAY
text: It's ONE YEAR later. We're at another show, not unlike
text: the one from the opening.
text: A copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame. The
text: cover reads 'The Death Chronic', complete with a
dialog: corresponding drawing.
speaker_heading: BANKY V.O.
text: Blast from the past.
text: Banky sits at his own signing table. Behind him hangs a
text: banner that reads 'BANKY EDWARDS - CREATOR Of BABY DAVE'.
text: A small line is formed in front of him. He talks with a
speaker_heading: FAN.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Do you know how much it's going for
dialog: these days? One ten. You signing it
dialog: will push that up even higher,
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: If you sell it, I want a kickback
dialog: (starts signing)
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: I don't know if this is true, but I
dialog: heard once that there was going to be
text: an animated series.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: There was going to be
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: What happened!
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (off comic)
dialog: You're looking at it. No Chronic - no
dialog: cartoon
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: That sucks man. That would've been
dialog: awesome.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Tell me about it
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Is that what happened to you and
dialog: Holden McNeil? You got into a fight
dialog: over the rights or something?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: It was a little more involved than
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Whatever happened to him?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: He quit the biz. I guess.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: You guys don't talk anymore?
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (looks OC)
dialog: No. Not really.
text: Banky locks eyes with someone OC. His expression
text: softens.
text: Holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room.
text: He smiles at Banky. Banky smiles back, and sort of nods.
text: Holden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic. He
text: points to it and gives a thumbs up.
speaker_heading: OC FAN
dialog: Probably shouldn't have killed off
dialog: Chronic.
text: Banky smiles to OC.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: Guess not. Some doors just shouldn't
dialog: be opened.
text: Banky looks in another direction, OC. He looks at Holden
text: and points to it. Holden looks in the same direction,
text: and then looks back at Banky and nods.
speaker_heading: OC FAN
dialog: You don't need that guy, anyway. You
dialog: do great stuff without him.
text: Banky looks at Holden for a beat. Then he brings his
text: pointer fingers together, mimicing Holden's 'shared
dialog: moment' gesture.
text: Holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if
dialog: to say 'hopefully'.
speaker_heading: OC FAN
dialog: You were just carrying that guy,
dialog: anyway.
text: Banky sort of smiles at the OC Holden. Then he offers
text: his own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'.
speaker_heading: BANKY
dialog: (to fan, still looking OC)
dialog: You're so right.
text: Holden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.
speaker_heading: OC FAN
dialog: Well, keep up the good work, man.
dialog: Love them dick jokes. Love 'em. See
dialog: ya.
text: The Fan Leaves, but Banky is watching Holden go.
speaker_heading: BXVKY
dialog: Yeah. Bye.
dialog: (shakes it off)
dialog: Okay. Who's next?
text: Alyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in
text: front of her. A WOMAN behind her. Alyssa dashes off
text: signatures in the copies of her comic.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (to OC departing fan)
dialog: Thanks for reading it.
text: The Woman stands and rubs her shoulders.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm going to get a soda. You want
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I'm fine, thanks,
text: The Woman heads off. Alyssa starts rummaging through her
dialog: bag.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (not rooking up)
dialog: Okay, who's next!
text: A comic book drops on the table in front of her. It's a
dialog: comic book called 'Chasing Amy'.
text: She leafs through it, not looking up.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Um... This isn't one of mine.
speaker_heading: OC HOLDEN
dialog: It's mine.
text: Alyssa looks up sharply.
text: Holden stands before her, smiling.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I saved you one.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How've you been?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Good. Really good. Yourself?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Good
dialog: (beat; off her own comic)
dialog: New issue's selling like crazy, for
dialog: some reason.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Because it's so good. I really liked
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (off comic)
dialog: I haven't even seen this yet. Did it
dialog: just come out?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: A month ago. I did a really small
dialog: run. Self-financed. Only about five
dialog: hundred issues.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Will I enjoy it?
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: You might. It's familiar subject
dialog: matter.
text: Alyssa leafs through it. Her eyes get somewhat misty.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Looks Like a very personal story.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I finally had something personal to
dialog: say.
text: They look at each other for a beat
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'm going to go. I don't want to hold
text: up the line.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Yeah. I mean, it can get ugly. I
dialog: just saw this nun in line call this
text: small child a cunt-rag.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Read that, when you have a minute
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I'd like to hear your thoughts about
dialog: it. If you get a chance, give me a
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Okay.
text: They look at each other for a beat.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Nice seeing you again,
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Really nice to see you too.
text: He walks away. A few steps away, he turns and waves
text: again. She waves back. And then he starts moving
text: through the thrall of fan-boys.
text: The Woman returns with coffee. She follows Alyssa's
dialog: gaze.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: who was that?
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: Hmm! Oh. Just some guy I knew.
text: She watches him go for another beat, then.
speaker_heading: ALYSSA
dialog: (to line)
dialog: Next
dialog: (to Woman)
dialog: So what do you want to do tonight?
text: And as they fall into conversation, the show goes on.
speaker_heading: END
