text: A college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high
dialog: school seniors about their future.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE COUNSELOR
dialog: ... For those of you going on to college
dialog: next year, the chance of finding a good
dialog: job will actually decrease by the time
dialog: you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop
dialog: from thirty-one to twenty-six percent,
dialog: and the median income for those jobs
dialog: will go down as well ...
text: There is some rustling in the audience.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE COUNSELOR (CONT)
dialog: Obviously, my friends, it's a
dialog: competitive world and good grades are
dialog: your only ticket through. By the year
dialog: Two Thousand ...
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL. HEALTH CLASS.
text: A different teacher lectures a different class of students.
speaker_heading: HEALTH TEACHER
dialog: ... The chance of contracting HIV from a
dialog: promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one
dialog: in one hundred and fifty. The odds of
dialog: dying in an auto accident are only one
dialog: in twenty-five hundred.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now this marks a drastic increase ...
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL. SCIENCE CLASS.
dialog: Same angle. Different teacher.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: ... From just four years ago when ozone
dialog: depletion was at ten percent of its
dialog: current level. By the time you are
dialog: twenty years old, average global
dialog: temperature will have risen two and a
text: half degrees. Even a shift of one
dialog: degree can cause such catastrophic
dialog: consequences as typhoons, floods,
dialog: widespread drought and famine.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. STUDENTS.
text: They stare back in stunned silence. One of them, DAVID
text: WAGNER, sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth.
dialog: Nobody moves ...
speaker_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: (chipper classroom tone)
dialog: Okay. Who can tell me what famine is?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 1958.
text: Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. All the hedges are
text: neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured. A sweet
text: stillness hangs over the SUBURBAN STREET, which is bathed in
text: beautiful BLACK AND WHITE.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (OS)
dialog: Honey, I'm home.
scene_heading: SUBURBAN HOME.
text: GEORGE PARKER enters the front door and hangs his hat on the
text: coatrack. He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer
text: with a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that
text: doesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a
text: tour guide at Disneyland.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (OS)
dialog: Hello darling.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: MRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her
text: apron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and
text: concrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a
text: fresh martini. She kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: How was your day?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said
dialog: that if things keep going the way they
dialog: are, I might be seeing that promotion
dialog: sooner than I thought.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh darling that's wonderful!
dialog: (an adoring gaze)
dialog: I always knew you could do it.
scene_heading: WAGNER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
speaker_heading: 1996 -- (LIVING COLOR)
text: DAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on
text: a sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big
text: smile on his face. David wears black shoes, black pants,
text: black t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly
text: ... He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never
text: taking his eyes off the show.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (OS)
dialog: (on T.V.)
dialog: Hey, Pumpkin! What's that smell?
dialog: (sniffing)
dialog: Is that your meat loaf?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (by rote)
dialog: "It might be ..."
speaker_heading: BETTY (OS)
dialog: (shy smile)
dialog: It might be.
text: He leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (OS)
dialog: Oh Pumpkin! You sure know the way to
dialog: this man's heart.
text: There is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles
text: wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when
text: his real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S MOM (OS)
dialog: ... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the
dialog: deal
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN.
text: David's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand.
text: Between the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix
dialog: her age.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S MOM
dialog: No--you have custody the first weekend
dialog: of every month and this is the first
dialog: weekend ...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't care if yesterday was the
dialog: thirtieth, this is still the first
dialog: weekend.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM.
text: Her words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S MOM (OS)
dialog: No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to
dialog: go to La Costa ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's
dialog: really my business, isn't it?
text: He reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at
text: an unnaturally high volume.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (on T.V.)
dialog: Hey. Where are those kids?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (reciting--a little louder)
dialog: "Right behind you father."
scene_heading: BUD AND MARY SUE TOGETHER
dialog: (on T.V.)
dialog: Right behind you father.
scene_heading: RESUME T.V. (BLACK AND WHITE)
text: The Parkers' son and daughter (BUD AND MARY SUE) enter the
text: foyer together. Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail. Bud
text: has on a Letterman's sweater.
speaker_heading: MARYSUE
dialog: Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little
dialog: surprise for you.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What's that Bud?
text: Bud hesitates for a moment, then folds up a shiny blue
dialog: ribbon.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: First prize at the science fair. There
dialog: were lots of swell projects--guess mine
dialog: was just the "swellest".
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Darling that's wonderful. Except there's
dialog: no such word as "swellest".
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the
dialog: "English" fair.
text: There is another jarring LAUGH TRACK.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
text: He smiles right along with it. David stares transfixed at the
text: set despite the continuing conversation in the other room.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S MOM (OS)
dialog: Well sure they can stay by themselves,
dialog: Barry, but that's not the point. You
dialog: said you'd take them.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well fine--they'll stay by themselves
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What's a mother to do?
speaker_heading: BETTY(OS)
dialog: (on T.V.)
dialog: Oh--what's a mother to do?
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
text: He grabs another handful of Doritos staring at the T.V ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. (SERIES OF SHOTS) DAY.
text: A cacophony of modem life. Beepers and nose rings--blue hair
text: and tattoos. Dissonant boom boxes compete with one another.
text: The hormones are running crazy.
scene_heading: SCHOOL COURTYARD.
text: lt is a large open area, alive at lunchtime. Groups of kids
text: hang out together, divided by their various cliques. The
text: music pounds in the background.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
text: He stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link
text: fence. Beads of sweat form on David's forehead as he speaks
text: to someone in front of him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hi. I mean ...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: ... Hi.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE.
text: A very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him. It's a warm,
text: welcoming smile.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look. You probably don't think I should
dialog: be asking you this. I mean--not knowing
dialog: you well and all ...
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.
text: She smiles wider at him, inviting him to continue.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pause ...)
dialog: I mean I know you--everybody knows you
dialog: ... I just don't know you ...
dialog: technically.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.
text: She nods at him ...
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see
dialog: you all the time in Algebra and I heard
dialog: you humming that Van Halen song and I
dialog: really like that song too ...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing
dialog: this weekend but my Mom's leaving town
dialog: and she said I could use her car so ...
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.
text: She positively beams. The girl flicks her blonde hair and
text: stares back at him adoringly.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
text: Instead of smiling back, David just stares, then looks at the
dialog: ground.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE. SCHOOLYARD.
text: For the first time WE SEE THAT SHE WASN'T TALKING TO HIM.
text: David stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard,
text: rehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to
text: face with a much cooler boy. He has a cell phone and a very
dialog: hip haircut.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: David watches as the girl throws her arm around the boy's
text: waist and heads out of the playground ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. "LUNCHEON COURT". DAY.
text: David and his friends are all gathered around the plastic
text: picnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon
text: court. The chess club meets at one end and there are some
text: teachers at the other. All the cool kids are on the other
text: side of the fence but David and his friends eat lunch at the
dialog: same table every day.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Okay, whose window did Bud break when he
dialog: was playing with his father's golf
dialog: clubs?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr.
dialog: Jenkins have?
text: Howard looks at him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name
dialog: the cat they found in the gutter?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Scout?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Marmalade.
text: They all nod--and murmur with admiration.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Okay--here's one: Why did their parents
dialog: come home early from their weekend at
dialog: the lake?
dialog: Everybody thinks.
dialog: Nobody knows.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: 'Cause Bud didn't answer the phone and
dialog: they were worried about him.
text: It's quiet for a beat.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You're unbelievable. You'll win this
dialog: thing for sure. When is it on?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's
dialog: tomorrow at noon.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: (weighing it)
dialog: A thousand dollars ... And it's on all
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course it is Howard. That's why they
dialog: call it a Marathon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.
text: David's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the
text: parking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same
text: uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T
text: shirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car
text: hold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the
text: prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all
text: look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends
text: are hanging out.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: Omigod, it's so mortifying, being
dialog: related to him. I can't believe you're
dialog: like--
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Only on my parent's side.
speaker_heading: KIMMY
dialog: I know, but you're like ... twins and
dialog: stuff.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You must be from like, the cool side of
text: the uterus.
text: A group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They
text: bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen
text: year olds. The girls freeze when they see them.
speaker_heading: KIMMY (CONT)
dialog: Omigod, omigod--here they come.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIN
dialog: Don't do anything. Just don't like--do
dialog: anything ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (cooly)
dialog: Hi Mark.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: He pauses then looks over at her. Jennifer slides sinuously
text: off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young
text: racehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole
text: parking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his
text: lackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan
text: Pathfinder like a small summit conference.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (to Jennifer)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (right back)
dialog: Hey.
dialog: Beat ...
scene_heading: MARK'S LACKEYS
dialog: (to Jennifer's lackies)
dialog: Hey.
scene_heading: JENNIFER'S LACKEYS
dialog: (back to them)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Saw you at the mall yesterday.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yeah ... Saw you too.
text: Everyone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
text: Jennifer pauses, weighing the next statement.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: My mom'll be out of town.
text: Kimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys
text: mumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost
text: on anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: (nodding faster)
dialog: Cool.
scene_heading: VARIOUS LACKEYS
dialog: Cool.
text: Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods,
text: summoning his flock.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK.
text: lt is a south-westem version of "Leave it to Beaver." The
text: uniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There
text: is a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have
text: the same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of
dialog: hell.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (VO)
dialog: ... I know, I know--He's just like so
text: FINE ... I'm still like: "Omigod."
scene_heading: INT. WAGNER HOME.
text: lt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so
text: at night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the
text: cordless phone attached to her ear.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It was amazing, Daph ... I'm like:
dialog: "Well my Mom'll be out of town." And
dialog: he's like "Well then, maybe we could--
dialog: you know ..." And I'm like "Yeah, sure."
dialog: And he's like "Well, cool."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know, he's just so smart.
dialog: (pause ...)
dialog: I don't know. Maybe that black thing I
dialog: just got.
dialog: (pause ...)
dialog: It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute.
dialog: (pause ... )
dialog: Well, "hello?" He's not coming over
dialog: here to study ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know. Well I'm jealous of you too
dialog: sometimes.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM.
text: lt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful
text: either. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside
text: with a cordless phone in his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ... He's not homeless Howard, they just
dialog: don't say where he lives.
dialog: (pause ...)
dialog: Well it's a silly question.
dialog: (pause ...)
dialog: Because nobody's homeless in
dialog: Pleasantville.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.
text: His mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her
dialog: Mercedes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ... because that's just not what it's
dialog: like.
text: She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway...
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Listen Howard--it's almost six-thirty.
dialog: I gotta go.
scene_heading: INT. WAGNER LIVING ROOM.
text: The huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the
text: room. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making
text: a B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from
text: the other direction, fiddling with her clothes.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: They hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at
text: exactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at
text: each other in shock.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Neither one moves. They clutch the remote together.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna
dialog: like be here in five minutes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon
text: starts at six thirty.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Pleasantville Marathon?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (almost reverently)
dialog: Yeah. Every episode ever.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (getting hysterical)
dialog: Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's
dialog: gonna like beeeee here!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any
speaker_heading: STEREO!
text: Jennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote. David yanks
text: back and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of
text: their hands, CRASHING onto the hardwood floor. lt smashes
text: into a million tiny pieces.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Oh my God ...
dialog: (sinking to his knees/
dialog: scooping up the remains)
dialog: Oh my God ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: David, stop stressing, you can like--
dialog: turn it on normally ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It
dialog: doesn't work without a remote.
text: David cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the
text: DOORBELL RINGS behind him.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh my God! He's here!
text: Jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa
text: and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. David
text: just stares in shock at the shattered plastic. Jennifer
text: reaches the front door and wets her lips. She fluffs her hair
text: quickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. FRONT DOOR.
text: Jennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't
text: Mark Davis on the other side. DICK VAN DYKE STANDS ACROSS THE
text: THRESHOLD IN A TV REPAIRMAN'S OUTFIT. Jennifer looks at him
text: puzzled. He steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin,
text: toolbox in hand.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: TV repair.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: TV repair?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Yeah. TV busted?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (pause ...)
dialog: Yeah ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (smiling wider)
dialog: Well here I am.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID'S POV.
text: He glances out the front door toward a weird VAN parked at
text: the curb. It says TV REPAIR on the side but looks like
text: something from a medicine show. The antenna on top resembles
text: a weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy
text: family from the 1950s, gathered around their TV set. Everyone
text: wears a smile, including the dog. The hand-painted motto
text: reads "Rob's TV Repair--WE'LL FIX YOU FOR GOOD."
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM.
text: David looks back at Dick Van Dyke who smiles at him, then
text: crosses to the living room STEPPING NIMBLY AROUND THE
text: OTTOMAN. He heads toward the TV.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (seeing the smashed remote)
dialog: Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little
dialog: disaster didn't ya fella.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah ... Sort of ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (setting down the toolbox)
dialog: We'll get you fixed up in no time.
text: He pops the top of the tool box while Jennifer and David just
text: stare. It's a strange looking box with the same happy family
text: painted on the side. Dick Van Dyke pulls out another remote.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: I know how I'd feel if mine went out.
text: Almost like losing a friend.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (tentatively)
dialog: You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Well that makes it a lucky day for both
dialog: of us, hunh?
text: Jennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You think you could do this like soon?
text: It's almost six thirty.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: What's the rush?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six
dialog: thirty.
text: At that moment there is a huge FORK OF LIGHTNING and a
text: booming CLAP OF THUNDER. It literally rattles the walls of
text: the house as Dick Van Dyke turns toward David.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Pleasantville?
text: David recoils slightly. Dick Van Dyke flashes him a smile.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: That's not the reason. I've got a date
dialog: at six thirty.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (ignoring her/
dialog: leaning closer to David)
dialog: Hey--who did Muff in take to the
dialog: masquerade ball when her date came down
dialog: with the measles?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: ... Her father.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Right. And how did she dress him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still staring)
dialog: ... Like Prince Charming.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (studying David/
dialog: nodding)
dialog: Nice ... Nice ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Um--hello? I've got like a social
dialog: emergency here.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: Remember the one where Bud lost his
dialog: cousin when he was s'posed to be
dialog: watching him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: What department store did they go to?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: McIntire's.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: McGinty's.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. McIntire's. Remember:
dialog: (sings)
dialog: "For the very best in men's attire,
dialog: Head right down to McIntire's."
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: That's right.
text: He stares at David, speechless, for a moment, then smiles
text: fondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: Say--why don't you take this remote
dialog: instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph"
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ooomph?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you
dialog: want something that'll put you right in
dialog: the show.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: We'll take it.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: He flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking
text: contraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a
text: strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash
text: Gordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while
text: Jennifer and David stare at him warily ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How much does it cost?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Oh--couldn't charge you for something
dialog: like that. It's free.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Free?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the
dialog: least I could do.
text: There is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first.
text: The house rattles for a moment then is quiet.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: Well, I better get going. Your show's
dialog: almost on, and ...
dialog: (smiling at Jennifer)
dialog: It's almost time for your date.
text: He places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and
text: smiles at them. Dick starts across the living room when he
text: suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and
text: tumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a
text: perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing
text: position. David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he
text: looks back at them and smiles.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Take care now.
text: There is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the
text: doorknob. David and Jennifer look at one another while the
text: front door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two
text: before there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his
dialog: head.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: David glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the
text: coffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he
text: reaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he
text: picks it up.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: David points the remote toward the TV set with an
text: apprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then
text: pushes one of the buttons.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: The TV set turns on. Oprah's face fills the screen as an
text: angry housewife screams at a transvestite!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hunh.
text: It ail seems normal as he pushes another button. This time
dialog: the channel changes.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (relaxing)
dialog: Great.
text: He continues to press the button, flipping through the
text: channels. Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches
dialog: for the remote.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Lemme see that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No way.
text: He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on
dialog: the Pleasantville Marathon.
text: BUD'S VOICE fills the room.
speaker_heading: BUD (OS)
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: Gee whizz, Mary Sue--why can't I borrow
dialog: your transistor radio?
speaker_heading: MARY SUE (OS)
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: I promised Betty Jane she could use it
dialog: over the weekend.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT. TV SET. "PLEASANTVILLE" (BLACK AND WHITE)
text: Bud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor
text: radio. They seem to be in the EXACT SAME POSITION as David
text: and Jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.
text: She tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Do you mind. This is like the most
dialog: important moment of my whole life.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: BUD (OS)
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: "But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a
dialog: transistor in to electric shop."
speaker_heading: MARY SUE (OS)
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: "And I told Betty Jean she could have it
dialog: for the picnic with Roy."
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (yanking at it)
dialog: God, David. Just give it to me!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (yanking it back)
dialog: Get lost!
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: YOU get lost!
scene_heading: WIDER. LIVING ROOM.
text: She tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands.
text: David pulls in the opposite direction as they POINT IT
text: DIRECTLY TOWARD THE TV.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. SPECIAL EFFECT.
text: A huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their
text: own atomic blast wave. The entire room is filled with a
text: BLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets
text: sucked into the TV.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE. LIVING ROOM.
text: It is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of
text: the picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight.
scene_heading: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (PLEASANTVILLE) DAY.
text: David and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's
text: living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing. They
text: still clutch the remote control in the exact same position
text: that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and
text: Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around
text: the room. THE WORLD HAS TURNED TO BLACK AND WHITE...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: George Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the
text: landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit
text: with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (as if to his own children)
dialog: Hi Sport, hi Muffin ... Better get a
dialog: move on, you're gonna be late for school.
text: He continues to cross through the living room whistling into
dialog: the kitchen ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (examining her black and white skin)
dialog: Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
text: He glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in
text: his hand. David frantically presses the buttons but nothing
text: happens. All at once, there is a voice behind them.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OS)
dialog: Psst! Over here.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: They whirl around to see DICK VAN DYKE'S FACE smiling at them
text: from the TV set in the comer. It's an old '50s set with a big
text: round picture tube. They run over to him as he smiles. His
text: face is the only color in the room.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you
dialog: thought I was just a fan or something.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: A miracle.
text: They stare stunned at the TV set.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: ... See, every time I thought I'd found
dialog: someone they'd turn out to disappoint me.
dialog: They'd know the early episodes, but they
dialog: wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd
dialog: know all about Muffin but they wouldn't
dialog: know about Bud ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to the TV set)
dialog: What the hell's going on!
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're
dialog: in ...
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You know ...
text: David glances around at his black and white surroundings. His
text: "mother's" voice rings out from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BETTY (OS)
text: Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're in Pleasantville?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Dream come true, hunh?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: This isn't funny! I happen to have a
dialog: very important date in like five minutes!
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Well, you don't have to worry about that
dialog: anymore.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT. TELEVISION SET. (COLOR)
text: All at once the scene on the TV changes and Dick Van Dyke's
text: picture gives way to a WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the WAGNER HOUSE.
text: Mark Davis is standing at the front door, BANGING on the
text: brass knocker. He checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a
text: moment or two, then turns and heads down the flagstone walk
dialog: never looking back.
speaker_heading: MARK DAVIS
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: ... Bitch.
scene_heading: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (BLACK AND WHITE AGAIN)
text: Jennifer flings herself at the screen, as Dick Van Dyke
text: appears all over again.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Noooooo!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You--you gotta get us out of here.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (recoiling slightly)
dialog: Why would I do that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because we don't belong!
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's
dialog: Department store" ... "Their father
dialog: dressed as Prince Charming." That was
dialog: gorgeous Bud.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My name's David.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (wailing on the floor)
dialog: Oh GOD ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (a little snippy)
dialog: You know--this is a pretty strange way
dialog: of showing your appreciation.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We
dialog: just--we want to go home now.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: But you don't know how long I've been
dialog: looking for someone like you.
text: A long face slowly descends on him.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: I'm very disappointed ...
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: In fact ... I'm starting to get a little
dialog: upset.
text: David moves toward the screen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't get upset.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (snapping back)
dialog: Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone
dialog: for years ... You pour your heart into
dialog: it ... This is a privilege you know.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I don't think I better talk about this
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where are you going ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: I don't think we should discuss this
dialog: until I'm a little bit more composed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: WAIT A MINUTE!!
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (turning his back)
dialog: Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so
dialog: emotional ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: COME BACK!!!
text: Dick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as
text: the screen goes completely BLACK. It cuts out entirely as
text: Jennifer and David just stare. David grabs the remote and
text: starts rapidly pushing buttons.
dialog: Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (dropping the gizmo)
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What's going to happen?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know ... It's not possible ...
dialog: (looking at her)
dialog: Is it possible?
speaker_heading: BETTY (OS)
dialog: Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is
dialog: getting cold.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It can't be possible.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: Betty (their "mother") sticks her head into the living room
text: wearing her black and white apron. She has a great big
text: Pepsodent smile.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, come on kids. You're not going off
dialog: to school without a hot breakfast inside
dialog: you ...
text: They just stare at her.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: Forward march.
text: They exchange a strange little glance then slowly rise to
text: their feet. Jennifer waits for David who forces a smile then
text: starts toward the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue.
dialog: It's so flattering.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (dazed)
dialog: Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN.
text: David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they
text: suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them:
scene_heading: THEIR POV. PARKER KITCHEN.
text: Every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table.
text: There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs.
text: Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham.
text: The table literally sags under the weight of the food. George
text: Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (once again)
dialog: Morning kids. Better get a move on or
dialog: you're going to be late for school.
text: They nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright
text: sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle
text: symphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare
text: straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the
dialog: heap.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: I don't believe this.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Neither do I.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Well, c'mon. Dig in.
text: David and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two
text: heaping plates at their places. Neither one moves.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to Jennifer)
dialog: I put blueberries in them just the way
dialog: you like.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to
dialog: start your day with a nice big breakfast.
text: She takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the
text: chair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: (oppressively chipper)
dialog: Here. Why don't you have some waffle
dialog: cakes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And there's sausage and eggs and some
dialog: good crisp bacon ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... And a ham steak.
text: Betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge
text: slab of butter.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: ... And of course, a nice big bowl of
dialog: oatmeal.
text: Jennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who
text: looks at her expectantly. She glances at David who just looks
text: stunned. Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a
text: forkful of the oozing mess ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FULL SHOT. PAT BOONE.
text: He stands facing the CAMERA in an actual Kinescope from 1958.
text: The backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the
text: background singers are all white debutantes. He wears a
text: letterman's sweater and button down shirt ...
speaker_heading: PAT BOONE
dialog: "... Tooty fruity--oh rooty. Tooty Fruity
dialog: ... Oh rooty."
text: He CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's
text: nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone). It becomes a slow and
text: lilting melody ...
speaker_heading: PAT BOONE (CONT)
dialog: "... Tooty fruity--oh rooty ..."
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS. PLEASANTVILLE.
text: The MUSIC CONTINUES as the CAMERA CUTS TO image after image
text: of this strange "Utopia." The effect is a weird, sanitizied
text: version of MTV--as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video.
text: There are men tipping their hats and women walking their
text: dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen.
speaker_heading: PAT BOONE (VO)
dialog: (slowly ...)
dialog: "... A wap bop a loo bop--a wap barn boom."
text: Pruned hedges. Twin beds. BIG houses. The CAMERA CRANES DOWN
text: in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find David
text: and Jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just take deep breaths.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: All that animal fat. I feel it in my
dialog: pores or something.
text: Jennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from
text: side to side--totally absorbed.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: I still don't see why we're doing this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're supposed to be in school.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: We're supposed to be at home David! We're
dialog: supposed to be in color!
dialog: (wailing)
dialog: Oh God ...
text: A man calls out from across the street.
speaker_heading: MR. SIMPSON
dialog: Hello Bud.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello Mr. Simpson.
speaker_heading: MR. SIMPSON
dialog: Hear your Dad got a new car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Owns the hardware store.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know
dialog: what's going on but you'd better fix it!
dialog: I had a date with Mark Davis and I even
dialog: bought new UNDERWEAR!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We just gotta play along for a little
text: while ... till that guy shows up again.
dialog: Then I'll talk to him and ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Play along?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and
dialog: you're ... um--Mary Sue.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (ripping the barette from her hair)
dialog: No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't
dialog: dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell
dialog: not going to do it for you!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck
text: until he comes back.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: To who?
text: Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror
text: starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming
text: SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the
dialog: block.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come
text: flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN)
text: They work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of
text: the ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing
text: across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response"
text: anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a
dialog: tree.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: C'mere, kitty ...
text: He emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the
text: tree. Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by
text: them, petting it gently as he goes.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like
dialog: "Nerdville".
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: I always knew you'd pay a price for
dialog: this. I knew you couldn't be hopelessly
dialog: geekridden for this long without
dialog: suffering some like, really tragic
dialog: consequences.
dialog: (voice wavering)
dialog: ... But it's just not fair. I mean--I'm
dialog: starting to get really--popular. Debbi
dialog: Russell transferred to another school
dialog: and my skin's been great since March and
text: Mark Davis is starting to come around
dialog: and ...
speaker_heading: BOY'S VOICE (OS)
dialog: Hello Mary Sue.
text: Jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old
text: driving by in his convertible. He is extremely handsome with
text: Jack Armstrong features and a Letterman's sweater. Despite
text: her crisis, Jennifer's jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl.
text: Biff Martin flashes a huge Pepsodent smile. The guy is a
dialog: "dreamboat".
speaker_heading: BIFF (CONT)
dialog: What's all the commotion? Where's the
dialog: cat?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Um ... It's ...
text: Biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck, with the
text: kitty in his arms.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Ah, right ...
dialog: (smiling at her again)
dialog: Well--guess I'll see ya later Mary Sue.
text: He takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his
text: really keen convertible. Jennifer gapes as he disappears
text: around the corner.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball
dialog: team.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (still gaping)
dialog: Does he--you know--like "me"?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: As a matter of fact he does.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (flicking her hair)
dialog: Hunh.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PLEASANTVILLE HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.
text: Streams of impeccably kept youngsters file through the double
text: doors. All cheery and very pleasant looking. It looks like a
dialog: Leni Riefenstahl movie.
scene_heading: ANGLE. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.
text: David stands beside Jennifer looking at the entrance to the
text: school. Three girls huddle together by the front steps.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Those are my friends.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (staring at them)
dialog: Can we do any better?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: LISA ANNE
dialog: (seeing her)
dialog: Mary Sue. You're gonna be late for
dialog: Geography.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Okay ...
text: She flicks her hair back--cops a first day of school
text: attitude, and heads across the street like she owns the
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER ...
text: It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower
text: Administration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve
text: button down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned
text: to the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at the
text: blackboard.
scene_heading: ANGLE. FRONT OF THE ROOM. TEACHER.
text: Miss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in
text: her hand. She indicates a diagram that spans the length of
text: the blackboard.
speaker_heading: MISS PETERS
dialog: Last week Class, we discussed the
dialog: geography of Main Street. This week,
dialog: we're going to be talking about Elm
dialog: Street. Can anyone tell me one of the
dialog: differences between Elm Street and Main
dialog: Street?
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Tommy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It's not as long?
text: Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod.
speaker_heading: MISS PETERS
dialog: That's right, Tommy. It's not as long.
dialog: Also, it only has houses. So the
dialog: geography of Main Street is different
dialog: than the geography of Elm Street.
scene_heading: ANGLE. JENNIFER.
text: She glances around at several students who seem to be nodding
text: in agreement. All at once, she thrusts her hand into the air.
speaker_heading: MISS PETERS
dialog: Mary Sue.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What's outside of Pleasantville?
text: The teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her
text: face. She looks vaguely troubled.
speaker_heading: MISS PETERS
dialog: What?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't understand ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Outside of Pleasantville ... What's at
dialog: the end of Main Street?
text: The class lets out a knowing groan--as if to say "Oh. We get
dialog: it now. Boy what a stupid question." Miss Peters gives a kind
text: but condescending look.
speaker_heading: MISS PETERS
dialog: Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer
text: to that. The end of Main Street is just
text: the beginning again.
text: Miss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and
text: down. Jennifer stares straight ahead, dumbfounded ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY.
text: There are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the Gym.
text: Each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks
text: with a "PLEASANTVILLE" jersey.
scene_heading: SHOT. DAVID.
text: He stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his
text: hand. (Not exactly an athletic image.) David lets go of a
text: jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net. He looks
text: a little surprised.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wow.
text: He stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David
text: retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it
text: up blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING
text: NOTHING BUT NET.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT. OTHER SIDE OF THE GYM.
text: Ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the
text: hoop. ALL OF THE SHOTS SAIL THROUGH THE HOOP, NONE EVEN
text: NICKING THE RIM. The boys retrieve their shots as the coach
text: claps his hands.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: That's it men. Keep it up. Big game
dialog: tomorrow.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely.
text: David flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces
text: off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as
text: smoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.
speaker_heading: BIFF (OS)
dialog: Bud ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: Biff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the
dialog: other side of the Gym. He is a classic All American Hero--
text: somewhere between 4-H club member and a future astronaut.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (a little nervous)
dialog: Hi ya Bud.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Hi ya Biff.
text: He fidgets nervously for a moment looking down.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Well ... If I was to ask your sister ...
dialog: What I mean is, if I was to go up to
dialog: Mary Sue ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh God! Are we in that episode?
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You want to ask her out tonight, right?
dialog: And then you want to give her your
dialog: school pin ...
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Yeah ... How'd you know?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Lucky guess.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real
dialog: good time for that right now ...
text: Biff's expression falls. He stands crushed in front of David.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a
dialog: little "different" lately ...
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: She won't go out with me?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn't say that. It's just that right
dialog: now ...
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't
dialog: go out with me ...
text: All at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and
text: hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of
text: revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE. GYM.
text: Play comes to a halt. ALL THE PLAYERS TURN AND STARE,
text: DUMBSTRUCK AT THE SIGHT OF A MISSED SHOT.
scene_heading: SHOT. DAVID.
text: He retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff.
text: David pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other
text: side of the gym.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Look, I'm sure we'll work something out.
dialog: I'll talk to her or something.
text: Biff looks at him, troubled.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Honest. It'll be fine.
text: Biff nods, a little confused, as David pats him on the back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. LATER ...
text: David stands off to the side with his sister, while class
text: pours out around them.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If
dialog: you don't go out with this guy we could
dialog: throw their whole universe out of whack.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It's too weird David. This place is
dialog: giving me the creeps. Did you know all
dialog: the books are blank?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I looked in the library. They got covers
text: with nothing inside them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What were you doing in a library?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I got lost.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh here ... look at this!
text: She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches.
text: Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire.
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: JENNIFER!
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Just watch. You know why those guys just
dialog: get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing
dialog: burns around here, that's why! They
dialog: don't need any firemen ...
text: Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jen, listen ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (trembling)
dialog: I like--really need a cigarette, too.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (putting his arm around her)
dialog: I'll get us out of here. I really will.
dialog: But if we don't play along we could
dialog: alter their whole existence. We may
dialog: never get home.
text: She looks over at him, slowly.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You really think anybody's gonna, like,
dialog: notice if I don't have a chocolate malt
dialog: with this guy.
text: At that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering
text: around the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of
text: wind-up toys.
speaker_heading: PEGGY JANE
dialog: (high-pitched--rapid fire)
dialog: You won't believe what we just heard.
speaker_heading: LISA ANNE
dialog: Biff Martin's going to ask you out.
speaker_heading: BETTY JEAN
dialog: And that's not all ...
speaker_heading: PEGGY JANE
dialog: No, that's not all ...
scene_heading: ALL THREE TOGETHER
dialog: He's going to give you his pin!
text: They explode in a torrent of TITTERS all over again. Jennifer
text: looks over at David.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKER HOUSE. DUSK.
text: A lone streetlamp glows in the foreground. Jennifer's voice
dialog: plays OS.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You sure I'm supposed to wear this?
scene_heading: INT. MARY SUE'S ROOM.
text: Jennifer emerges from the closet in a mohair sweater and a
text: poodle skirt. Under the sweater she wears a 1950's "bullet
text: bra" that turn her breasts into lethal weapons.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (looking in the mirror)
dialog: I could like kill a guy with these
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's in your closet.

dialog: (examining her profile)
dialog: I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He won't notice anyway.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They don't notice that kind of thing.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: So what's the point?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jen please ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: He-llo? I've got like three pounds of
dialog: underwire here ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late
dialog: for work.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SODA SHOP. DUSK.
text: The flashing neon ice cream cone looks good enough to drink.
text: Underneath it, the swirling script spells "SODA SHOP". Johnny
text: Mathis drifts out into the evening air ...
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: David comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get
text: his breath. He adjusts a little soda jerk's hat, then plunges
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP.
text: Mr. Johnson, the owner and proprietor is wiping down the
text: counter. He is a "pleasant" looking man, in his early forties
text: wearing a white apron and black glasses. The strains of
text: "MISTY" get louder as Bud lets the screen door slam behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Bud?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry ... I had to help my folks and
dialog: then I couldn't find my hat ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Oh.
text: He stops wiping for a moment, holding the towel in his hand.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: I didn't know what to do.
text: He stares at the rag a little troubled.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Well--I always wipe down the counter and
dialog: then you set out the napkins and glasses
dialog: and then I make the french fries ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Yeah ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
text: He looks down at the towel clearly disturbed. David pauses
text: for a moment then starts toward him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He crosses to Mr. Johnson who has polished one section of the
text: counter right down to the wood. David takes the towel out of
text: his hand and folds it neatly in front of him.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (gently)
dialog: You know, if this ever happens again,
dialog: you can make the fries even if I haven't
text: put out the napkins yet.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: I'm so glad you're here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I understand.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Biff's convertible rolls up to the curb with Pat Boone
text: playing on the radio. He runs a comb through his short blonde
text: hair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and
text: heading up the walk. Biff rings the doorbell and, a moment
text: later, Jennifer's silhouette appears in the doorway ...
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Oh. Mary Sue ...
scene_heading: EXT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.
text: The place is really hopping now. All the spots in the parking
text: lot are filled with vintage "jalopies" and several patrons
text: are streaming through the door. The SAME JOHNNY MATHIS SONG
text: is still PLAYING on the juke box, and the neon ice cream soda
text: sign blinks against the sky.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP.
text: David is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to
text: keep up with the load. Several clean cut teenagers pepper him
text: with orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots. It's
text: clear he isn't used to this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (frazzled)
dialog: Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two
dialog: orders of fries and a split?
speaker_heading: TEEN AGE GIRL
dialog: Peppermint soda, two chocolate shakes,
dialog: order of fries, and we'll split it.
text: David nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow. He
text: scoops some ice cream into the metal blender as Mr. Johnson
text: comes up beside him.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: There aren't any cheeseburgers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (turning)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Well, usually I put out the burger and
dialog: then you finish with the lettuce ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen to me!
text: Mr. Johnson recoils slightly.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Do you have the lettuce?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: ... Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Have you cooked the burgers?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well you can just put on the lettuce,
dialog: finish the burger and pretend it was me
dialog: doing it all along.
text: Mr. Johnson stares at him.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Really. It's fine.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE.
text: The screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a
text: Letterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays
text: through, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her
text: "girlfriends" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a
text: table, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing
text: against him as she goes.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and
text: apprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda
text: spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all
text: over his chest.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT. TABLE.
text: Biff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome
text: devotion of a labrador retriever. He looks like a cross
text: between Troy Donahue and a mannequin.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (haltingly)
dialog: I sure am glad you said you'd come out
dialog: with me tonight Mary Sue.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (full blown "Mary Sue")
dialog: Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad
dialog: you asked me.
text: He guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: I don't know if I ever said this to you
dialog: before, but, well ... I think you're
dialog: just about the keenest girl in the whole
dialog: school ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Really Biff? The keenest?
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Oh yeah.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (all sarcasm)
dialog: Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
speaker_heading: DAVID (OS)
dialog: What can I get you two?
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: He stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper
text: and a pencil. Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost
text: bursts out laughing. He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty
text: angle with large white apron tied around his neck.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my
text: usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
text: More goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the
text: same dopey countenance.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a
text: salad and an Evian Water.
text: He shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: Cheeseburger it is.
scene_heading: ANGLE. FOLLOWING DAVID.
text: He glowers at her all the way back to the counter. David
text: posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an
text: eye on the table the entire time ...
scene_heading: RESUME. TABLE.
text: Biff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look
text: on his face. His hands are properly folded in front of him.
dialog: She's still trying to do her best "Mary Sue."
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: See the whole time we were in civics
dialog: together, I really wanted to sit next to
dialog: you--but you were always sitting between
dialog: Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne.
text: There is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: BIFF (CONT)
dialog: ... And you always seemed so smart and
dialog: everything. Like that report you did on
dialog: "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know
dialog: what I'd talk to you about.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well, sometimes talking's over-rated.
dialog: Don't you think?
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Hunh?
dialog: (goony laugh)
dialog: Oh, right ...
text: He still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two
text: then glances down at the table top. There is a momentary
text: break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "MISTY" starts up all
dialog: over again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself.
speaker_heading: BIFF (CONT)
dialog: So I know I haven't been steady with
dialog: anybody, but I just don't want to rush
dialog: it. You don't want to make a mistake
dialog: with something that important.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh, gosh no.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: I mean, there's kids that are even
dialog: holding hands already but I figure
dialog: there's plenty of time for that kind of
dialog: thing later on. Don't you?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh you bet.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Will you excuse me for a sec?
text: Jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister
text: practically stumbles through the bathroom door.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM.
text: Of course there aren't any toilets. Jennifer gropes her way
text: to the sink and leans against the counter.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Jesus Chirist ...
text: She turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a
text: dumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a
text: moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICES
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: "Did he give it to you ... Did he give
dialog: it to you ... I bet he gave it to her
dialog: ... Did he give it to you?"
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (straight ahead)
dialog: I don't think he knows how.
text: They TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It
text: sounds like an aviary.
speaker_heading: LISA ANNE
dialog: I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's
dialog: Lane.
speaker_heading: PEGGY JANE
dialog: I bet he is. I bet he is.
speaker_heading: BETTY JEAN
dialog: I bet he's even gonna hold her hand!
text: They TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP.
text: David is standing beside their table as she retums from the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (chipper)
text: Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry
dialog: cokes.
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: If you need anything, I'll be right over
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (Mary Sue)
dialog: Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly
dialog: need when we have each other?
text: She flashes him a "sweet" smile then reaches out and TOUCHES
text: BIFF'S HAND. Both boys jump slightly as Jennifer gives her
text: brother a venomous grin then suddenly waves "bye bye." David
text: just stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the
text: Soda fountain.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (befuddled)
dialog: Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over
dialog: and sit next to you in civics but ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You want to get out of here?
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You wanna get out of here? You wanna
dialog: leave?
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (confused)
dialog: But where would we go?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: ... Lover's Lane.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (swallow)
dialog: Lover's Lane!
text: There is an audible GASP from the booth behind them. Jennifer
text: ignores it.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. BIFF.
text: He just stares at her with his mouth open ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: Jennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: C'mon. Let's go.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT. SODA FOUNTAIN.
text: David is in the middle of making a hot fudge sundae when he
text: sees Jennifer leading Biff by the hand into the parking lot.
text: Everyone at the counter is enjoying their dessert, when David
text: lets out a blood curdling scream.
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: NOOOOOO!
text: He vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door.
text: Everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance ...
scene_heading: EXT. SODA SHOP.
text: Biff's car is just pulling onto the street when David sprints
text: into the parking lot. He takes off after the car, sprinting
text: down the street.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T
text: EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO
scene_heading: DOESN'T EXIST!
text: The tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a
text: jog and then finally a walk. He pauses, winded, in the
text: street, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on
text: his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (to God)
dialog: Thanks a lot.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.
text: It is a beautiful tree-lined pond with a lush willow tree in
text: the foreground. The moonlight glistens silver across the
text: water. Several cars are parked in a row with their occupants
text: HOLDING HANDS. Biff's convertible is parked at the end.
scene_heading: SHOT. BIFF'S CAR.
text: He sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead. Jennifer
text: is draped languidly across the seat beside him, making the
text: most of her mohair sweater. She stares at Biff in a not-so-
text: Pleasantville-kind-of-way. He glances over at her and
text: swallows.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Sure is pretty.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (staring at him)
dialog: Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think
dialog: you'd want to come here until we'd been
text: pinned for a little while.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you
dialog: want to.
text: She leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top
text: of the seat. Her tits point toward the sky.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: (breathy)
dialog: Or maybe I should just "pin" you.
text: He looks over at her a little confused, then breaks into his
text: goony laugh.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Oh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you
dialog: possibly pin me?
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. BIFF.
text: He is still guffawing when he looks over at Jennifer and
text: suddenly freezes. Biff's eyes widen ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: David comes sprinting up to the porch, then doubles over
text: catching his breath. He clings onto the porch swing when the
text: door opens behind him.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Bud?
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: His "mother" and "father" come out onto the porch. David
text: catches his breath then forces a smile.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Son, what's wrong?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Have you seen Mary Sue?
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: Why no. She's still on her date with
dialog: Biff ... is something the matter?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still panting a little)
dialog: No, I ... I was just ... worried about
dialog: her.
text: His mother and father exchange a "knowing" look. George rests
text: a hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (oppressively paternal)
dialog: Bud, your sister's a little older now
dialog: and she's naturally going to start going
dialog: out with boys.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... In fact pretty soon--she's even
dialog: going to get married and make someone a
dialog: good little home-maker like your mother
dialog: here.
dialog: (smiles at Betty/
dialog: inside joke)
dialog: That's IF she can learn to bake.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, George ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: But your sister is a fine young woman
dialog: and she would never do anything for us
dialog: to be concerned about.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.
text: The low gutteral MOANS of two coupling animals drifts out
text: over the evening air. It is raw and primitive and desperate.
text: The CAMERA begins to TRACK behind all the other cars--their
text: occupants primly holding hands in a tender sillouhette. It
text: finally COMES TO REST on a convertible at the end, with a
text: girl's leg sticking out the window.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: A Letterman's sweater hangs over the door. The windshield is
text: completely fogged. Jennifer's sweater is draped over the
text: backseat. The car is rocking.
scene_heading: INT. CAR.
text: They are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair. Biff
text: pulls back for a moment, GASPING for air. His face is covered
text: with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye. He's
text: stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings
text: desperately to the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (some terror)
dialog: I think I better go home now Mary Sue ...
text: She holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: ... Why?
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (more terror)
dialog: I think ... I might be ill ...
text: He glances down at his lap a little confused.
speaker_heading: BIFF (CONT)
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: I think something's happening to me.
text: He looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer. She reaches up
text: and grabs a handful of his hair.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: It is?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Trust me ...
text: He looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down,
text: and OUT OF FRAME ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: A single light is burning in the kitchen window.
speaker_heading: BETTY (OS)
dialog: Do you want some more cookies?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN.
text: David is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his
text: face. There are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs
text: all over the table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sick)
dialog: Oh no ... I'm fine.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm fine.
text: There is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Now who could that be.
text: FOLLOWING DAVID.
text: He crosses into the foyer ahead of his "parents." David
text: swings open the door revealing Mr. Johnson, standing on the
dialog: porch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh hi!
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Hi there. You took off so quick. I
dialog: wasn't sure if you were okay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ...
dialog: Had to get home early.
text: Mr. Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a CONFIDENTIAL tone
text: of voice.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Bud ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: You know how when we close up, I close
dialog: the register, then you lower the shades,
text: then I turn out the lights, then we both
dialog: lock the doors.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (proud)
dialog: Well you weren't around this time so I
dialog: did the whole thing myself.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: Mr. Johnson has a strange look of "manly pride" on his face.
text: His shoulders square back. His chest puffs out a little.
text: There is a sudden sparkle in his eye.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (more confidential)
dialog: Not only that, I didn't even do it in
dialog: the same order. First I lowered the
dialog: shades, then I closed the register.
text: He looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: Oh, hello Betty.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Hello Bill.
text: Neither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks
text: on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr. Johnson and
text: his new found virility.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ...
dialog: really appreciate it.
text: He turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's
text: convertible pulls up at the curb.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. CLOSE UP. JENNIFER.
text: She looks sweetly over at the driver's side of the car (OUT
speaker_heading: OF FRAME).
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really
dialog: wonderful time.
scene_heading: ANGLE. BIFF. OTHER SIDE OF CAR.
text: He sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his
text: face. Biff stares stunned at Jennifer, like he just got hit
text: with a couple of thousand volts.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: ... Me too.
text: She leans over and kisses him on the cheek ... Then she bites
text: his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff
text: smiles back.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR.
text: She climbs out and shuts the door. Jennifer nods to Mr.
text: Johnson as she heads up the walk.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Hello Mr. Johnson.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Oh, hello Mary Sue.
text: She is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch.
text: David grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (urgent whisper)
dialog: What did you do to him?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: Nothing.
text: She starts up the staircase. David follows her and the CAMERA
text: follows them both.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean "nothing?" That's not
dialog: nothing. That's ...
text: She reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Relax "Bud." We had a really nice time.
speaker_heading: (mock YAWN)
dialog: ... Now I'm really tired and we gotta
dialog: get up early for school in the morning
dialog: so ...
text: She flashes her brother an evil grin.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: 'Night.
text: She shuts the door softly in his face. David stairs at the
text: gray wood in front of him.
scene_heading: EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.
text: Biff pulls up at an intersection with the same dazed look in
text: his eye. The car rumbles at the stoplight for a moment or
text: two, before he glances over to his right.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. BIFF.
text: The stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement:
scene_heading: BIFF'S POV. ROSE.
text: There, against a gray picket fence, on a black and white
text: street in a black and white neighborhood, A SINGLE RED ROSE
text: IS BLOOMING.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE. MORNING
text: It would be a stunning vista if it wasn't in black and white.
text: The church steeple gleams in the sunlight. The perfect little
text: houses look like a row of pretty toys ...
scene_heading: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. DAY.
text: David sits parked in front of the TV furtively turning
text: through the channels. He flips the dial frantically. No sign
dialog: of Dick Van Dyke.
speaker_heading: BETTY (OS)
dialog: Bud. It's 7:30 in the morning. Are you
dialog: watching television?
text: He gives her a sheepish grin and sighs ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL GYM. DAY.
text: It is the same configuration as earlier. Everyone wears their
dialog: Pleasantville "Lions" jerseys, white sneakers and black
text: socks. David enters the Gym a little groggy. He hasn't had
dialog: much sleep.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: He looks up and stops. David cocks his head to the side,
text: staring across the gym.
scene_heading: HIS POV. BIFF AND OTHER BOYS.
text: They are huddled at the far end, each holding a basketball
text: under his arm. Biff is in the center of the group, animatedly
text: describing something that is holding their RAPT ATTENTION.
scene_heading: WIDER ANGLE. INCLUDING DAVID.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Oh no ...
text: Biff continues his story while they stare at him with their
text: mouths open. The Coach blows his whistle.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Come on men. Let's go. Big game next
dialog: week.
text: The huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander
text: toward the hoop. Ten shots go up at once but NOT ONE COMES
text: EVEN CLOSE. Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge
text: of the backboard. One slams into the side of the gym.
text: Everyone stares in disbelief.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh my God ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR. DAY.
text: David stands face to face with his sister in mid
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay.
dialog: They're like not good at basketball
dialog: anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You don't understand. You're messing
text: with their UNIVERSE.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well maybe it needs to be messed with.
dialog: Did that ever like--occur to you?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, they don't want to be like
dialog: this, it's just that nobody ever helped
dialog: them before.
speaker_heading: PEGGY JANE
dialog: (walking past)
dialog: "MS". How you doin'?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Kewl "PJ". How you doin'?
speaker_heading: PEGGY JANE

dialog: "Kewl."
text: Jennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You have no right to do this.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well if I don't who will?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They're happy like this.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt
text: and a sweater set.
dialog: (pause ...)
dialog: You like all this don't you?
text: David recoils slightly.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: I mean, you don't think it's just like
dialog: dorky or funny or something ... you
dialog: really like it.
dialog: (shudders)
dialog: Oh God! I am just so personally
dialog: horrified right now ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just don't think we have the right
dialog: to ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: David, let me tell you something. These
dialog: people don't want to be geeks. They want
dialog: to be "attractive." They've got a lot of
dialog: potential, they just don't know any
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They don't have that kind of potential.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
text: Jennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked
text: in an intimate conversation. The girl wears bobby socks and
text: the boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is

text: whisper--their faces inches apart. All at once the girt gets
text: shy and glances away. She blows a big bubble with her gum,
text: but the BUBBLE IS BRIGHT PINK IN AN OTHERWISE GRAY FRAME.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Wow. What kind of gum is that?
scene_heading: CLOSE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.
text: He looks over in shock as she sucks the BRIGHTLY COLORED
text: BUBBLE GUM back into her mouth. Jennifer flicks her hair.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the
text: flagpole.
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.
text: It is the exact same shot as before: The CAMERA STARTS ITS
text: LONG SLOW TRACK behind the vehicles, except this time ALL OF
text: THEM ARE ROCKING. Various limbs and articles of clothing hang
text: out the open windows. MOANS of pleasure waft out over Lover's
text: Lane as the pond glistens in the distance ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.
dialog: It is a typical '50s family practice right out of Norman
text: Rockwell. There is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter
text: and a jar of lollipops beside them. Lisa Anne (Mary Sue's
text: best friend) is being examined by Dr. Henderson. Her mother
text: sits at her side.
speaker_heading: DR. HENDERSON
dialog: Let me see it again.
text: Lisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE.
text: Everything else in the frame is Black and White, but her
text: tongue literally gleams with color.
speaker_heading: DR. HENDERSON (CONT)
dialog: (examining it)
dialog: Well ... I don't think it's anything to
dialog: worry about ... It'll probably just
text: clear up by itself.
dialog: (to Lisa Anne)
dialog: Cut down on greasy foods and chocolate.
dialog: No french fries, that kind of thing.
dialog: (aside/
dialog: to the Mother)
dialog: It's just a "teenage" thing.
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.
text: It is really rocking now. More cars are lined up along the

scene_heading: FRUITY (BY LITTLE RICHARD) PLAYS OS:
speaker_heading: LIL RICHARD (VO)

scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS. (MONTAGE)
scene_heading: PARKER LIVING ROOM.

scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM (MUSIC CONT ...)
text: The Pleasantville Lions lose a game late in the second half.
text: The scoreboard reads 84 to 16 ...
scene_heading: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)
text: David examines the back of the TV set ...
scene_heading: INT. FURNITURE STORE. (MUSIC CONT...)
text: A large group of customers is huddled in a circle, staring at
text: an item on the display floor, like it is the monolith in
text: "2001". They seem both confused and absolutely mesmerized as
text: the CAMERA PUSHES IN TO REVEAL: a double bed ...
scene_heading: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)
text: David sits on the floor with a weird look of resignation as a
text: Brillcream commercial plays in front of him ...
speaker_heading: LIL RICHARD (OS)
dialog: "... A wop bop a loo bop--a wop bam
dialog: boom!"
scene_heading: SODA SHOP. NIGHT. ON DAVID.
text: He heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but
text: he's clearly disconcerted. David stops and stares at A BRIGHT
text: RED HOT ROD parked at the front door of the restaurant. He
text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SODA SHOP.
text: The place has been transformed. What was cheery and benign a
dialog: couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. The
text: letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. The
text: Pat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and
text: Roll. There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air.
text: Somebody has played the flip side.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young
text: couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and
text: hands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are
text: FLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return
text: to normal. David shakes his head.
text: FOLLOWING HIM.
text: He crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad
text: of paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND
scene_heading: THE ROOM: The JUKE BOX ... The COKE SIGN .. THE NAUGAHIDE
text: STOOLS ... David crosses to one of the booths where his
text: sister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What'll it be?
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (still chipper as ever)
dialog: Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the
text: usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
text: Bud has already written it down. He glances over at his
dialog: sister.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Me too. Sounds swell.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: Really? It seems so fattening.
text: Before she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind
text: the counter. Bud posts the order and turns to Mr. Johnson.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
text: Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (staring straight ahead)
dialog: There aren't any cheeseburgers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Look. I thought we talked about this, I
dialog: thought we said ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Oh--what's the point, Bud?
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: Mr. Johnson. looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness
text: in his eyes. David grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: C'mere.
text: He pulls him along the counter toward a little office
text: storeroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. STOREROOM.
text: It is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a
text: small table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a
text: happy family motoring in their Rambler.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What did you say?
text: Mr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Well ... I'm not sure I see the point
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you talking about! You make
dialog: hamburgers! That is the point!
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: No I know ... I know I do ...
text: (he pauses, then looks up)
dialog: But it's always the same, you know?
dialog: Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the
dialog: cheese ... It never changes. It never
dialog: gets any better or worse ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just listen to me ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (not hearing him)
dialog: ... Like the other night, when I closed
dialog: up by myself. That was different ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Forget about that!
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Oh ... Okay.
dialog: (beat/
dialog: lower)
dialog: ... But I really liked it.
text: Bud takes a deep breath. He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries
text: to speak softly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look, you can't always like what you do.
dialog: Sometimes you just do it because it's
dialog: your job. And even if you don't like it,
dialog: you just gotta do it anyway.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: So they can have their hamburgers!
text: This sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (like a secret)
dialog: You know what I really like?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (warily)
dialog: ... What's that?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Christmastime.
text: David rolls his eyes. Mr. Johnson leans closer, speaking
text: furtively.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: See every year on Dec 3, I get to paint
text: the Christmas decorations in the window.
dialog: And every year, I get to paint a
dialog: different thing ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: One year it's the North Pole. The next
dialog: I do Santa's workshop. Here I'll show
dialog: you.
text: He pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens
dialog: it for David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Wow ... That's pretty good ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: But this morning I was thinking about
dialog: it and I realized that I looked forward
dialog: to it all year. And then I thought "Gee.
dialog: That seems awfully silly. That seems
dialog: like an awfully long time to be waiting
dialog: for just one moment, don't you think?"
text: David looks at him speechless.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: Well don't you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think you should try not to think
dialog: about this anymore.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Besides being the barbershop, it is the bastion of all male
text: life in Pleasantville. Bud and Mary Sue's "father" (George)
text: sits in one of the chairs. "Big Bob" McGee, owner of the
text: drugstore, supermarket and Chevy dealership sits in the
text: other. He has a crew cut that's getting shorter.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Have they ever lost before?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Basketball? No they sure haven't.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Just feels "wrong", that's all.
text: There are several murmurs.
speaker_heading: THIRD PATRON
dialog: Maybe that's where they get that saying,
dialog: "can't win 'em all."
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They
dialog: do have that saying.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've
dialog: always won 'em all.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Well, yeah. That's true too.
text: More murmurs, Everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DAY.
text: The women's bridge club has assembled in the Parker kitchen
text: like it does every Wednesday afternoon. Four women are seated
text: around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix
text: between them. Betty is sifting next to Marge Jenkins, the
text: woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (dealing the cards)
dialog: ... He said it would clear up on its
dialog: own if she just stayed away from fried
dialog: foods and sweets ...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well that makes sense.
speaker_heading: MARGE
text: Except it's spread to her lips now too.
dialog: Oh, I don't know.
speaker_heading: MARY
speaker_heading: (a THIRD WOMAN)
dialog: And you say it's just "red?"
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well--like red, only ... "redder."
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like
dialog: the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was
dialog: going by it the other day and it looked
dialog: green only "greener."
scene_heading: SHOT. BETTY.
text: She looks up quickly--then grabs some bridge mix.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: (lowering her voice)
dialog: Have you seen him lately? The man
dialog: doesn't look like himself. I was
dialog: getting my sewing machine fixed across
text: the street and he was sitting in the
text: window of his shop just staring.
dialog: Wasn't looking at anything in
text: particular--just staring off into space.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That is strange.
text: Betty reaches out and grabs her cards. She fans them out in
text: front of her, when her eyes go wide.
scene_heading: HER POV. BRIDGE HAND.
text: They are ALL HEARTS and all BRIGHT RED. It looks like a
text: fistfful of valentines.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. BETTY.
text: She puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath.
text: Betty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before
text: lifting them up and taking another look.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Betty, it's your bid.

speaker_heading: BETTY

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN.

text: Betty washes while Jennifer dries and it's clear who's more
text: used to this. Jennifer examines a chipped nail as she places
text: a dish in the drying rack.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Mary Sue?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yeah?
text: Betty hesitates. Rinses out a pot.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Sure.
text: She pauses for a long moment.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (turning toward her)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, you hear all these things lately.
dialog: You know--kids spending so much time up
dialog: there ...
dialog: (she looks over)
dialog: Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yeah ...

dialog: That--and ...
text: She stops herself.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No. I want to know.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (glances toward the living room/
dialog: lowers her voice)
dialog: ... Sex.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ah.
text: Betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning. A
dialog: beat goes by ...
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: What's sex?
text: Jennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at
text: her with a blank, curious expression. Jennifer hesitates.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You sure you want to know this?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Okay.
text: She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of
text: the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to
text: the kitchen counter and turns to her.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: You see Mom ...
dialog: (softer and with understanding)
dialog: When two people like each other very
dialog: much ...

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. LATER ...
text: The CAMERA PANS across the kitchen table where there is a

text: with a concerned look on her face.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You okay?
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. BETTY.
text: She nods--shaken but "fine." Betty stares long and hard at
text: the plate of chocolate chip cookies. She's far away.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes ...
dialog: (softly)
dialog: It's just that ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (gently)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETTY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PARKER BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: George crosses from the dresser to the TWO TWIN BEDS in the

text: buttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk
text: on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed. It is

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sweetie? You coming to bed?
text: There is no answer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM.

dialog: Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath
dialog: first.
scene_heading: CLOSER. BETTY.
text: She swallows once as she stares down at the tub--then reaches

text: little faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN.
text: CLOSER STILL ...
text: Betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top
text: of her robe. She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor,
text: standing naked in the middle of the bathroom. Betty glances
text: toward the mirror and then quickly glances away. She takes a
text: deep breath and steps into the tub.
scene_heading: EVEN TIGHTER. ON HER FACE ...
text: Betty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the
text: steam, and closing her eyes for a moment. She lingers like
text: that for a second or two, before settling a little lower in
text: the tub. Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. There
text: is the slight trace of a smile.
text: EXTREME CLOSE UP BETTY'S FACE.
text: Her eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently. The
text: water continues to THUNDER DOWN as she arches her back.
text: Betty's breathing seems to quicken as she opens her eyes all
dialog: over again:
scene_heading: HER POV. BATHROOM ...
text: ALL AT ONCE, EVERYTHING AROUND STARTS TO TURN FROM BLACK AND
text: WHITE TO COLOR. A BIRD OUT THE WINDOW BECOMES A RED BREASTED
scene_heading: ROBIN. THE TILE ON THE TUB TURNS OUT TO BE PURPLE. GREEN
scene_heading: TOWEL ... PINK ROBE ... BRIGHT YELLOW DAISIES ON THE PLASTIC
scene_heading: SHOWER CURTAIN.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. BETTY'S FACE.
text: She stares in amazment. Beads of sweat form on Betty's
text: forehead as the world goes to TECHNICOLOR. The THUNDERING
text: WATER POUNDS IN THE BACKGROUND, but beneath can be heard the

text: intense ... THEN SUDDENLY ...
scene_heading: EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.
text: The HUGE ELM TREE across the street suddenly BURSTS INTO

scene_heading: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

dialog: window ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh my God!
scene_heading: EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.
text: David comes racing out of the front door and down the walk. A
text: small CROWD has gathered in front of the fire. (They don't
text: seem frightened--just sort of amazed.) The street is still
text: BLACK AND WHITE but it is now bathed in a weird ORANGE LIGHT.
text: The flames leap higher and higher ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus Christ ...
text: FOLLOWING DAVID.
text: He takes off down the block, as fast as he can run. The crowd

text: his lungs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: FIRE! FIRE!
scene_heading: INT. FIRE STATION.

scene_heading: INT. BUNKROOM.
text: All the firemen are sitting around playing Gin Rummy when
text: David rushes in the front door. They can hear his voice from
text: down the hall.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (entering)
text: FIRE ... FIRE ...
text: They still don't move. All the firemen just look at him from
text: their bunks with a perplexed expression.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: CAT!!!
text: All at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets
text: and their yellow slickers. They race to the landing just
text: outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole ...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.
text: The FIRE HAS SPREAD TO AN ADJOINING TREE as the FIRE ENGINE
text: comes SCREAMING toward the house from the top of the block.
text: David sits in the front of the truck next to the Fire Chief
text: who drives the vehicle at break neck speed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Right here!
text: The Fire ENGINE screeches to a halt. The Fire Chief looks
dialog: around ...
speaker_heading: FIRE CHIEF
dialog: Where is it?
text: David shoots him a look then glances at the inferno. He
text: shakes his head and leaps from the truck.
text: FOLLOWING DAVID.
text: He races around to the back where the other firemen are
text: standing just as confused. David grabs one of the hoses and
text: begins to pull it from the truck.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Here! Grab this nozzle.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: But where's the ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just grab it!
text: He strips out about fifteen feet of hose, then grabs the

text: and positions the man right in front of the flames.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Okay! Now point this right at the
dialog: flames--like this.
text: The Fireman nods and does as he is told. David opens the
text: valve sending out a huge FLUME OF WATER.
speaker_heading: FIREMAN
dialog: Whoa!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So that's what these do.
text: A huge smile breaks out across the fireman's face--like a man
text: who has suddenly found his purpose in life. He beams from ear
text: to ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another
dialog: hose ...
speaker_heading: BOB (VO)

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: WIDER.

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I am pleased to present You with this

text: He hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into
speaker_heading: APPLAUSE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. LATER ...
text: David walks away from the center of town looking down at his

text: when a young woman comes up beside him.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE
dialog: Hi Bud ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: She is MARGARET ANNE HENDERSON, the prettiest girl in school,
text: and one of the most popular. Margaret wears a frilly polka
text: dot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure.
text: Nonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: That was sure swell ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (vaguely remembering an episode)
dialog: Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: No. I baked them for you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. You baked them for Whitey.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (low and gutteral)
dialog: No. I baked them for you.
text: All at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up
text: against him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her
text: mouth is inches away from his.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Um ... thanks.
text: David can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and
text: freshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment,
text: unable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: See ya.
text: She turns and heads around the comer, while David just
text: watches her dumbstruck.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SODA SHOP. DUSK.
text: David heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat.
text: The BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to "hip" '50s JAZZ. DAVE
text: BRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a
text: moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside.
speaker_heading: SODA SHOP.
text: The place has "morphed" even more. If it was a teenage
text: hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house
text: now. Brubeck's "TAKE FIVE" plays in the background while
text: several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths.
scene_heading: DOORWAY.
text: David walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of
text: the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz
text: on a BONGO DRUM. There are several COFFEE cups on the table.
text: Jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: I had nothing to do with that fire.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Not directly anyhow ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's fine.
text: David glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the
text: bongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at
text: him, with a weird expression of awe.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (still under her breath)
dialog: Um ... They like wanna ask you a
dialog: question ... I didn't know how to
dialog: handle it. So ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure.
text: He crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at
text: him. It's like Elvis has entered the building.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: How you doin?
speaker_heading: VARIOUS KIDS
dialog: Swell ...
text: They keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and
text: forth like they're sharing a secret. Finally ...
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: How'd you know about the fire?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: How'd you know how to put it out and
dialog: all?
text: David hesitates, weighing his words.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well--where I used to live ...
dialog: That's just what firemen did.
text: This sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: And where's that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (carefully)
text: Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
text: This sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids.
text: It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A
text: hush descends.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: What's outside of Pleasantville?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look it doesn't matter. It's not
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: What is it?
text: David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on
dialog: every word.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's really not important.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (OS)
dialog: What's outside of Pleasantville?
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING DOORWAY.
text: Margaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the
text: doorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the
text: same excitement as the others, it just means so much more.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT)
dialog: (hungry for knowledge)
dialog: C'mon. Tell us ...
text: She stares right in his eyes. She's ten feet away but might
text: as well be touching him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Well ... There are some places where
text: the road doesn't go in a circle.
dialog: There are some places where it keeps
text: on going.
text: There's an excited giggle. They lean forward.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (an exotic concept)
dialog: Keeps going ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well--it all just keeps going.
dialog: Roads ... rivers ...
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: (from the back)
dialog: Like the "Mighty Mississippi".
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ... What?
text: He moves forward extending a book. The cover reads: "THE
text: ADVENTURES OF HUCKELBERRY FINN." David opens the first page.
text: There is printing inside.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (quoting)
dialog: "It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin'
dialog: an' goin' as far you could see."
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (turning to Jennifer)
dialog: I thought the books were blank?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: They were.
text: He looks over at her.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault.
dialog: They asked me what it was about and I
dialog: like didn't remember 'cause we had it
dialog: back in tenth grade, But I told them
dialog: what I DID remember, and the next
dialog: thing I knew the pages had filled in.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The pages filled in?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: But like only up to the part about
dialog: the raft, because I didn't read any
dialog: farther.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: David flips through the book and sure enough only the first
text: chapter has print. The pages are blank after that.
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: Do you know how it ends?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: Well, yeah ... I do.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: So how does it end?
text: She has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of
text: feet away. It's silent in the soda shop.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well--see ... they're both running
dialog: away--Huck and the slave ... And ...
dialog: They go up the river ... But--in
dialog: trying to get free they sort of see
dialog: that they're free already.
text: David looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book
text: that aren't blank anymore. Rows and rows of FRESH NEW TYPE
text: materialize in front of him. He turns to the back of the
text: book, that is complete with a COLOR illustration.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: 3RD BOY
dialog: Do you know this one?
text: He shoves another book in front of David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hunh?
dialog: (looks down at the book)
dialog: Oh yeah ... Well this is great.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: See--Holden Caulfield is like this
dialog: really lonely kid...
scene_heading: EXT. PLEASANTVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY. DAY.
text: The CAMERA PANS down from the "PUBLIC LIBRARY' sign to find
text: the front door. A long line of kids waiting to check out
text: their books stretches onto the sidewalk ...
text: EXTREME WIDE SHOT. LIBRARY. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.
text: Several men from the barbershop lean against the wall next to
text: the spinning barber pole. They watch the spectacle for a
text: moment or two, as teenager after teenager exits with an
text: armful of books.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: I don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger.
text: Big Bob McGee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT)
dialog: I mean goin' up to that lake all the
dialog: time is one thing, but now they're
dialog: going to a library! I mean what's next?
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda.
dialog: That's where they oughtta be.
scene_heading: WIDER STILL.
text: From the shadows of the Town Hall, up the block, David
text: watches the stream of kids emerge with their books. They
text: cradle them in their hands like a piece of newfound
dialog: treasure ...
scene_heading: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: George sits on the edge of his Barka Lounger, across the
text: coffee table from "Big" Bob McGee. Even sitting down the man
dialog: is a looming presence. Besides owning the market, auto
text: dealership, hardware store, and gas station, he also owns the
text: insurance agency where George works. George sweats into his
dialog: collar.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Want some bridge mix?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, no thanks ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm fine--but thank you.
text: George nods as Bob takes a belt of his Martini and leans
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: George, you're probably wondering why
dialog: I asked if I could come over today ...
text: George shrugs--then nods--then shrugs ...
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: I'm sure you've noticed the same
dialog: things we all have--certain "changes"
text: going on in the town.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know what I mean by "changes"?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: "Changes."
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: "Changes."
dialog: (takes a belt of martini)
dialog: And it's not just the fire or big
dialog: stuff like that. It's little things.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did you hear about Bill Miller?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: No. What?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Wife wants him to get one of those
dialog: new beds.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: One of those ... big beds?
text: Bob nods.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
dialog: Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I really don't know.
dialog: (beat)
text: Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a
text: boxboy at the market.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ... How?
speaker_heading: BIG BOB
dialog: Said he didn't want to do it anymore.
text: Just took off his apron in the middle
dialog: of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her
text: groceries spread all over the counter
dialog: ... Took 'em four hours to sort the
dialog: whole thing out.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Holy cow.
text: Bob takes a belt of his drink ...
speaker_heading: BIG BOB
dialog: George, everyone likes you.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh well ...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause
dialog: you're a great bowler ... They respect
dialog: you ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (heartfelt)
dialog: Thank you very much.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: And it's important for them to see
dialog: someone they respect, stand up for
dialog: what's right. If you love a place,
dialog: you can't sit around and watch this
dialog: kind of thing happen to it.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No. Of course not.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (big patriarchal smile)
dialog: And that's why I want you to be on
dialog: the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (stunned/
dialog: moved)
dialog: Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Why don't you start by saying "yes,"
dialog: and then getting me one of those swell
text: pineapple kabobs.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Oh sure ... You bet.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Betty ...
text: There is no answer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
dialog: (louder this time)
dialog: BETTY ...
text: Still no answer.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
text: BETTY--BOB WANTS TO TRY ONE OF YOUR
scene_heading: GREAT HORS D'OEUVRES ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: George turns around to see David, standing on the landing,
text: listening to the entire conversation. Their eyes lock for a
dialog: moment ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll get her.
text: He moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN.
text: David gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across
dialog: the room to see:
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE.
text: Betty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the
text: window. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (approaching slowly)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: She doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on
text: her shoulder.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Are you alright?
text: Betty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED
text: COMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED.
text: SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole
text: thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the
text: tear stains on either side of her face.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (fighting tears)
dialog: What am I going to do?
text: David moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's okay. It's alright.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (trembling)
dialog: I can't go out there. How can I go out
dialog: there?
text: She looks right up at David.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: Look at me ...
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: He stares at her for a second. Big green eyes full of fear
text: and confusion. David pushes a reassuring smile.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Have you got any make up?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: In my handbag.
text: He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits
text: Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for
text: her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.
text: He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude,
text: Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY
text: powder puff.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: It is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup,
text: she returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones
text: disappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a
text: DARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER.
text: He works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back.
text: All at once, David seems to wince:
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE.
text: The life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone
text: from three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the
text: fictional version of herself all over again.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (off his reaction)
dialog: What?
text: David shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the
text: compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her
text: face, turning her head first right, then left.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Does it look okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Looks just like it did.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: And they won't be able to tell?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (even quieter)
dialog: No ... They won't be able to tell.
text: Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the
text: plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before
text: she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide
dialog: "stewardess" smile ...
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: What?
text: He wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's fine.
text: She smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Sure.
text: He watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room,
text: extending the little tray of hors d'oeuvres in front of
dialog: her ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP. DAY.
text: Mr. Johnson is all alone in the shop, setting up the napkin
text: dispensers. He whistles BRUBECK'S "TAKE FIVE" when the screen
text: door slams behind him. Mr. Johnson looks up with a start.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Oh, hi.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Aren't you a little early?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I brought you something ... From the
dialog: library.
scene_heading: CLOSER. FOLLOWING DAVID.
text: He has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three
text: feet long. Mr. Johnson looks at him a little intrigued as
text: David crosses to the counter.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's an art book.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Open it.
text: Mr. Johnson reaches out and opens the cover. After a beat,
text: his eyes widen.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: I just thought since you liked
dialog: painting it might help to ...
text: Mr. Johnson gasps. It's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a
text: gasp. David looks over at him but he's lost in the pages.
scene_heading: HIS POV. (INSERT) ART BOOK ...
text: Massacio's "Expulsion of Adam and Eve' leaps off the pages in
text: vibrant, tortured color. The beauty of the garden is offset
text: by their agony and their shame. HE TURNS THE PAGE ...
text: Titian's "Venus to Utano". Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden
text: light. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of
text: her flesh almost seem to glow ...
text: Rembrandt's "Self Portrait." Dark reds, umbers, blacks and
text: browns. He looks back at Mr. Johnson with pain and wisdom.
text: There's a brilliant light on his hair.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (OS)
dialog: Mmmmgh ...
text: Faintly, almost imperceptibly, the SOUND of a rich ARIA
text: begins to UNDERSCORE THE IMAGES. It's so faint you can't be
dialog: sure you even hear it at all ... like you're hearing it with
dialog: your eyes.
text: He TURNS THE PAGES faster. Breugal's "Harvesters" ... Tumees
text: "Steam Train" ... Monet's "Cathedralo" ... Cezanne's
text: "Oranges" ... Mr. Johnson shuts the book.
scene_heading: WIDER. SODA SHOP.
text: They sit like that for a beat.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: It's beautiful, Bud ...
text: He looks up at David, troubled.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: I'll never be able to do that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, well--you're just starting out.
dialog: I mean, you can't do it ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: No, that's not it.
text: Mr. Johnson shuts the book gently.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: Where am I going to see colors like
dialog: that?
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: What can he say. David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just
text: smiles and shrugs.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Must be awfully lucky to see colors
dialog: like that. I bet they don't even know
dialog: how lucky they are.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
text: He just stares for a second.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. LONG SHOT. DAY.
text: Margaret walks up the center of Main Street toward the CAMERA
text: with her books pressed against her chest. She passes the
text: drugstore, then the hardware store ... Far off in the
text: distance, a young man comes racing out of the soda shop,
text: pulling off his little paper hat as he goes. He comes running
text: up behind her as fast as he can.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: He takes a deep breath and tries to quiet the panting.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (turning/
dialog: lighting up)
dialog: Oh ... Hi.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Look, I probably shouldn't be asking
dialog: you this--not knowing you that well
dialog: and all ...
text: Margaret stops in the street and turns to him.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: It's just that my folks are gonna
dialog: stay home and they said I could use
dialog: their car.
dialog: (moment of truth/
dialog: abandoning his speech)
dialog: ... You want to go out with me
dialog: tonight?
text: He wants to turn away but doesn't. David forces himself to
text: stare at her and all of a sudden she beams. It's the whitest,
text: pearliest smile in the world.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Sure ... Where would we go?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (swallows)
dialog: ... Lover's Lane?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ELM STREET. DAY.
text: David comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation.
text: He vaults over a parking meter, swings around a lampost and
text: leaps off the bumper of a parked car. David hi-fives into the
text: air at no one in particular and sails over Mr. Simpson's
text: hedge almost decking him in the process.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: Sorry ...
text: FOLLOWING DAVID.
text: He races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All
text: American fullback. David bounds up his front steps two at a
text: time flinging open the door.
scene_heading: INT. PARKER HOUSE. FOYER.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: "Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching
dialog: in ..."
text: He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron
text: and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs,
text: when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (OS)
dialog: Bud ...
text: He pauses a second and glances back.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (CONT)
dialog: David ...
text: He peers into the living room. David goes a little grayer ...
scene_heading: HIS POV. TELEVISION.
text: Dick Van Dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the
text: TV screen. He seems to have a bit of a stubble.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Hello there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (wary)
dialog: ... Hi.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (stage whisper)
dialog: Well c'mere, young fella.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM.
text: David crosses slowly over to the TV set.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: You know I've been thinkin' ... I
dialog: might have been a little "hasty"
dialog: the other day when you asked to come
dialog: home--just took me by such surprise,
dialog: ya know--ha ha ...
text: He gives a goony laugh. David just looks at him ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: So even though I can't make any
dialog: promises, well--I figured if you
dialog: asked me real nice--I might just be
dialog: willing to talk about it again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Talk about it. Right now, I mean.
dialog: I got to ... um ...
text: The look turns suddenly dark and ominous.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Bud--I thought you wanted to come
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I
dialog: told my "dad" I'd clean out the
dialog: rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted
dialog: me to ... to change the tape in the
dialog: register ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (getting testy)
dialog: I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm
dialog: getting sorta concerned about what
dialog: I'm seeing in some of these
dialog: re-runs ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Re-runs?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Like when Margaret Henderson makes
dialog: her cookies for Whitey.
dialog: (losing it a little)
dialog: ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I know they're not. But I mean--
dialog: they're just "cookies" after all ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well they're not just cookies. I
dialog: mean, they're great cookies ...
dialog: Look, I'd love to get into this
dialog: whole thing but I'm really running
dialog: late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
speaker_heading: BUD.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
text: He swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic
text: limbo. David stands in the middle of the living room,
text: breathing hard ...
scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM.
text: She sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a
text: book. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to
text: open it when she senses something and glances toward the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE.
text: Bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems
dialog: to be out of breath.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Nothing?
text: He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the
text: remote in his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen ...
text: He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: You're reading?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (glancing at the book)
dialog: Yeah. Can't believe you started such
text: a dorky fad.
text: She holds up the cover.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: ... Yeah.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35
dialog: pages.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still stunned)
dialog: That's great.
text: He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to
dialog: drift ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: So what is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well ... I just ...
dialog: (out of the blue)
dialog: Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Remember when you told me that Lisa
dialog: Rosenberg liked me?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yeah ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well--did she really like me or were
dialog: you just making that up.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No. She really liked you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You weren't playing a joke? She
dialog: woulda gone out with me?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Gone out with you. She woulda like
dialog: rearranged your tonsils.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wow.
text: He looks at her amazed--reliving the missed opportunity.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: How come I'm still in black and white?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (back to earth)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well I've had like ten times as
dialog: much sex as these girls and I'm
dialog: still like this. They have one hour
text: in the back of a car and suddenly
text: they're in technicolor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: ... it's not just the sex ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (looking up quickly)
dialog: What?
text: She stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard
text: their name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's
text: calculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her
text: expression changes: a vague look of recognition.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT)
dialog: No, it's not just the sex, is it?
text: She glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes
text: a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After
text: a second or two, she looks back. David looks at her for a
dialog: beat ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY.
text: David gets out of his "dad's" convertible, carrying a dozen
text: "gray" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front
dialog: walk ...
scene_heading: INT. CAR. NIGHT. LATER ...
text: David sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret
text: Henderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road,
text: holding the wheel at "10 and 2" as he steals a glance to his
dialog: right.
scene_heading: HIS POV. MARGARET.
text: It's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes
text: her glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm
text: wind that swirls inside the convertible ...
scene_heading: SHOT. DAVID.
text: He studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to
text: avoid a parked car on his right ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: They pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads:
scene_heading: "NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE"
text: Main Street turns into a winding country road as they leave
text: the town behind and head off into the woods. They wind
text: through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a
text: second sign appears, much like the first:
scene_heading: "NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE"
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
text: Sure enough, the town emerges in front of them again,
text: completing the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh ... Right.
text: He looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR. DUSK.
text: SAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto
text: a smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small
text: hill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road.
text: It continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the
text: crest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a
text: deep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat
dialog: between them ...
scene_heading: HIS POV. CAR SEAT.
text: THE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They
text: sit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED ...
scene_heading: INT. CAR.
text: David looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems
text: to be happening around them ... Many of the Dogwoods have
text: started to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty
text: percent of the petals have "bloomed" in some weird false
text: spring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as
text: they finally reach a crest in the hill.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wow.
scene_heading: THEIR POV. LOVERS LANE.
text: There, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone
text: Technicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW

speaker_heading: SAM COOKE (VO)
dialog: (over the car radios)
dialog: "Cupid, draw back your bow ..."
scene_heading: SHOT. CAR.
text: Slowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids
text: have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by
text: the edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It
text: almost looks "Athenian."
scene_heading: INT. CAR.
text: David looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly
text: cocks his head to the side.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's that smell?
text: Margaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the
text: convertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is
text: blooming beside the car.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Aren't these great?
text: David takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes
text: a long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to
text: relax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like
text: some strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the
dialog: flower ...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK.
text: Betty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on
text: either hand. From a block away, she looks like any other
dialog: homemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray
dialog: make-up.
scene_heading: CLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY.
text: She nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in
text: the Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street
text: when she glances up, and suddenly stops.
text: HER POV. ACROSS THE STREET.
text: There, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda
text: shop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for
text: the large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It
text: is rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks
text: like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject
dialog: matter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres
text: and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist
text: Santa hovering over the roof tops.
scene_heading: SHOT. BETTY.
text: She stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to
text: wander across the street. It's late afternoon and the
text: business district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of
text: the block, staring straight ahead.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP.
text: The door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the
text: place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining
text: through the window near the back of the store. Betty glances
text: around. The little bell JINGLES as she enters.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (OS)
dialog: We're closed right now ...
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: He sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a
text: board which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his
text: shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Oh, hi ...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (turning to leave)
dialog: I'm sorry ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: No, no ... Come on in.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE.
text: He gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still
text: holding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the "Cubist
dialog: Christmas" in the window.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I just thought ... It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Thanks.
text: Their eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr.
text: Johnson motions toward his easel.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: I was just trying to do one of these
dialog: "still lifes."
text: He sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of
scene_heading: GRAY FRUIT.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: Having kind of a tough time.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I think it looks nice.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Well ...
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
text: He leads her over to the table and points down at the art
text: book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh my ...
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: They are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at
text: the book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears
text: into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Here. Look at this.
text: He turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is
text: nearly electric.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Where'd you get this?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Bud brought it to me.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Bud?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Here's my favorite.
scene_heading: INSERT. BOOK.
text: He turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping
text: Women." The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her
text: head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: What do you think?
text: She doesn't answer ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: Isn't it great how she's resting like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (faintly)
text: She's crying.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: Mr. Johnson looks down at the painting.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: She's crying.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: No she's not.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yes she is.
text: He looks up at her ...
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE.
text: A single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it
text: and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just
text: wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP.
text: A long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath.
scene_heading: ANGLE. MR. JOHNSON.
text: He stares up at her in amazement.
scene_heading: ANGLE. BETTY.
text: She senses something and glances down at her hand. Her
text: fingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts
dialog: for the door.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (following her)
dialog: Wait ...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I've got to go ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: It's alright.
text: He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the
text: wall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: It's alright. Let me see.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (shame)
dialog: No ...
text: He reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves
text: around to glimpse the other side of her cheek.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: It's beautiful.
text: CLOSER ...
text: She freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly,
text: turns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed
text: underneath. Betty stands there exposed.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: ... It's beautiful.
text: She swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: You shouldn't cover that up.
text: Mr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on
text: the counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at
text: the tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he
text: starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.
text: CLOSER STILL ...
text: She recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr.
text: Johnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and
text: acceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make
text: a decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing
text: her flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues
text: to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the
text: beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. NIGHT.
text: She lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing
text: earlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the
text: pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a
text: moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting
text: the book. The cover is plainly visible: "LADY CHATTERLY'S
speaker_heading: LOVER."
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: She doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed
text: and crosses to "her" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens
text: the book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and
text: doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She
text: could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the
dialog: little desk.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: She flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is
text: bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony
text: tail. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired
text: and she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer
text: notices something across the desk.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE.
text: A pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of
text: her. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances
text: back down at the print.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Hunh.
text: She can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in
text: front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked
text: the PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER
text: FRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is
text: the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look
text: on her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel
text: when there is a loud TAP on the window.
text: She rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer
text: slides open the window.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKER HOUSE.
text: Biff stands on the front lawn tossing pebbles at the window.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Mary Sue--C'mon ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (leaning out the window)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (jiggling in anticipation)
dialog: It's six-thirty ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: We were gonna ... You know ...
text: He jiggles some more.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: Why not?
text: She glances down at her book.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'm busy.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: With what?
scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.
text: She hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk. Her
text: own image in the silver frame stares back at her. The hair is
text: pulled back in a pony tail. The glasses sit on the front of
text: her nose.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (turning to Biff)
dialog: I'm studying.
text: She thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles. Biff
text: stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as Jennifer reaches up and
text: quietly closes the window ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.
text: David and Margaret sit on the edge of the grass, looking out
text: across the water. Even in the moonlight, the COLORS are
text: vivid. David still clutches the gardenia in his hand, taking
text: a long hit like an Opium addict.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (inhaling)
dialog: Mmmmgh.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Do they have those ... Where you come
dialog: from?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah ... I guess.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You don't know?
text: Margaret laughs like that isn't even possible. She shifts on
text: the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a
text: long tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her
text: shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT)
dialog: So what's it like?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Out there.
text: She clings onto the words like they could transport her by
text: themselves. David thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh. don't know ... It's different.
text: She leans forward.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well it's louder ... And scarier I
dialog: guess ... And ... and a lot more
dialog: dangerous ...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Sounds fantastic. You know some kids
dialog: came up here the other night to go
dialog: swimming--took off all their clothes.
text: She giggles. David looks at her in amazement.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT)
dialog: Do they have an Ocean? I've heard
dialog: about the ocean.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What's that like?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well it's big. And it's blue ...
text: (as if realizing it for the first time)
dialog: ... It's really really blue.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Mmmm.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Boy. It's hot up here.
text: Suddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan
text: sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the
text: figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts.
text: She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it
text: forms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater
text: across the grass and leans back on it.
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT)
dialog: You want some berries?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hunh?
text: She unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in
text: REDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I picked them myself. They grow wild
dialog: up here.
dialog: (eating one)
dialog: Mmm. So sweet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (looking at them)
dialog: They just grow like that?
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (looking straight up)
dialog: Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff.
dialog: Currants and strawberries ... Here.
dialog: I'll show you.
text: She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her
text: heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and
text: reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a
text: piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers
text: back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ...
speaker_heading: MARGARET (CONT)
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: Margaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED
text: APPLE. It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the
dialog: moonlight.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He hesitates just looking at it. Margaret speaks in a
dialog: whisper.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Go on. Try it.
speaker_heading: HIS POV.
text: She is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched
text: apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. Margaret is
text: smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. David
text: reaches out and takes it.
scene_heading: WIDER. DAVID AND MARGARET.
text: For this instant, they seem alone in the garden. He looks
text: down at it, then glances over at Margaret. David hesitates
text: for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.
text: George heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a
text: happy tune. He smiles at Mr. Simpson and swings the attache
text: case as he turns and heads up his front walk.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER.
text: George opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs
text: like he always does. He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his
text: coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly
dialog: greeting:
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Honey--I'm home.
text: There is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles
text: as he calls out again:
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
dialog: Honey--I'm home ...
text: There is more silence. George looks around a little confused
text: when there is a BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.
text: Betty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of
text: fruit. She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully
text: with her chin in the air. Mr. Johnson sits behind his easel,
text: painting her portrait from a few feet away. Betty looks
text: radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm PINK OF HER
text: FLESH TONES lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ...
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: She looks over at Mr. Johnson when they hear the BOOMING CLAP
text: OF THUNDER. Each of them freezes. There is ANOTHER, LOUDER
dialog: BOOM ...
scene_heading: ANGLE. WINDOW.
text: The "Cubist Snowscene" lights up brightly, illuminated by the
text: sudden flash of lightning behind it. Betty leaps up from the
text: chair and crosses to the window looking out.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: I don't know.
text: Betty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the
text: painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING THE PAINTING.
text: It is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that
text: isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him
text: fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual
text: nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself
text: revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges
text: and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime.
text: There is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER.
scene_heading: WIDER. BETTY AND MR. JOHNSON.
text: She looks over at Mr. Johnson and he glances down. After a
text: moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to
text: run. Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing
text: it, moves slightly closer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.
text: David and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. At
text: first they don't separate when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF
text: THUNDER. It is only when they hear the SECOND ONE and the
text: RAIN starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in
dialog: the sky.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What is that?
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the
text: increasing rain. It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks
text: to him in terror.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Rain.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Real rain?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
text: She looks at him frightened. David smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Right. Of course you don't ...
text: He puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the
text: grassy slope. A dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank,
text: looking in terror at the water falling from the sky.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (reaching the car)
dialog: We'll just put up the top.
text: He goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the
text: catch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing
text: around as the rain starts to pound harder.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: What top?
text: He looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched
text: in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to
dialog: shiver.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's fine. Come on.
text: He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the
text: kids are clustered together. They look at one another,
text: terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an
text: overhanging rock.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: It's alright. There's nothing to be
dialog: afraid of.
text: They look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him
text: positively adoringly. She clings to his shoulder as the storm
text: howls a few feet away ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. NIGHT.
text: She stands at the window looking out at the driving rain.
text: Jennifer still holds the D.H. Lawrence book in her hand.
text: There is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of
dialog: thunder.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Cool ...
text: She flops back down on the bed and continues to read ...
scene_heading: PARKER LIVING ROOM.
text: George wanders through the empty and darkened house
text: completely perplexed and utterly disoriented. He looks around
text: for his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms
text: and the sound of the driving storm.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (a little frightened/
dialog: a little petulant)
dialog: Honey, I'm home ...
text: He still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM.
text: The lights are dark there as well and he looks around
dialog: confused.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
dialog: (baffled)
dialog: Where's my dinner?
text: He sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking
text: smells. George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's
text: empty as well.
scene_heading: KITCHEN.
text: He crosses into the darkness ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where's my dinner ...
scene_heading: INT. FOYER.
text: George comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer. He
text: slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (insistent)
dialog: Where's my DINNER ...
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE.
text: It's really blowing now. The rain is coming down in heavy
text: sheets, being swirled and driven by the wind. The front door
text: opens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still
text: dressed in his shirtsleeves.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where's my DINNER!
text: ON GEORGE.
text: He stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete
text: confusion. The rain pounds against his body and within
text: seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (over the storm)
text: WHERE'S MY DINNER ...
scene_heading: EXT. ELM STREET.
text: A tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling
text: through the torrent. George reels down Elm Street screaming
text: skyward in the distance.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ... WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY
speaker_heading: DINNER!
text: SERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE ...
text: He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance
text: agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he
text: passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ...
text: Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well
text: with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain.
text: George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened
text: shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering ...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (plaintively)
dialog: Where's my dinner?
text: He wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY. NIGHT.
text: The regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across
text: three lanes. Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt,
text: sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses.
text: The NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there
dialog: aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ...
scene_heading: ANGLE. BIG BOB.
text: He picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight. He
text: starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up
text: and suddenly stops.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.
text: George is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold
text: and shivering. His shirt is soaked through to the skin. His
text: hair is drenched and dripping.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What happened?
text: He doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps
dialog: shivering.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: The men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a
text: couple of times, still soaked to the bone.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Are you alright?
dialog: (looking at him)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: Rain.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Real rain?
text: George nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling
text: alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning
text: lights up the sky.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: Oh my God ...
text: He turns back to George.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: ... We had no idea. Burt was rolling
dialog: a 250 and ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you alright?
text: George shivers and Bobs leads him over to one of the benches
text: and guides him into the seat ...
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (still shivering)
dialog: Well, I ... I came home like I always
dialog: do, And I came in the front door. And
dialog: I took off my coat. And I put down my
dialog: briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
scene_heading: ANGLE. MEN.
text: They all nod in recognition.
scene_heading: ANGLE. GEORGE.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ... Only no one was there.
text: A MURMUR goes through the men.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
dialog: So I went into the kitchen and I
dialog: yelled it again. "Honey--I'm home."
dialog: But there was no one there either.
dialog: No wife. No lights. No dinner.
dialog: They all GASP.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
dialog: So I went to the oven--you know--
dialog: because I thought maybe she had made
dialog: me one of those "TV dinners ..."
text: The men nod and lean forward. George shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
text: But she hadn't. She was gone.
text: A LOUDER MURMUR moves through the crowd. George lowers his
text: head and just shakes it from side to side. Big Bob moves up
text: and puts a hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (gently/
dialog: the patriarch)
dialog: ... It's gonna be fine George.
text: George looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly
text: on the back.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: What do we do Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well--we'll be safe for now--thank
dialog: goodness we're in a bowling alley--
dialog: but if George here doesn't get his
dialog: dinner, any one of us could be next.
dialog: It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or
dialog: even you Phil ...
text: They murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: (like a WWII movie)
dialog: ... That's real rain out there
dialog: gentlemen. This isn't some little
dialog: "virus" that's going to "clear up on
dialog: it's own." There's something
dialog: happening to our town and I think we
dialog: can all see where it comes from.
text: They nod in agreement.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: We're gonna need a town meeting.
dialog: Phil, how fast can you turn around
dialog: a leaflet in your print shop?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Couple of hours.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Gus, why don't you get a bunch of
text: kids from the basketball team to help
dialog: you put them up on lamposts and tree
dialog: trunks ...
text: Gus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm,
text: patriarchal smile. He claps a hand on George's shoulder.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: (soothingly)
dialog: And the first thing you're gonna do
dialog: is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice
text: dry bowling shirt.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.
text: The rain still pounds out the window. Betty and Mr. Johnson
text: are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through
text: Mr. Johnson's snow scene in the window. Betty is in soft
text: radiant color now. Almost the whole frame seems to glow
dialog: pink ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: You can't go out there.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: But I really should get home.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: But you can't go out there.
text: There is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of
text: THUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her
text: eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the
dialog: roof.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sounds nice ... Once you get used
dialog: to it.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (listening)
dialog: Yeah. It does.
text: There is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: Like a drum.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
text: Betty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear
text: seems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as
text: Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr.
text: Johnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two.
text: Betty starts to smile ...
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE.
text: David huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she
text: nestles against him with her head on his shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.
text: She lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting
text: image of Mary Sue. Her hair is up in a bun now. The glasses
text: have slipped down her nose. There is another fork of
text: lightning and the LOUDEST THUNDER CLAP of all. Jennifer
text: smiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her
text: shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE UP. A BRIGHT RED ROSE.
text: Drops of moisture cling to the petals as it GLEAMS BRILLIANT
text: RED IN THE MORNING SUN ...
scene_heading: AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE.
text: The rain is gone now. The town glistens in the sunlight
text: complete with a huge RAINBOW arching across the sky.
text: Literally all the COLORS IN THE RAINBOW shine against the
text: black and white of the town. It looks like a greeting card.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP.
text: Betty and Mr. Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each
text: other's arms. Sunlight streams in through the window, warming
text: Mr. Johnson's face which has now turned to color. He opens
text: his eyes and looks outside ...
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (seeing the rainbow)
dialog: Oh my Gosh ...
scene_heading: EXT. LOVER'S LANE.
text: Birds are chirping. David and Margaret also lie asleep in
text: each other's arms, beneath the shelter of the rocky overhang.
text: Margaret lifts up and sees the rainbow. She has turned to
dialog: color as well ...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (awed)
dialog: Oh my God ...
scene_heading: INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.
text: She has passed out on her bed with her book on her chest.
text: Jennifer's hair is still tied in a bun and she still wears
text: Mary Sue's glasses, but her face has returned to its rosy
text: pink hue. She blinks open her eyes, feeling the sunlight, and
text: looks out the window.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (looking at the rainbow)
dialog: Oh my God ...
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY.
text: The men are all passed out across the various lanes and
text: scoring tables. It looks like a YMCA shelter. After a moment
text: or two Big Bob yawns, and stretches, and glances out the
text: glass doorway. He sees the rainbow and freezes in shock.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Oh my GOD!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ELM ST. DAY.
text: David comes gliding up Maple Street in the sunshine with a
text: huge smile on his face. He has that special grin and faraway
text: look that a boy only knows once in his life. Perplexingly he
text: is still in black and white. Bud turns on Elm Street and
text: starts heading for his house when he glances up and suddenly
text: freezes.
scene_heading: HIS POV. TREE TRUNK.
text: There, tacked to the bark, is a hastily scrawled public
dialog: notice:
scene_heading: TOWN MEETING TONIGHT
scene_heading: ALL "TRUE" CITIZENS
scene_heading: OF PLEASANTVILLE
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He looks up at it for a moment.
scene_heading: INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DUSK.
text: George and Betty stand face to face in their suburban
text: kitchen. He is black and white. She is in full color.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I told you where I was.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: All night?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I got caught in the storm. You were
dialog: gone all night too.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (the ultimate defense)
dialog: I was in a bowling-alley.
text: Betty turns--glances out the window.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
dialog: (sudden smile)
dialog: Look. Let's just forget about it.
dialog: Let's just go to the meeting and ...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I told you, George. I'm not going.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (bigger smile)
dialog: Sure you are.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No I'm not.
text: She turns to face him. George flinches slightly.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: Look at me George. That meeting's not
dialog: for me. Look at my face.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's fine. You'll put on some make up
dialog: and ...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't want to put on some make up ...
text: George's eyes widen. It's a watershed moment.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: It goes away ... It'll go away.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (gently)
dialog: I don't want it to go away.
text: He suddenly squares back his shoulders and puffs out his
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (the '50s patriarch)
dialog: Okay--now you listen to me ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're gonna come to this meeting and
dialog: you're gonna put on this make up, and
dialog: you're gonna come home at six o'clock
dialog: every night and have dinner ready on
dialog: this table.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: No I'm not sweetie.
text: His expression leaves as quickly as it came. Betty moves
text: closer to him.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: (half whisper)
text: ... There's a meatloaf in the fridge.
dialog: You just put it in the oven and turn
dialog: this little knob up to three-fifty.
dialog: If you put the pie in forty minutes
dialog: later, it'll be hot in time for
dialog: dessert.
text: George's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: I made a couple of lunches for you
dialog: and put them in brown paper bags ...
dialog: (much quieter)
dialog: I'm gonna go now.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where are you gonna go?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm gonna go now.
text: She turns and starts out the kitchen door when George calls
dialog: after her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Betty, don't go out there like that!
dialog: They'll see you!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They'll SEE you!
text: And she closes the door behind her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT)
dialog: Betty, come back here!
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.
text: Dozens of black and white citizens stream in through the
text: front door.
scene_heading: SHOT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET.
text: Several "transformed" teenagers stare at the spectacle with
text: their FLESH COLORED SKIN AND BRIGHT BLUE EYES. They seem to
text: hang back in the shadows.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL.
text: Big Bob stands at the podium beneath a permanent banner that
text: reads "PLEASANTVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE." As the only
dialog: legally constituted body in Pleasantville, it is a natural
text: place for a town meeting. There is nothing bright and cheery
text: however. The floor lamps in each comer cast huge, looming
text: shadows up the walls. The light at the podium bathes Big
text: Bob's face in a blinding splash of light. The whole thing
text: evokes some weird twisted image from German Expressionism--
text: like they are about to go look for Frankenstein. It is grayer
dialog: than gray.
scene_heading: CLOSER. PODIUM.
text: Big Bob stands at a lectern with a Rotary insignia on the
text: front. He speaks calmly but compellingly to a hundred men and
text: women who hang on his every word. Bob holds a BRIGHT YELLOW
scene_heading: GRAPEFRUIT.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: This was found over in Dave Murphy's
dialog: trash can. There were four of them
dialog: like this ...
text: There is a murmur from the crowd ...
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. GEORGE.
text: He sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind
text: Bob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a
text: full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic
text: and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a
dialog: shiny new pin can give you.
scene_heading: SHOT. BOB.
text: He holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jane Davidson found these in her
text: son's laundry basket.
text: There is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats.
text: Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: This is from Mary Petersen's front
dialog: porch. She found one last week.
dialog: There were two more this morning ...
text: The MURMUR starts to grow ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.
text: David and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside
text: Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap
text: their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The
text: meeting across town seems a million miles away. After a
text: moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a
text: beautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright
text: RED bow.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I got you something.
text: Margaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the
text: wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real
text: umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It was a prop for the school play ...
text: She looks down and giggles.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Can I open it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure ...
text: Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She
text: puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of
text: pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points
text: her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a
text: summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret
text: looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and
text: two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with
text: BLACK AND WHITE faces ...
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Hello Bud ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (clipped)
dialog: Hello Whitey.
text: They smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and
dialog: arrogant.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: (more pointed)
dialog: Hello Margaret.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Hello Whitey ...
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: (loud)
dialog: Hey Bud, how come you're not at
dialog: the town meeting right now?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (curt)
dialog: No reason.
dialog: (pause/
dialog: firing back)
dialog: How come you're not?
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Oh. We're s'posed to go out and
dialog: let everybody know about it. See.
text: He points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of
text: Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and
dialog: leers ...
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT)
dialog: No reason hunh ... See I thought
dialog: maybe it was cause you were too
dialog: busy entertaining your colored
dialog: girlfriend.
text: Margaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF
text: LAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around
text: her and pulls her close.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why don't you guys just get the
dialog: hell out of here.
speaker_heading: WHITEY
dialog: Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that.
text: He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns
text: toward Margaret.
speaker_heading: WHITEY (CONT)
dialog: (leering more)
dialog: You know Margaret, you can come
dialog: over and bake those Oatmeal cookies
dialog: for me anytime you want to.
text: They share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels
text: out with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David
text: holds her tighter ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.
text: She nods, groping for reassurance ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.
text: The chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing.
text: Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the
dialog: audience.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Ed McFadden's got a blue front door.
speaker_heading: ED MCFADDEN
dialog: It's always been blue!
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Not that blue!
speaker_heading: MAN
text: There's a big tree turning orange
dialog: in Joe Baker's front yard!
scene_heading: SHOT. GEORGE.
text: He still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on
text: his face. George fingers the little pin in his lapel ...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: People, people ... I think we all
dialog: know what's going on here.
scene_heading: SHOT. BOB.
text: Bob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Obviously certain "changes" have
dialog: been happening. Up until now, things
dialog: in Pleasantville have always been--
dialog: well ... "Pleasant." And, recently,
dialog: certain things have become ...
dialog: "Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me
dialog: the first thing we have to do is to
dialog: separate out the things that are
dialog: pleasant, from the things that are
dialog: "Un-Pleasant."
text: There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ...
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: George, why don't you and Burt
dialog: take the lead on this. Why don't
dialog: you put together kind of an
dialog: "Un-Pleasant" Activities Committee ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.
text: Mr. Johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and
text: stares with his palette at a blank pane of glass. There is a
text: knock at the door ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: Mr. Johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it.
text: Betty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a
text: "Lady Samsonite Weekender" bag. She stares up into his eyes.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: FULL SHOT. SHOP WINDOW. MORNING.
text: Burt Campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every
text: morning, only today there is a slight difference. He swings
text: open the door, puts out the rakes and shovels, then sets a
text: newly handwritten sign clearly in the front window:
dialog: "NO COLOREDS"
text: SERIES OF SHOTS. SHOP WINDOWS.
text: As the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more
text: "NO COLOREDS" signs appear in the windows: next to the
text: donuts ... by fishing poles ... beside the stationery
text: supplies ... Everything else looks frighteningly the same...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.
text: Joey Anderson, the local paper boy, is finishing his morning
text: rounds. He reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the
text: bakery. Then he throws right toward the post office. Then he
text: turns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams
dialog: into a trash can ...
scene_heading: WIDER. SODA SHOP.
dialog: Where Mr. Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene,
text: there is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all. A
text: NUDE version of Betty graces the shop window--painted in
text: curving sensual brush strokes. Joey stops his bike and just
text: stares in amazement. He gets up and rides away as fast as he
dialog: possibly can ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MAIN STREET. LATER ...
text: David is in a happy daze, wandering up Main Street and
text: doesn't even notice the crowd gathered outside Mr. Johnson's
text: soda shop. After a moment or two, he glances up and sees the
dialog: window ...
scene_heading: CLOSER. DAVID.
text: His eyes go wide. The murmur of the crowd grows louder as
text: stray derisive comments rise above the noise. David glances
text: from the nude in window to the growing angry mob ...
scene_heading: MAIN STREET. DAY.
text: David goes tearing through the business district looking for
text: any sign of his "mother." He glances in the flower shop ...
text: toward the green grocer ... David is just about to turn on
text: Elm Street when a booming voice seems to come from the
dialog: sky ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (OS)
dialog: Bud ...
text: David stops and looks to his right. There, in the window of
text: the Philco TV store, are twenty screens of various sizes
text: displaying the image of Dick Van Dyke.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: I want a word with you ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (scared)
dialog: Oh--well ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
speaker_heading: (BOOMING)
dialog: NOW!
text: The sound reverberates like God Himself. David ducks inside
text: the store, slamming the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. STORE.
text: Fifty Dick Van Dyke's stare at him from every TV in the
text: store. The effect is smothering.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (still pretty loud)
dialog: What the hell do you think you're
dialog: doing!
text: David glances around, not sure where to look.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: What do I MEAN!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You think this is a toy? You think
dialog: it's your own little goddamn
dialog: coloring book ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: A deluge doesn't just "happen."
dialog: Bolts of lightning don't just
dialog: "happen" ...
dialog: (louder)
dialog: You burned down an ELM tree for
dialog: Christ's sake ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I had nothing to do with that.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory.
dialog: What episode does the orgy happen
dialog: in, again?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: It was a gift Bud. It was so
dialog: special. You liked these things
dialog: as much as I did, remember:
text: Warm smells in the family kitchen?
dialog: A smile from a stranger? You know
dialog: how rare that is?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (beat/
dialog: quietly)
dialog: ... Only if they mean it.
text: Dick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes "red" in the
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
scene_heading: OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING
dialog: TO PISS ME OFF!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (finding courage)
dialog: I didn't do anything wrong.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Oh no? Let me show you something!
scene_heading: SHOT. TV SCREEN.
text: All at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of
text: the screen containing the image of David and Margaret at
text: Lover's Lane. The VIDEOTAPE rolls forward as she extends the
text: BRIGHT RED APPLE. David hesitates, then takes it, then puts
text: it to his mouth and takes a bite.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
text: "YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE."
text: The image of David biting the apple PLAYS BACKWARDS AND
text: FORWARDS like some football instant replay ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
text: YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS
speaker_heading: PARADISE!
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: David just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on
text: the TV screens.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Where's the remote control I gave
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Because you're coming home. I'm
dialog: gonna put this place back the way
dialog: it was.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No you're not.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
speaker_heading: EXCUSE ME?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (gathering strength)
dialog: I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (nuts)
text: JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
text: He lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the
dialog: "barrier."
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: OW!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: I'm going to leave now.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: You're not going anywhere. You're
dialog: gonna get that remote and you're
dialog: gonna come home and we're gonna
dialog: make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
text: Dick Van Dyke looks at him stunned as David turns and leaves
dialog: the shop.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: Don't make me get rough with you!
dialog: I can get awfully fucking rough!
scene_heading: ELM STREET. DAY.
text: David sprints down the tree lined street toward his house.
text: The leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN
text: even this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's
text: hedge and goes tearing up his front walk.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER.
text: The door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David
text: glances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He
text: crosses into the living room.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM.
text: David rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at
text: it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door.
scene_heading: MAIN STREET. DAY.
text: David moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to
text: stash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville
text: Travel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various
dialog: destinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't
text: see much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a
text: drain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: David turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main
text: Street. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to
text: his feet as the voices get louder.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: The crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a
text: group of young men who circle around her, taunting and
text: harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face:
text: BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd
text: circles her like a pack of dogs.
scene_heading: CLOSER. BETTY.
text: The ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the
text: black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high
text: with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one
dialog: another "Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's
dialog: under that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her
text: picture ..." One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she
text: quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to
dialog: the ground ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: David shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into
text: the dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the
text: side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is
text: as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.)
text: David steps in front of his "mother" with both fists
dialog: clenched.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (as scared as she is)
dialog: Come on!
text: He plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black
text: and white thugs just stares at it.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: COME ON!
scene_heading: ANGLE. CROWD.
text: They look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the
text: side of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running
text: down his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts
text: backing away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Get out of here!
text: They back away further and David takes a threatening step.
text: The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother."
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER)
text: David moves up to her gently.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you alright?
text: She nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David
text: reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go
dialog: wide.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: What?
scene_heading: CLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER.
text: Betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She
text: opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected
text: image of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The
text: courage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look
text: at each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle
text: arm around her shoulder.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Come on.
text: He begins to lead her up toward the corner.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY.
text: A larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude
text: painting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are
text: even louder. The "closed" sign still sits in the doorway.
text: After a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: A big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the
text: fever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an
text: instant, Mr. Johnson's "canvas" is totally destroyed. The
text: CHEERING grows louder ...
text: Almost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together.
text: The door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon
text: all that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND
scene_heading: BROKEN GLASS.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP.
text: It is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables
text: ripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick
text: in the front of the juke box ...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN ST. DAY.
text: David and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being
text: destroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection
text: watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok.
text: After a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET
text: comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh my God.
text: He takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David
text: strokes her hair.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Are you alright? Are you okay?
text: She nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two,
text: then glances down to her side ...
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: She is clutching the umbrella in her left hand. The thing has
text: been ripped to shreds. The spines are broken and the fabric
text: is torn. Margaret stares at the thing with a combination of
text: confusion and shame. David goes white with rage and looks
text: toward the mob.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (taking his arm)
dialog: No. Let's get out of here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. (LEADING TO LOVER'S LANE).
text: They all ride in George's convertible up the twisting turning
text: road. It has turned completely PINK with the dogwood petals.
text: David winds up the trail, in the fading light, looking for
text: refuge. He clutches the wheel tight.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We should be okay up here.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.
text: The car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road. After a
text: moment, Lover's Lane reveals itself. It is lush and green
dialog: like before only this time, there is one major difference. A
text: phalanx of BLACK AND WHITE THUGS have created a roadblock in

speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: David jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier. It is a
text: weird incongruous image: the black and white roadblock in
text: front with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind--
dialog: like some perfect dream you can never get to. The thugs have
text: turned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs
text: across the road. They hold axe-handles in their hands.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: We better go.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.
text: Darkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on. Some
text: debris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of
text: the mob still fill the air. David rolls back into town with
text: the headlights off.
scene_heading: CLOSER. CAR.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not sure.
text: They head down Main St. and turn the comer on Walnut. All at
text: once, a weird ORANGE LIGHT bathes the car ...
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. THEIR POV.
text: A BONFIRE has been lit in the middle of the street between the
text: library and the barber shop. Twenty to thirty people are
text: gathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright
text: ORANGE FLAMES shoot into the air.
scene_heading: ANGLE. CAR.
text: David pulls over by the curb, and their eyes go wide ...
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE.
text: From closer up, it becomes clear what they're burning. Huge
text: piles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk,
text: waiting their turn on the pyre. There is a strange celebratory
text: atmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with
text: the glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker. David sees
text: something and bolts from the car ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh my God.
scene_heading: ANGLE. SIDE OF THE BONFIRE.
text: Jennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with Biff.
text: He clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist
text: trying to stop him from throwing it on the fire ...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Don't! Just let go.
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: It's better, Mary Sue.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I said, NO!
dialog: (yanking it)
dialog: ... I've read like one book in my
dialog: whole life and I'll be damned if I
dialog: let you throw it on that fire ...
text: Jennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then
text: suddenly kicks Biff in the groin. He doubles over in agony
text: when Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other
dialog: direction.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE. STREET.
text: She sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop
text: when a hand reaches out and grabs her. Jennifer starts to
text: scream but David puts a hand to her mouth.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: It's okay. It's me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: WIDE SHOT. SODA SHOP. OTHER SIDE OF MAIN STREET.
text: The crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark
text: wreckage of the soda shop. Several stools lie out in the
text: street and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered
text: around the sidewalk. It is eerily quiet.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: David, Betty and Margaret sit silently in the car, across the
text: street with the lights off. He unlatches the door handle and
text: gets out slowly. The rest of them follow him into the empty
text: street as they move silently toward the soda shop, like some
text: platoon on patrol.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE.
text: As they get closer, more of the wreckage comes into view. Half
text: a booth ... a soda spigot ... After a moment or two Jennifer
text: looks up and gasps.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: Several teenagers step out of the shadows. They have scraped
text: faces and ripped clothing--the signs. Most are dazed and ALL
text: OF THEM ARE IN COLOR. After a second or two, more appear:
text: Mary Jane ... Lisa Anne ... The boy who was reading Huck
dialog: Finn...
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: The kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer. Of
text: course he doesn't. The sounds of the Mob still carry through
text: the air from somewhere off in the distance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let's go inside.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP.
text: The place is just sad. All the remnants of what they had are
text: strewn around the floor, The jukebox is turned over. The
text: stools are ripped out of the floor. Betty looks over at the
text: corner where he painted her ... The easel is smashed to bits.
scene_heading: ANGLE. BETTY.
text: She brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around
text: her and draws her close. After a moment or two they HEAR a
text: weird SCRAPING sound.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello?
text: The SCRAPING SOUND stops. They all look to the open door and
text: after a second or two, Mr. Johnson appears holding a broom and
text: dustpan.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Just thought I'd try to tidy it up
dialog: a bit.
text: Betty runs across and throws her arms around him. The
text: teenagers watch as she holds him tight.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON (CONT)
dialog: It's okay. Once we sweep it up it'll
dialog: be alright again ...
text: Betty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair. No one says
text: anything while they just embrace for a moment. Finally ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn
text: these booths back up. "Mary Sue",
dialog: why don't you help me slide this in
dialog: front of the door. We'll be okay in
dialog: here.
text: They respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids
text: start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage.
text: Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as
text: the kids try to put their shop back together.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT.
text: Big Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The
text: atmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a
text: lynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills.
text: Bob points his finger.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: This is not the answer people.
text: The crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: No matter how upset we may get, or
dialog: how frustrated we may be, we're
dialog: not gonna solve our problems out
dialog: in the street. It's just the wrong
dialog: way to do it. We have to have a
dialog: "Code of Conduct" we can all agree
dialog: to live by.
text: His tone grows softer--more concerned ...
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: Now, I asked George and Burt here
dialog: to sketch out some ideas-and I
dialog: think they've done a terrific job.
dialog: (beat/
dialog: scans the crowd)
dialog: If we all agree on these then we
dialog: can take a vote and I think we'll
text: start to move in the right direction.
scene_heading: ANGLE. CROWD.
text: They murmur and nod ...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (reading from the
scene_heading: CODE OF CONDUCT")
dialog: "ONE: All public disruption and
dialog: acts of vandalism are to cease
dialog: immediately."
scene_heading: EXT. BONFIRE. NIGHT.
text: It is still ablaze with books. As Bob continues to READ in
text: VOICE OVER, a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb.
scene_heading: SHOT. FIRETRUCK.
text: The same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls
text: several yards of it from the back of the truck. He can barely
text: contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and
text: extinguish the raging bonfire ...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: "TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville
dialog: are to treat one another in a
dialog: courteous and "pleasant" manner ..."
text: SERIES OF SHOTS. LAMPPOSTS.
text: The CODE OF CONDUCT is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in
text: rapid succession. It is plastered on walls and in shop
dialog: windows ...
speaker_heading: SODA SHOP.
text: Debris is still strewn around the street. A dim light
text: emanates from inside.
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP.
text: It looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to
text: fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads
text: the code of conduct out loud by flashlight.
speaker_heading: LISA ANNE
dialog: "Courteous and Pleasant manner."
dialog: That doesn't sound too bad.
text: David just looks at her then continues.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (reading from THE CODE)
dialog: "THREE: The area commonly known as
dialog: Lover's Lane as well as the
dialog: Pleasantville Public Library shall
dialog: be closed until further notice."
text: This sends a murmur amongst the kids.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: "FOUR: The only permissible
dialog: recorded music shall be the
dialog: following: Pat Boone, Johnny

dialog: "Oh my gosh ... No ..."
text: David holds up his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: "FIVE: There shall be no public
dialog: sale of umbrellas or preparation

text: Various glances dart back and forth between them. David
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: "SIX: No bedframe or mattress may
dialog: be sold measuring more than 38
dialog: inches wide."
dialog: (pause)
dialog: "SEVEN: The only permissible exterior
dialog: paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or
dialog: GRAY, despite the recent availability
dialog: of certain alternatives."
text: David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just winces slightly.
text: Betty clutches his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: "EIGHT: All elementary and high
dialog: school curriculums shall teach the
dialog: "non-changist" view of history--
dialog: emphasizing "continuity" over
dialog: "alteration."
dialog: (David pauses)
dialog: Wow.
text: David lowers the paper.
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: It is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a
text: moment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares
text: down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of
dialog: sadness.
text: Off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling
text: with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was
text: being read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Hey. This thing works.
text: He hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop.
text: RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BUDDY HOLLY
dialog: Well all the things that you say
dialog: and do Make me want to be with
dialog: you-oo-oo ...
speaker_heading: LISA ANNE
dialog: (suddenly/
dialog: in a panic)
dialog: Turn that off!
text: The boy looks back at her.
speaker_heading: LISA ANNE (CONT)
dialog: (shrieking)
dialog: You're not allowed to do that now!
text: He flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox
text: winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it.
text: David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear
dialog: tone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure you are.
text: He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids
text: watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.
scene_heading: WIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP.
text: Buddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly
text: different meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to
text: an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious
dialog: reputation.
speaker_heading: BUDDY HOLLY
dialog: The little things that you say and do
dialog: Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ...
dialog: RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ...
dialog: RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...
text: Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an
text: arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little
text: safer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they
dialog: don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel
dialog: ashamed.
text: Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE
text: ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the
dialog: helm of his ship ...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. LATER ...
text: He steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David
text: motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge.
text: The disturbance seems to have died down and the street is
text: silent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Stick together till you get off
dialog: Main Street.
text: They nod and head off down the block. David just watches them
text: silently from the wreckage of the soda shop ...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE. NIGHT.
text: The Fire Department is cleaning up the charred remains of the
dialog: bonfire ...
scene_heading: INT. SODA SHOP. LATER ...
text: Betty is asleep in one of the booths. Jennifer sleeps beside
text: her on the floor. David and Margaret sleep next to them in
text: another booth with Margaret curled up against his chest.
text: David opens his eyes.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.
text: Mr. Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at
text: the large piece of plywood where his window used to be. He
text: just gazes at the thing as if he could look through it.
text: There's a faraway look in his eye.
scene_heading: SHOT. DAVID.
text: He rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret.
text: David crosses over to Mr. Johnson and speaks in a whisper.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I don't know what I'd do if I
dialog: couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just
dialog: don't know what I'd do ...
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. DAVID.
text: He just nods. David glances down at the table next to him. He
text: picks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just
text: looks at it. It's orange and pink and yellow. David thinks
dialog: for a second.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe I have an idea.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. DAWN.
text: The same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down
text: Main Street tossing his papers toward the curb. He throws
text: right toward the post office, then left toward the hardware
text: store, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: This time the boy slams into a lamp post. He tumbles off his
text: bike and stares straight ahead in disbelief ...
scene_heading: HIS POV. TOWN HALL.
text: Two men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of
text: paint cans. Above them, however, is painted A VIVID ALMOST
text: UTOPIAN MURAL OF THE TOWN OF PLEASANTVILLE in LIVING COLOR.
text: Instead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life.
text: The post office turns out to be a RICH RED BRICK. The sky
text: shines in vibrant BLUE. It is a rendering of what the town
text: could look like. David and Mr. Johnson sleep soundly next to
text: their own signatures. David opens his eyes and sees the
dialog: paperboy ...
scene_heading: ANGLE. PAPER BOY.
text: He turns around and rides away as fast as he can.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL. LATER ...
text: A huge crowd has gathered. There is a loud buzz in the air.
text: David and Mr. Johnson stand side by side in front of their
text: work like they're presenting and guarding it at the same
dialog: time.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. CROWD.
text: Most of the faces are black and white. A few near the back
text: are in color. Big Bob moves through the back of the crowd,
text: hurriedly buttoning his shirt. The buzz grows and the people
text: part as he heads toward the front of the pack ...
scene_heading: ANGLE. FRONT OF CROWD.
text: When Bob emerges from the crowd, Mr. Johnson flinches
text: slightly. David just looks him in the eye and tries to find
text: as much courage as he can. "Big" Bob looks up at the color
text: rendering of his town with absolute horror. His eye scans the
text: green trees, the bright yellow gas station, the puffy pink
text: clouds on the horizon.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: Did you do this?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly but clearly)
dialog: Yes I did.
text: Bob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Do you know that it's illegal?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Yes I do.
text: Bob looks dumbfounded. He tries to process the whole thing
text: but just looks more confused. Bob runs his hand through his
text: hair, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because anybody should be able to
dialog: paint in whatever color they want.
scene_heading: ANGLE. BACK OF CROWD.
text: Betty stands beside Margaret and Jennifer watching the
text: spectacle. There are tears in her eyes and a great deal of
text: love. Jennifer smiles with pride at her brother ...
scene_heading: SHOT. BOB.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're not allowed to do this! I
dialog: could arrest you for this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Still doesn't make it right.
text: There is some clapping from the back of the crowd. Bob's eyes
text: widen. His face goes flushed (darker gray). A vein bulges in
text: his neck. He turns to the police chief.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dan! Arrest them!
speaker_heading: DAN (POLICE CHIEF)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Um ... I don't know how to do that,
dialog: Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What do you mean!?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well, I never had to do it before.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You put handcuffs on them and you
dialog: take them to the police station.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Oh. guess I could do that, then.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (suddenly stronger)
dialog: C'mere, Dan. I'll help you.
text: David walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out.
text: A louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually
text: helps him fasten on the cuffs. Mr. Johnson comes over to join
text: them and the murmur starts to grow ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: NIGHT TIME.
text: A bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky ...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.
text: A group of "colored" kids hangs out on Main Street near the
text: police station. They gaze off into the distance at the barred
text: window of a jail cell. It is elevated half a story above the
text: street. Everything is black and white except for the warm
text: YELLOW LIGHT, that glows through the bars. They know in a
text: glance who's inside.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT.
text: David sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has
dialog: never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the
text: sheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling.
scene_heading: INT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ...
text: Mr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He
text: clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in
dialog: true "inmate" fashion.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. WALL.
dialog: Rather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr.
text: Johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall
text: complete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at
text: his work and smiles.
scene_heading: SHOT. POLICE CHIEF.
text: He approaches David's cell from the other direction and
text: knocks gently on the bars. David turns around.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: There's someone to see you Bud.
speaker_heading: DAVID.
text: David sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could
text: be. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding
text: crosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE
text: LOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought it might be you.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE.
text: He stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's
text: outfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND
speaker_heading: WHITE.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Hope you're proud of yourself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am actually ... Glad to see you've
dialog: finally shown your true colors.
text: Dick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the
text: cell behind him.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Okay, let's cut the shit and get
dialog: right to it. Where's that remote
dialog: control?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Because you're coming home.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Why don't you just take me back
dialog: without it?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Oh. You're a smart little bastard
dialog: aren't you?
dialog: (tightly)
dialog: It's kind of like a restricted
dialog: ticket. You gotta leave the same
dialog: way you came.
text: David just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back
dialog: on the bunk ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So ... I guess as long as I'm
dialog: here, all sorts of things could
dialog: happen to this place. We could
dialog: have pink lawns and blue trees ...
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Just gimme the damn remote!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry. I can't do that.
text: Dick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the
text: barred window.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: I don't know what went wrong.
dialog: You answered every question. You
dialog: knew every detail. The senior
dialog: Prom ... McIntire's Department
dialog: Store. We had all the same warm
dialog: memories: Sock hops. The Church
dialog: Social ...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They weren't my memories.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I borrowed them. It's no good when
dialog: you borrow them.
text: Dick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to
dialog: tremble.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: (containing his rage)
dialog: How long do you think you've been
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (warily)
dialog: I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Much less than that.
dialog: (checks his watch)
text: An hour and a half.
text: David looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad
text: nasty smile.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: See--and this is really great--
dialog: the show was on for what--half an
dialog: hour a week? So that means for
dialog: every week that goes by in
dialog: Pleasantville, only half an hour
text: goes by in the real world.
text: The smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE (CONT)
dialog: Now Buddy, you're going on trial
dialog: tomorrow. And if they find you
dialog: guilty, you're gonna be stuck here
dialog: forever. Well, not forever--lemme
dialog: think ...
dialog: (calculates)
dialog: Five year sentence ... Carry the
dialog: three ... That comes out to ...
dialog: sixteen and a half centuries, and
dialog: that's rounding down.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm going on trial tomorrow?
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: This is TV pal. They don't fool
dialog: around.
text: David is rocked but tries not to show it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (stoicly)
dialog: There's worse places.
speaker_heading: DICK VAN DYKE
dialog: Oh sure. For the first hundred
dialog: years. Then it starts to get a
text: little monotonous.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sleep well.
text: He taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him
text: out. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down
text: the hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David
text: looks around his cell, truly afraid.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: He stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the
text: ceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it
dialog: ... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David
text: crosses to the small window and looks out.
text: HIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW.
text: Across the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall
text: complete with the newly painted mural. The "Utopian" view of
text: Pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable
text: exception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to
text: BLACK AND WHITE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY.
text: It is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the
text: front door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history.
text: There is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air.
scene_heading: INT. TOWN HALL. DAY.
text: The place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce
text: meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews
text: and ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous
text: configuration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped
text: across the back wall.
scene_heading: ANGLE. BENCH.
text: At the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is
text: a large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the
text: front. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings
text: finally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange
text: combination of Franz Kafka and "Inherit the Wind." Big Bob
text: bangs the gavel ...
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: The undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the
text: pews are Black and White. There is a "colored" section in the
dialog: back for standing room only.
scene_heading: ANGLE. JURORS BOX.
text: George is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his
text: relationship to one of the defendants. He is dressed
text: impeccably with his Rotary Pin still gleaming on his lapel.
text: After a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of
dialog: the room ...
scene_heading: ANGLE. BETTY.
text: She stands in the back with the rest of the "colored" faces.
text: Betty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of David or Mr.
text: Johnson. All at once, a hush goes through the crowd.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DOORWAY.
text: It swings open and David and Mr. Johnson are led in wearing
text: handcuffs. Dan, the Police Chief (now ballif), shows them to
text: a table in the center of the room directly facing Big Bob.
text: There is no lawyer present. There is also no prosecutor.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DAVID.
text: He glances around a little confused. (Weird courtroom.) Big
text: Bob bangs the gavel.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Bud Parker and William Johnson,
dialog: you have been charged with
dialog: desecration of a public building
dialog: and the intentional use of
dialog: prohibited paint colors in
dialog: violation of the Pleasantville
dialog: Code of Conduct and laws of
dialog: common decency. Do you admit that
dialog: on the night of May 1, you did
dialog: consciously and willfully apply
text: the following FORBIDDEN colors to
dialog: the Pleasantville Town Hall:
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce,
dialog: Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox
dialog: Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson,
text: Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Um ... Yes I do. Where's our
dialog: lawyer?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We prefer to keep these
dialog: proceedings as "pleasant" as
dialog: possible. I don't think a lawyer
dialog: will be necessary.
text: There is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the
text: black and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then
dialog: proceeds.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: Do you further admit that this
dialog: was done surreptitiously and
dialog: under the cover of darkness?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well--it was dark out ...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Good. Do you further admit that
dialog: this unnatural depiction occurred
dialog: in full public view where it was
dialog: accessible to, and in plain sight
dialog: of, minor children?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It was accessible to everyone.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Very well. Let the record show
dialog: that the defendants have answered
dialog: in the affirmative to all the
dialog: charges.
text: He looks directly at them for the first time.
speaker_heading: BOB (CONT)
dialog: Do you have anything to say in
dialog: your defense?
scene_heading: SHOT. DEFENSE TABLE.
text: Mr. Johnson just looks at David, confused and terrified.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: I didn`t mean to hurt anybody.
dialog: I just have to paint ... I
dialog: need to.
text: He gropes for something else to say, but what else is there?
text: David glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat.
text: David rises from his chair.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think I've got something to say.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Very well ...
text: David looks out over the audience. After a moment or two, he
text: looks back at Big Bob.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think I know why you're doing
dialog: this. I mean, I understand why
dialog: you're doing this. I used to
dialog: feel the same way. I used to
dialog: want this place to stay just the
dialog: way it was. I never wanted it to
dialog: change ...
text: There is a loud MURMUR. Big Bob bangs the gavel.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (he smiles slightly)
dialog: But nothing stays the same. You
dialog: get things, and you lose things,
dialog: and that's the good part and the
dialog: bad part--but you can't have a
dialog: good part without a bad part.
text: He turns and sees his mother in the balcony. They lock eyes
text: for a moment. David smiles slightly and continues.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: It's like the basketball team.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: The basketball team?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure. Everybody's upset because
dialog: they're not winning anymore--but
dialog: just think how it would feel if
text: all of a sudden they do win.
text: There's a murmur in the gallery.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Wouldn't it feel better than when
dialog: they used to win all the time?
text: There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob looks concerned.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: See, I know you want it to stay
dialog: "Pleasant" but there are so many
dialog: things that are so much better:
dialog: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or
dialog: Dangerous ... or Wild ... or
dialog: Brief ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And every one of those things is
dialog: in you all the time if you just
dialog: have the guts to look for them.
dialog: (pointing to the "colored" section)
dialog: Look at those faces back there.
dialog: They're no different than you are.
dialog: They just happened to see
dialog: something inside themselves that
dialog: you don't want to ...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Okay--that's enough!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought I was allowed to
dialog: defend myself.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're not allowed to lie.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not lying ... Here I'll show
dialog: you.
text: He turns suddenly toward the jury box.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Mr. Simpson ...
speaker_heading: MR. SIMPSON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What color is that hedge of yours?
speaker_heading: MR. SIMPSON
dialog: Green.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, not that hedge. The other one.
speaker_heading: MR. SIMPSON
dialog: The other one?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The one in your mind. The one
dialog: that you see on a bright cold
dialog: morning. The one that you see
dialog: when you walk in front of your
dialog: house and you just stand there
dialog: and stare.
text: Mr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy
text: look in his eye.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: What color is that hedge?
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. MR. SIMPSON.
text: SUDDENLY AND BEFORE OUR EYES, MR. SIMPSON TURNS TO LIVING
text: COLOR. A huge MURMUR moves through the courtroom. Bob bangs
text: the gavel.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I said, that's enough!
speaker_heading: VARIOUS VOICES FROM
speaker_heading: THE AUDIENCE
dialog: "No ... Let him finish ... Go on ..."
text: Big Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David
text: suddenly turns toward George.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alright. Dad ...
scene_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE.
text: There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen
text: while David confronts his "father." George straightens up.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (solemn)
dialog: Yes Bud.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Don't you miss her?
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. GEORGE.
text: He looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody
text: listens. George just stares at him like he got shot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I mean, of course you do, but it
dialog: isn't just the cooking or the
dialog: cleaning that you miss--it's
dialog: something else, isn't it ...
text: George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as
text: he glances toward the back of the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: (softer whisper)
dialog: Maybe you can't even describe it.
dialog: Maybe you only know it when it's
dialog: gone. Maybe it's like there's a
dialog: whole piece of you that's missing
dialog: too.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: You might even call it "love."
speaker_heading: BIG BOB
dialog: (BANGING the gavel loudly)
dialog: Okay, that's IT!!!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (motioning toward the back)
dialog: Now don't you think she looks just
dialog: as pretty in color? Don't you
dialog: think she looks just as pretty as
dialog: she did the day you met her?
text: Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls
text: down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a
text: long trail of COLOR behind it.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Don't you wish you could tell her
dialog: that?
text: He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him
text: through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (POUNDING the gavel)
dialog: YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why am I out of order?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO
text: TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well I don't think it's a circus.
dialog: And I don't think they do either.
text: David motions behind him to the black and white section.
text: There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But see that's just the point. It
dialog: can't stop at once. Because it's
dialog: in you. And you can't stop
dialog: something that's in you.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (tightly)
dialog: It's not in ME.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh sure it is.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No it isn't.
text: He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans
text: over the bench and gets right up in his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (smug whisper)
dialog: What do you want to do to me
dialog: right now?
text: Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves
dialog: closer.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: C'mon. Everyone's turning colors.
text: Kids are making out in the street.
dialog: No one's getting their dinner--
dialog: hell, you could have a flood any
dialog: minute ... Pretty soon you could
dialog: have the women going off to work
dialog: while the men stayed home and
dialog: cooked ...
speaker_heading: BIG BOB
dialog: That's not going to happen!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But it could happen.
speaker_heading: BIG BOB
dialog: No it couldn't!
text: Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts
text: around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of
text: his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely
text: RED IN THE FACE.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: A gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and
text: just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big
text: Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP. BIG BOB.
text: He sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down
text: at his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob
text: freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and
text: flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom.
scene_heading: ANGLE. DOORWAY.
text: As Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town
text: Square GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep
text: green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators
text: bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd
text: moves outside.
scene_heading: EXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!)
text: All the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars,
text: Green hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally
text: turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David
text: walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his
text: creation. The whole town is washed in joy.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet
text: in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of
text: conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like
text: spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and
text: looks at her brother making out.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ...
text: David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David
text: throws his arms around his sister as more and more people
text: stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.
text: David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She
text: clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I told you. I'm like positive.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This thing works. We could go
dialog: home right now.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'm not ready yet. I gotta do
dialog: this for a little while.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge).
text: A large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first
text: time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning.
text: Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit
text: of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Besides. You think there's like
dialog: a chance I'm gonna get into
dialog: college back there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (thinks ...)
dialog: Honestly ... no.
text: They both smile.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: You got the admissions letter.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Right here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And you're sure about this?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I've done the slut thing, David.
dialog: It's really kinda old.
text: David nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll come back and check on you
dialog: in a month.
text: Jennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a
dialog: couple of seconds.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You're like the coolest brother
dialog: in the world.
text: David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly
text: hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge
text: Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at
text: the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at
text: her brother, then turns toward the door ...
scene_heading: EXT. MARGARETS HOUSE. DAY.
text: She clutches her umbrella at her side. David holds a bag of
text: oatmeal cookies. Each one clings on to the other one's
text: clothing. Their faces are inches apart.
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: You're gonna forget about me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No I won't. I swear.
text: Margaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her
text: arms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft
text: kiss. The umbrella falls to the ground ...
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: I like calling you David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I like it too.
scene_heading: INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM.
text: David stands in front of the television with Mr. Johnson at
text: his side. He holds the remote control in his hand. Mr.
text: Johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Well how do you know it won't go
dialog: back to the way it was?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're gonna keep painting aren't
dialog: you?
text: Mr. Johnson nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT)
dialog: Well ...
text: He nods again and thinks about it. They smile at each other
dialog: one last time.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: (remembering something)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (reaching into his pocket)
dialog: I've got something for you.
text: He pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it
text: to David who unfolds it and instantly smiles.
scene_heading: INSERT. PAPER.
text: It is a small painted replica of their mural in the same
text: vibrant colors. Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like
text: the one on the wall.
scene_heading: SHOT. DAVID.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: MR. JOHNSON
dialog: Just a little--You know.
text: David looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances
text: toward the door.
speaker_heading: WIDER.
text: Betty is standing there holding a brown paper bag. A sweater
text: is draped over her arm.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (extending the bag)
dialog: I made you these for the trip.
dialog: They're marshmallow rice squares.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thanks. I thought you weren't
dialog: gonna ...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (painful/
dialog: quieter)
dialog: I had to say goodbye.
text: She looks up at David and their eyes lock. Betty hands him
text: the bag.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
text: There's a meatloaf sandwich in
dialog: there too. Don't go skipping
dialog: dinner just 'cause you're not
dialog: here anymore.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (voice quivering)
dialog: And ... wear this on the trip in
dialog: case it gets cold.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: ... It's a pretty short trip.
text: She nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders
text: anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. Then
text: she throws her arms around his neck.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I'm so proud of you, Bud.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thanks ... I love you.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I love you too.
text: She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty
text: flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT)
dialog: Well ...
text: She steps back and looks at him. David glances down at the
dialog: remote.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You better stand back a little.
text: Betty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room.
text: David points the remote at the TV ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DAY.
text: All the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A
text: WESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl. A second
text: or two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform
dialog: synchronization.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM.
text: He stands in the middle of the living room looking at his
text: new/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was. The
text: black onyx coffee table. The clean burbur rug. The big screen
text: TV in its sleek black cabinet. David looks at it and smiles.
text: The place is inadvertantly in black and white.
speaker_heading: CLOSER.
text: He reaches forward and turns on the TV (by hand) flipping
text: around the dial. Jerry Springer is berating a prostitute ...
text: Tony Robbins hawks self-improvement in an infomercial ...
text: Court TV is doing an O.J. recap. David unfolds Mr. Johnson's
text: sketch and glances down at it. He smiles to himself. A
dialog: different kind of nostalgia ...
speaker_heading: END
dialog:
