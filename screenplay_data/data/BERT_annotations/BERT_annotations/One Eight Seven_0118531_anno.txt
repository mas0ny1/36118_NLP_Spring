dialog: <br/> He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears
text: <br/> wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased
text: <br/> slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at
dialog: <br/> once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass
text: <br/> on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD.
dialog: <br/>
text: <br/> ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade

text: <br/> No response, but it doesn't phase Trevor. He removes

dialog: <br/>
speaker_heading: <br/> TREVOR
dialog: <br/> The purpose of the bicycle is to
dialog: <br/> demonstrate the principle of
dialog: <br/> centripetal force. That's the
dialog: <br/> opposite of the force we studied
dialog: <br/> yesterday, which was...
dialog: <br/>
scene_heading: <br/> VOICE IN THE CROWD
dialog: <br/> Magnum force.
dialog: <br/>
text: <br/> Hoots and laughter.
dialog: <br/>
speaker_heading: <br/> TREVOR
dialog: <br/> Centrifugal force... Centripetal
dialog: <br/> force is where the acceleration of
dialog: <br/> a body moving in circular motion
text: <br/> is directed toward its center by an
dialog: <br/> opposing force, thus creating
dialog: <br/> momentum that constrains the body to
text: <br/> its circular path. Like a gyroscope.
dialog: <br/> (sees nothing
dialog: <br/> but yawns)
dialog: <br/> It's better if I show you. Here,
dialog: <br/> Tywan, you be my helper.

speaker_heading: <br/> TREVOR

speaker_heading: <br/> MR. GARCIA

dialog: <br/> ... Let me try and explain

dialog: <br/> our students here at John Quincy
dialog: <br/> Adams like they're my clients.
dialog: <br/> I can't accuse anybody just on
dialog: <br/> your hunches. I need more than

dialog: <br/> (looking at Hyland)
dialog: <br/> I won't have another law suit like
dialog: <br/> we did with that Blackwell case.
dialog: <br/> (now to Trevor)
dialog: <br/> Boy's mother spent $400 that she
dialog: <br/> couldn't afford on new clothes for
dialog: <br/> her son. Unfortunately we
dialog: <br/> considered the clothing gang
dialog: <br/> attire and sent the boy home.
dialog: <br/> That cost the district a quarter
dialog: <br/> of a million dollars.
dialog: <br/> (beat)
dialog: <br/> So I want you to be straight with

speaker_heading: <br/> TREVOR
dialog: <br/> No, I didn't...

speaker_heading: <br/> MR. GARCIA
