dialog: 
scene_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HITCH
dialog:

dialog: to see most.
dialog: 
text: A BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The
text: Mountain Eagle in 1926. He picks it up and looks at it:
dialog: 
text: The young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically
text: calling "Action!" on his first film. His eyes don't have to
text: move far to find ALMA, standing just behind him, making notes
text: on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face.
dialog: 
dialog: They look so young...

scene_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK

scene_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK

speaker_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALMA

dialog: 
text: Lew escorts Alma and Peggy into the auditorium.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK THEATER, PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The soothing whir of the projector as Hitchcock stands next
text: to it... but the sound of the audience below TITTERING
text: NERVOUSLY is anything but reassuring.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK
dialog: (under his breath)
text: But they're laughing too much.
dialog: 
text: He peers down through the tiny window but can't see a bloody
dialog: thing.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK THEATRE, DOWNSTAIRS LOBBY - A MINUTE LATER
dialog: 
text: Hitch inches open the door and PEERS THROUGH THE CRACK at the
text: audience but now he can't read them. Are they gripped with
dialog: suspense -- or do they just hate it?
dialog: 
text: From the lobby we see
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HITCH
dialog: 
text: as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the
text: empty corridor. A scared, lonely, corpulent figure. Totally
dialog: powerless.
dialog: 
text: There's nothing for him to do but wait.
dialog: 
dialog: And wait.
dialog: 
dialog: And wait.
dialog: 
text: Across the foyer, a spotty young THEATRE EMPLOYEE sweeps up
text: ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his
text: business, entirely oblivious...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON HITCH'S FACE
dialog: 
text: As he grips the railing. This is taking far too long.
dialog: 
text: And then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world A
scene_heading: BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM.
dialog: 
text: Soon the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMS IN TERROR... then breaks into
text: LAUGHTER again... nervous laughter this time, the best kind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HITCH
dialog: 
text: As he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his
text: orchestra, raising them up again as the audience STARTS
text: SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue
dialog: 
text: PUSHING TIGHTER ON HITCH
dialog: 
text: As the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out...
text: leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a
dialog: smile... the largest of his whole career.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - LATER
dialog:

scene_heading: WOMAN WAITING ON LINE
dialog: Mr. Hitchcock, how does it end?
dialog: 
scene_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK
dialog: I promised Mother I wouldn't tell.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THEATER MANAGER
dialog: Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my
dialog: wife won't take a shower after seeing
dialog: your movie?
dialog: 
scene_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK
dialog: Have her dry-cleaned.
dialog: 
text: Laughter as Lew appears.

dialog: 
scene_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK
dialog: What did he say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEW WASSERMAN

text: appreciatively, relents.
dialog: 
text: As the flashbulbs start to POP --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALMA
dialog: This could be the biggest hit of your
dialog: career, Alfred.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK
dialog: Our career, Alma.
dialog: 
text: He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep, intense
text: gratitude and joy. As more flashbulbs pop --

speaker_heading: ALFRED HITCHCOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: I've realized I'll never be able to find
dialog: a Hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALMA
dialog: You do realize I've been waiting decades
dialog: to hear you say that.
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: else knows or wants to tell...
dialog: (he leans a little closer)
dialog: ... there is a God and he's so big and
dialog: powerful, he doesn't always remember
dialog: you're there...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ED GEIN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... but if you can get his attention and
dialog: he sees you're suffering, he'll notice

dialog: that we got to keep our house -- and the

speaker_heading: A SMALL BIRD
