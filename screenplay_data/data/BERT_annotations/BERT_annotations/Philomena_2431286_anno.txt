scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
text: PHILOMENA sits at a pew in a largely empty church - there are
text: two other WORSHIPPERS dotted about; there is no service. She
text: is looking at a statue of Madonna and Child.
text: A PRIEST passes PHILOMENA and stops to talk. He is dressed in
text: a black sweater and dog collar rather than formal robes.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Hello Philomena, haven’t seen you
dialog: for a while?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I just came in to light a candle.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Someone special?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Yes.
text: But she pointedly doesn’t elaborate any further. The PRIEST
text: tries to continue the conversation:
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: How’s the new hip?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: It's very good. It’s Ti-tanium.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Oh, the bionic woman...
text: She smiles, but he can see she’s not really in the mood for
dialog: talking.
speaker_heading: PRIEST (CONT’D)
dialog: Well, always nice to see you.
text: He carries on. PHILOMENA returns her gaze to the Madonna and
dialog: Child.

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
text: PHILOMENA stands before a row of dozens of little candles
text: burning in sockets. She puts a pound coin in a box, takes a

dialog: over 92...
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Pouncing on this)
dialog: Isn't that high?
text: Now we see ROBERT, Martin’s doctor, mid-50s, chipper.
dialog: Caption: London, 2002
text: ROBERT looks up from a folder of results he’s reading and,
text: familiar with Martin’s hypochondria, ignores the question.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Weight fine... could do with losing
dialog: a centimetre or two off your waist.
dialog: Stool sample outstanding...
text: MARTIN finally perks up at this, raises his eyebrow, pleased
text: with himself. ROBERT notices this...
speaker_heading: ROBERT (cont’d)
dialog: No, that means you haven't provided
dialog: one yet.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh right, yes. No, I’d remember.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
text: (As he shuts the file)
dialog: Did you think it didn’t stink or
dialog: something?
dialog: (Little smile from MARTIN)
dialog: There’s basically nothing wrong
dialog: with you Martin. Um... do you run?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Well... I walk a lot.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Try running.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Worried)
dialog: Do I need to?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I do it. Good for your body and...
dialog: good for your head - Kate says you
dialog: think you’re mildly depressed?
text: MARTIN shrugs.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I got fired. I’m unemployed.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: But it wasn’t your fault, was it?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: That’s probably why I’m depressed -—
dialog: I was sacked for saying something I
dialog: didn't say!
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Try running-
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I said the exact opposite of what I
dialog: was sacked for!
text: Another silence. ROBERT tries a different tack:
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: What are you working on at the
dialog: moment?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I was... thinking of writing a
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: That’s good. What about?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Russian history.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What makes you think it’s
dialog: depression and not just feeling
dialog: sorry for yourself?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Doesn’t have to be Russian history -
dialog: could be something else...

scene_heading: EXT. FUNFAIR, LIMERICK - NIGHT
text: Nineteen year old PHILOMENA LEE, pretty, dark haired, wears a

text: bright lights, the air filled with noise and excitement.
speaker_heading: JOHN (OOV)
dialog: You looking for something?
text: YOUNG PHILOMENA turns to see JOHN, early 20s, with a group of
text: his FRIENDS by a beer tent, smiling at her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
dialog: No.
text: She walks off, he follows.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I haven’t seen yous any place.
dialog: Where are you from?
text: JOHN follows her past the brightly coloured stalls, still
text: cradling his glass of beer.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: Are you from Limerick then?
text: YOUNG PHILOMENA stops by a hoop-la, excited by the attention
dialog: but trying to play it - at least a little - cool.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: Here have a drink of my beer.
text: He holds out his beer. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: Go on take it - what’s the matter
dialog: with you.
text: She relents, takes the glass from him and takes a swig. She
dialog: doesn’t like the taste.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: I like your dress. Did you make it
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
dialog: (Indignant )
dialog: No I bought it in a shop. Anyway,
dialog: me auntie told me I’m not to talk
dialog: to strange men like you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sure I’m not strange. Look at yer
dialog: man over there...
text: He nods to a ruddy-faced man, early 20s, (DECLAN), his ankle-
text: swinger trousers tied up with string, buying a toffee apple
text: from a stall and looking at his purchase with reverence.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: Has a rope for a belt. He should
text: put some jam on his shoes and
text: invite his trousers down for tea.
text: YOUNG PHILOMENA giggles.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: That’s who your auntie was talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
dialog: I wouldn’t mind a bite of his
dialog: toffee apple.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You want a toffee apple?
dialog: (Calls out)
dialog: Declan!
text: DECLAN looks over, smiles, revealing one and a half teeth.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: Come over here.
text: DECLAN, a simple soul, dutifully troops over.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: Do you want this beer?
text: There’s about half a pint left. DECLAN nods enthusiastically.
text: JOHN nods to the toffee apple, a single bite out of it.
speaker_heading: JOHN (cont'd)
dialog: I‘1l swap you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FUNFAIR, LIMERICK - NIGHT
text: JOHN and YOUNG PHILOMENA kiss passionately in a gap between
text: two stalls, hidden from view. JOHN brushes his hand down the

text: bottom. The shot CONTINUES to her hand; OOV she moans
text: softly... she drops the toffee apple she’s holding.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM, JANE’S HOUSE - DUSK
text: CLOSE on PHILOMENA LEE, an elderly Irish lady, watching TV,
text: the blue light playing on the lenses of her glasses. Though
text: distracted, distant with her thoughts, she is half paying
text: attention to a news report on TV about the purchase, for
dialog: forty nine and a half million pounds, of a painting of by
text: Rubens - ‘The Slaughter of The Innocents’.
text: Her daughter JANE, dark-haired, late 30s, enters in a hurry.
text: She pulls a coat over an outfit of black skirt and white top -
dialog: (like a receptionist in Soho House might wear).
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Right, just go up and turn their
text: lights out in half an hour.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Doesn’t she know you’ve got a
dialog: proper job?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m just helping her out tonight -
text: she’s short staffed.
text: The painting flashes up on TV, depicting bloody biblical
text: carnage.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Distracted, talking to
speaker_heading: the TV not JANE)
dialog: Fancy spending all that money on a
dialog: God awful thing like that? If it
dialog: was me I’d take everyone to the
dialog: Brent Cross shopping centre and I’d
dialog: say you can have one thing,
dialog: whatever you like - two things.
text: JANE drops her keys in her bag, she’s ready to go:
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So I'll be back before midnight.
dialog: Okay?
text: PHILOMENA doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: JANE (cont'd)
dialog: Mum?
text: JANE sees her mother is looking down at something in her
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: And I'd get myself a brand new
dialog: Nissan Micro automatic...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mother?
text: She sees PHILOMENA is clutching a small, old, black and white
text: photo with serrated edges. She is late for work but begins to
dialog: sense something is badly wrong.
speaker_heading: JANE (cont'd)
dialog: What is it mum? What’s the matter?
text: PHILOMENA looks up at JANE, tears in her eyes. JANE nods to
dialog: the photo.
speaker_heading: JANE (cont'd)
dialog: What's that?
text: PHILOMENA’S hands start to shake as, slowly, she holds it up.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Voice barely a whisper)
dialog: It’s his birthday. He would have
dialog: been fifty today...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM, ROSCREA - NIGHT
text: YOUNG PHILOMENA, her sweaty face contorted as she screams out
text: in agony. She lays back on a bed, legs in stirrups, in an
text: improvised delivery room above the chapel. She’s in the
text: advanced stages of labour - but there are complications.
text: As two OLDER NUNS look on impotently, wringing their hands,
text: she is attended by a younger nun just a few years older than
text: her. This is Sister ANUNCIATA, pale, red-haired, terrified.
text: She looks at a pair of forceps in a metal bowl and knows she
dialog: should attempt to use them - but they seem monstrous,
text: medieval. YOUNG PHILOMENA grabs ANUNCIATA’S hand as another
text: spasm grips her body.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
dialog: Don’t let them put him in the
dialog: ground. It’s cold there... it’s
dialog: dark there...
text: ANUNCIATA extricates her hand and hurries away from the bed,
text: leaving YOUNG PHILOMENA frightened, distraught...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY, ROSCREA - NIGHT
text: Other inmates of Roscrea, ‘fallen’ YOUNG GIRLS like
text: Philomena, a couple of them obviously pregnant, kneel by
text: their beds in prayer. They are watched over by MOTHER
text: BARBARA, mid-50s, kind-faced, the most senior nun at Roscrea.
text: From upstairs they can hear PHILOMENA crying out in pain; we
text: see how frightened the YOUNG GIRLS are, some in tears.
speaker_heading: MOTHER BARBARA
dialog: (Soothing voice)
dialog: Pray girls. Pray for the Magdalen.
text: As they whisper their prayers ANUNCIATA enters the dormitory
text: and hurries up to MOTHER BARBARA.
speaker_heading: ANUNCIATA
dialog: Reverend Mother, please - we must
dialog: get a doctor. The baby is the wrong
dialog: way round, it’s breech.
dialog: 10.
text: MOTHER BARBARA is aware the YOUNG GIRLS are listening
text: intently. In that same, soothing voice, she replies:
speaker_heading: MOTHER BARBARA
dialog: It’s in God’s hands now.
text: Now we see the hardness in her, the darkness of her eyes.
speaker_heading: MOTHER BARBARA (cont'd)
dialog: The pain is her penance. It will
text: help absolve her of her sin.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM, ROSCREA - NIGHT
text: YOUNG PHILOMENA thrashes about, delirious. The OLDER NUNS can
text: do no more than press wet cloths to her head.
text: ANUNCIATA enters, looks at YOUNG PHILOMENA in such pain. She
text: sees again the forceps on the side and cries out in anguish:
speaker_heading: ANUNCIATA
dialog: I don’t know how to do it!
text: Mother Barbara’s words are in her head... ‘it’s in God’s
text: hands now’... but she cannot do it - she cannot just stand by
text: and let the girl die. She picks up the forceps and plunges
text: between YOUNG PHILOMENA’S legs. On the girl’s scream..
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOTHER BARBARA'S STUDY, ROSCREA -— DAY
text: Jump back to two months earlier. YOUNG PHILOMENA stands
text: before MOTHER BARBARA and YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE, Mother
text: Barbara’s number two, thin-faced, early 40s. Ashamed of her
text: swollen, pregnant belly, she can barely meet their eyes.
scene_heading: YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
dialog: Did you let him put his hands on
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
dialog: (Beat, humiliated)
dialog: Yes sister.
speaker_heading: MOTHER BARBARA
dialog: And did you enjoy that? Did you
dialog: enjoy your sin?
text: YOUNG PHILOMENA doesn’t answer.
scene_heading: YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
dialog: Did you take your knickers down?
text: YOUNG PHILOMENA looks at the two older women, their eyes
text: boring into her. She is too petrified to answer.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: MOTHER BARBARA
dialog: Answer Sister Hildegarde - did you
dialog: take them down?
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
dialog: (Tears in her eyes)
dialog: Yes.
text: YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE settles back into her chair, turns
text: sniffily to Mother BARBARA:
scene_heading: YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
dialog: He got an awful lot for his toffee
dialog: apple.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
dialog: Oh Reverend Mother the sisters at
dialog: school never told us anything about
dialog: babies or... the thing.
speaker_heading: MOTHER BARBARA
dialog: Did your mother not tell you?
scene_heading: YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE
dialog: Her mother died ten years ago.
speaker_heading: MOTHER BARBARA
dialog: Oh, God rest her soul...
dialog: (Sudden venom)
dialog: But don’t dare to blame the
dialog: sisters! You are the cause of this
dialog: shame. You and your indecency!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM, ROSCREA - NIGHT
text: Back to the birth. With the forceps and her strong fingers,
text: ANUNCIATA pushes and twists the tiny body inside YOUNG
text: PHILOMENA, lying back, drenched in sweat, moaning in pain.
text: Finally, with a gush of pale red liquid onto the white sheet,
text: ANUNCIATA pulls out the baby’s head, dragging a new life into
text: God's world. It’s over and ANUNCIATA, overcome with emotion,
text: holds up the newborn baby to his mother.
speaker_heading: ANUNCIATA
dialog: It’s a boy.
text: She hands him to YOUNG PHILOMENA, who takes him to her chest.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
dialog: I knew.
dialog: Caption: Roscrea, 1952
text: The door to the delivery room opens. MOTHER BARBARA stands in
text: the doorway, taking in the sight of YOUNG PHILOMENA cradling
text: her baby. She makes the sign of the cross.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MOTHER BARBARA
dialog: Thank the Lord.
text: Aware of MOTHER BARBARA’S icy glare but bitter at her

dialog: round with bottles of wine topping up glasses). And now we
text: REVEAL behind her MARTIN, looking ill at ease, wishing he
text: wasn’t there. DAVID, an old friend, same age, chatting with
text: KEITH, 50s, and a woman, 40s, a no-nonsense look about her
speaker_heading: (SALLY MITCHELL).
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Martin!
text: MARTIN forces a smile and joins them.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont'd)
dialog: (Gestures to KEITH)
dialog: Keith you know.
dialog: (Then to SALLY)
dialog: Sally Mitchell this is Martin
dialog: Sixsmith, used to be the BBC’s man
dialog: in Moscow.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: And Washington.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And then became a spin doctor for
dialog: the government, until it all went a
dialog: bit tits up. Is that a fair
dialog: summation Martin?
text: DAVID is not drunk but has obviously had a few drinks.
dialog: JANE, serving, is all ears.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes. Pretty much. I suppose if you
dialog: shovel shit for long enough, you'll
dialog: end up with some on your shoes.
text: They laugh politely.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeh but you got it on your head -
dialog: how did you manage that?
text: They laugh louder - MARTIN too.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, well, you’ve got to have a
dialog: sense of humour about these things.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you up to at the moment?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m thinking of writing a book. On
dialog: Russian history. .?
text: They look at him and no-one responds. Horrible eggy moment.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Or something else. Might try going
dialog: back to journalism-
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I remember you! You’re the one who
dialog: sent that terrible e-mail saying-
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No I didn’t. Common mistake.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (Line overlaps with his)
dialog: -it was a good day to bury bad news
dialog: on 9/11... I thought that was you?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No, that was someone else. What I
dialog: actually did was, one year later,
dialog: on the day of Princess Margaret's
dialog: funeral, send an e-mail saying
dialog: let’s make sure the only thing we
dialog: ‘bury’ today - inverted commas - is
dialog: Princess Margaret.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Which is slightly different.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: It’s totally different. But the
dialog: papers said it was another e-mail
dialog: about burying bad news, nobody from
dialog: the government defended me and... I
dialog: got royally fucked up the arse by a
text: bunch of self interested spineless
dialog: shits.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (Sarcastic)
dialog: But you’ve still got a sense of
dialog: humour about it?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Defiantly)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well if you want to get back into
dialog: journalism, talk to Sally.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh I just do, you know, sob
dialog: stories, human interest stuff - not
dialog: really your cup of tea is it.
text: MARTIN looks at her awkwardly. It isn’t, but he doesn’t want
dialog: to say it isn’t.
speaker_heading: SALLY (cont'd)
dialog: But I’1l be happy to have a look if
dialog: you want to push any ideas my way?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes... please.
text: To escape his embarrassment he walks over to JANE, standing
text: close by.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Could I get a glass of... Pinot
dialog: Grigio please?
text: JANE is obviously not in the mood for niceties:
speaker_heading: JANE
text: It’s just red or white.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh yes, sorry. White then please.
text: But as she pours it, there is the first glimmer of
text: recognition. She’s sure she’s seen Martin before.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I hope you don’t mind me asking but
dialog: didn't you used to be a reporter on
dialog: News At Ten?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Erm, I was the BBC’S correspondent
dialog: yes, in Moscow and then Washington.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know a woman, you see, and she
dialog: had a baby when she was a teenager
dialog: and she kept it a secret for fifty
dialog: years - we only found out about it
dialog: today. And the baby was taken from
dialog: her by these nuns and they made her
dialog: have it adopted. And she kept it a
dialog: secret all this time...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: It’s my mother.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes I guessed.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Would that be of any interest you
dialog: to you - that kind of thing?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Well, I’m actually quite busy
text: writing a book at the moment.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Russian history...
dialog: (On her glazed reaction)
dialog: -which is actually fascinating. And
dialog: what you’re talking about is a
dialog: human interest story, which I don’t
dialog: really do.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Why not?
text: He sees, at the other end of the kitchen, SALLY MITCHELL,
text: DAVID and KEITH laughing with some other GUESTS.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Because human interest tends to be
dialog: a euphemism for stories about
dialog: vulnerable, weak-minded, ignorant,
dialog: people to fill up the pages of
dialog: newspapers read by vulnerable, weak-
dialog: minded, ignorant people.
dialog: (Suddenly realising how
dialog: this sounds)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Not that you are and, um, I hope
dialog: you find him...
text: He takes his wine and walks off, taking a swig. JANE looks
text: totally nonplussed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NOTTING HILL - DAWN
text: Taking his doctor’s words to heart MARTIN, up with the larks,

scene_heading: INT. WESTMINSTER CHURCH - NIGHT
text: A recital. A congregation watches a choir singing John
text: Taverner’s ‘Mother of God’; music fills the beautiful

dialog: pleasure from it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WESTMINSTER CHURCH - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MARTIN sits on the edge of his bed in his boxers and a T-
text: Shirt. Behind him his wife KATE finishes moisturizing her

text: bed. All the while we stay on MARTIN, wrestling with himself.
text: KATE gets into bed and sees that MARTIN has become frozen.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Finally)
dialog: I don’t believe in God. And I don’t
dialog: know when I stopped.
text: A beat, then KATE makes her way over to his side of the bed,
text: realising that her husband is deeply unhappy. She puts her
text: arms around him from behind, comforting him.
dialog: 17.

text: reflection in the glass is super-imposed over her for a
dialog: moment...
text: Curiosity aroused, he strains to get a good look - but gets
text: only intermittent glimpses as a couple cars drive past on
text: their way out of the car park. He notes she’s dressed smartly

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hello I’m Martin, you must be
dialog: Philomena.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Hello Martin.
text: They shake hands; he notes the crucifix around her neck, she

speaker_heading: MARTIN
speaker_heading: (To JANE)
dialog: Hello again.

speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Table’s through here...

speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
speaker_heading: (To JANE)
dialog: Sorry if I was a little rude the

dialog: moment...

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m just glad you managed to track

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh no it’s... nice.
text: They all sit down.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: So how are you Philomena?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I’m all right. I had a new hip last
dialog: year Martin, it’s much better than
dialog: the bone one I had before and it’s
dialog: made of ti-tanium which is metal -
text: but it doesn’t rust.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Well if that happened you’d have to
dialog: have it oiled like the Tin Man
dialog: wouldn’t you.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Oh is that right?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No no - I mean, like the Wizard of

text: PHILOMENA turns to JANE.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: What does he mean?
speaker_heading: JANE
text: He’s just joking mum.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: It was just a joke. No, actually my
dialog: mother has advanced osteoarthritis

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: And where’s that?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Knightsbridge.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Oh well that’1l be expensive.

dialog: for four years, totally cut off
dialog: from the outside world. In order to
dialog: repay the sisters for taking you

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (V.O.)
dialog: The worst jobs were in the laundry,

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (V.O.)
dialog: Anthony was best friends with

speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (V.O.)
dialog: We lived with it every day. Who’s

text: YOUNG PHILOMENA sees the other NUN leave the room, and seizes
text: the opportunity to go and talk to ANUNCIATA.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
speaker_heading: (To KATHLEEN)
dialog: I won’t be a minute.
text: She goes over to ANUNCIATA , sits down next to her and talks
text: in a quiet voice:
speaker_heading: YOUNG PHILOMENA
text: Kathleen’s worried sick. She thinks
dialog: they’re going to take Mary away
dialog: from her. I said if they were going
dialog: to do that they’d tell her first
dialog: for sure...
text: ANUNCIATA is caught between a rock and a hard place. She’s
text: just a young girl herself, and she doesn’t know how to deal
text: with the enormity of what she knows will happen to most of
text: the girls at the abbey. So she clumsily tries to move the
text: conversation on, and pulls something from her robe.
speaker_heading: ANUNCIATA
dialog: (Keeping her voice down)
dialog: I got something for you Phil, but
dialog: you can’t tell anyone about it.
text: She hands YOUNG PHILOMENA a small, black and white

speaker_heading: ANUNCIATA
text: He’s growing up so fast.

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (V.O.)
dialog: We all knew what it meant when a

text: YOUNG PHILOMENA looks around and sees that, temporarily,
text: YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE and one of the other nuns have
text: disappeared - there is only one NUN left, who has her back to
text: her. YOUNG PHILOMENA abandons her duties and crosses to a
text: small basement window high up in the wall. Standing on
text: tiptoes, she sees, beyond a hedge, a dreaded shiny black
text: limousine drive past. KATHLEEN looks up at her piteously,
text: pleadingly. YOUNG PHILOMENA catches the eye of another GIRL,

text: bottom halves of four adults who surround the little girl.
text: Mother BARBARA and YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE - identifiable
text: from their unflattering skirts and shoes - are presenting
dialog: MARY to the couple we saw earlier, the woman recognizable

text: runs into shot, holds MARY’S hand and looks up at the adults.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (V.O.)
dialog: They’d only come for Mary. But
dialog: Anthony wouldn’t let her out of his
dialog: sight. They were inseparable, you
dialog: see...
dialog: 26.
text: The WOMAN crouches down to ANTHONY’S level and touches his
text: face tenderly. But, because she has her back to us, we still
dialog: don’t see her face. We don’t need to, she simply represents

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (V.O.)
dialog: Normally, I loved to sing - it was
dialog: one of the only things I enjoyed at
dialog: that place. But all I could think
dialog: about was poor Kathleen.
text: We can see YOUNG PHILOMENA’S heart isn’t in it, her
text: expression far off, her mind elsewhere. She sees ANUNCIATA
text: enter the chapel and take her place with the NUNS. She
text: catches her friend’s eye and manages to throw her a smile.
text: But ANUNCIATA, hollow-eyed, is unable to return it. YOUNG
text: PHILOMENA sees tears in her friend’s eyes - she’s crying?
dialog: Assuming she must also be upset about Kathleen, YOUNG
text: PHILOMENA carries on as the hymn builds to a crescendo.
text: But now a MAGDALEN GIRL enters the chapel and hurries to join
text: the others. She pushes through until she’s next to YOUNG
text: PHILOMENA, then urgently whispers in her ear. The blood

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I’m fine.

dialog: a moment outside:
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: I’m one of the lucky ones Martin.
dialog: Some of the mothers and babies
dialog: didn’t even survive the childbirth.
dialog: 33.
text: As we see this hit home with MARTIN, PHILOMENA presses the
text: buzzer and, after a few moments, a YOUNG AFRICAN NUN -
text: dressed much less formally than her 1950s counterparts in a
text: blue sweater and white blouse - opens the door.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I’m Philomena Lee. I made an
dialog: appointment.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: Oh yes come in Philomena.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: And this is my friend Martin
dialog: Sixsmith News At Ten.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: Oh, hello.

speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: Sister Claire will be with you

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh yes please.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Yes please. Can I use the bathroom?
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: It’s down stairs on-
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I know where it is.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEETING ROOM, ROSCREA - DAY
text: MARTIN is looking at the photos on the wall... a head and
text: shoulders photo from the early 60s of Mother Barbara and
text: YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE on the Abbey steps, starched Wimples,
text: crucifixes around their necks; a nun holding a baby; two nuns

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD, ROSCREA - DAY
text: CLOSE UP: PHILOMENA, staring straight ahead. We stay on her

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: «+. what she’s looking at: that same view from the courtyard
text: she had fifty years ago. In her mind’s eye, it is just like
text: it was yesterday, the car carrying Anthony disappearing from

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY.
text: MARTIN moves on to a Hollywood publicity photo of the movie
text: star Jane Russell, busty and glamorous, looking incongruous

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY. DAY.
text: PHILOMENA stands looking at the room where the laundry used

text: posh car driving past.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEETING ROOM, ROSCREA —- DAY
text: MARTIN is being nosy, looking round the room. He stands at a
text: bay window and can see, through a window on the other side of
text: a courtyard, in a corridor on the other side of a courtyard
text: they overlook, a very old nun standing with two sticks,
text: staring at him (in fact, this is SISTER HILDEGARDE - though
dialog: we don’t know this yet).
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE (OOV)
dialog: Hello, I’m sister Claire.
text: Startled, he turns round. Sister CLAIRE is mid-40s, kind-
text: faced. She smiles cheerfully; his eyes flick to the crucifix
dialog: she also wears.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oh, hello...
text: He gestures back to the photos on the wall, trying to divert
text: her attention away from what he’s been looking at.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Just admiring your picture of Jayne
dialog: Mansfield.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: No that’s Jane Russell. Jayne
dialog: Mansfield was the blonde one.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Of yes of course, I mean they were
dialog: both very big - I mean the two of
dialog: them, they were huge. Their
dialog: careers.
text: He can’t stop himself glancing down at Sister CLAIRE’S bust.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Which one died in the car crash?
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Jayne Mansfield, yes.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: She was decapitated wasn’t she?
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t know the details. I’m sure
dialog: it was horrible.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Why is she on the wall?
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Sorry, I didn’t catch your name?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Martin Sixsmith.
text: PHILOMENA enters the waiting area.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Brightly)
dialog: He’s Martin Sixsmith, News At Ten.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: BBC news actually. But I’m not with
dialog: them any more.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Hello Philomena, very nice to meet
dialog: you - ah, here’s the tea.
text: The YOUNG NUN lays some tea things and a plate of fruit bread
text: down in front of them and leaves. As SISTER CLAIRE sets the
text: tea and plates, MARTIN manoeuvres himself back to the bay
text: window, sneaks a look sideways and sees the Old Nun (Sister
text: HILDEGARDE) is still there.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE (cont'd)
dialog: Now I was trying to find in our
dialog: records the last time you came to
dialog: see us Philomena?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: It was well before your time Sister
dialog: Claire. Mother Barbara had passed
dialog: away and I spoke to Sister
text: Hildegarde on the telephone - but
dialog: when I came here she wasn’t well
dialog: enough to see me.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: She’s still with us, but she’s very
text: frail now.
text: She lays plates in front of PHILOMENA and MARTIN.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Oh look Martin buttered brack. Have
dialog: some.
text: MARTIN helps himself to a slice; he takes a bite.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Very tasty. It’s a bit like a sort
dialog: of a Pandolce, isn’t it?
dialog: 37.
text: They just stare at him.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: It’s fruit bread Martin.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, no it’s... yes that’s lovely.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Well now - I don’t know if they
dialog: told you last time Philomena, but
dialog: most of our records were destroyed
dialog: in the big fire-
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Fire?
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: -it was before my time. So I’m
dialog: afraid we're at a standstill.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: I have no news. I’m so sorry we
dialog: can’t help you.
text: We can see how much of a blow this is to PHILOMENA, how much
dialog: she'd built herself up.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Yes. Yes...
text: The room falls silent. MARTIN watches as PHILOMENA starts to
text: speak, quietly at first but building in emotion.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: I still go to mass... I don’t want
dialog: to cause any fuss or point the
dialog: finger at anyone, or blame the
dialog: church in any way. I just want to
dialog: know that he’s all right - I don’t
dialog: even have to see him. Sometimes I
dialog: have visions of him and he’s
dialog: homeless and nobody loves him...
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: (Takes PHILOMENA’S hand)
dialog: Philomena we can’t take away your
dialog: pain, but we can walk through it
dialog: with you, hand in hand.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What about some of the older nuns?
dialog: Perhaps they might remember a few
dialog: details?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
text: Most of them have passed on.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What about the ones that haven’t?
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Well I don’t think you’1l get much
text: sense out of them.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Can I try?
text: He sneaks another look and sees a curtain being drawn by
text: someone in front of HILDEGARDE, so he can no longer see
text: inside the room.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: I don’t think that’s going to be
dialog: possible.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: I’m happy to answer any questions
dialog: that Philomena has.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m asking a question.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: You're a journalist.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I used to be, certainly.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Martin’s a Roman Catholic.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes... well, I used to be.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: I'd feel more comfortable if I
dialog: could speak to Philomena in
dialog: private.
dialog: MARTIN has rather enjoyed - for this brief moment - being a
text: journalist again. But, on catching PHILOMENA’S worried
text: expression - she hates confrontation - he reins it back in. A
dialog: beat then, politely:
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Of course.
dialog: 39.
text: He gets up and walks out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GIFT SHOP AREA - DAY
text: MARTIN shuts the door behind him, quietly seething at Sister
text: Claire's obfuscating. He wanders over to the gift shop stand
text: and idly fingers a little plastic Jesus for a few moments -
text: but his mind is elsewhere. Checking he’s not being observed,
text: he crosses to some double doors and peers through them and
text: sees the Old Nun (HILDEGARDE), on her sticks, silhouetted
text: against the light from the open door behind her. Her eyes
text: seem to meet his; her expression inscrutable. MARTIN smiles.
text: He reaches to open the door. Then, from the staircase behind
dialog: him:
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN (OOV)
dialog: Hello - can I help you?
text: MARTIN spins round to see the YOUNG NUN.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Sorry, I was just erm...
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: Are you looking for something?
text: He turns back, just as the door shuts; Sister HILDEGARDE is
text: gone, the light from the room extinguished. The momentary
dialog: opening closed.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Pointing to the door)
dialog: Is that, erm..?
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: Those are private quarters.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Right.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I‘ll wait outside...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROSCREA ABBEY - THE WALL WITH CROSSES. DAY
text: MARTIN is standing in a little graveyard with neatly tended
text: rows of irons crosses. As he walks along the graves he
text: realises from the inscriptions, (Sister Theresa, Sister
dialog: Margaret...), that nuns from the Abbey are buried here.
text: Curious, he walks along until he finds Mother Barbara's
dialog: grave, and notes she died on July 20th, 1990.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSCREA ABBEY - DAY
text: The YOUNG NUN sees a pale-faced PHILOMENA to the front door.
text: PHILOMENA clutches a manila envelope.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Thank you, and would you thank
dialog: Sister Claire again for me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: Goodbye Philomena.
text: The YOUNG NUN disappears back inside, shutting the door
text: behind her and leaving PHILOMENA alone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROSCREA ABBEY - BRAMBLE AREA. DAY
text: The bit between his teeth, MARTIN climbs over a low fence
text: into a small enclosed area adjacent to the nuns’ graveyard
text: which is thoroughly overgrown with weeds, bushes and
text: brambles. He crouches down, peers through the tangle and can
text: just make out a headstone. Using his feet and hands he clears
text: away the overgrowth around it until he can see it properly
text: and reads the inscription: ‘Maria Gidney’, a young woman who
dialog: died in 1962 aged 16, with underneath: ‘Mother And Child Died
dialog: In Childbirth’...
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
text: He uses a stick to clear away bracken from another headstone,
dialog: he reads: ‘Aisling Devlin’, who died in 1957 aged only 14.
text: And again, underneath: ‘Mother And Child Died In Childbirth’.
text: He stands up, surveys the overgrown graveyard and the nuns’
text: graveyard next to it, and the thought hits him: ‘Why are the
text: graves of the nuns beautifully tended, and yet the graves of
dialog: the mothers and children abandoned and overgrown?’
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROSCREA ABBEY - DAY
text: MARTIN hurries back to his car, where PHILOMENA is waiting
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Sorry I was just having a look
dialog: around...
dialog: (Seeing her expression)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: PHILOMENA, obviously upset, doesn’t reply; she just wants to
dialog: get into the car as quickly as possible.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 4l.
scene_heading: INT. BMW, ROSCREA - DAY
text: PHILOMENA sits staring ahead. MARTIN doesn’t start the car.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What did she say to you?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Long beat)
dialog: She said you were a journalist and
dialog: you were trying to manipulate me
dialog: and I should be careful what I say
dialog: to you.
text: She opens her bag, takes out the manila envelope, hands it to
speaker_heading: MARTIN.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont'd)
dialog: And she gave me this.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Do you want me to open it?
text: Again she doesn’t reply. He opens it, takes out a single
text: sheet of paper - obviously a photocopy. He scans it.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: It’s a contract... signed by you,
dialog: in 1955.
dialog: (Reading from it)
dialog: They’ve highlighted part of it...
dialog: (Quotes)
dialog: ‘I hereby relinquish full claim
dialog: forever to my said child-

dialog: to see, interfere with or make any
dialog: claim to the said child at any

dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: I‘ll never find him.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: If they coerced you in any way to
dialog: sign that piece of paper we can
dialog: challenge them legally.

dialog: what? The one piece of paper
dialog: designed to stop you from finding

dialog: God in His infinite wisdom decided

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I signed it because I believed I'd

dialog: what made it so much worse, was
dialog: that I enjoyed it.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: The sex.
text: He turns to face her.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: Oh, it was wonderful. I thought I
text: was floating on air. He was so
dialog: handsome and the way he held me in
dialog: his arms and - well I didn’t even
dialog: know I had a clitoris Martin.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Really?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: And after I had the sex, I thought
dialog: anything that feels so lovely must
dialog: be wrong.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Mutters )
dialog: Fucking Catholics.
dialog: (Realizes what he’s said)
dialog: Sorry.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I spent thirty years as a nurse,
dialog: I’ve heard worse than that.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: It’s just that, why would God
dialog: bestow on us a sexual desire which
dialog: he then wants us to resist? Is it
dialog: some weird game that he’s invented
dialog: to alleviate the boredom of being
dialog: omnipotent? Baffles me... and I
dialog: thought I was pretty clever.
text: They fall quiet; she stares out at the view.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: How did it go?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What, from the Sisters of Little
dialog: Mercy?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (Laughs )
dialog: Just tea and cake then. That’s all

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Mum!
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont'd)
dialog: Night Martin.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Good night Philomena. Night Jane.
text: They exchange a smile, then they leave. MARTIN reflects on
text: things for a few moments. The BARMAN, early 40s, puts another
text: pint of Guinness down in front of him, MARTIN runs a finger
text: down the side of it.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Been up to the Abbey?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes. Yes, it’s obviously changed a

dialog: the same ones they had when the
dialog: Magdalen girls were there.
dialog: From out the back:
speaker_heading: MUM (OOV)
dialog: They’re all gone now!
text: MARTIN flicks a look in the direction the voice came from,

speaker_heading: BARMAN (cont'd)
dialog: There’s not many of them gets any

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I imagine that’s because of the

dialog: everything?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: I’m sure it is.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: How did that start - do you know?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: I should think they put a match to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: The Sisters. Sure they had a great
text: fire out the back in the field.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: So... the building wasn’t damaged?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: They had a fuckin’ big bonfire,
dialog: burnt all the records. Thousands of
dialog: ‘em.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: This was years ago. I suppose they
dialog: were embarrassed about selling all

text: From out the back again:
speaker_heading: MUM (OOV)
dialog: They don’t want people telling
dialog: tales.
speaker_heading: BARMAN

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: BARMAN

speaker_heading: MUM (cont'd)

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: That’s unbelievable... babies were
dialog: sold?
speaker_heading: MUM
dialog: They said she came in here and
dialog: asked for Bourbon but they had to

dialog: But I’m not one to repeat gossip.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No, no... I can see that.
text: As she says this MARTIN finds his eye resting on a ‘Madonna

speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: So how did they decide who got a
dialog: baby?
speaker_heading: MUM
dialog: If you were a Catholic with a

speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)

speaker_heading: MARTIN

scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT
dialog: (Previously Sc 66)
text: 1982. Poor quality, taped VHS of news footage of a photo
dialog: opportunity at the White House; President REAGAN is
text: surrounded by ADVISORS. He turns to shake hands with the aide
text: to his right; we see that it’s MICHAEL, smiling nervously but
text: undeniably thrilled to be amongst such illustrious company.
text: We now see he is a man with what appears to be a stellar
dialog: career in the making. But his appearance - conservative
dialog: career-man - is totally at odds with the night-clubber we saw
dialog: in scene 66.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MARTIN’S ROOM, WASHINGTON DC HOTEL - NIGHT
text: MARTIN has fallen asleep on his bed still fully clothed.
text: Woken by his door buzzer, he rouses himself and answers it.
text: He looks through the spyhole and sees PHILOMENA outside in
text: her dressing gown. He steels himself and opens the door.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Martin I wanted to tell you
dialog: something earlier but it slipped my
dialog: mind, and I was going to tell you
dialog: on the phone but I forgot the
dialog: number, so I thought I’d come and
dialog: tell you in person what with you
text: only being along the corridor.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: What I wanted to say was, thank you
dialog: Martin, for helping me to look for
dialog: my son. I know you got the sack
dialog: from your job - not News At Ten -
dialog: the other one. And I just want to
dialog: say, that their loss is my gain.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Stunned for a moment)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Good night Martin.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Good night.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BREAKFAST AREA, WASHINGTON DC HOTEL - DAY
text: MARTIN is sitting at a table, working at his laptop, sipping
text: from a black coffee. The breakfast area is busy, and in front
text: of him PHILOMENA is enjoying herself investigating what is on
text: offer at the hot buffet.
text: CLOSE UP: the computer screen. MARTIN is working through a
text: long list of files; we see pictures of different males of
text: varying ages, all named ‘Anthony’ or ‘Tony’ Lee. Some
text: Christian names are spelt with a ‘h’, some without; some
text: surnames spelt ‘Leigh’ or ‘Lea’. Each file is different, some
text: have a military appearance, some civil, some even appear to
dialog: be criminal records.
dialog: 68.
text: MARTIN looks up and sees PHILOMENA chatting with the CHEF at
text: the omelette station and overhears a snatch of conversation.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: -we don’t really have Mexicans in
dialog: England, we have the Indians
dialog: instead, and everybody loves curry.
text: He returns to his laptop. He is checking the photos attached
text: to the records; one is a cutting showing a blonde businessman
text: shaking hands with somebody; another is a young black boy,
text: another is a man in a marines uniform. MARTIN dwells on some,
text: but quickly rejects others. He dials a number on his mobile;
text: waits impatiently for it to go through:
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hi Caroline it’s Martin Sixsmith.
dialog: Hi...
dialog: (Listens )
dialog: Yes, I’m not getting any joy, but I
dialog: just wanted to check - you know the
dialog: file with the immigration cuttings?
dialog: (Listens )
dialog: I know you’ve checked, but could
dialog: you send me a link anyway?
dialog: (Listens )
dialog: Thanks.
text: He hangs up as PHILOMENA comes back over to the table,
text: glancing briefly at the screen.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Martin they’ve got pancakes over
dialog: there, and waffles and omelettes -
dialog: any filling - and cereals and bacon
dialog: and sausage and-
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yeh I know what’s over there.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: -anything you like. The breakfast
dialog: is included isn’t it?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, yes - I’m just not hungry. My
text: stomach hasn’t woken up yet.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Mine wakes up before I do. I’m
dialog: having a ham and Swiss cheese
dialog: omelette - shall I get you one?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No thank you.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Why don’t you have some
dialog: blueberries?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Anything to stop the
dialog: relentless barrage)
dialog: Okay, yes. Great.
text: Now a WAITRESS approaches their table.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Okay if you want to help yourself
dialog: to breakfast over there we have a
text: hot and cold buffet, fresh fruit

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I know-
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: -fillings.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: -I know exactly what is available
dialog: for breakfast. So. Thank you.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (Trying to tempt him)
dialog: We also have fresh pancakes?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Sharply)
dialog: No. Thank you. I’m trying to have a
dialog: private conversation here.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: My apologies sir.
text: The WAITRESS leaves.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: There’s no need to be rude. He’s a
dialog: very kind man, Antonio.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes, I’m sure he’s one in a million
dialog: - well one in a hundred thousand.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You've said that to at least ten
dialog: people now - so that’s just maths.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: You should be nice to people on the
dialog: way up because you might meet them
dialog: again on the way down. I’d have
dialog: thought you of all people would
dialog: understand that.
text: This stings, though maybe she didn’t mean it to. And then
dialog: again, maybe she did?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: I’d rather you were rude to me than
dialog: the nice people who work here.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m trying to help you find your
dialog: son, that’s why we’re here. Okay?
dialog: So, please-
dialog: (Gestures to laptop)
dialog: -just for now, can I have some
dialog: quiet time?
text: PHILOMENA looks at him, her nose defiantly up in the air. She
text: goes to say something but stops herself.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BREAKFAST AREA, WASHINGTON DC HOTEL - DAY
text: MARTIN is studying his laptop. He sees a new e-mail in his
dialog: inbox from ‘Owsianoska, Caroline’, entitled ‘Anthony Lee’. He
text: opens it and clicks on a link. As he waits for it to download
text: he sees PHILOMENA back at the omelette station, and catches a
text: snippet of her renewed conversation with the CHEF.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: -were you born in Mexico? Well you
dialog: must like nachos? My grand daughter
dialog: Natalie got me into them. I’ve
dialog: never been to Mexico - I hear it’s
dialog: lovely apart from the kidnappings-
text: Shaking his head in exasperation, he turns back to the screen
text: where an image downloads line by line from the top of the
text: screen. We make out a blurry newspaper photo of a little boy
text: and girl, holding hands with a smart, middle-aged couple
text: posing at an airport arrivals lounge. MARTIN hears PHILOMENA
text: share a laugh with the CHEF and is about to look over to them
text: when the image reveals the boy is holding a tin toy aeroplane
text: in his hand. Stunned, he recognizes it instantly. He has
text: found Anthony. The headline above the cutting reads: ‘New
dialog: Life For Irish Orphans’.
dialog: 71.
text: Excited, he scans the article, picks up the surname Hess then
text: finds the boy’s Christian name: Michael.
text: He puts ‘Michael Hess, D.O.B. 07.05.52’ into a search engine,
text: waits a few moments, then clicks on a site - the official
text: site of the Republican Party. There is a picture of the adult
text: Michael, early 30s, smiling, in a formal head and shoulders
text: pose. But it’s the passage at the top of the page which jolts
scene_heading: him: Michael A. Hess: (b) 07.05.52 - (d) 08.15.95. He stares
dialog: at the legend (d). Surely not..?
text: Scarcely able to believe it, he scans the article below the
dialog: picture, picks out some key sentences: ‘Michael was brought
dialog: to the US from Ireland by his adoptive parents...’ and then,
dialog: at the end: ’... Michael died on August 15th, 1995.’
dialog: See MARTIN: Oh God, he’s dead...
text: MARTIN looks up to see PHILOMENA making her way back to the
text: table with her omelette and a bowl of raspberries. In a panic
text: he quickly shuts down the window showing the young Anthony
text: clutching the aeroplane.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: They’ve run out of blueberries so I
dialog: got you raspberries instead.
text: MARTIN just stares at her, frozen expression. She
text: misinterprets this as an admonishment.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry. Quiet time.
text: As PHILOMENA puts down her tray she glances at the screen,
text: now just displaying the image of the adult Michael in the
text: formal pose. She stares at it and, even though she can’t know
text: what Anthony would look like as a grown man, puts her hand to
text: her chest.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: That’s my Anthony.
text: She looks at MARTIN, who doesn’t answer. But his eyes not
dialog: only confirm this they tell her something else... she
text: clutches her crucifix.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont'd)
dialog: He’s dead... isn’t he.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: (A beat then he whispers,
dialog: choked)
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: A WAITRESS hovers holding a coffee pot.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: WAIRTESS
dialog: Coffee?
text: There’s no answer; the WAITRESS hovers, obviously unaware of
dialog: what is happening.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Anguished)
dialog: He doesn’t want coffee he wants
dialog: blueberries!
text: PHILOMENA starts to cry.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (To the WAITRESS)
dialog: Thank you, we don’t need anything.
text: MARTIN tries to comfort PHILOMENA, putting his arms round her
text: awkwardly, self-consciously, speaking quietly to her.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: I’m so sorry...
text: She readily accepts the comfort.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON 7TH STREET - NIGHT

text: We see PHILOMENA in the back of a taxi on the way to the

text: taxi stops at some traffic lights.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - WASHINGTON - NIGHT
text: BACH CONTINUES, building to a swell...
text: PHILOMENA stares out at the PEOPLE in the street; she can’t
dialog: understand how life is going on when Anthony is gone. She
text: sees a YOUNG WOMAN picked up by her BOYFRIEND and swung round
text: playfully as he gives her a kiss. He then pretends lifting

text: of iconography - a huge Calvin Klein poster in portrait
text: aspect of a beautiful female model laughing in a casual
text: embrace with a devastatingly handsome, be-stubbled male

speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (Interrupts him)
dialog: Wait - you’re at the airport?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yeh. Obviously she wants to get
text: back home, be with her daughter.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What about the story?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Confused)
dialog: Well... he’s dead.
text: SALLY shakes her head curtly at the SUB EDITOR - she doesn’t
dialog: like his layout.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Dead or alive, happy or sad - you
dialog: said it - they’re both good. Spin
dialog: it, find a story..
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yeh, but if I stay here and she
dialog: goes, no-one’s going to answer my
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Then keep her there.

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What? Come on... she’s in bits.

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yes, you signed a contract. Call me
dialog: when you've got something.
text: She hangs up. MARTIN looks at PHILOMENA, sitting quietly,
text: looking up at the poster. He feels a wave of terrible guilt.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MARTIN sits down next to PHILOMENA. A few moment’s silence as
text: they both look up at the poster together; PHILOMENA stares at
text: the female model, laughing, carefree.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I remember that day at the fair,
dialog: his father made me laugh by
text: pretending to be an old man.
dialog: (Smiles, remembering)
dialog: And then I made him laugh by
text: pretending to be an old lady.
dialog: (Beat, the smile
dialog: disappears)
dialog: And now I am one... I’1l never know
dialog: if Anthony ever thought about me.
dialog: I’‘1l never be able to say sorry.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Beat, not quite sure how
dialog: to put it)
dialog: Look, we don’t have to...
dialog: (Voice tails off)
dialog: We can... stay.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Stay?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: If you want to?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: What for?
text: And now he must grit his teeth and begin the lie.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I was thinking we could... maybe
dialog: talk to some people who knew him,
dialog: find out what happened to him?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I think I’d rather just go home.
dialog: On Martin: so this is what it has come down to - forced to
text: persuade an old lady to stay with him against her wishes,
dialog: against his better judgement.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I... think it might help, in terms
dialog: of your loss.
text: She looks at him, unable to speak for a moment.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Will it?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: There’s lot of research which
dialog: suggests that... people who’ve
dialog: suffered a loss can help...
dialog: overcome it by talking to people
dialog: who knew the person that died and,
dialog: from them, learning about his life,
dialog: sort of thing...
text: A halting, inarticulate and wholly unconvincing attempt. He
dialog: didn’t even come close to convincing himself.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I didn’t know that.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Yes it’s quite well known... I
dialog: really think it could help.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT
text: They are back in Philomena’s old room. MARTIN is at a desk
text: tapping away at his laptop, PHILOMENA is sitting on a sofa

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I thought it would make me laugh.

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Is that a man?

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’ve been sent a picture of Anthony

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Oh...
dialog: (She thinks about this)
dialog: Yes please.

dialog: formal function.
speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Martin... This man looks just like

text: more closely. Puzzled, he enlarges the picture slightly,
text: looks intently at the figure.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Long beat)
dialog: It is me.
text: Sure enough, it’s him, in profile, talking to someone;
text: Michael is standing just a few feet away from him. Mind
text: spinning as he studies the photo, fragments of memory come
text: back to MARTIN. That name - he knew he’d heard it before...
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Michael Hess... I met him.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: At the White House.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Hungrily)
dialog: What was he like?
dialog: 79.

text: just a few feet away from Michael.
speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: What was his handshake like?

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Well, if it had been a weak

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Well that’s something.

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I... can’t.
dialog: (Thinks really hard)
dialog: Just... ‘hello’ or something. I’m
dialog: sorry.

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Repeating the word, as if

dialog: ‘Hello.’
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Might have been ‘Hi’.

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: It doesn’t matter...

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont'd)
dialog: (Big smile)
dialog: He was smart, and he had a firm

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT
text: MARTIN is at the bar, changed and showered, laptop in front
dialog: of him.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Pint of Guinness please.
dialog: 99.
text: As the BARMAN pours him one, MARTIN turns things over in his
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MARTIN sits at his laptop, but he’s distracted, can’t
text: concentrate. He studies the pint of Guinness in front of him.
text: He takes a sip, puts the glass down. As he studies it,
text: absentmindedly running his finger down the side of it,
text: something catches his eye: the trademark Guinness Celtic Harp
text: symbol on the side of the glass. He stares at it, thoughtful.
text: Remembering something. Suddenly, it all clicks into place -
dialog: but before he can do anything:
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Martin, there’s something I have to
dialog: say to you-
text: He looks up, surprised to see her down in the bar.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont'd)
dialog: I’ve made a decision and my mind’s
dialog: made up and there’s nothing you can
dialog: say that’s going to make me change
dialog: it.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I appreciate everything you’ve done
dialog: for me, and thank you for putting
dialog: up with me, I’ve enjoyed the hotels
dialog: and all the food and everything,
dialog: but this hasn't really worked out
dialog: the way that I wanted it to. So,
dialog: tomorrow I think we should get on
text: an aeroplane and go back to
dialog: England. There it is, and that’s an
dialog: end to it.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: And don’t try to change my mind by
dialog: saying all clever things and trying
dialog: to confuse me because I didn’t go
dialog: to Oxbridge like you-
text: MARTIN’S mobile starts to ring, interrupting the argument. He
text: checks the display: ‘Sally Mitchell’ and quickly kills the
text: call without answering. He looks at her:
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Oxford. I went to Oxford - Oxbridge
dialog: is a portmanteau of Oxford and
dialog: Cambridge, that’s where two words-
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I don’t give a shiny shoe about
dialog: that - it’s all the same to me!
text: MARTIN begins to fiddle with his lap-top.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I think we should go and visit Pete
dialog: Olsson tomorrow.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Go on your own! I’m not going all
dialog: that way just to hear another
dialog: person say that Anthony didn’t give
dialog: two hoots about me, and that I
dialog: abandoned him and all the rest of
dialog: it...
text: MARTIN points to the Harp symbol on the side of his pint of
dialog: Guinness.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: All I want to do is go home and
dialog: mind my own business, and watch
text: David Attenborough on the telly and
dialog: I’'1l be happy with that.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: There. On the side of the glass.
dialog: What’s that?
text: He points more deliberately to the symbol.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
text: It’s a Celtic harp.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Right...
text: He has found what he was looking for in his computer (though
text: we don’t yet see what he’s looking at). He now turns the
text: computer round to show her the picture of Anthony with
text: President Reagan, which we’ve seen before. He zooms in on
text: Anthony so it’s just him in the frame, and we can see that on
text: his jacket lapel he is wearing a gold Celtic Harp badge.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: And what’s that?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Beat)
text: A Celtic Harp.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: If he cared so little about where
dialog: he came from, why would he wear
dialog: something so Irish?
text: She thinks about it all, slightly stunned at the
dialog: implications.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Perhaps he played the harp? He was
dialog: gay..?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: He didn’t play the harp.

scene_heading: INT. HIRE CAR, POTOMAC VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: This is it.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I think he would have been happy

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I wouldn’t complain.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: (Nervous )
dialog: So what do we do now?
text: The car pulls forward. MARTIN surveys the empty drive.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: We doorstep him.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: What’s that, doorstep?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: It’s what nasty journalists do when
dialog: they want to speak to somebody who
dialog: doesn’t want to speak to them.
text: She nods, thoughtfully, then sees something in the mirror:

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HIRE CAR, POTOMAC VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POTOMAC VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY
text: We follow MARTIN as he walks up to the front door and rings

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hello Peter Olssen?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m Martin Sixsmith, I’m here with
dialog: Philomena Lee, the mother of your
dialog: late partner Michael Hess...
text: Sure enough, PETE’S immediate reaction is to shut the door on
text: him, but MARTIN jams his foot in it. He and PETE make eye
dialog: contact. So far so good.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: If you move your foot.
text: MARTIN moves his foot - and PETE immediately slams the door

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HIRE CAR, POTOMAC VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY
text: PHILOMENA in the car. She sees MARTIN turn away and walk
text: back, defeated. Her heart goes out to him, but she can feel

text: deflated. A few moment’s silence:
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (With a lot of feeling)
dialog: I’ve not been very... helpful, have
dialog: I.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Startled)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Wait here.
text: The door was slammed in Martin’s face - but it was slammed in

text: once and for all. MARTIN reluctantly stays in the car.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POTOMAC VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY
text: We now follow PHILOMENA up to the door. She rings the bell,

text: his doorstep.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I just want to talk about my son.
dialog: He was taken from me. And I’ve been
dialog: looking for him ever since.

scene_heading: INT. FRONT ROOM, POTOMAC VILLAGE HOUSE - DAY
text: CLOSE UP on a plasma screen. SCORE OVER the SUPER 8 footage
dialog: we saw earlier of little Anthony on the airport tarmac,

dialog: that of her son.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: PHILOMENA, flickering blue light playing across her glasses
text: as she watches the footage on the screen, tears in her eyes.
text: PETE sits next to her, holding her hand. MARTIN stands behind
text: her, also watching.
dialog: 106.
text: SCORE CONTINUES as PHILOMENA catches up on the moments from
dialog: Anthony’s/Michael’s life we have seen previously, (the little
text: boy on the tarmac; the birthday party; with Ronald Reagan;
dialog: the club in New York; with Pete etc.)
text: The two stories we have been watching now finally collide,
text: and we CUT BACK AND FORTH between PHILOMENA’S face and the
text: screen, each time tightening in on her. We see the ruined
text: Abbey amongst the images. Eventually we abandon the screen
text: and stay with PHILOMENA, closing in ever tighter as she
text: witnesses a life compacted, catching up on fifty missed years
text: with these magical, ghostly images.
text: Finally, she turns to MARTIN.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Isn’t he handsome Martin?
text: We are ON MARTIN, him watching the screen (which we don’t
text: see). He does not respond to Philomena, his eyes transfixed
text: by something he is looking at. Seeing his expression she
text: TURNS BACK, puzzled, to look at the screen - and her
text: expression pales.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont'd)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What’s wrong?
text: And NOW we CUT TO the plasma screen and see MICHAEL...
text: outside Roscrea. He is being greeted warmly by the (now
scene_heading: elderly) Sister HILDEGARDE [NOTE - SISTER CLAIRE IS NOT IN
dialog: THE SHOT]. And this is the end of the journey started in
text: scene 89 - Michael’s journey back to Roscrea.
dialog: Suggest the insertion of a line at the following point, to
text: draw out Philomena’s reaction to Anthony coming back to
dialog: Roscrea:
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: He went to Ireland? He went to
dialog: Roscrea...?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I took him. He was looking for you,
dialog: Philomena.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (looking at the screen)
dialog: He came to look for me?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Pointing to HILDEGARDE)
dialog: That nun... I saw her at Roscrea on
dialog: our last trip.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Sister Hildegard.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: She's very old now but it was
dialog: definitely her.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: They always told me they didn’t
dialog: know where Anthony was.
text: PETE looks confused.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But they told us that they couldn’t
dialog: find you. They said you’d abandoned
text: him as a baby.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Whisper, voice full of
dialog: emotion)
dialog: I did not abandon my child.
text: MARTIN gets up, unable to contain his emotions.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: She was looking for him! She's
dialog: spent her whole life trying to find
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: PETE
text: He’s there now.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I had this huge standoff with his
dialog: father. He wanted him buried in the
dialog: US, but it was your son’s dying
dialog: wish. He said he wanted to go home.
dialog: Beat. Silence.
speaker_heading: PETE (cont'd)
text: He’s buried at Roscrea.
text: During this we have been moving slowly in on PHILOMENA’S
text: face; now she closes her eyes, clutches her hand to her chest
text: and sighs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: MARTIN drives, PHILOMENA alongside. As they pull up outside
text: the Abbey they fall quiet for a moment, pondering what’s
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: We’ve come full circle.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: ‘The end of all our exploring will
dialog: be to arrive where we started, and

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Oh Martin that’s lovely, did you

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Well never mind it’s still nice.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Shall we go in?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You’re not going to make a scene in

speaker_heading: MARTIN

scene_heading: EXT. ROSCREA - DAY
text: They walk up to the Abbey building together in silence,

speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEETING ROOM, ROSCREA —- DAY

speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
dialog: Sister Claire has asked if you

text: MARTIN gives PHILOMENA a thunderous look ‘after all that’s
dialog: happened they still want to make you wait?’ But as the YOUNG
text: NUN leaves the room and they sit down in chairs facing the
text: window, PHILOMENA leans in and speaks quietly to him:
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Now remember Martin, it’s not her
dialog: fault. She didn’t know that Anthony
dialog: had a different name.
text: Of course she is saying this as much to herself as Martin.
text: Frustrated, he leans back in his chair in angry silence, gets
text: up, paces about. He stops to look at a classic ‘Sacred Heart’
text: image of Jesus on the wall, one so familiar to Irish
text: households: Christ, palms turned outwards, displays stigmata
text: wounds, and his heart is visible beneath his robes, glowing
text: and enveloped in a crown of thorns. He turns to see PHILOMENA
text: sitting on the edge of her chair, bag on her lap, waiting so
text: obediently that he is irritated by her. He looks at his watch
text: - the delay in seeing them is outrageous. He can’t stand it
text: in this room any more and slips quietly outside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GIFT SHOP AREA - DAY
text: He emerges by the gift stand, checks that there is no-one
text: around, then - his blood up - crosses to the double doors,
text: through which he saw Sister HILDEGARDE on his last visit. He
text: knows through there is where the nuns live. He slips quietly
text: through the doors.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, ROSCREA - DAY
text: MARTIN propels himself along, trying the first couple of
text: doors - they are all locked. He carries on and tries another
text: door - and this one is open. He slips inside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN AREA, ROSCREA - DAY
text: A small kitchen area. It’s empty, but an electric kettle
text: boils on the side - someone was here very recently. Another
text: door on the far side of the kitchen: he strides over to it,
text: opens it and enters another room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: INT. TV AREA/NUNS QUARTERS, ROSCREA - DAY
text: He enters a communal living area. Two elderly NUNS are in
text: there; they turn to face him - neither is HILDEGARDE. Then,
text: from a door to his left, SISTER CLAIRE and a PRIEST emerge.
text: As they shut the door behind them he sees, in the room behind
text: them, in a wheelchair, Sister HILDEGARDE. This is who he is
dialog: looking for.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Excuse me what do you think you're
dialog: doing here?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I just want to ask Sister
dialog: Hildegarde something.
text: The YOUNG NUN enters the TV room behind him, breathless,
text: having followed him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NUN
speaker_heading: (To SISTER CLAIRE)
text: He just walked straight in.
text: They are momentarily distracted by her, and MARTIN uses this
text: to slip past them and reach HILDEGARDE’s door.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: This is completely inappropriate
dialog: behaviour!
text: MARTIN ignores him and enters the room, shutting the door
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HILDEGARDE’S ROOM, ROSCREA - DAY
text: MARTIN sees there is a key in the door which he turns,
text: locking himself in. He turns to face HILDEGARDE, sitting in
text: her wheelchair by her desk, looking up at him, startled. From
text: outside, banging on the door.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE (V.O.)
dialog: Open this door! She’s an old lady!
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m not here to hurt you, I’ve just
dialog: come to ask you a question. I’ma
dialog: friend of Philomena Lee...
text: HILDEGARDE'S eyes narrow. There is no way she is going to
text: talk to this man. Especially not about ‘her’. He pulls a
text: chair up to her, keeping himself at her level so as not to
text: appear to be physically threatening.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: Why did you do it?
dialog: (Beat, no response)
dialog: When a mother and son were
dialog: searching for each other, why did
dialog: you keep them apart?
text: HILDEGARDE looks at him, her expression that of a wily old
text: fox. But still she refuses to answer.
text: Then, a door on the other side of the room - the one that
text: opens into the corridor and which was previously locked,
text: suddenly opens. SISTER CLAIRE - who has a master key - and
text: the PRIEST have doubled back and now burst in. MARTIN stands
text: up to face them.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: We're going to call the police
dialog: unless you leave immediately.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I’m not leaving without an answer.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: I’m sorry I think your whole
dialog: manner, coming in to a holy place
dialog: like this, and behaving the way you
dialog: have, is absolutely disgusting.
text: He turns back to HILDEGARDE, sits down again careful not to
text: tower over her, his tone still reasonable.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Low voice, in control)
dialog: I‘1l tell you what’s disgusting,
text: lying to a dying man.
dialog: (Directly to HILDEGARDE)
dialog: You could have given them a few
dialog: precious moments with his mother
dialog: before he passed away - but you
dialog: chose to lie. That’s disgusting.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Come on Sister Hildegarde, you
dialog: don’t have to listen to this.
text: Sister CLAIRE starts to wheel her away from Martin.
speaker_heading: SISTER HILDEGARDE
dialog: Not very Christian is it-
text: This is too much for the old nun to bear - she grabs the
text: wheels of her wheelchair and stops her. Finally, HILDEGARDE
text: speaks, jabbing a bony finger at MARTIN.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: SISTER HILDEGARDE (cont'd)
dialog: Let me tell you something - I have
dialog: kept my vow of chastity my whole
dialog: life. Self denial and mortification
dialog: of the flesh, that’s what brings us
dialog: closer to God.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Sister Hildegarde-
text: She wants to shut HILDEGARDE up - she clearly views her as a
text: liability. HILDEGARDE ignores her:
speaker_heading: SISTER HILDEGARDE
dialog: Those girls have nobody to blame
dialog: but themselves, and their own
dialog: carnal incontinence.
speaker_heading: SISTER CLAIRE
dialog: Sister Hildegarde - please!
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: You mean they had sex?
speaker_heading: SISTER HILDEGARDE
dialog: What’s done is done - what do you
dialog: expect us to do about it now?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Nothing. There’s nothing to be
dialog: said. I’ve found my son, that’s
dialog: what I came here for.
text: The room falls quiet. MARTIN sees PHILOMENA standing at the
text: door Sister Claire and the Priest came through.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont’d)
dialog: (She wants to go)
dialog: Martin.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hang on hang on.
text: He turns back to HILDEGARDE. He is starting to lose it.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (cont'd)
dialog: What you can do is say sorry! How
dialog: about that? Apologise. And then you
dialog: can go out there and clear all the
text: weeds and crap off the graves of
dialog: the mothers and babies who died
dialog: here. Stop trying to hide them
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: HILDEGARDE
dialog: Their suffering was atonement for
dialog: their sins.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: One of them was fourteen years old!
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: (Sharply)
dialog: That’s enough Martin!
speaker_heading: HILDEGARDE
dialog: The Lord Jesus Christ will be my
dialog: judge - not the likes of you.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Really? Because I think if Jesus
dialog: was here right now he’d tip you out
dialog: of that fucking wheelchair - and
dialog: you wouldn’t get up and walk.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: Stop it! Stop it!
dialog: (To CLAIRE and the PRIEST)
dialog: I’m sorry, I didn’t want him to
dialog: come in here like this and make a
dialog: scene.
text: MARTIN gets up and goes over to PHILOMENA. We see a pious
text: smile creep across HILDEGARDE’S face.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Incredulous)
dialog: Why are you apologizing to them?
dialog: Anthony was dying of Aids and she
dialog: still wouldn’t tell him about you.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I know! But it happened to me. Not
dialog: you. And it’s up to me what to do
dialog: about all this. It’s my choice.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: So you’re just going to do nothing?
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: No.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I’m going to forgive.
dialog: (Turns to Sister
dialog: Hildegarde) )
dialog: Sister Hildegarde, I want you to
dialog: know that I forgive you.
text: HILDEGARDE’S face drops and she turns her head away from
text: PHILOMENA with an angry grunt, much happier with Martin's
text: abuse than Philomena’s forgiveness. MARTIN looks at
text: PHILOMENA, floored.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What..? Just like that?
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: It’s not ‘just like that’! It’s
dialog: hard. It’s a hard thing to do.
dialog: (Tears in her eyes)
dialog: I don’t want to hate people.
dialog: Look at you. I don’t want to be
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (Close to tears with anger
dialog: and frustration)
dialog: I’m angry!
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA
dialog: I know. It must be exhausting.
text: PHILOMENA smiles. She feels much better now.
speaker_heading: PHILOMENA (cont'd)
dialog: Sister Claire, would you be kind
dialog: enough to take me to my son’s
dialog: grave.
text: A silence. Sister CLAIRE stands.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Of course.
text: Sister CLAIRE leads PHILOMENA out into the corridor. MARTIN
text: is left alone for a moment with the PRIEST and HILDEGARDE,
