text: FISHER, a young and very ambitious junior executive and
text: PHYLLIS BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties.
text: She is a lawyer with the agency.
text: At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being what
text: you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth. His tie
text: is loosened, he checks his watch every fifteen seconds.
text: Clearly he is very distraught.

speaker_heading: ON JOANNA
text: Now that the light is brighter, we can SEE her more clearly.
text: In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style
scene_heading: that can best be described as Bloomingdale's. HOLD FOR A

text: expression that she is terribly upset. Then, making up her
text: mind, she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase.
text: THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HER as she carries it into the bedroom,

text: Cheers and good-natured jokes.
speaker_heading: O'CONNOR

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: HER POV

dialog: What?!

speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Here are my keys. I won't be needing

dialog: Note: Ted does not for a moment believe that his wife will

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sardonic)

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.
dialog: You're a terrific mother 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (from her gut)
dialog: I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm

speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: TED

text: TRACKS WITH HIM, walks into the bedroom.
text: The bedroom is a mess: the closet door stands open, inside
text: Joanna's section is empty except for some shoe-boxes and a

dialog: emptied.
text: HOLD IN A WIDE SHOT as Ted wearily picks up one of the dresses

dialog: Huh... Hello?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (righteous)
dialog: All right, Thelma... That's it. I've
dialog: had it. You can call your good friend

dialog: enough, okay? I mean, I don't know
dialog: what I did, but you can tell her
dialog: she's made her point.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Ted, what are you talking about?!
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE

scene_heading: ON THE FRONT DOOR
dialog: As we HEAR:

text: She is a neighbor (Apt. 6-B) and Joanna Kramer's best friend.
dialog: About four months ago Thelma and her husband Charley were
dialog: divorced.
dialog: Until then the two families had been very close, the Kramer's
dialog: son
dialog: (Billy) being about the same age as the Phillips' daughter
dialog: (Kim).
dialog: With the divorce, however, the Kramers tried to remain friends
dialog: with both Thelma and Charley and that has caused a certain
dialog: amount of friction.
text: Thelma is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. She dresses
text: well, works out religiously at Jack LaLanne's and goes to a
dialog: therapist twice a week. She is also given to acting the lay
text: analyst with her friends. Thelma is generous with her advice,
dialog: sharing the wealth so to speak. With all of this she is kind,
text: loyal and a loving friend. At the moment, however, she is
dialog: all business.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (looking around,
dialog: suspiciously)
dialog: All right. What's going on?
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: From his attitude it is clear that there is no love lost

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: All right, Thelma, you want to know
dialog: what's going on? I'll tell you what's
dialog: going on. I'll tell you exactly what's
text: going on.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Look, Ted, all I 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (starting to really
dialog: roll)
dialog: I came home tonight. We just got the
text: Fire and Ice account at the agency.
dialog: Do you know what that means?! Do you
dialog: understand what that means? It means
dialog: that it was maybe one of the five
dialog: best days in my whole life.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Ted, all I wanted to know was where
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (not letting her get
dialog: a word in edgewise)
text: I walk in the house and before I can
dialog: say "How are you?", "Did you have a
dialog: nice day?" before I can say anything.
text: Pow she's out the door.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything?
dialog: She must've said something.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Yeah, she said it wasn't any use
dialog: talking anymore.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Ted, don't be so hostile.
text: Ted draws himself upright with the dignity of the Ambassador

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hostile?
dialog: (pow)
dialog: Me?
dialog: (whack)
dialog: Thelma, I'm not hostile.
dialog: (thud)
dialog: I am anything but hostile.
dialog: (sock)
dialog: But if you want to know what I am.
dialog: I'll tell you what I am. What I am
dialog: is, I am hurt. I am very hurt. And I
dialog: just want to know one thing, okay?
dialog: Just one thing... Why? That's all I
dialog: want to know... Why?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (how to say this)
dialog: Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot
dialog: and... well, she told me a lot of...
dialog: ah, things about the two of you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (instantly nervous)
dialog: Things? What kind of things?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (clearly she knows
dialog: more than she's

dialog: I mean... things. Ted, Joanna's very
dialog: unhappy and 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (flash of anger)
dialog: Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn
dialog: good life. She's got a husband that
dialog: loves her. She's got a terrific kid.
dialog: She's got a wonderful home 
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (getting mad herself)
dialog: What d'you know about how Joanna
dialog: felt? You went off to an office every
dialog: morning and you'd come dragging home
dialog: at seven or eight every night and as
dialog: long as dinner was on the table you
dialog: thought everything was swell.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Did it ever occur to you guys that
dialog: Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person
dialog: in the world to live with?! Did it?!
dialog: For one thing she's always thirty
dialog: minutes late. You can set your watch
dialog: by it 
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: So she's late. What's the big deal.
dialog: That's just a way of saying, "Pay
dialog: attention to me."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (not listening)
dialog: Two. She is getting to be a real
dialog: hermit or recluse or whatever it is
dialog: you call it. Thelma, do you know
dialog: where I could be in this business if
dialog: I had a wife that entertained or
dialog: went out socially 
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the
dialog: most selfish human being I have ever
dialog: met. No wonder she said you came
dialog: first, then Billy, then, if there
dialog: was anything left over, she got the
dialog: scraps.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Joanna said that?
text: Thelma nods.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Then how come she never said anything
dialog: like that to me?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Maybe she didn't feel like she should
dialog: have to. Maybe she felt like if you'd
dialog: been paying any real attention to
dialog: her to start with, maybe you would've
dialog: noticed.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (stung)
dialog: Boy, you guys are really something,
dialog: y'know? I'd like to know one thing,
dialog: okay  just one little thing. Did
dialog: you tell Joanna she should leave me?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (stiffly)
dialog: No.
text: She turns and starts toward the front door, Ted at her heel.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Y'know something Thelma  you are
dialog: the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean
dialog: it. Joanna and I never had any trouble
dialog: until you and Charley split up.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I
dialog: know, I went through it. You've got
dialog: to believe I did everything I could
dialog: to get Joanna to stay.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But I'll tell you something. You may
dialog: not want to hear it, but it took a
dialog: lot of courage for Joanna to do what
dialog: she just did.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'd like to know what the hell kind
dialog: of courage it takes to walk out on
dialog: your husband and your child?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THELMA
text: That stops her dead in her tracks. She had always assumed
dialog: that Joanna took Billy with her when she left.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Joanna left Billy? She didn't take

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (the camp counselor)
dialog: Sure. Didn't I ever tell you French

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: This is terrific... isn't this
dialog: terrific?
text: As Ted begins the process of making French toast, it soon

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look at this, isn't this something?!

speaker_heading: TED

dialog: (worried)
dialog: Mom, I mean dad...
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: C'mon, there's not much difference 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: We use the green and yellow.
text: Ted looks at his son for a moment, then carefully replaces

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain
dialog: and buy him an ice.
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: He sits on one of the playground benches, the work he took

text: He is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest, tie and
text: polished Gucci loafers. We will call him THE SATURDAY FATHER.
dialog: Note: The Saturday Father and his daughter (a pretty young
dialog: girl of about ten) will appear from time to time throughout
text: the film. He is a divorced father, putting in his time, not
dialog: giving a shit about the child. The Saturday Father insists
dialog: on treating Ted as though they were members of the same secret

dialog: what might happen to him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (looking in the
dialog: direction of the
dialog: voice)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SATURDAY FATHER
dialog: Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain,

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I've got a lot more than twenty
dialog: minutes to kill.
speaker_heading: SATURDAY FATHER
dialog: Tough...

dialog: How long you been divorced?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Three months. How can you tell?
speaker_heading: SATURDAY FATHER
dialog: You've got that look. My lady and I
dialog: split two years ago in August and

speaker_heading: CLOSEUP BILLY

dialog: Note: In all of the shots of Billy we SEE the teacher there

speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Sure.

speaker_heading: CLOSER ON TED

speaker_heading: ON PHYLLIS

dialog: Look, I don't know if this will make

dialog: Make her be the way I thought a wife
dialog: was supposed to be. Only she wasn't

dialog: (smiles to himself)
dialog: Well, she wasn't like that. And now,
dialog: when I think about it, I can see she
dialog: tried very hard to be like I wanted
dialog:  very hard. And when she couldn't,
dialog: then she tried to tell me about it.
dialog: Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I
dialog: thought that if I was happy, that
dialog: meant she was happy too. Only she
dialog: wasn't. The truth is, the only reason
dialog: she didn't leave a lot sooner was
dialog: because she loves you so much. Joanna
dialog: stayed until she couldn't stand me

text: It is a gray, cloudy day in mid-November. Snow is falling.

speaker_heading: TED'S VOICE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: JOANNA'S VOICE
dialog: Ted?
speaker_heading: TED'S VOICE
dialog: Joanna?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT, ISLE OF CAPRI  NIGHT
speaker_heading: ON THE DOOR
text: As Ted enters, looks around. The Maitre d'hotel approaches.
text: From his attitude, it is clear that Ted and Joanna were
dialog: regular customers.
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'HOTEL
dialog: Good evening, Mr. Kramer. We haven't
dialog: seen you for a long time. Mrs. Kramer,
dialog: she waits for you in the back.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Thank you, John.
text: THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he walks toward the back room
text: of the restaurant. Several waiters approach and say hello,
text: the piano player looks up and smiles. As he reaches the door
text: to the back room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM
speaker_heading: TED'S POV  JOANNA
text: She sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of
dialog: her.
text: She is dressed simply and no longer has a tan. Nevertheless,
text: Joanna is still stunningly beautiful. HOLD ON HER FOR A BEAT
text: as she looks up, smiles.
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: He stands watching her, his knees weak. It is impossible not
text: to fall in love with her all over again.
speaker_heading: TWO SHOT
text: As he crosses to her table, sits down.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Hello, Ted. You look well.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So do you.
text: The waiter appears, carrying a scotch and soda. He sets it
text: down on the table in front of Ted.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: The usual, Mr. Kramer.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (not taking his eyes
dialog: off Joanna)
dialog: Thanks, Gino.
text: The waiter nods and promptly disappears.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: How's the new job?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Fine.
text: There is a self-conscious pause. From the bar, the piano
text: player begins playing a new song. From Ted and Joanna's
text: reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal
dialog: to them in the past.
text: They listen for a moment, then:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look at us, Joanna. Just like any
text: old married couple having dinner.
dialog: Who would believe it.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes... How's Billy?
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: The question he has been dreading.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He's great... except...
dialog: (not looking at her)
dialog: ...Except he had... he fell and he
text: cut his face. He... He has a scar,
dialog: Joanna, from about here to here.
dialog: (indicating where and
dialog: how big)
text: There is a beat of silence. A moment of shared feeling.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (he has to say it to
dialog: someone)
dialog: I can't help but feel somehow...
dialog: it's my fault. I keep thinking I
dialog: could've done something  stopped
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: You can't tell it from a distance,
dialog: Ted.
text: For the first time he looks up at her.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?
scene_heading: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I've seen him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You have?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: A few times. Sometimes I sit in that
text: coffee shop across the street and
dialog: watch when you take him to school.
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: Speechless.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
text: He looks like a terrific kid.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He is...
dialog: (he still can't get
dialog: over it)
dialog: You sat in that coffee shop across
dialog: from school 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (completing the
dialog: sentence)
dialog: Watching my son... Ted, I've been
dialog: living in New York for the past two
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: You've been living here, in the city?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (a deep breath)
dialog: Ted... The reason I wanted to see
dialog: you... I want Billy back.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You want what?!
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (firm)
dialog: I want my son. I'm through sitting
text: in coffee shops looking at him from
dialog: across the street. I want my son.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Are you out of your mind?! You're
dialog: the one that walked out on him,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (trying to explain)
dialog: Ted, listen to me... You and I, we
dialog: had a really crappy marriage 
dialog: (hastily)
dialog: Look, don't get so defensive, okay?
dialog: It was probably as much my fault as
dialog: it was yours... Anyway when I left I
dialog: was really screwed up 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Joanna, I don't give a 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (she will be heard)
dialog: Ted, all my life I'd either been
dialog: somebody's daughter or somebody's
dialog: wife, or somebody else's mother.
dialog: Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-
text: two-year-old, highly neurotic woman
dialog: who had just walked out on her husband
dialog: and child. I went to California
dialog: because that was about as far away
dialog: as I could get. Only... I guess it
dialog: wasn't far enough. So I started going
dialog: to a shrink.
dialog: (leaning forward,
dialog: very sincere)
dialog: Ted, I've had time to think. I've
dialog: been through some changes. I've
dialog: learned a lot about myself.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (like a shot)
dialog: Such as?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (boring in)
dialog: Come on, Joanna, what did you learn?
dialog: I'd really like to know.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (relentless)
dialog: One thing, okay? Just tell me one
dialog: goddam thing you've learned.
text: There is a beat of silence, then:
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (quiet, determined)
dialog: I've learned that I want my son.
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: He reacts as though he has been slapped.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Joanna, go be a mother. Get married,
dialog: have kids. Don't get married, have
dialog: kids. Do whatever you want. I don't
dialog: give a damn. Just leave me out of it
dialog:  and leave my baby out of it.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Ted, if you can't discuss this
dialog: rationally -
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (getting to his feet)
dialog: Joanna, go fuck yourself!
text: And with that he turns on his heels and stalks out of the
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE  DAY
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
text: A large, very plush office: lots of antiques, beautiful
text: nineteenth century paintings on the wall along with
text: autographed photographs of at least three ex-Presidents of
text: the United States. Sitting behind a large and imposing desk
text: is JOHN SHAUNESSY, a handsome, formidable man in his early
text: sixties. He is well-dressed, a cornflower in his buttonhole,
text: that sort of thing. At the moment, Shaunessy leans back in
text: his chair as Ted finishes his story.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (leaning forward,
dialog: intense)
dialog: Look, she walked out on her own child,
dialog: right? That's desertion, right? Mr.
dialog: Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an
text: open and shut case.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: First, there's no such thing as an
text: open and shut case. Especially where
dialog: custody is involved. Got it?
text: Ted nods.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Second, the burden is on us to prove
dialog: your ex-wife is an unfit mother.
dialog: That means I'm going to have to play
dialog: rough and, if I play rough, you can
dialog: bet they will too. Can you take that,
dialog: Mr. Kramer?
text: Ted nods.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Third, it'll cost you five thousand
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: REACTION TED
dialog: That's an astronomical amount of money to him.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: That's if we win. If we lose, you
dialog: could end up having to pay your wife's
dialog: court costs as well.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (determined)
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Good. You've hired yourself a hell
dialog: of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.
dialog: (down to business)
dialog: How old is the child?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Six.
speaker_heading: ON SHAUNESSY
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: That's tough. In most cases involving
text: a child that young, the court tends
dialog: to side with the mother.
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: Agitated. This is not what he wanted to hear.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But she signed over custody. Here...
text: He digs in his pockets, pulls out a piece of paper and thrusts
text: it at the lawyer.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (glancing at it)
dialog: I'm not saying we don't have a shot,
dialog: but it won't be easy...
dialog: (thinks for a moment)
dialog: Mr. Kramer, do me a favor. There is
dialog: something I find very helpful in
dialog: matters like this. I sit down and
dialog: make a list of all the pros and cons
dialog: on an issue. I actually write them
dialog: down and look at them. I want you to
dialog: do that, okay? Then, after that, if
dialog: you're really sure you want to retain
dialog: custody of your child  then we'll
dialog: go in there and whip their asses.

speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
dialog: So, Mr. Ackerman, as you can see
dialog: from my resume, my experience in

dialog: The only thing is, you have to say

scene_heading: CROSS-CUT WITH THE CHRISTMAS PARTY
text: That swirls around him. We notice in particular, one very

scene_heading: EXT. STREET  DAY
speaker_heading: ON A BUS
text: As it pulls to a stop, the doors open and, along with the
dialog: usual flood of mothers and children we SEE Ted and Billy.
text: THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they walk to school. Billy is
text: talking a mile a minute, describing in minute detail the
text: plot of an episode of "I Dream of Jeannie." Ted listens
text: intently, then, almost involuntarily, he glances over his
text: shoulder in the direction of the Coffee Shop.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: There, standing in the window, watching, is Joanna.
scene_heading: ON TED AND BILLY
text: As they continue to walk. Ted's eyes remain on Joanna. As
text: they reach the door to the school, Ted looks at his son.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (kissing Billy goodbye)
dialog: You're a terrific kid, Billy Kramer.
text: He stands watching as Billy rushes off into the building.
text: Then he turns back and once again looks in the direction of
dialog: the Coffee Shop.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: This time there is no one there.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. KRAMER APT. BLDG.  NIGHT
scene_heading: ESTABLISHING SHOT
text: HOLD FOR A BEAT as we HEAR:
text: OFF SCREEN Sound: A telephone ringing. Then, a moment later:
speaker_heading: TED'S VOICE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY'S VOICE
dialog: Ted? John Shaunessy here. I just got
dialog: a call from your wife's lawyer. She
dialog: wants to see the kid.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT
text: Ted Kramer, the phone cradled against his ear is cleaning up
text: the remains of one of Billy's attempts to make the perfect
text: peanut butter sandwich.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON TED
text: Horrified.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What?! She wants what?!
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY'S VOICE
dialog: (he's been through
dialog: this a million times)
dialog: She's the mother. That means she's
dialog: within her legal rights.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: John, what if she kidnaps him. I've
dialog: heard all these 
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (the patience of a
dialog: saint)
dialog: Look, Ted, I don't honestly think
dialog: she would go to the trouble of suing
dialog: you for custody of the child if she
text: was planning on kidnapping him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (doubtful)
dialog: I don't know, John... I mean, to be
dialog: brutally honest, I'm not so sure
dialog: what kind of mental shape Joanna's
dialog: in right now. Y'know she admitted
text: she was seeing a shrink.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY'S VOICE
dialog: (a flicker of interest)
dialog: You ever see her talk to the walls?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No, but 
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY'S VOICE
dialog: Then you don't have a choice. Have
dialog: Billy at the Seventy-Fifth Street

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FIFTH AVE. SIDE OF CENTRAL PARK  DAY
scene_heading: ON TED AND BILLY
text: TRACKING IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk along the Central
text: Park side of Fifth Ave. From their attitude it is clear that
text: each of them, for their own reasons, is very nervous.
scene_heading: TED'S POV  TRACKING FORWARD
text: About half a block away Joanna paces back and forth. She
text: hasn't seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as
dialog: they are.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE ON TED AND BILLY
text: Ted stops, turns to Billy and gives him a last-minute check.
text: Then, spotting a smudge he takes his handkerchief, spits on
text: it and wipes the child's chin. Now satisfied, he takes Billy's
text: hand and they continue. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP BILLY
text: As he spots his mother.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Mommy!
scene_heading: QUICK CUT: JOANNA
text: As she turns, spots Billy, starts to run.
speaker_heading: ON BILLY
text: TRACKING WITH HIM as he lets go of Ted's hand and starts to
text: run flat out toward his mother. She kneels, opens her arms
text: wide for him and he goes barreling into her, almost knocking
text: her down from the impact.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (somewhere between
dialog: laughter and tears)
dialog: Oh, Billy... Oh my Billy... Oh my
dialog: son...
speaker_heading: WIDER SHOT
text: Joanna gets to her feet and takes Billy's hand.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (to Ted, but looking
dialog: at Billy)
dialog: I'll have him back at six.
text: And they start off in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: Realizing that Billy has not said good-bye, has not looked
text: at him once.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
speaker_heading: WIDER SHOT
text: Ted stands helpless, watching them leave.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
speaker_heading: WIDER SHOT
text: Ted, now almost lost from view on the crowded street, still
dialog: hasn't moved.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
text: Ted and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed. They look like
text: a couple that has been married at least five years. Ted is
text: busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts to
text: unbutton his shirt. Phyllis is getting undressed also, hanging
text: things in the closet, putting things away in drawers. But as
text: Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it is
text: clear that something is wrong.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (he has become an
dialog: armchair lawyer)
dialog: So, naturally, you assume that since
dialog: Joanna left, that would be a
dialog: compelling point against her, right?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (thoughtful)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But it doesn't work that way. A major
dialog: decision was handed down by the
dialog: Appellate Court in 1969  in the
dialog: case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Kramer 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court
dialog: ruled in favor of the mother, thus
dialog: establishing a precedent for awarding
dialog: the child to the mother even though
text: she previously abandoned the baby.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: Kramer... There's something I ought
dialog: to tell you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I've been offered a job in Washington

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON TED
text: He stops what he is doing, turns to her.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: (a deep breath)
dialog: I'm going to take it.
speaker_heading: REACTION  TED
text: He sits down on the bed.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: It's a very good job  too good to

dialog: him on the bed)
dialog: Look, I...
dialog: (she means love)
dialog: ..."like" you a lot. And you...
dialog: (she means love)
dialog: ..."like" me, okay? Maybe if it was
dialog: a year from now, maybe things would
dialog: be different...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: But it's not a year from now, is it?
text: She shakes her head, then, reaches out and touches him.
speaker_heading: PHYLLIS
dialog: I'll miss you, Kramer...
scene_heading: INT. KRAMER APT.  DAY
scene_heading: ON THE FRONT DOOR
text: It is open and standing in the doorway is an attractive woman,

dialog: court appointed psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: Mr. Kramer?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked
dialog: me to look in on your son and prepare
text: an evaluation sheet.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, yes. Won't you come in.
text: Dr. Alvarez enters the apartment. Ted helps her off with her
dialog: coat.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: Where is the child?
speaker_heading: TED
text: He's in his room, playing.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: Good. I'll see him in there.
text: As Ted carries her coat to the closet, Dr. Alvarez walks
text: into the living room, looks around.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in
dialog: here with anyone?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social
dialog: life discreetly. At the moment I am
text: seeing no one.
scene_heading: CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: Does that distress you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Not particularly.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: What does?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The prospect of losing my child.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ
dialog: (makes some notes,
dialog: then:)
dialog: Very well, I'd like to see him if I
dialog: may.
text: They cross to the door of Billy's room. Ted opens it.
scene_heading: INT. BILLY'S ROOM  DAY
speaker_heading: THEIR POV

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Billy. This is Dr. Alvarez. She would

scene_heading: DR. ALVAREZ
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: I'd like to talk to Billy privately.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (embarrassed at being
dialog: caught)
dialog: Oh, yeah...
text: Reluctantly, Ted leaves, closing the door behind him.
text: THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he crosses the living room to
text: the couch where he has a stack of legal books and a number
text: of note pads spread out. He is obviously continuing his legal
dialog: education.
text: THROUGH OUT THE FOLLOWING, THE CAMERA REMAINS ON HIS FACE.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ (O.S.)
dialog: What do you have here, Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY (O.S.)
dialog: Detroit.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ (O.S.)
dialog: Have you ever been to Detroit?
speaker_heading: BILLY (O.S.)
dialog: No. But I've been to Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ (O.S.)
dialog: I see you have people there. What
dialog: are their names?
speaker_heading: BILLY (O.S.)
dialog: That's Kim... and this one's Thelma

dialog: is daddy and that's Batman and over
dialog: there is Robin.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ (O.S.)
dialog: What about your mommy?
speaker_heading: BILLY (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ (O.S.)
dialog: Do you like to be with your mommy?

speaker_heading: TED

dialog: Objection. You're leading the witness.
speaker_heading: BILLY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: REACTION  TED
text: Eyes wide. He starts to get up.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Objection.
speaker_heading: BILLY (O.S.)
dialog: Sure. Lots of times.

speaker_heading: ALVAREZ (O.S.)
dialog: (interested)
dialog: When does he hit you?
text: Ted has his hand on the doorknob, about to enter.
speaker_heading: BILLY (O.S.)
dialog: He hits me on the planet Kriptarium,

dialog: from the famous peanut butter factory.
speaker_heading: ALVAREZ (O.S.)

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Wow! Is this really where you work?
text: Ted nods, walks over to the desk and begins collecting

speaker_heading: BILLY

scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE  DAY
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT

scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE  DAY
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM
speaker_heading: ON THE DOOR

speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
text: As Joanna gets to her feet, crosses to the witness stand and
text: is sworn in.
dialog: Note: Throughout the following, we continually CROSS-CUT to
text: Ted Kramer, leaning forward, listening intently. It becomes
text: evident that, in spite of himself, there are moments he feels
dialog: great compassion for Joanna.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you
dialog: tell the court how long you were
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Six years.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: And would you describe those years
dialog: as happy?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: The first couple, yes, but after
dialog: that it became increasingly difficult.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a
dialog: job while you were married to your
dialog: ex-husband?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No, I did not.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Did you wish to?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes. I tried to talk to Ted  my ex-
dialog: husband  about it, but he wouldn't
text: listen. He refuses to discuss it in
dialog: any serious way. I remember one time
dialog: he said I probably couldn't get a
dialog: job that would pay enough to hire a
text: baby-sitter for Billy.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed
dialog: at the present time?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes, I work for Jantzen as a
dialog: sportswear designer.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: And what is your present salary?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I make thirty-one thousand dollars a

speaker_heading: REACTION  TED
text: Stunned.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (switching tactics)
dialog: Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: Yes. Very much.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: And yet you chose to leave him?
text: There is a long pause, then:
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (speaking carefully,
dialog: with great thought)
dialog: Yes... Look, during the last five
dialog: years we were married, I had... I
dialog: was getting more and more... unhappy,
dialog: more and more frustrated. I needed
dialog: to talk to somebody. I needed to
dialog: find out if it was me, if I was going
dialog: crazy or what. But every time I turned
dialog: to Ted  my ex-husband, he couldn't
dialog: handle it. He became very... I don't
dialog: know, very threatened. I mean,
dialog: whenever I would bring up anything
dialog: he would act like it was some kind
dialog: of personal attack. Anyway, we became
dialog: more and more separate... more and
text: more isolated from one another.
dialog: Finally, I had no other choice, I
dialog: had to leave. And because of my ex-
dialog: husband's attitude  his unwillingness
dialog: to deal with my feelings, I had come
dialog: to have almost no self-esteem...
dialog: (with feeling)
dialog: At the time I left, I sincerely
dialog: believed that there was something
dialog: wrong with me  that my son would be
dialog: better off without me. It was only
dialog: when I got to California and started
dialog: into therapy I began to realize I
dialog: wasn't a terrible person. And that
dialog: just because I needed some creative
dialog: and emotional outlet other than my
dialog: child, that didn't make me unfit to
dialog: be a mother.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (to the judge)
dialog: Your honor, I would like to place in
text: evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's
text: therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore
dialog: Freedman of La Jolla, California.
text: And with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a thick
text: sheaf of papers. Then, turning his attention back to Joanna:
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Mr. Kramer, why did you set up
dialog: residence in New York?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Because my son is here. And his father
dialog: is here. As a mother, I don't want
dialog: my child to be separated from his
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court
dialog: why you are asking for custody?
text: There is a pause, then:
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Because he's my child... Because I
dialog: love him. I know I left my son, I
dialog: know that's a terrible thing to do.
dialog: Believe me, I have to live with that
dialog: every day of my life. But just because
dialog: I'm a woman, don't I have a right to
dialog: the same hopes and dreams as a man?
dialog: Don't I have a right to a life of my
dialog: own? Is that so awful? Is my pain
dialog: any less just because I'm a woman?
dialog: Are my feelings any cheaper? I left
dialog: my child  I know there is no excuse
dialog: for that. But since then, I have
dialog: gotten help. I have worked hard to
dialog: become a whole human being. I don't
dialog: think I should be punished for that.
dialog: I don't think my son should be
dialog: punished for that. Billy's only six.
dialog: He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't
dialog: need his father, but he needs me
dialog: more. I'm his mother.
text: There is a beat of silence, then:
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Thank you, Mrs. Kramer. I have no
dialog: further questions.
speaker_heading: ON SHAUNESSY
text: As he stands, collects his papers from the table and, taking
text: his own sweet time, crosses to Joanna.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you
dialog: were married seven years. Is that
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: In all that time did your husband
dialog: ever strike you or abuse you
dialog: physically in any way.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Did your husband strike or physically
dialog: abuse his child in any way?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Would you describe your husband as
dialog: an alcoholic?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: A heavy drinker?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Was he unfaithful?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Did he ever fail to provide for you?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (wry smile)
dialog: Well, I can certainly understand why
dialog: you left him.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Objection.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (switching his line
dialog: of questioning)
dialog: How long do you plan to live in New
dialog: York, Mrs. Kramer?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Permanently.
text: Note: During the early part of Shaunessy's cross-examination,
dialog: Joanna has been very forthright, very sure of herself. Now,
text: as he starts getting tougher, she begins to falter.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Permanently?
text: (smiles, like a shark
dialog: smiles)
dialog: Mrs. Kramer, how many boy friends
dialog: have you had  permanently?
speaker_heading: ON JOANNA
text: Her head snaps back as though she's been hit.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I don't recall.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (boring in)
dialog: How many lovers have you had 
dialog: permanently?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
text: (looks toward Gressen
dialog: for help)
dialog: I don't recall.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: More than three, less than thirty-
dialog: three  permanently?
speaker_heading: ON GRESSEN
text: He is again on his feet, outraged.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Overruled. The witness will answer,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (almost a whisper)
text: Somewhere in between.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Do you have a lover now?
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY

speaker_heading: JUDGE

speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Is that... permanent?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (by now she is becoming
dialog: thoroughly rattled)
dialog: I... I don't know...
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Then, we don't really know, do we,
dialog: when you say "permanently" if you're
dialog: planning to remain in New York, or
dialog: even to keep the child for that
dialog: matter, since you've never really
dialog: done anything in your life that was
dialog: continuing, stable, that could be
dialog: regarded as permanent.

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Sustained.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (a new attack)
dialog: Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider

dialog: an adult?
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (red in the face)
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Sustained.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: I'll ask it another way. What was
dialog: the longest personal relationship
dialog: you have had in your life  other
dialog: than parents and girlfriends?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (rattled)
dialog: Ah... I guess I'd have to say...
dialog: with my child.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (wonder, irony)
dialog: Whom you've seen twice in a year?
dialog: Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't
dialog: he the longest personal relationship
dialog: in your life?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: I suppose...
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I
dialog: couldn't hear you.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: How long was that?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: We were married two years before the
dialog: baby. And then four very difficult
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: So, you were a failure at the longest,
dialog: most important relationship in your
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Overruled.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I was not a failure.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh? What do you call it then  a
dialog: success? The marriage ended in
dialog: divorce.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (so angry she forgets

dialog: I consider it less my failure than
dialog: his.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (seizes on this)

speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: And did you have a close personal

speaker_heading: O'CONNOR
dialog: (in a whisper)
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: And how did you find his work?
speaker_heading: O'CONNOR
dialog: It was good. He was a hard worker, a
dialog: lot of drive, a real hustler.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: And yet you fired him.
text: There is a long pause.
speaker_heading: O'CONNOR
dialog: (looking down)
dialog: Ted was a good worker. But, ah...
dialog: after his wife left him and he was
dialog: taking care of the kid on his own,
dialog: things started to change. Look, I
dialog: know he had problems, I understand
dialog: that. I've got problems, everybody's
dialog: got problems. But I've got a shop to
dialog: run, I can't let that kind of thing
dialog: get in the way...
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I guess I felt that Ted was letting
dialog: his duties at home interfere with
dialog: his responsibilities in the office.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN

speaker_heading: THELMA

speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court
dialog: exactly why you want to retain custody
dialog: of your child.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (speaking quietly)
dialog: When Joanna 
dialog: (to the judge,
dialog: correcting himself)
dialog:  my ex-wife  when she was talking
dialog: before about how unhappy she was
dialog: during our marriage... Well, I guess
dialog: most of what she said was probably
dialog: true. There were a lot of things I
dialog: didn't understand  a lot of things
dialog: I would do different if I could.
dialog: Just like I guess there are a lot of
dialog: things Joanna wishes she could
dialog: change... But we can't. Some things,
dialog: once they are done, can't be undone.
dialog: Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe
dialog: she does. So do I. But the way it
dialog: was explained to me, that's not the
dialog: issue. The only thing that's supposed
dialog: to matter here is what's best for
dialog: Billy... When Joanna said why
dialog: shouldn't a woman have the same
dialog: ambitions as a man, I suppose she's
dialog: right. But by the same token what
dialog: law is it that says a woman is a
dialog: better parent simply by virtue of
dialog: her sex? I guess I've had to think a
dialog: lot about whatever it is that makes
dialog: somebody a good parent: constancy,
dialog: patience, understanding... love.
dialog: Where is it written that a man has
dialog: any less of those qualities than a
dialog: woman? Billy has a home with me,
dialog: I've tried to make it the best I
dialog: could. It's not perfect. I'm not a
dialog: perfect parent.
dialog: (unconsciously echoing
dialog: something Joanna
dialog: said earlier)
dialog: I don't have enough patience.
dialog: Sometimes I forget he's just a little
dialog: kid... But I love him... More than
dialog: anything in this world I love him.

dialog: ever had a woman in your bed while
dialog: your child was asleep in the next
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: So do I.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Sustained.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (switching to another
dialog: line of attack)
dialog: Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you
dialog: were fired from your last job not
dialog: more than six weeks ago?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (not losing his cool)
dialog: Technically, the agency lost a big
dialog: account and seventy four people were
dialog: let go. I was one of them.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (snotty)
dialog: You were fired, correct?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes, but I'm with J. Walter Thompson
dialog: now. I don't think that will happen
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (snide)
dialog: Give them time...
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: Objection, your honor! Counsel is
text: harassing the witness.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (to the judge, pettish)
dialog: Your honor, I'm only examining the
text: man's employment record. He pretends
dialog: to fitness when he cannot hold a
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Sustained.
speaker_heading: ON GRESSEN
text: He is thoughtful for a moment, like a man trying to decide
text: whether or not to drop the bomb. Then, turning back to Ted:
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (very tough)
dialog: Mr. Kramer, did your child nearly
dialog: lose an eye when he was in your care?
speaker_heading: REACTION  TED
text: Stunned. He looks across at Joanna.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT  HIS POV
text: Joanna looks away.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (boring in)
dialog: Mr. Kramer, did you, or did you not
dialog: tell the child's mother that you
dialog: were responsible for the injury that
dialog: permanently disfigured your child?
text: Shaunessy is on his feet racing toward the bench.
speaker_heading: SHAUNESSY
dialog: (vehement)
dialog: Objection! Your honor, counsel is
dialog: raising a question that is not germane
dialog: to these proceedings.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (to the judge)
text: While the child was in the care of
text: the witness, he cut his face badly
text: and is now scarred.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (to Gressen)
dialog: Are you introducing the question of
dialog: negligence here, counselor?
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: Yes, your honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I see. Well, you'll have to do better
dialog: than that. Do you have any affidavits
dialog: to support negligence?
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: I do not, your honor, however 
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: This is an isolated incident,
dialog: counselor, unless you can prove
dialog: otherwise.
speaker_heading: GRESSEN
dialog: (back to Ted)
dialog: Does the witness deny the injury
dialog: took place?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (before Ted can say
dialog: anything)
dialog: No, counselor, I'm going to over-

speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: His best stories have been Babar and

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, JOANNA'S APT. BLDG.  DAY
text: ON A STACK OF MAIL
text: As it is dropped in front of a doorway. We SEE that the letter

speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: I urge you to retain her. Her number
dialog: is 722-8099, and I think she will
dialog: take the job if it is offered. I'm

text: As she finishes reading the letter.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: That's all I can think of, except to

dialog: Ted.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH  DAY
text: It is a clear, cold beautiful winter's day. Ted and Billy
dialog: walk
text: along the beach at the edge of the water. THE CAMERA TRACKS
text: WITH THEM. There are several beats of silence as Ted tries
dialog: to think of how to begin. Finally:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Billy, sometimes when a mother and a
dialog: father are divorced, there's a
dialog: discussion about who the child should
dialog: live with, the mother or the father.
dialog: Now there is a man who is very wise.
dialog: He's called a judge. And a judge has
dialog: a lot of experience with divorces
dialog: and he decides who it would be best
dialog: for the child to live with.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why does he decide?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Because... Well, that's what he does.
dialog: He's a very powerful man.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Like a principal?
speaker_heading: TED
text: Bigger than a principal. The judge
text: sits in robes in a big chair... The
dialog: judge has thought a lot about us,
dialog: about you and me and your mom, and
dialog: he has decided...
dialog: (a deep breath)
dialog: ...he has decided that it would be
dialog: best for you to live with your mom
text: Joanna in her apartment.
dialog: (fake cheerful)
dialog: And I'm very lucky. Because even
dialog: though you'll live with your mom
dialog: Joanna I'll get to see you once a
dialog: week for dinner and a couple of
dialog: weekends a month.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't understand, daddy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (trying very hard not
dialog: to cry)
dialog: What don't you understand, pal?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Where will my bed be, where will I
dialog: sleep?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: At your mom's. She'll have a bed for
dialog: you in your own room.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Where will my toys be?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'll send your toys there and I'm
dialog: sure you'll get some new ones.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Who will read me my stories?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your mom.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Daddy, what if The Face comes when
dialog: I'm at mommy's?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Your mom knows all about The Face,
dialog: okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The
dialog: Face to beat it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Will you come and say good-night to
dialog: me every night?
text: Suddenly Ted can't stand it any longer.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, it's getting cold. Why don't
dialog: you go inside where it's warm. I'll
dialog: be along in a minute.
text: Billy hangs back, watching Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Go on, scoot.
text: The boy turns and runs back along the beach toward the house.
text: Then, he stops, turns back to look once more at his father.
speaker_heading: HIS POV  LONG SHOT
text: Ted stands at the ocean's edge, his back to CAMERA, weeping.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KRAMER KITCHEN  MORNING
scene_heading: ON TED AND BILLY
text: They stand side by side, like a surgeon and his assistant.
text: Spread out on the counter in front of them are the makings
dialog: of French toast. The following is done with great efficiency,
dialog: in contrast to the first time we saw them go through the
text: same ritual. They work in silence except for an occasional
text: command. Each concentrating on this last moment of closeness,
text: each doing his best to avoid thinking about Billy's departure.
dialog: Finally:
speaker_heading: ON BILLY
text: Looking at his father, trying to memorize the older man's
dialog: face.
text: Ted turns, sees his son watching him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (with false gaiety)
dialog: Hey? What's doin' with that bread?
dialog: Let's see a little hustle around
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  MORNING
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT

text: Nearby, Billy and his father sit, silent, waiting.
text: Sound-effect: The intercom from the lobby buzzes.
text: CLOSER IN ON TED AND BILLY
text: Ted looks at his son, smiles. The boy smiles back.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: This is it, pal.
text: Billy, fighting back tears, nods.
text: Sound-effect: The intercom buzzes again.
text: Ted gets to his feet and starts toward the foyer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FOYER  DAY

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: JOANNA'S VOICE
dialog: Ted, it's Joanna. Can you meet me in
dialog: the lobby?... Alone?
text: And she hangs up before he can answer.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to Mrs. Willewska,
dialog: in the kitchen)
dialog: I'll be back in a minute.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY  DAY
scene_heading: ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS
text: As they open, Ted steps out, looks around.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window.
text: Joanna sits off to one side, wearing sunglasses. She looks
text: up as Ted approaches, a small smile on her face.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (abrupt)
dialog: Okay, I'm here. Now why did you 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Ted, do you love him?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Goddamnit, Joanna. What the 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (insistent)
dialog: Ted, do you love him?
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I love him too... I don't think I
dialog: ever knew how much until now.
text: There is a long pause as she looks at Ted, unable to speak.
dialog: Finally:
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (a deep breath, then:)
dialog: Ted, when we got married it was
dialog: because I was twenty-seven years old
dialog: and I thought I should get married
dialog: and... when I had Billy it was because
dialog: I thought I should have a baby...
dialog: and I guess all I did was mess up my
dialog: life and your life and 
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Joanna, what the hell is 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: Please... Please don't stop me. This
dialog: is the hardest thing I've ever had
dialog: to do..
speaker_heading: ON TED
text: Struck by the urgency in her voice.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: After I left... when I was in
dialog: California, I began to think, what
dialog: kind of mother was I that I could
dialog: walk out on my own child. It got to
dialog: where I couldn't tell anybody about
dialog: Billy  I couldn't stand that look
dialog: in their faces when I said he wasn't
dialog: living with me. Finally it seemed
dialog: like the most important thing in the
dialog: world to come back here and prove to
dialog: Billy and to me and to the world how
dialog: much I loved him... And I did... And
dialog: I won. Only... it was just another
dialog: "should."
dialog: (she begins to break
dialog: down)
dialog: ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing
dialog: everything you did, everything you
dialog: went through... Something happened.
dialog: I guess it doesn't matter how much I
dialog: love him, or how much you love him.
dialog: I guess it's like you said, the only
dialog: thing that counts is what's best for
dialog: Billy. I don't know, maybe that's
dialog: all love is anyway... Ted, I think
dialog: Billy should stay with you...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (she reaches out,
dialog: takes his hand)
dialog: He's already got one mother, he
dialog: doesn't need two... He's yours...
dialog: (her last ounce of
dialog: reserve crumbles)
dialog: I won't fight you for him any more.
dialog: He's yours...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, God... Oh, my God...
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Only can I still see him?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No more waiting in Coffee Shops... I
dialog: promise.
text: Joanna's last ounce of reserve crumbles, she begins to sob.
text: Ted puts his arms around her and holds her. They do not kiss.
text: Then, after a few moments she steps back.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (chin high)
dialog: Okay... I think I'll go talk to my
dialog: son now.
dialog: (wiping her eyes)
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Beautiful.
text: They step into the elevator and, as the doors close, blocking
dialog: them from view, we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET  DAY
scene_heading: ON TED AND BILLY
text: TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk to the park.
text: They are deep in conversation, although we are too far away
text: to bear what they are saying. HOLD ON THEM and, as they reach
text: the entrance to the park, Billy first, then Ted begin to
text: run, overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive, of being
text: together. As they continue to run, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND
dialog: UP AND WE SEE that they are only two among thousands of
text: parents and children in Central Park on a sunny afternoon.
text: THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until they are lost from
dialog: view and it is...
