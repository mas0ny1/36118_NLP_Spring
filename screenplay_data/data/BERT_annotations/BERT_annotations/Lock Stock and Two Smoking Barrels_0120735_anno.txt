dialog: By Guy Ritchie
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT
text: This whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards,
text: tapping fingers and mouths. We open on a bright pair of eyes. One is
text: bruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their
dialog: clarity.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three
dialog: cards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards
dialog: you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any
dialog: kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty-
dialog: five to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit
text: running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and
dialog: finally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell-
dialog: tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because
dialog: it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player,
dialog: not make one. So you want to play?
text: DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
dialog: What have you got?
text: We cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned
dialog: over: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed. That's a good
dialog: hand. A flush beats my pair. What about you?
dialog: * Cut from completed film.
text: Another pair of excited eyes widen to the question. We see more cards:
text: a run is revealed.
dialog: And here's me trying to explain the game to you. Hustlers, you're all
dialog: hustlers!
dialog: We cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up. OK! You
dialog: got some real money?
text: DISSOLVE TO BLACK: MORE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Ed scoops up a large pile of money.
dialog: Odds chaps, you gotta remember the odds.
text: There ? a loud slam of a door. We cut to a wide shot of a policeman
text: who has just entered. It is then revealed that two of the three players
text: are also policemen. They stand to attention, red faced with
dialog: embarrassment.
speaker_heading: SERG
dialog: I hope I am not interrupting. Comfortable, Edward?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can
dialog: feel a case of the flu coming on and . . .
speaker_heading: SERG
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: All right, all right, don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you;
dialog: but before I do, I need to know what's going on, son.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.
text: DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE MUSIC STARTS.
text: We pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in
text: the inside of a shotgun. The barrels recede further, then `boom.' LOCK
text: STOCK are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters. We
text: wait for a while, as the barrels reappear through. the smoke. We then
text: see one smoking barrel; 'boom!' the other is let off: AND TWO SMOKING
text: BARRELS joins the sentence.]
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (FLASHBACK] - DAY
text: We open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery
text: on a street corner. A crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming
text: volume at which he is advertising his wares.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny-
dialog: by-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here
dialog: shopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a
dialog: bag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten
dialog: pounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not
dialog: eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten
dialog: pounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man
dialog: who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you
dialog: here today I would make more money with me measuring tape.
text: A well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd
text: waving money. It seems he can't wait to get rid of it.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you
dialog: say? I'll have five.
dialog: Certainly sir. I'll just wrap.
text: Changing his attention.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that.
text: A tourist spectator, rather than a buyer, has been. put on the spot.
text: She fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of
text: the crowd, of which she is now the focus. She passes her money like
text: it's contaminated. Others follow suit.
dialog: Buy 'em, you better buy 'em; they're not stolen, they just never been
dialog: paid for.
text: This really stokes the fire. The money can't come fast enough. Just as
text: business reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first
text: enthusiastic punter, who seems to be rather more familiar than he first
dialog: pretended.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Bacon!
text: Bacon's expression changes dramatically. A series of crash zooms
text: between Ed's, Bacon's and a third party's eyes (the police) reveal
text: there is a problem. They're off: EDDY and BACON run like they have done
text: this before. They go down an ally; Ed jumps some stairs, we freeze.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's
dialog: fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the
dialog: police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big
dialog: boy now and it is time to move on.
text: We cut to a shot of Ed as he lands. He has made good distance.
scene_heading: INT. GROCER'S SHOP - MORNING
text: EDDY arrives at a grocer's shop. We meet Tom. Tom is talking to Nick
dialog: the Greek.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Of course you are. All right, Ed.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Nick the Greek, always a pleasure. All right Tom, what you been eating?
text: Tom examines his midriff and adopts a confused expression.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Please, both join me in my orifice.
scene_heading: INT. GROCER'S SHOP STORE ROOM - DAY
text: They work their way past a maze of boxes.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: (fingering and admiring one of the boxes)
dialog: How much did you say it was, Tom?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You know how much it is, Nick.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: And that does include the amp?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You know it doesn't include the amp.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN -AFTERNOON
text: Tom and Ed make their way through a busy, well-equipped kitchen. This
text: is obviously a smart and serious establishment. They stop in front of
text: the man whose uniform is covered in blood; he appears to be the head
dialog: chef. Meet Soap.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What have you come as?
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you
dialog: Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in
dialog: your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a
dialog: grocer's.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be
dialog: surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind
dialog: that, what about the money?
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: Get your fingers out of my soup!
speaker_heading: SLOW MOTION
text: Soap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any
text: unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that
dialog: it's legal.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he
dialog: doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.

scene_heading: RELEASE SLOW MOTION]
text: Ed looks in bag.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I
dialog: see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat
dialog: man and Bacon?
text: Tom looks on with suspicion.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Who's this fat man, then?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
scene_heading: INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: A hard-looking man of about fifty is sat behind a large antique desk.
text: On this desk is a hatchet resting in a block of wood, poised like a
text: judge's hammer. Harry is obviously in the sex game. Cluttered up in a
text: hazardous way are a selection of dildos, spanking paddles, etc. A
text: cabinet of fine-looking shotguns is placed behind. We have a split
text: screen involving EDDY and his friends (listening in) and Hatchet with
text: one hand on the phone and the other on a shotgun.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: You got it all?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: A hundred grand.
text: FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved
dialog: has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry
dialog: as some including himself like to call him.
text: RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Well if you got it, you got it. Now, if you don't mind . . .
text: The phone is slammed down.
scene_heading: SHOT OF HATCHET
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: (voice-over)
text: When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts
dialog: that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: (voice-over)
text: Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's
dialog: stone cold heart.

speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: What's this EDDY like, then?

scene_heading: FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: (voice-over)
text: Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
speaker_heading: TOM

dialog: But he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled
dialog: and jobs get done.
text: RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY

dialog: All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Where did he get a hundred grand?
dialog: 20
speaker_heading: BARRY
text: He has got some adhesive mates, they have tossed up between them.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry,
dialog: I got it under control.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Good, you can get this under control now.
text: A glossy Christie's brochure displaying a pair of impressive antique
text: hammer-lock shotguns is shoved in Barry's face.
dialog: It seems Lord Appleton Smythe has run out of money, and these little
dialog: beauties are up for auction, but I am not paying quarter of a million
dialog: quid for 'em, if you know what I mean Barry. One of my associates has
dialog: given me an address and the location of these lovelies. Make sure we
dialog: get everything from inside the gun cabinet. I don't want to know who
dialog: you use, as long as they are not complete muppets; and don't tell them
dialog: what they're worth.

scene_heading: INT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY
text: Meet the Dog. Dog is horrible. He is large and intimidating.
text: Administering pain is Dog's forte. He is also the Guy we cut from the
text: last scene `slap' to the teeing of a golf ball. Wallop. Dog pulls a
text: sadistic and alarmingly pleasurable face.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: It's a dog eat dog world, lads, and I got bigger teeth than you.
text: We see an individual hanging upside down tied up with gaffer tape but
text: otherwise naked. An orange is stuck in the man's mouth. Dog is standing
text: on another man's chest who has a tee stuck between his teeth from where
text: Dog fires golf balls at the other unfortunate figure. The tied-up man
text: is Gordon. The other is Slick. Gordon nods his head erratically
text: implying that he has reached a decision.
dialog: (to Plank)
dialog: I think your man is trying to say something.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: Perhaps not; maybe I should have another swing just to make sure.
text: Agonised muffled screaming from Gordon. Slick (who has a tee in his
text: mouth) shuts his eyes in horror as the golf ball thumps into Gordon.
dialog: Yes, Gordon, is there something you would like to tell us?
text: The orange is removed from Gordon's mouth.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: (rushing to get the words out)
text: In the kitchen, under the floor . . .
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Shut it, you idiot . . .
text: Dog swings the golf club round Slick's jaw, knocking him unconscious.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: You were saying?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: It's in the karzi, pull the fishing wire under the seat. Jesus, for
dialog: god's sake let me down.
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: Oh, Dog! . . . I think you want to have a look at this!
text: Plank returns holding an assortment of drugs and cash. Gordon starts to
text: scream. Dog picks up a steel for sharpening knives and throws it across
text: the room. Thunk. Silence follows. Plank grimaces.
dialog: Oh, Dog!
scene_heading: EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: Ed, Bacon, Soap and Tom park outside their house. As they get out they
text: pass Plank and John who have also just parked. They ignore each other,
text: and go to their separate doors.
scene_heading: INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: BACON places a pile of money on a table. The rest are eating, Tom keeps
text: looking at his plate distastefully.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the
dialog: pound. You don't need to count it.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I still will, if you don't mind.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (eating)
dialog: So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and
dialog: twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous
dialog: experiences.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: That's going on optimism.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be
dialog: funny, but you're not.
text: Tom is definitely not overweight, quite the opposite in fact. He
text: examines himself to see if something has developed.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Fat? Who are you calling fat? What are all these fat jokes about?
text: The light switch above Tom's head lets out a few sparks causing him to
text: cower in a sharp defensive action.
text: Jesus! It's good in here, ain't it! Trains overhead, walls exploding .
dialog: . . Why the hell did you move in?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Because it's cheap like a budgie.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to;
dialog: a bit anti-social, you know.
text: BACON beckons Tom to a cupboard built into the wall.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: He means they're thieving dogs.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: I mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop, they're ripping
text: off unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs.
text: BACON opens the cupboard doors and puts his finger to his lips. The
text: noise from next door immediately gets louder.
dialog: Not exactly thick, these walls.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: (off)
dialog: No you prat, that's for me.
scene_heading: INT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Dog has a small pile of money and pills that he is distributing to his
dialog: lads.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: How many times do I have to explain this to you, Plank? You find a job
dialog: worth doing and you will find your share improving . . . Now do you
dialog: have a problem with that?
text: He obviously doesn't.

text: Little Chris looks under one of the sunbeds.
speaker_heading: LITTLE CHRIS
dialog: It's not him, Dad.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Try that one.
text: Little Chris returns from a peek and nods in confirmation.
speaker_heading: LITTLE CHRIS
text: Sleeping like a baby.
text: Big Chris then approaches and raises the sunbed.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: This is one of those high-powered numbers, isn't it?
text: John O'Driscoll's eyes widen; Chris slams down the sunbed on top of him
text: as hard as he can.
dialog: Got some bad news for you, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN O'DRISCOLL
dialog: What the fu-!
text: Big Chris slams down the sunbed on top of John.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Mind your language in front of my boy.
speaker_heading: JOHN O'DRISCOLL
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Big Chris repeats the earlier treatment twice more.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: That includes blasphemy as well. Now tell me, John . . .
speaker_heading: JOHN'O'DRISCOLL
dialog: Tell you what, Chris?
text: A man opens the sunbed mom door.
speaker_heading: SUNBED MAN
dialog: I say, hold on.
speaker_heading: LITTLE CHRIS
dialog: I say shut it!
speaker_heading: SUNBED MAN
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS

speaker_heading: JOHN O'DRISCOLL
dialog: Tell Harry . . .
text: Bang as sunbed comes down again.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me
dialog: and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
speaker_heading: JOHN O'DRISCOLL
dialog: I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am
dialog: nearly there.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Son, have a look in his locker.
speaker_heading: JOHN O'DRISCOLL
dialog: No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
dialog: * Cut from completed film.
dialog: 30
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, all right.
dialog: Big Chris lifts it, then smashes it down again. Now, you want me to
dialog: lift it up again?
text: Little Chris pipes up. Obviously familiar with counting money he has
text: flown through it.
speaker_heading: LITTLE CHRIS
dialog: He's not poor. Five hundred and sixty pounds and that's just in his
dialog: wallet . . . Fuckin' 'ell John, you always walk around with that in
dialog: your pocket?
text: The expression on Big Chris's face changes.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Oi! Next time you use language like that, boy, you'll wish you hadn't!
speaker_heading: LITTLE CHRTS
dialog: Sorry, Dad.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Right, well, put the rest of the stuff in that, son. You can go home in
dialog: a plastic bag tonight, John. You owe what you owe arid before this tan
dialog: has faded, you want to have paid.

dialog: Charles, why have we got this cage?
text: Pause. Charlie shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, because it's Willy and Willy lives here.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Yes Charlie, but you didn't know it was Willy, did you?
speaker_heading: WILLY
dialog: Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the
dialog: problem?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest

speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that
dialog: because you need to know.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond
dialog: film, is it?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
text: A bit of confused eye-rolling goes on. Barry eventually looks at his
dialog: watch.
dialog: I am off, it's all yours now. Call me when you're done.
text: As he leaves, the two Scousers eye him distastefully.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (to Dean)

scene_heading: EXT. BOXING CLUB ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: EDDY and the lads have all made an obvious effort with their

speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Invitations.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Invitations?
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name
text: on it.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with
dialog: the Queen on it. Will that do?
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I
dialog: do mean no one.
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT
text: EDDY enters the boxing gym on his own, and raises his eyebrows at the
text: thought of climbing into the ring. Everybody else is sitting down
text: counting their money and converting it to chips. Ed takes the only
text: empty chair and has a quick look around, particularly behind.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Evening Frazer, Phil, Don. This is a bit dramatic, isn't it? Is it
dialog: supposed to be symbolic?
dialog: 40
speaker_heading: PHIL/DON
dialog: All right Ed. Apparently it's for security.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I would have brought my gloves if I had known.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: You must be Eddy. JD's son.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
text: There is an attractive blonde croupier shuffling the cards. EDDY
dialog: Evening Tanya, it has been a while.
scene_heading: EXT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT
text: As the boys walk in to Samoan Jo's, a man comes tearing out of the door
text: covered in flames followed by his friends trying to put the flames out.
text: The lads look on in mild shock.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I heard this place was rough.

speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: What sort of a pub is this then?
speaker_heading: SAMOAN JO
dialog: A Samoan one. Anything else?
speaker_heading: BACON
text: (receiving a monstrous, leafy cocktail)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SAMOAN JO
dialog: A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a
dialog: fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
speaker_heading: SAMOAN JO
dialog: You want a pint, go to the pub.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: I thought this was a pub.
speaker_heading: SAMOAN JO
dialog: It's a Samoan pub.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
speaker_heading: SAMOAN JO
dialog: You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
text: BACON looks at Rory Breaker, the man watching the TV.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Excuse me, could you turn the TV down?
speaker_heading: RORY BREAKER
dialog: No.
text: He takes a swig of whatever he is drinking and frowns at Bacon. BACON
text: frowns back, then Soap interrupts.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: This is the English-Brazil game, isn't it?
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: This is three card brag, gentlemen. That means that three threes is the
text: highest, then three aces and then running down accordingly; then it's a
text: running flush, a run, a flush, then a pair: An open man can't see a
dialog: blind man, and it will cost you twice the anti to see your opponent.
dialog: Don't fuck around, fellas; you all know the rules and you know I won't
dialog: stand for it.
speaker_heading: FRAZER
dialog: What sort of shirt is that then, Ed? 'Three hundred open.
speaker_heading: EDDY
text: The type of shirt that has buttons on the front and collars at the top,
text: Frazer. One hundred and fifty blind.
speaker_heading: DON
text: Three hundred and fifty open.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Fold.
dialog: * Cut from completed film.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
text: Three hundred and fifty open.
speaker_heading: FRAZER
dialog: You're the only fella in London who wears shirts like that. Three
text: hundred and fifty open.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: No Frazer, it's just I'm the only classy fella you have had the
dialog: pleasure of seeing in London. One hundred and seventy-five blind.
speaker_heading: DON
text: Four hundred open.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
text: Four hundred open.
speaker_heading: FRAZER
dialog: Eight hundred. Like that, do ya, son?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: When my knees stop knocking I'll live with it. Four hundred blind.
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Barry, who is sitting among sweaty towels, takes out a four-inch
text: monitor and switches it on, and hey presto we can see the card table.
text: The camera is placed behind Ed in one of the four posts. Barry zooms
text: in, pauses on the back of Ed's head, gets his focus and jibs down to
text: view his cards, pauses and re focuses, because Ed is playing blind. He
dialog: hasn't raised them: there is nothing Barry can do. We cut to Barry's
text: other hand. He is pressing a button on a remote control. We cut
text: straight to Harry's leg which is receiving the pulse.
dialog: 46
scene_heading: BOXING GYM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Listen ladies, this is cards. Men play cards, you want to talk soft you
dialog: should be at the fucking hairdressers, so shut up and play.
dialog: (dramatic pause)
dialog: I fold.
speaker_heading: FRAZER
text: Two thousand open.
speaker_heading: EDDY

speaker_heading: DON
text: Two thousand open.
speaker_heading: FRAZER
dialog: Deep end, eh? Fold.
speaker_heading: EDDY
text: Two thousand blind.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: You what?
text: There is a pause as Don examines Ed's brow looking for a trace of
dialog: nerves.
dialog: Two grand? You're still blind. You have been eating too much English
dialog: beef, mate; honkers, mad.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Well, you going to play?
text: Cut from completed film.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Fucking right I am going to play. Three thousand, there.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Four thousand to an open man, you know that.
text: We can feel the confidence emanating from Eddy. Don continues to search
text: Ed's forehead waiting for a break of nervous moisture, but it's as dry
dialog: as a desert disco.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Donald, do you know how to play this game? The reason I put in half the
dialog: anti is because I don't know what I have got. Now play, or fold.
dialog: Silence.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT.
text: Don is thrown out on to the street, screaming and cursing.
scene_heading: EXT. STATELY HOME - NIGHT
text: The Scousers, having now entered, make their way through the large
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: All right, Kenny.
text: Dean looks at Gary's disguise with some distaste. He has a stocking
text: pulled over only half his face. A sexy thigh grip is replicating an
text: artificial, frilly moustache, not giving the desired menacing look. A
text: big bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.
dialog: (Lovingly rearranging his hair)
dialog: If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're
dialog: mistaken, Kenny.
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT
text: Music starts. We cut to a montage of Ed, Hatchet and Barry at work. Ed
text: must be about 250,000 up but the game is getting out hand and pieces of
text: paper are being signed; IOUs.
scene_heading: INT. STATELY HOME BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Dean returns down a corridor carrying an armful of rifles and enters a
text: large bedroom. There are a couple of toffs (English aristocrats) tied
text: up in bed. The old man has bits of tissue between is toes which Gary
text: has seen fit to light, in order to extract information. Briefly meet
text: Lord and Lady Appleton Smythe Winston and Daisy's parents).
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What are you doing, Kenny?
text: Gary is on the point of lighting another piece of tissue.
speaker_heading: GARY
text: Finding out where he keeps the money.
dialog: 48 49
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Kenny, you twat, does it look like these people have got any money?
dialog: They can't even afford new furniture. We've got the guns; now if you
dialog: don't mind . . .
text: At that moment they are interrupted by the sound of a shotgun
text: cartridge. The ancient butler has made an unexpected entrance. He is
text: holding an equally ancient pair of hammer-lock guns (the ones from the
text: catalogue) which he has obviously got little control of. The recoil
text: knocks the butler clear off his feet. The second shot hits the ceiling
text: covering the old boy in plaster.
text: We cut to a POV of the butler on his back. We see Dean looking down.
dialog: You want to be more careful, old fella. You very nearly took my man's
dialog: head clean off with that. You all right, Kenny?
text: We cut to a shaking shell-shocked Gary, mouth agape. The gun shot has
text: torn through the centre of Gary's bouffant hairdo leaving him with a
text: pair of smoking Mickey Mouse ears. Shock prevents him from answering.
dialog: Kenny?
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Ten grand blind.
text: We see Hatchet feeling his leg; he looks shifty
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Barry zooms in again; he can see nothing.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
text: Twenty thousand open.
text: EDDY looks at his cards: he has a running flush.
speaker_heading: EDDY
text: Twenty thousand open.
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Barrv sighs with relief and types in the relevant information.
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT
text: Having received this information Hatchet pauses, then . . .
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: I'll fold.
text: We hear lots of oohs and aahs. EDDY frowns slightly This is odd play.
text: Rather than looking happy he has a discrete glance over his shoulder;
text: satisfied that nothing can be amiss, he collects his money.
dialog: Don't go spending, that all at once, boy.
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Barry's phone rings. He jumps in shock and fishes around to find it.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: What?
dialog: 50 ~ 51
scene_heading: INT. RED PHONE BOX - NIGHT
text: The Scousers reply; Gary is still unable to speak due to his shotgun
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: You get the guns?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You should see what they did to poor Gary.
text: Gary wanders past the phone box in a gormless state. He obviously
dialog: doesn't know what day of the week it is.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Gary, get back into the van!
dialog: Barry frowns down the telephone. Yeah, yeah, we got 'em.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Good. I'll speak to you later.
text: Barry clicks the phone off. Dean looks at Gary and raises his voice as
dialog: if speaking to a deaf person.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Gary, Gary, if you can hear me, I think we better get you back in the
dialog: van now, OK?
text: Dean takes his arm and guides him back into the van.
scene_heading: BOXING GYM - NIGHT
text: Stakes have increased dramatically. There is a pause as Frazer looks at
dialog: his cards.
speaker_heading: EDDY
text: Twenty thousand open.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: OK. My Doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going
dialog: on here. I fold.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Got some cards there, boy? Thirty thousand. Back to you already Eddy?
text: Hatchet looks impatiently at the door.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Fifty grand.
text: Hatchet scours Ed's forehead. It is still dry.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Eighty grand.
scene_heading: BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Barry, who is trying as hard as he can to see Ed's cards, frustratedly
text: zooms in and out; eventually Ed raises them just
dialog: enough; Barry jibs, hey bingo he sees Ed's cards!
text: Ed's got nothing but a pair of sixes. Barry excitedly starts tapping
dialog: away.
dialog: 53
scene_heading: INT. BOXING GYM - MGHT
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: One hundred grand.
speaker_heading: FRAZER
dialog: Hold on fellas, I know . . .
speaker_heading: HATCHER (interrupts j
dialog: I know you're not in, which means nobody cares what you know. Two
dialog: hundred and fifty.
text: Hatchet and EDDY minutely study each other's hairlines, waiting for a
text: nervous droplet to appear. Sweat breaks; a drop on Ed's forehead, fills
text: frame. Slowly we follow a droplet's journey coursing down Eddy's brow
text: Eventually this is met by a large unblinking eye, at this point the
text: pause is broken.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
dialog: As you know, this puts us in an awkward position. I don't have enough
dialog: to continue.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: We will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to
dialog: continue. It's a loan or we see both your cards.
text: Silence follows. A lot of nose scratching and examining of imaginary
text: dirty ftngernails spreads contagiously throughout the remaining
dialog: company.
dialog: It doesn't look . . .
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: You will what?
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: I will loan you the money.
text: Silence. The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Ed's chin, trembles for a
text: second, then unattaches itself. Very slowly it falls. We follow its
text: long silent journey. Eventually it is greeted by the back of Ed's
text: cards. It explodes dramatically in sound and vision, symbolizing this
dialog: worrying news.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I think I would rather just turn them over.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I
dialog: am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over
dialog: because you can borrow.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I need two hundred and fifty grand.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
text: Ed's face is now awash, busily blistering with sweat.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: That's if I want to see you.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
text: The pause is painful.
dialog: 55
speaker_heading: CRUOPIER
dialog: You can still fold.
text: EDDY doesn't like the sound of this. There is sympathy in her voice.
text: Harry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier; the croupier
text: pleads with Eddy.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I'll see ya.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: For half a million?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can
dialog: still fold.
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money
dialog: back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
text: These last few words echo in the distance of Ed's mind (and ours). He
text: is committed, but has now left the world of the conscious. Hatchet
text: turns over the first card; it's a seven. EDDY
text: ushers him on; another seven, it looks as though he will have three;
text: then the third: it's a four. There is an anti-climatic silence. After a
dialog: loud pause . . .
speaker_heading: CROUPIER
dialog: Is that it?
dialog: * Cut from completed film.
dialog: 56
speaker_heading: FRAZER
dialog: He was bluffing!
text: Hatchet looks content and rather nonchalant.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Let's see your fucking cards.
text: Nobody is impressed by Hatchet's cards; all eyes fall on EDDY
text: expectantly We crash in to Ed's pupils with a loud swoosh. They
text: contract to the size of pinheads. His world has changed for ever.
scene_heading: FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: I knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the
text: table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A
dialog: series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted
dialog: with a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred
dialog: thousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million.
scene_heading: RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY
text: Harry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: I know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give
dialog: you all a week to find it. After that, I'll take a finger off each of
dialog: you and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment;
dialog: and when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what?
text: Ed gets up. We stumble with him in slow motion. He is hardly able to
text: stand. He wobbles over to the door. Harry continues to talk over the
dialog: top.
dialog: Business is business, and I am good at making mine work. I like your
dialog: dad's bar, JD's, so don't get clever or lethargic. If you can't pay in
dialog: a week, a few fingers and a bar for starters.
text: Ed stumbles out of the door, doubles up and vomits all over the f door.
scene_heading: INT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT
text: Ed has made his way into the bar. All his friends have fallen asleep.
text: One of Bacon's eyes opens to see Ed cleaning himself up.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: This doesn't look good.
dialog: The others wake on this statement. We cut between the lads and their
dialog: frozen reaction.
text: FREEZE SHOT OF LADS IN SHOCK
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: I then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going
dialog: to start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was
dialog: no way I could raise that kind of money on my own. Harry saw it as
dialog: their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table. I
dialog: hate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that. If I
dialog: said I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie.
text: RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF LADS
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Listen, I wish he would let me settle it on my own.
text: Tom drops his drink and rushes Eddy.
dialog: 58
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I'll kill him!
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: (intercepts Tom)
dialog: Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: What's all the fuss about Harry? Why don't we just boycott the payment?
text: They all look at Soap like he is mad.
scene_heading: INT. HATCHET HARRY'S' OFFICE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called
dialog: Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on
text: the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't
text: do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached
text: for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch
text: black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death
dialog: with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet
dialog: Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I'll think of something, don't worry.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Ed, who looks like he is close to suicide, has developed a two-day
text: stubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets. He stumbles
text: along the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket. He

dialog: (off)
dialog: Plank, open up.
text: This is done without the use of the steel-caged security door.
dialog: This weed is getting quite a reputation, you know, fellas. Gloria
text: remains motionless in her chair. Plank waves his hand about in a sort
dialog: of `how you doing' way to everyone and goes to take a seat. At the last
text: minute, poised like he is sitting on a potty he realizes he is about to
dialog: sit on this girl.
dialog: Jesus! Never saw you there. Hello, love. Enjoying yourself?
text: Gloria doesn't respond. Plank waves his hand over her face. Still no
text: response. Plank looks around for some acknowledgement.
dialog: Is she, er, compus?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: (doesn't look up)
dialog: What do you think?
text: Plank takes a close look at the girl.
dialog: 61
speaker_heading: GIRL
speaker_heading: BOO!

dialog: notes.
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: Fuck me!

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Sod you, you clean it up.
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: Sorry fellas, but that stupid cow!
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Never mind, could you please just sit down and stay out of the way.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Anyway, how much do you want?
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: (trying to look like the money hasn't had an impact on him)
dialog: I am after a half weight.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: That's one and a half thousand. Pass those scales, Willie, and sort out
dialog: the gear, Charlie. Any chance of seeing your money?
scene_heading: INT. JD' S BAR - DAY
text: Cut to Bacon, Soap and Tom sitting and talking in the back of JD's bar.
dialog: They don't look a lot better than Ed.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds
dialog: are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON
dialog: . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
speaker_heading: BACON
text: At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: It's hit us all hard!
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
text: Tom, who has not really been listening, suddenly interrupts.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's
text: Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag,
text: advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er
dialog: . . . I dunno, `does what no other dildo can do until now', latest and
dialog: greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all
dialog: that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the
dialog: pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to
dialog: the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something,
dialog: for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them
dialog: clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for
text: twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot
dialog: Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they
dialog: have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques;
dialog: not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he
dialog: tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!
text: There is a long pause while BACON considers this.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Probably no longer than four weeks.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six
dialog: . . . no, five days?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, it's still a good idea.

scene_heading: INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not

speaker_heading: DOG

speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Is Big Chris on his way?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Should be here any minute. I think you're making a mistake, Harry.

speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: What do you know about Chris, eh? You put Big Chris on a job and he
dialog: will make sure it gets done, no matter what's in his way. His dad used
dialog: to collect debts and his dad before that, and that monster of a boy
text: will after he has gone. It seems that the Almighty himself requested
dialog: them to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old
dialog: Nick's door himself, if he was behind on his payment. But he has never
text: nicked a picker in his life. Straight as an arrow and as strong as the
dialog: bow that fired it. If you dropped your tenner he would search till he
dialog: found ya . . . the only problem is he isn't stable, has a temper like a

speaker_heading: EDDY

speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
speaker_heading: EDDY

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility,

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Seven hundred each.

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of

text: We crash-zoom again into Harry's eyes to see the pupils contract. It's

speaker_heading: DOG

dialog: not going to be easy.
scene_heading: INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY
text: BACON has a kettle next to where he is sitting. It steams away quite

scene_heading: INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: What's that idiot doing next door?
dialog: (Points at Paul)
dialog: We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out
text: like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but
dialog: it is never locked, is it Plank?
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DOG
text: And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the
dialog: rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up,
dialog: scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but
text: they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When
dialog: the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then,
dialog: unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
speaker_heading: ALL TOGETHER
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: DOG

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: Ladies, if you don't mind, back to a more important issue. We've only
dialog: got two real guns . . . apparently that's what they are. We find a good
dialog: place to hide next door. When it sounds like the right time, we jack in
dialog: the box, look nasty and stuff, cocoon them in gaffer tape, then we nick
dialog: their van and swap the gear into a new van and then bring it back here.
dialog: As long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly, it's the last
dialog: thing they'll expect. If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them
dialog: around a bit I am sure it won't do any harm. A bit of pain never hurt
dialog: any one (thinking about it) if you know what I mean . . . Also, I think
dialog: knives are a good idea, you know, big fuck-off shiny knives, the ones
dialog: that look like they could skin a crocodile. Knives are good because
dialog: they don't make any noise, and the less noise the more we're likely to
dialog: use them. That'll shit 'em up and make us look like pros.
text: There is a pause as they look at Soap with suspicion.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: (amazed by this stupidity)
dialog: Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
text: We hear another pop and Plank gets shot in the neck. This
text: understarulably sends him into a real panic, thinking this is curtains.
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: (gurgle)
dialog: They shot me!
text: Panic unashamedly exposing itself. Trickles of blood start flowing from
text: in-between Plank's fingers.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: Well shoot them.
text: Plank shoots at everything and nothing. Smoke fills the corridor,
text: leaving them in a cloud. A bit of coughing goes on, then silence.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Jesus Plank, you could have got smokeless cartridges, I can't see a
dialog: bloody thing.
text: Pop! Another pellet is fired hitting John in the chest.
dialog: Ah, Jesus, shit, I've been shot!
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: I don't fucking believe this. Could everybody stop getting shot. Sit
dialog: down John, you cock, patch yourself up; it's only a fucking air rifle.
text: Dog is interrupted by an enormously loud blast of machine-gun fire. Dog
text: and the boys panic, cover their ears and hit the floor. After this
text: outburst Dog looks up at Mick and sees he is the culprit. Mick looks
text: down at Dog expecting a congratulatory nod from Dog; he doesn't get it.
dialog: What the fuck was that?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: That was the bren gun!
dialog: 94 . ~ 95
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: If you use that again, you're a dead man, do you understand?
text: He speaks softly but he is quite shaken. He then raises his voice; he
dialog: has had enough of all this mincing.
dialog: Right fellas!
text: He shouts to the Sloanes while dragging the semi-conscious body of J up
dialog: to use as a shield.
dialog: Before I go any further I am going to shoot your mate's toes off!
text: No sooner said than done; his toes go. The smoke problem repeats itself
text: and J faints again, but an unfazed Dog continues.
dialog: Now if you want us to be gone in two minutes, open the fucking gate,
dialog: now!
scene_heading: INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: He'll probably kill us if we do.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: Well, J will certainly get it if we don't; he's serious. Look what he
dialog: did to his toes.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: (off)
dialog: Right, his leg's going now.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: All right, all fucking right, I am coming.
dialog: (Turning and whispering)
dialog: Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
text: Willie slinks off with a `like what?' look on his face.
scene_heading: INT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: And all your friends, there's a good lad.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: There is only three of us here.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I mean it, there is only three of us here.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: Plank?
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: (gurgle, gurgle)
dialog: Yeah, one of them's out.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: OK, open the gate.
text: No sooner said than done. Dog hits one straight on Winston's forehead
text: with the butt of his gun and drags him to the stairs. 97
scene_heading: INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY DOG
dialog: Up boy, up, up.
text: They reach the top of the stairs.
dialog: Tie 'em up John and, Plank, you come with me. Where's the money?
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: There, in those shoe boxes.
text: Dog opens them. There is nothing in them. If looks could kill Plank
text: would be pushing up daisies.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: (gun to the head of Winston)
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
text: Out the back.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: And the weed?
speaker_heading: WINSTON
text: Out the back.
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Point.
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Your hands, now!
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: I can't, I am tied up.
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: Well, well, shake your head or something.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: All right Plank, get Paul out of the van.
text: This is done on a walky talky.
scene_heading: INT. SLOANES' BACK ROOM - DAY
text: The door opens. Willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete. He
text: turns to his opponent and, eyes shut for Dutch courage, hacks straight
text: into Mick's arm. Mick's machine gun goes off and William loses a finger
text: as he tries to push the barrel to the side. He starts screaming
text: uncontrollably
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: (to Plank)
dialog: Give us your knife.
text: Dog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to
text: its source. William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog and
text: slumps on the floor in a silenced wreck, holding a bleeding hand.
text: (the point of the blade resting on William's throat)
dialog: Enough! Mick, how you doing?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: How do you think I am doing? He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off.
text: Dog's attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash, neatly
text: packed and stacked.
text: PAUL (in doorway visibly shocked
dialog: Gordon Bennett! What's been going on in here?
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: Shut up, you idiot. You got the bags? Can you get it in?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: There's a lot here, all right. I don't think we will be able to get
text: this all in the van.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: Bollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips.
scene_heading: EXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - DAY
text: A traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC WARDEN
dialog: You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will
dialog: move it for you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'll only be a minute.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC WARDEN
dialog: You've already been fifteen.
text: Paul, realising that persuasion is futile, decides other means are
text: necessary to despatch this nuisance. He looks down both sides of the
text: street: the coast is clear.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Look. Go on, look.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC WARDEN
dialog: At what, exactly?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My van is half full.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC WARDEN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
text: Having made their way to the rear of the van, Paul opens the back
text: doors. Paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head. The
text: momentum carries the warden into the van, unconscious. Paul has another
text: quick look round and Lifts the warden's legs up and pushes him deeper
text: into the vehicle.
scene_heading: INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: My neck, Dog.
dialog: (Dog shows no sign of pity)
dialog: That's the last bag?
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: (Turning to Mick.)
dialog: How about you? All right?
speaker_heading: MICK
dialog: I'll be fine when; have dealt with this little shit. Mick grabs the
text: machete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: Do it quietly.
text: Gloria, who has been forgotten by the Sloanes and unnoticed by Dog and
text: troop, has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising
text: the gravity of the situation. She is kick-started into action by the
text: sure demise of Willie. The machine gun has been placed not too far away
text: from her. She picks it up, and fires it into the already wounded body
text: of Mick, who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat.
text: Gloria, who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself,
text: knew existed, destroys everything she points at. Bodies jump for cover
text: and Winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best.
text: Eventually the gun, which seems to have a limitless supply of lead,
text: goes quiet. We cut to close-ups of everybody opening their eyes
text: cautiously. Looks of relief come from everyone, not least the Sloanes.
text: Dog, who is closest, stands, walks straight up to her and punches her
text: on the jaw Gloria is knocked out.
dialog: What was that? Where did she come from? That's fucking it. Tie her up.
dialog: We are getting out of here.

speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Do you want one?

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's a traffic warden.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: (looking straight at Paul)
dialog: What's he doing in the van?

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: DOG

speaker_heading: TOM

scene_heading: INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Dog opens his door, enters the front room, dumps his two bags down and
text: is met by a bleeding Plank (who is grunted at) and John, who is rubbing
text: his chest. Dog sighs and turns to get more bags. The action starts.
text: It's hard to tell who is who because of the balaclavas. The lads jump
text: out of their positions.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Down, down, get fucking down now'
text: This is like d??vu. There is no response as the three of them seem
text: not to believe what's going on. BACON hits Dog with the butt of his
text: gun, establishing who's boss. Dog does down with a thud. Plank hits the
dialog: floor immediately.
scene_heading: EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Paul enters, sees trouble, drops his bags and prepares to run. He is
text: met by Tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead
text: pipe. This has more than the desired effect and Paul has to be dragged
text: in screaming by Tom. It all went rather smoothly
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys.
speaker_heading: DOG

speaker_heading: BARFLYJACK
dialog: (voice-over)
dialog: Rory's got few interests in life; darky music, football, bees and honey
dialog: and kicking the shit out of anyone that interferes with that shortlist.
text: A few nights ago Rory's Roger iron rusted, so he has gone to the
text: battle-cruiser to watch the end of a football game. Nobody is watching
text: the custard so he has turned the channel over. A fat man's north opens
text: and he wanders up and turns the Liza over. `Now fuck off and watch it
dialog: somewhere else.' Rory knows claret is imminent, but he doesn't want to
text: miss the end of the game; so, calm as a coma, he stands and picks up a
text: fire extinguisher and he walks straight past the jam rolls who are
text: ready for action, then he plonks it outside the entrance. He then
text: orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong oddly in the nuclear sub and
text: switches back to his footer. `That's fucking it,' says the man. Rory
text: gobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty; he flicks a flaming match
text: into his bird's nest and the man lit up like a leaking gas pipe. Rory,
text: unfazed, turned back to watch his game. The flaming man and his chinos
text: ran outside to extinguish the flames, and Rory cheered on. His team won

dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Jesus, I have heard about him.
speaker_heading: DEAN

dialog: No fucking about, Nick; where can I find those guns?
scene_heading: INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Dog, I have found the cash!
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: The stupid bastards! Count it!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking.
dialog: Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But...

scene_heading: INT RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Rory Breaker is amassing his troops and preparing to go round to Ed's.
speaker_heading: RORY BREAKER
dialog: We are going to do a proper decoration job. I want the grey skies of
dialog: London illuminated; I want that house painted red. Winston here is
dialog: coming along, see if he can recognize any of 'em, then we bring what's
dialog: mine back here. Watch out for these fellas; they've got a bit of
dialog: arsenal and they don't mind using it. Now you know what you're doing,
dialog: yes?
scene_heading: EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Big Chris and Little Chris are waiting outside. Dog's gang are waiting
text: for Ed's gang inside. Rory's gang are going to Ed's.
dialog: 122
scene_heading: INT. RORY BREAKER'S VAN - DAY
text: Six heavy-looking black guys are loading their weapons.
scene_heading: INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Dog's gang are also loading their weapons and concealing themselves
text: among the furniture. Dog is counting out the money in the side room and
text: has the two antique hammer-lock shotguns resting on the table in front
text: of him, which were found with the rest of the bounty.
scene_heading: EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Rory's boys stop the van outside Ed's and back up to Ed's front door.
text: The rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with
text: gun) prepares to do his worst.
scene_heading: INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY
text: There is a loud bang and the front door disappears. In its place is a
text: large black man pointing an even larger machine gun. Nobody seems to be
text: at home; it appears to be quite an anti-climax. A long pause follows as
text: both gangs don't quite know what to do. Rory's guys jump over the
text: machine gun to explore further.
speaker_heading: PLANK
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: What the fuck is going on here?
text: Dog's lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into
text: their own home, carrying weapons of mass-destruction and looking to use
text: them. We cut to a close-up of Plank's pov under the sofa. He can see
text: numerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying. At last Plank can't
dialog: take any more; his finger's shaking too much on the trigger. BANG.'
scene_heading: EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY
text: We see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through.
scene_heading: INT. ED AND BACON'S BACK ROOM - DAY
text: Dog, who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room, is more than
text: aware of the seriousness of the situation. He quickly closes his
text: suitcase of money and grabs the two old guns, opens the adjoining door,
text: gets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it. He then
text: checks his escape route out of the front window and exits. Dog looks
text: quite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life, and
text: is holding the infamous guns in each hand like a Mexican bandit.
scene_heading: EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Big Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the
text: activity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks
text: straight into him.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Got something here for me, have ya?
dialog: (Dog is stunned by this)
dialog: Come on, chop chop.
text: Before Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each
text: hand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt. Dog moans, not knowing
text: what day of the week it is. Chris opens the case, sees it's full of
dialog: money, takes the two shotguns, then leaves. Thank you very much.
text: On reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on
text: the back seat.
dialog: Count that son, and put your seatbelt on.

scene_heading: INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Ed's place has been shot to pieces. Only Rory and Winston (in shock)
text: seem to be left. Rory is throwing the bags of weed into the back of his

speaker_heading: RORY BREAKER
dialog: This is one of them.
text: Winston nods in confirmation.
dialog: Lucky, that.
text: Bang' Bang! Plank (to Rory's surprise) still had a loaded gun. Rory and

speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: How did you get your hands on these?

dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Was it any trouble getting the money?
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS

speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Have you counted the money?
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: They were going to pay, then?
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: It looks like ?, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my
dialog: experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: Good job, Chris.

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: GARY

speaker_heading: SOAP

speaker_heading: BACON

speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares

speaker_heading: BACON

scene_heading: INT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY
text: The two Scousers with guns in hand creep their way up the stairs.
text: There's only one door in front of them. Dean gets ready to kick it
text: open. Gary leans against the wall and delivers a Professionals-style
dialog: kick.
scene_heading: INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harry is in his offtce playing with his guns. The phone rings.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: That you, boy?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: It's pay day, ain't it?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: I wanted to talk to you about that.
speaker_heading: HATCHET
dialog: I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me,
dialog: which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few
dialog: people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what
dialog: does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that.
dialog: Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
scene_heading: INT. ED'S CAR - DAY
text: Ed puts the phone down after a pause. His state of shock is obvious to

speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Well what?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Well, what did he say?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those
dialog: guns . . . now.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: You what? What are you on about?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we

speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: I think you're a sandwich short of a picnic, mate; you want to start
dialog: making sense.
dialog: 133
scene_heading: INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: We cut to a time Lapse. Hatchet puts down the phone while resting his
text: bum on the front of his desk. He is ecstatic with the guns. He loads
text: and plays with them, aiming at imaginary moving birds.
text: The door is suddenly kicked wide open and, lo and behold, there is a
text: Scouser standing in the door. Dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying
text: through his troubled mind, most of which are based an regretting the
dialog: decision to kick this door in: `shit, what the hell is that, and why is
text: he holding a shotgun'. Hatchet realizes that the man standing in the
text: doorway (who is posed like De Niro in the poster of Taxi Driver,
text: holding a gun in each hand) has nor come to deliver the mail. The pair
text: are blissfully unaware that employee has met employer. Hatchet Harry
text: has effectively contracted his own demise. The pause is eventually
text: shattered by reality There is a rush to pull their individual triggers.
text: There is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective
text: targets. Both barrels are emptied into Dean's chest. The Scourer is
text: airborne by the sheer power of the cartridges. One of Dean's
text: bullets,finds its way into Harry's shoulder. Gary can do nothing to
text: stop this atrocity. He watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past
dialog: him.
text: Overtaken by emotion or fear, Gary charges in, gun blazing, and
text: proceeds to perforate Hatchet who is now unarmed. Hatchet flies over
text: his desk. Gary comes into the room to finish the job and fires one last
text: bullet into Hatchet, who is lying on the chair side of his desk. It is
text: then revealed that Barry is sitting in his chair behind the door. The
text: Scourer can't see Barry and Barry can't see Gary's face. Barry throws
text: the hatchet that is sitting next to him in a butcher's block. It hits
text: Gary in the back. Gary spins round firing wildly and lodges a bullet in
text: Barry's stomach. It is then clear to them both that this has all been a
dialog: terrible mistake.
speaker_heading: BARRY/GARY
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: Then both collapse into dead lumps on the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE ED'S CAR - DAY
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: You and me, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What do you mean, me?

text: Tom notices it's open.
scene_heading: INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY EDDY
dialog: Oh Jesus, not again.
text: The two pause while they build their confidence. They enter Hatchet
text: Harry's room. It's still smoky. There on the table is the money.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That's it, I am off.
text: Ed tiptoes over to the bag containing the money.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Tom, this is our case.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: . . . What?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
text: Tom sees his guns. His eyes widen in surprise.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I'll meet you in the car. I am taking these guns.
dialog: 136
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Son?
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
text: We can't see Dog but we can see the sharp side of a knife resting along
text: the front of Little Chris's throat. The Dog is Lying down in the back.
text: Big Chris assesses the situation.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: You all right back there, mate?
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want
dialog: to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: All right, furry muff.
text: Big Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He shrugs and
text: starts the car.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
speaker_heading: DOG
dialog: You had better be careful.
text: Big Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little
text: Chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road. He gets
text: faster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife.
text: Chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle.
text: BANG' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) OUTSIDE HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Another time lapse.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: Well, what's going on?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which
dialog: means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more
dialog: problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they
dialog: are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything
dialog: wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
text: Bang! Big Chris's car hits them straight in the rear. The bag of cash
text: goes flying through the car, landing on the dash. The lads are knocked
text: unconscious.
scene_heading: INT. CHRIS'S CAR (NOW STATIC) - DAY
text: Big Chris, having removed the knife from a stunned Dog, proceeds to
text: smash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing
dialog: so.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Never, never, not as long as I can remember has anybody been as rude to
dialog: me as you have.
text: Dog is being thrown around like a rag doll.
scene_heading: INT. SIDE ROOM TO INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT, OPENING SCENE
text: We are looking through a two-way mirror.
speaker_heading: SERG
dialog: Don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need
dialog: to know what's going on, Edward.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.
text: The camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a
text: policeman. There is a long pause far consideration. Eventually he
text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC WARDEN
dialog: No, that's not one of them.
text: The policeman then knocks on the door.
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: The SERG looks round to see the policeman. They exit and Ed is left on
text: his own. After a short pause the door bursts open.
speaker_heading: SERG

text: FADE IN TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: FADE IN.
scene_heading: INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT
text: All the lads are sitting in the bar. Ed is talking to Tom who is
text: interested in whatever he has to say.
speaker_heading: EDDY
text: The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so
dialog: that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because
dialog: there is no evidence against us.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Apart from those shotguns.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: And Tom took care of them.
text: Pause while Tom looks embarrassed about something.
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: You did take care of the guns, didn't you, Tom?
text: Ed looks at Tom, who looks even more embarrassed.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I wanted to talk to you about that.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: Well, talk.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought
dialog: we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a
text: problem getting hold of him.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: You dippy bastard.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car
dialog: which is sitting outside?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them
dialog: to you, could they?
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
speaker_heading: BACON
dialog: And, throw yourself off while you're at it. SOAP
dialog: Now, Tom! There is a pause.
speaker_heading: ALTOGETHER

speaker_heading: JD

speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: JD
dialog: Can I help?
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: I think I can help you, as it happens.
speaker_heading: JD
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
speaker_heading: JD
dialog: Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
text: They all look rather shocked. He is carrying their bag and he places it
text: on the table, which increases the shock factor.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: It seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have
dialog: cost him . . . I am not going to make the same mistake, am I? I have
dialog: decided to bring your bag back.
dialog: Pause. The words you are looking for start with thank you.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Now you have presented me with a problem. I don't have an employer any
dialog: more. So I have taken care of myself and my son, and if you think that
dialog: is unfair you just come and pay me a little visit; but you better be
text: waving the white flag high and clear, otherwise it will be the last
dialog: little visit you lot ever make . . . That's all I had to say. It's been
dialog: emotional.
text: Big Chris turns to walk out. The lads stare at the bag and then at each
dialog: other.
scene_heading: EXT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT
text: Big Chris walks out into the street. We see a shiny new sports car.
text: Little Chris is sitting in the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money-
dialog: loaning business, all right, son?
speaker_heading: LITTLE CHRIS
dialog: All right, Dad.
speaker_heading: BIG CHRIS
dialog: Well, put your seatbelt on then.
scene_heading: INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT
text: Ed goes forward to open the case. The rest are still in shock. Ed opens
dialog: the bag.
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: There's nothing in it!
speaker_heading: SOAP
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: EDDY
dialog: I mean it's fucking empty.
text: BACON lunges forward and stares in. He sticks his hand in and extracts
text: an A4 envelope. They look puzzled. Ed feels the package and starts to
text: tear the top off. As this is done it creates a split screen.
text: On the other side of the picture, Tom is on a London bridge with the
text: car boot open. He looks at the guns with regret and give them one last
text: polish. Then he folds the guns up and places them on top of a handrail.
text: Simultaneously Ed extracts a Sotherby's brochure on shotguns. They
text: still look confused. They turn the brochure upside down and recognize
text: the shotguns. Slowly they start to turn the pages.
text: Torn pushes the shotguns over the top rail: they fall. He starts
text: walking but stops for some reason. He retreads his steps and peers
text: over; the guns had just fallen on to a shelf.
text: Ed sees the price of the guns: a series of alarming zooms cut between
text: eyes and prices. They panic and reach for their mobile phones.
text: Tom is climbing over the bridge now and has to hold on to the rail with
text: one arm.
text: Ed starts screaming at the other two that the number is engaged and
text: asks them to put their phones down.
text: Tom now had one hand on the guns and one on the rail. His mobile phone
text: starts to ring in his top pocket; he has either to drop the guns or let
text: go of the rail to answer the phone.
text: The shot freezes.
