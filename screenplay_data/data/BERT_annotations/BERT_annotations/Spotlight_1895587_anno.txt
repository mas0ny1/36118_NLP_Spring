dialog: 
text: A quiet, cold winter night. An OLDER COP emerges from an

dialog: Boston, MA - December, 1976
text: He reaches the front desk. A YOUNG COP looks to him,
text: curious, as he lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: How's that going?
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
text: The mother’s bawling and the uncle’s
dialog: pissed off.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: She’s not married?
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Divorced with four kids. I guess
dialog: Father was helping out.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: Helping out?
text: The Older Cop shrugs. The front door opens and BURKE, FRESH
text: FACED, 32, walks in. He wears a dark overcoat.
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Hey, Mr. Burke. They’re in the back
text: talking to the Bishop.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: And Father?
text: The Older Cop nods in the other direction.
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
text: We put him in the break room.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Any press?
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Some guy from the Citizen, but we
dialog: sent him away. None of the big
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Let’s keep it that way.
text: Burke walks toward the interview room.
dialog: 11/26/14 2.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: (off Burke)
dialog: Who’s that?
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: Assistant DA.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: Gonna be hard to keep the papers
text: away from the arraignment.
speaker_heading: OLDER COP
dialog: What arraignment?
text: He’s matter of fact. The young cop reacts, looks towards the

speaker_heading: OLDER COP (0.C.) (CONT’D)
dialog: You can tell Father Geoghan it won’t

speaker_heading: BISHOP
dialog: Sheila, you know what good work the

dialog: give you my personal guarantee that

text: Burke enters, eyes Sheila nervously fingering ROSARY BEADS.
speaker_heading: BISHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll just be another moment, Paul.
speaker_heading: BURKE
dialog: Of course, Father.

text: DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR BEN BRADLEE JR., 50s, gruff, stands in

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Losing good reporters, it’s tough.
dialog: And losing one of our best... well
dialog: to put it as eloquently as I can,
dialog: it’s a real kick in the ass.
text: A few polite chuckles from those in the crowd.
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: But Robby’s known Stewart longer
dialog: than most of you have been alive so
dialog: I’m gonna turn it over to him.
dialog: Robby?
text: Ben looks to WALTER ‘ROBBY’ ROBINSON, 55, Boston Everyman.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Thanks, Ben. I think. And although
dialog: I take issue with the reference to
dialog: my seniority, I will say Stewart’s
dialog: departure is especially painful for
dialog: me. You see, for... what? 20 years
dialog: now, Stewart’s been more than
dialog: willing to part with his money at
dialog: the poker table...
dialog: (Laughter)
dialog: And I got a kid in college.
text: More laughter.
speaker_heading: STEWART
dialog: Yeah, but I’m gonna keep playing.
speaker_heading: TA
dialog: 11/26/14 4.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Problem solved. Godspeed, buddy.
text: Everyone’s laughing now. Robby connects in a warm, easy way.
speaker_heading: ROBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, Stewart, I find the timing of
dialog: your departure a bit disconcerting.
text: The corner office sits empty, the
text: new editor arrives on Monday, so
dialog: forgive me, buddy, but I gotta
dialog: ask... what the hell do you know?
text: The room hoots and laughs. Stewart covers his mouth. Speak
dialog: no evil. More laughter takes us to...

speaker_heading: SACHA

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Nah, it’s for Mike. I can never eat

speaker_heading: SACHA

dialog: Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Dan, I
dialog: talked to my guy at Justice, I know
dialog: you guys have been dropping cases...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look, Dan, I’m not asking if the
dialog: PD's lying, I know they are. All
dialog: I’m asking is who’s behind it?
text: Matt sets the cake by Mike, sits at a desk full of FAMILY
text: PHOTOS. Sacha checks messages at a tidy desk, full of books.
speaker_heading: MIKE (INTO PHONE) (CONT'D)
dialog: I get it. You don’t want to talk.
dialog: (listens)
dialog: I’m not mad, Dan, I’m hungry. We've
dialog: been talking so long, I missed
dialog: lunch. So I’m going to go eat,
dialog: which gives you an hour to decide if
dialog: you want to be on the right side of

speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: You think Cahill’s got something?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Maybe, I just don’t think this

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ben likes it.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, it’s not bad, it’s just not
dialog: Spotlight.
text: Robby enters.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: What’s just not Spotlight?
speaker_heading: SACHA MIKE
dialog: The PD numbers. The numbers story. It feels

speaker_heading: ROBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh. You got Cahill to talk?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (busted)
dialog: No. But I will.
dialog: 11/26/14 6.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Good. Then we’ll know if it’s thin.
text: Robby goes into his office, bit of an edge to him.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How'd it go upstairs?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay. Robby gave a good speech.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: I heard Lubin and Connor are going
dialog: to the Times.
speaker_heading: MATTY MIKE
dialog: Come on, really? Yeah, I heard the same thing.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: They're leeching us.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: At least they’re sending us a guy
dialog: from Miami to run things. That
dialog: should help.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Has Baron even spent time in Boston?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I don’t think he’s ever been here
dialog: before. Maybe we should buy him a
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: I have a friend down at the Herald,
dialog: said Baron cut 15% of the staff.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Great.
text: Mike rolls his chair back, calls out to Robby in his office.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Hey Robby, the new boss coming in to
dialog: make cuts?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Aren’t you sitting down with him?

speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Yes, I am.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You think it’s about Spotlight?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I don’t know, Mike, but I do know
dialog: Ben needs an answer on the crime
dialog: numbers story.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I’m telling you, I really don’t
dialog: think that story’s for us.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: So you did get Cahill to talk then?

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Thanks for taking time out of your
dialog: weekend, Robby.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: My pleasure.
dialog: (they sit)
dialog: What are you reading?
text: Marty holds up a book.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: ‘The Curse of the Bambino.’
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: (sitting)
dialog: That’s a great book. The Globe has
dialog: season tickets at Fenway, once you
dialog: settle in.
dialog: 11/26/14
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Thank you. Uh, to be honest, I’m
dialog: not much of a baseball fan. I’m
dialog: just trying to get a feel for city.
dialog: Are you originally from Boston?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I am, born and raised. A lot of the
dialog: newsroom is from here. It really
dialog: feels like a local paper in that
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: And did that change at all after the
dialog: paper was sold to the Times?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: No. I don’t think that had a big
dialog: impact.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Good.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So, you're an editor for, uh, the
dialog: Spotlight team?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I prefer to think of myself as more
dialog: of a player-coach. But yes. Are
dialog: you familiar with Spotlight?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: No. Not particularly.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Well, we’re a four person
dialog: investigative team. We report to
dialog: Ben Bradlee Jr. and we keep our work
dialog: confidential.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What are you working on now?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: We just put out a piece on this
dialog: shoddy construction outfit and right
dialog: now we’re trolling around for our
dialog: next story.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: How long does that typically take?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Hard to say. A couple of months.
speaker_heading: 12A
dialog: 13
dialog: 11/26/14 9.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: A couple of months.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Yeah, we don’t like to rush it.
dialog: Once we settle on a project, we can
dialog: spend a year or more investigating
dialog: it.
text: Marty jots down some notes. Robby sees he’s writing a lot.
speaker_heading: ROBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that a concern?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Not necessarily. Uh, but from what
dialog: I understand readership is down, the
dialog: Internet is cutting into the
dialog: Classified business and, uh, I
dialog: think, uh, I’m going to have to take
text: a hard look at things.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: So you anticipate more cuts?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I would assume so, yes, but what I’m
dialog: more focused on right now is finding
dialog: a way to make this paper essential
dialog: to its readers.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I'd like to think it already is.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Fair enough. I just think we can do
dialog: better.

speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Another week.
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: To the 10:30.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You? Since when?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Technically, I am an editor.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Technically. Your sit-down with

speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yes, that’s it.
speaker_heading: MARTY

text: The room reacts. Huh? Editors look at EILEEN MCNAMARA, 50s.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That’s the Geoghan case?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Yes, what’s the folo on that?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It’s a column, what kind of folo
dialog: were you thinking?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Well, apparently this priest
dialog: molested kids in six different
dialog: parishes over the last thirty years
dialog: and the attorney for the victims,
dialog: Mr...
speaker_heading: EILEEN
dialog: Garabedian.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Thanks, Eileen. Mr. Garabedian says
dialog: Cardinal Law found out about it
dialog: fifteen years ago and did nothing.
speaker_heading: CANELLOS
dialog: I think that attorney’s a bit of a
dialog: crank. And the Church dismissed the
dialog: claim.
dialog: 11/26/14 13.
speaker_heading: EILEEN
dialog: He said, she said.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Whether Mr. Garabedian is a crank or
dialog: not, he says he has documents that
dialog: prove the Cardinal knew.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: As I understand it, those documents
dialog: are under seal.
text: Silence. No one knows what to do. Robby watches.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Okay, but the fact remains, we have
dialog: a Boston priest abused 80 kids,
dialog: we've got a lawyer who says he has
dialog: proof Law knew about it, and we've
dialog: written all of...
dialog: (checking his notes)
dialog: ...two stories on this in the last
dialog: six months?
dialog: (then)
dialog: This strikes me as an essential
text: story for a local paper. At the
dialog: very least, we should be going after
dialog: those documents.
speaker_heading: CANELLOS
dialog: How would you like to do that?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Well, I don’t know what the laws are
dialog: here, but in Florida we would go to
dialog: court.
text: Robby raises an eyebrow. In fact, the whole room does.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You want to sue the church?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Technically we wouldn't sue the
dialog: Church. We would file a motion to
dialog: lift the seal on those documents.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: The church will read that as us
dialog: suing them. So will everybody else.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Good to know.
dialog: 11/26/14 14.

speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Baron wants to sue for the sealed
dialog: docs in the Geoghan case.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He wants to sue the church? That’s
dialog: great.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We covered Geoghan when the story
dialog: broke three years ago. Baron was
dialog: still in Miami.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: (needling Ben)
dialog: I think he was at the Times then.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He wasn’t here.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You think the suit has a chance?

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Who’s the Judge on this case?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Uh, Constance Sweeney.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Tough.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Why’s that?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Good Catholic girl.
text: Marty pushes on.
dialog: 11/26/14 16.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Judging from what I’ve read, it
dialog: doesn’t seem like we’ve done a
dialog: thorough investigation of the
dialog: Geoghan case. Is that right?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No it’s not. We looked hard at
dialog: Geoghan. David Armstrong for Metro
dialog: and Michael Paulson for Religion.
text: Marty isn’t impressed.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Okay, but, uh, just so I understand,
dialog: beyond our daily coverage, we
dialog: haven't committed any long term
dialog: investigative resources to the
dialog: question of whether or not Cardinal
dialog: Law knew about this?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No, we haven’t.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (to Robby)
dialog: And that’s the kind of thing your
dialog: team does?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Spotlight? Well, yeah, but we’re
text: still prospecting the Boston PD
dialog: story I told you about.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Could you set it aside?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: We could.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Marty, in the past, Spotlight has
dialog: had success in large part because

speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Mitch Garabedian, right? I covered

speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: I only interviewed him once. He’s
dialog: kind of a character.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I like characters. I'’11 take him.
speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: The Porter case? Remind me?

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I vote yes.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: No, we're just setting it aside for
dialog: now. I don’t need to tell you guys,
dialog: we need to be more discreet than
dialog: usual. Everybody’s gonna be
dialog: interested in this, not just the

speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: You're familiar with the Geoghan

speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: Sure. Eighty plaintiffs. All

dialog: swimming.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: And the allegations against Cardinal
dialog: Law?
dialog: MacLeish considers the question.
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: Look, it’s tricky. You need to
dialog: understand these are shitty cases.
dialog: The statute of limitations is only 3
dialog: years and most of these victims
dialog: don’t come forward until long after
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Why is that?
dialog: 29
dialog: 11/26/14 23.
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: They're kids. Shame. Guilt. And
dialog: they come from tough neighborhoods,
dialog: nobody wants to admit this kind of
dialog: thing. So you’re screwed on the
dialog: time limit and even if you argue
dialog: your way around that, the charitable
dialog: immunity statute caps damages at
dialog: twenty grand.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Twenty grand for molesting a child?
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: That’s the way the system works.
dialog: The Church is tough. So your best
dialog: shot is to try these cases in the
dialog: press like I did on Porter. But
dialog: most victims want nothing to do with
dialog: being on TV. And Mitch isn’t
dialog: exactly a people person.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: So if Garabedian can’t get these
dialog: victims to talk to the press...
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
text: Then he has a long road ahead of

speaker_heading: SACHA

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No. In the Globe.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's okay. I’1l track it down. I’m

speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: Suits. There are eighty-four of

dialog: should get your facts straight.
dialog: 11/26/14 25.
dialog: True to word. Garabedian is a bit of crank.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're right. I should. I’m just
dialog: trying to get some background
dialog: information on the Geoghan case...
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: You're not recording this are you?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No, I wouldn’t do that without

speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: (brusque )
dialog: I can’t show you the Church

text: after, they’re under seal.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN

dialog: me before the Massachusetts Board of
dialog: Bar Overseers three times? They’re
dialog: watching me very closely.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The Church?
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: Yes, the Church. They'd like to get
dialog: me disbarred. In fact, put that
dialog: away.
dialog: (off Mike’s pad)
dialog: Put it away! I don’t want you
dialog: recording this in any way, shape or
dialog: form. Not on paper, not on tape,
dialog: nothing. In fact, I probably
dialog: shouldn't even be speaking to you.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there
dialog: are things you can’t tell me. But I
dialog: also know that there’s a story here.
dialog: And I think it’s an important story.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: I already talked to the Phoenix.
dialog: 11/26/14 26.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, and there’s a reason I didn’t
dialog: see it, nobody reads the Phoenix
dialog: anymore. They’re broke, they don’t
dialog: have any power. The Globe does.
dialog: And if we cover this story,
dialog: everybody will hear about it.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: The Church thinks in centuries, Mr.
dialog: Rezendes. You think your paper has
dialog: the resources to take that on?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, I do. But if you don’t mind

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I can imagine.
speaker_heading: CARDINAL LAW
dialog: Tough seat to sit in, especially in
dialog: a small town. I think you’1l find
dialog: Boston’s a small town too, Marty, in
dialog: many ways. But if I can be of any
dialog: help, don’t hesitate to ask. I find
dialog: that this city flourishes when its
dialog: great institutions work together.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Uh, thank you. Personally I’m of
dialog: the opinion that for the paper to
dialog: best perform its function it needs
dialog: to, uh, stand alone.

speaker_heading: CARDINAL LAW

text: papers on his lap.
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: So am I the first survivor you've
dialog: talked to?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Yes, Phil. You are.
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: Okay, well, first of all, let me say
dialog: thank you for having me in today. I
dialog: want you to know that you have the
dialog: full cooperation of my organization,
speaker_heading: SNAP.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: How many members are there in your
dialog: organization, Phil?
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: We had eleven at our last chapter
text: meeting. No ten. Karen just moved.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: There was a woman in your group?
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: Of course there was a woman. They
dialog: don't discriminate, not when it
dialog: comes to abuse. And this has
dialog: nothing to do with being gay. What
dialog: this is, is priests using the collar
dialog: to rape kids. Kids. Boys and girls.
text: He reaches into a file, pulls a PHOTO of himself as a kid.
dialog: 11/26/14
speaker_heading: SAVIANO (CONT’D)
dialog: I was eleven. I was preyed upon by
dialog: Father David Holley in Worcester.
dialog: And I don’t mean prayed for. I mean
dialog: preyed upon. Are any of you
dialog: Catholic?
text: The whole team looks at each other. Good question.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I was raised Catholic but now I go
dialog: to my wife’s Presbyterian church.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: I'm lapsed but I go to church with
dialog: my grandmother sometimes.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: It's safe to say we were all raised
dialog: Catholic but now...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not so much.
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: Okay. Well, let me tell you, when
dialog: you're a poor kid from a poor
dialog: family, religion counts for a lot.
dialog: And when a priest pays attention to
dialog: you it’s a big deal. He asks you to
dialog: collect the hymnals or take out the
dialog: trash, you feel special. It’s like
dialog: God asking for help. And maybe it’s
dialog: a little weird when he tells you a
dialog: dirty joke but now you got a secret
dialog: together so you go along. Then he
dialog: shows you a porno mag, and you go
dialog: along. And you go along, and you go
dialog: along, until one day he asks you to
dialog: jerk him off or give him a blow job.
dialog: And so you go along with that too.
dialog: Because you feel trapped. Because
dialog: he has groomed you. How do you say
dialog: no to God, right?
dialog: This lands.
speaker_heading: SAVIANO (CONT’D)
dialog: See, it’s important to understand
dialog: that this is not just physical
dialog: abuse, it’s spiritual abuse too.
dialog: When priest does this to you, he
dialog: robs you of your faith.

dialog: Here, this is his testimony from the
dialog: Kos case.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Phil, what’s a treatment center?
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: It’s where they send priests when
dialog: they get caught. This is all right
dialog: here in the box, I sent it all to
dialog: you guys five years ago.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: To the Globe? Who'd you send it to?
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: I don’t wanna say who, but they said
dialog: they weren't interested.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: But Phil, we did run a couple of
dialog: stories on you. I saw them in the
dialog: clips.
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: Yeah but to be completely frank, it
dialog: wasn’t enough!
text: Robby and Mike trade a look as Phil takes a PACKET out of the
text: box overflowing with tattered clips, articles and data CDs.
dialog: 11/26/14 41.
speaker_heading: SAVIANO (CONT’D)
dialog: You guys gotta understand, this is
dialog: big. It’s not just Boston, it’s the
dialog: whole country, the whole world. And
dialog: it goes right up to the Vatican.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Do you have any proof of that, Phil?
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: No, not yet, but think about it,
dialog: there are so many of them, how else
dialog: could they have hidden it for so
dialog: long?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: So many what?
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: Priests! I know of thirteen right
dialog: here in Boston.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: You know of thirteen priests who
dialog: have molested children in Boston?
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: Yeah. Why do you keep repeating
dialog: everything I say?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: I just like to clarify things.
speaker_heading: SAVIANO
dialog: Maybe you should have clarified it
dialog: five years ago when I sent you all
dialog: this stuff! It’s all right here.
text: Phil’s sudden anger catches the room off guard. He stares at
text: the box, tries to pull himself together.
speaker_heading: SAVIANO (CONT’D)
dialog: May I use your bathroom?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah. Sure, Phil. Come on.

speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 11/26/14 42.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: He’s got an agenda, that’s for sure.
speaker_heading: MIKE SACHA
dialog: You think? He’s obviously been through a
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: But he’s smart and if he’s right
dialog: about thirteen priests...
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Might be a big ‘if’ with this guy.
dialog: (then to Sacha)
dialog: Run background on him and follow up
text: with some of the other survivors in
dialog: his group.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I'll track down this ex-priest Sipe.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Okay. But stay on Garabedian,

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: PATRICK MCSORLEY

speaker_heading: PATRICK MCSORLEY

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Where was that?

speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: St. Ambrose in Dorchester. She's
dialog: the one who introduced me to Father

dialog: long hair, very hip. He invited me
text: to his apartment in Back Bay.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Where in Back Bay?
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: Beacon Street. Are you from here?
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: I grew up in Ohio but my mom’s from
dialog: Southie.
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: So you get it. I’d never even been
dialog: to Back Bay.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: What happened on that first visit?
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: Well, he was very nice at first,
dialog: very casual, very funny. And I
dialog: think he could tell I was gay
dialog: because he showed me this mobile he
dialog: had, like over a baby’s crib? But
dialog: with different words. Homosexual,
dialog: bisexual, transsexual...
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Did you know you were gay at the
dialog: time, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: Yes, but that wasn’t information I
dialog: was sharing with anybody. Not in
dialog: Dorchester.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Right. So, what happened when he
dialog: showed you the mobile?
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: Well, I was a little freaked out and
dialog: I guess he could tell so he said,
dialog: you know what will help is if we
dialog: play strip poker. Of course I lost.
dialog: And things went on from there.
dialog: 11/26/14 48.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: What happened specifically?
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: Specifically, he molested me.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Joe, I think the language here is
dialog: going to be very important. We
dialog: can’t sanitize this, just saying
dialog: molest isn’t enough. People need to
dialog: know what actually happened.
text: Joe sits back, getting it as the waiter serves two coffees.
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sure. So what happened then?
speaker_heading: PATRICK MCSORLEY
dialog: You really want to hear this shit?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, Patrick. I do.
text: Patrick is struggling a bit. But he continues.
speaker_heading: PATRICK MCSORLEY

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: PATRICK MCSORLEY
text: So we're driving home and he starts
text: patting my leg and then... his hand

dialog: Classy guy.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: And did you?
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: Yeah. I know what you must be
dialog: thinking, why I would ever do that
dialog: with some creepy guy thirty years
dialog: older than me. But you have to
dialog: understand, this was the first time
dialog: in my life that someone told me it
dialog: was okay to be gay. And he was a
dialog: priest.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: So you had oral sex. Did you have
dialog: intercourse as well?
dialog: 61
dialog: 11/26/14 50.
speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY
dialog: Yes. Not then, but later. It
dialog: really messed me up. I’m sober now
dialog: but that was the beginning of it
dialog: all. It’s very confusing, you know,
dialog: to be introduced to sex like that
dialog: and then to be attracted to men...

speaker_heading: SACHA (INTO PHONE)

speaker_heading: JOE CROWLEY (OVER THE PHONE)

speaker_heading: SACHA (INTO PHONE)

speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: MIKE (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Great. So Phil said you worked at

speaker_heading: SIPE (OVER THE PHONE)
dialog: Yes, that’s right. The Seton
dialog: Psychiatric Institute. It was run
dialog: by the Daughters of Charity.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And when was that, Richard?
speaker_heading: SIPE (OVER THE PHONE)
dialog: Well, I started my psychotherapy
dialog: fellowship there in 1965 and I was
dialog: there for five years, but I spent
dialog: the next thirty studying abusive
dialog: priests and their victims.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Really? That’s been your sole
dialog: focus?
speaker_heading: SIPE
dialog: Look, Mike, the church wants us to
dialog: believe that it’s just a few bad
dialog: apples, but it’s a much bigger
dialog: problem than that.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: How much bigger?
speaker_heading: SIPE
dialog: Well, based on the research, I would

dialog: He called it a “a phenomenon.”
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Why didn’t he go public?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He did, but the church has made a

text: MacLeish looks at her. Surprised. He sits back.
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: Yes, I’m familiar with him.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Have you settled cases against

speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: As I’m sure you can understand, I
dialog: can’t discuss that.
dialog: 11/26/14 62.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: What about Father Ronald Paquin?
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: I can’t discuss that either. Come
dialog: on, guys.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: We understand you've settled several
dialog: cases against each of them.
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: Even if I’d been involved in those
dialog: cases, the settlements would be
dialog: confidential. I could be disbarred
dialog: for acknowledging their existence.
text: Robby’s not backing down. MacLeish shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH (CONT’D)
dialog: Look, I told you, these are tough
dialog: cases. Most of these folks just
dialog: want some acknowledgement of what
dialog: happened. We got them a sit-down
text: with the bishop and a little dough.
dialog: It was the best they could hope for.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: It was certainly the best the priest
dialog: could hope for.
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: No, the Church promised to take the
text: priests out of circulation.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: And did you follow up on that?
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: (done with this)
dialog: You guys need anything else?
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Yes. Why aren’t there any records?
dialog: I was just down at the courthouse,
dialog: why aren’t there any records of
dialog: these settlements?
text: MacLeish pauses. Hesitant, now not so sure of himself.
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: We dealt directly with the Church.
dialog: We'd draw up a demand letter and
dialog: we'd send it to the chancery.
dialog: So that’s
dialog: 11/26/14 63.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: You never filed anything in court?
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: It was a private mediation.
text: ano. Jesus. Sacha and Robby react.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: So this is just you and the
dialog: archdiocese’s lawyers in a room?
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Anyone else?
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: Occasionally, the Church would bring
dialog: in another defense attorney to help
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: You have any names?
speaker_heading: ERIC MACLEISH
dialog: (stonewalling him)
dialog: No. No I don’t.

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So this was all under the table?
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: There’s no paper trail at all. The

text: The lawyer takes his third and the
text: Church sweeps it under the rug.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Jeez. It’s a freakin’ racket.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It’s more complicated than that.
dialog: MacLeish has got a duty to his
dialog: clients to get the best deal he can.
dialog: 75
dialog: 11/26/14 64.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Sure, but how many victims do you
dialog: represent and profit from before you
dialog: say something?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Garabedian would say none. That's
dialog: why he’s taking these cases to
dialog: court. Because he wants people to
dialog: know about this.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: I agree. And, legal ethics aside,
text: Ben, operating the way MacLeish has
dialog: all but guarantees the abuse stays
text: under wraps.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Did MacLeish confirm all of
dialog: Saviano’s priests?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: No. He’s limited by the
dialog: confidentiality agreement.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: But he’s clearly settled cases
dialog: against a number of them. Phil’s
dialog: put me in touch with some of the
dialog: other victims, I’m pretty confident
dialog: all of his priests are going to
dialog: check out.
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’ve been through a lot of these.
dialog: ‘Sick leave’ isn’t the only
dialog: designation they use when they take
dialog: one of these priests out of
dialog: circulation. They use a slew of
dialog: terms - ‘absent on leave,’
text: ‘unassigned,’ ‘emergency response.’
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They got a name for everything,
dialog: these guys.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Except rape.
text: A phone rings in the Spotlight office. Mike exits to get it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And they move parishes way more
dialog: frequently than other priests. When

dialog: seven or eight years. These guys,
dialog: it’s two to three tops.
dialog: 79
dialog: 11/26/14 71.
speaker_heading: SACHA

scene_heading: INT. GLOBE, SPOTLIGHT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 79
dialog: 
text: The team is HUDDLED around a SPEAKERPHONE.
speaker_heading: SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE )
dialog: I think if you want to understand
dialog: the crisis, you need to start with
dialog: the celibacy requirement. That was
dialog: my first major finding: only 50% of
text: the clergy are celibate.
dialog: They share a look. 50%? Can that be true?
speaker_heading: SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE) (CONT'D)
text: Now, most of them are having sex
dialog: with other adults. But this creates
dialog: a culture of secrecy, that tolerates
dialog: and even protects pedophiles.
speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: So you believe the church is aware
dialog: of the extent of this ‘crisis?’
speaker_heading: SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE )
dialog: Absolutely. After the first major
dialog: scandal in Louisiana, Tom Doyle, the
dialog: Secretary Canonist for the Papal
dialog: Nuncio, coauthored a report warning
dialog: pedophile priests were a billion-
dialog: dollar liability. That was in 1985.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 1985?
speaker_heading: SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE )
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Who saw this document? Anyone in
dialog: the Catholic hierarchy?
dialog: 11/26/14 72.
speaker_heading: SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE )
dialog: Sure. Doyle tried to introduce the
dialog: report at the National Conference of
dialog: Catholic Bishops. In fact, Cardinal
dialog: Law initially helped to fund the
dialog: report, but then he backed out and
dialog: they shelved it.
speaker_heading: REZENDEZ

speaker_heading: ROBBY

dialog: right to you? In terms of scale?
speaker_heading: SIPE (ON SPEAKERPHONE )
dialog: No. Not really. It sounds low. My

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN

speaker_heading: MIKE
text: Off the record.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: Three years ago, I get a call from
dialog: an ex-Priest. Anthony Benzevich.
dialog: He was at Blessed Sacrament back in
dialog: ‘62 and he saw Geoghan taking little
text: boys up to the Rectory bedroom.
dialog: Benzevich was appalled, he told the
dialog: Bishop. And the Bishop threatened
dialog: to reassign him. To South America.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Jeez.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: Yeah. So, fast-forward 35 years,
dialog: Benzevich reads Geoghan’s been
dialog: charged with molesting more than a
dialog: hundred kids. Benzevich feels
dialog: guilty, he calls me.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You have testimony from a priest
dialog: telling his superiors about Geoghan
dialog: in 62'?
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: No, I do not. Because when I call

text: he shows up with a lawyer.
dialog: 11/26/14 95.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wilson Rogers.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
text: Suddenly, Father Benzevich has a
dialog: foggy memory. Can’t remember
dialog: anything. He’s useless. So I go
dialog: back to work, I forget about it,
dialog: whatever. Until about a year ago. I
dialog: find an article about a priest who
dialog: warned church officials about
dialog: Geoghan.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Benzevich went to the press.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: Local paper, Patriot Ledger, nobody
dialog: saw it. But now I got Benzevich on
dialog: record, so I file a motion to depose
dialog: him a second time. And Wilson
dialog: Rogers, that smug son of a bitch, he
dialog: files a motion opposing my motion.
dialog: And that’s when I have him!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Have him how?
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: Rogers opposes my motion. So I gotta
dialog: make an argument as to why I’m
dialog: allowed to depose Father Benzevich a
dialog: second time. But now, I’m allowed
dialog: to attach exhibits. You follow what
dialog: I'm saying?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The sealed documents...
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: Yes, I can use the sealed documents
dialog: I’ve gotten in discovery, Mr.
dialog: Rezendes, the same documents your
dialog: paper is currently suing for.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You're shitting me.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: No, I am not shitting you. So I
dialog: pull out the 14 most damning docs
dialog: and I attach them to my motion. And
dialog: they prove everything.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: About the Church, about the bishops,

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: And it’s all public? Because your
dialog: motion to oppose Rogers’ motion...
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: »»-is public. That’s correct. Now
dialog: you're paying attention.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (head spinning)
dialog: So I can just walk into the
dialog: courthouse right now and get those
dialog: documents?
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: No. You cannot. Because the
dialog: documents are not there.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: But you just said they’re public.
speaker_heading: GARABEDIAN
dialog: I know I did. But this is Boston.
dialog: And the Church doesn’t want them to

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: SACHA
dialog: Yeah. And with the confirmation

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Robby, that source of yours, is this
dialog: someone we could revisit?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Might be tough.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But he has no problem helping the

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He’s a lawyer, he’s doing his job.
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: He knew and did nothing.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He coulda said something about this
dialog: years ago. Maybe saved some lives.
dialog: 11/26/14 130.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: What about us?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: We had all the pieces. Why didn’t
dialog: we get it sooner?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: We didn’t have all the pieces.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: We had Saviano, we had Barrett, we
dialog: had Geoghan. We had the directories

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You know what? We got it now.
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: Spotlight’s been around since 1970.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So what? We didn’t know the scope
dialog: of this. No one did. This started
dialog: with one goddamn priest, Robby.
text: Robby looks at Sacha. A beat.
speaker_heading: ROBBY
dialog: MacLeish sent us a letter on 20
dialog: priests, years ago. Sacha found the

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Are you freaking kidding me? 20
dialog: priests?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: SACHA
text: Just after Porter. December of ‘93.
speaker_heading: ROBBY

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That was you. You were Metro.
speaker_heading: ROBBY

dialog: But yeah.
text: The room quiets. Gut punch. Ben shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Uh, can I say something?
text: They turn to him.
speaker_heading: MARTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes it’s easy to forget that
dialog: we spend most of our time stumbling
text: around in the dark. Suddenly a
text: light gets turned on, and there's
dialog: fair share of blame to go around.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I can’t speak to what happened
dialog: before I arrived but all of you have
dialog: done some very good reporting here,
dialog: reporting that I believe is going to
dialog: have an immediate and considerable
dialog: impact on our readers.
dialog: (then)
dialog: For me, this kind of story is why we
dialog: do this.
text: The team takes this in.
speaker_heading: MARTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Having said that, Cardinal Law and
dialog: the Catholic community are going to
