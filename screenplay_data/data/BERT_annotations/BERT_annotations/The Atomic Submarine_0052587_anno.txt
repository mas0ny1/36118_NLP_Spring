speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 2 ANOTHER STOCK SHOT - ARCTIC WASTES - DAY
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: It would have astounded Peary to
dialog: learn that, by the late 1950's
dialog: and early 60's, the vast, frozen
dialog: top-of-the-world he pioneered had
dialog: become a vital highway for world

speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Here great passenger and cargo-

dialog: by the dozens, back and forth
text: across the Pole, until a series

dialog: threatened to close the Arctic

scene_heading: 5 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE SHOT - STURGEON
text: As it glides, very close, PAST CAMERA, so we can read
scene_heading: the name: U.S.A.S. STURGEON (United States Atom Sub
dialog: Sturgeon) on the bow. We may spot the closed-circuit
text: TV camera on the surface of the conning tower.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: The decisive moment came May 3, at
dialog: 1315 hours, when the undersea
dialog: atomic liner, Sturgeon, largest of
dialog: them all, reached 87 degrees, 10
dialog: minutes north latitude - only a
dialog: few miles from the North Pole it-
dialog: self!
scene_heading: 6 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - UNDERWATER ICE CAVE - DAY
text: In the depths of it appears a distant, faint ball of
text: glowing light. The ball begins moving toward CAMERA,
text: slowly, becoming larger and larger. There may be a
text: FAINT, WEIRD ELECTRICAL HUM just audible from it.
scene_heading: 7 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CARGO SUB STURGEON
text: It moves ahead, unconscious of impending doom, the Peep-
text: Peep of its sonar impulses now gradually increasing in
text: pitch, Doppler effect, as they echo back from the
text: approaching blob of light.
scene_heading: 8 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER - DAY
text: Dimly seen, a vague, indistinct shape (thru this sequence
text: -- it approaches -- a huge, oval-shaped disc, with what
text: seems to be a revolving turret, or lighthouse, on top.
text: The Peep-Peep of the Sturgeon sonar has now risen to a
text: frantic scream, and the MAGNETIC, LOW-FREQUENCY HUM from
text: the saucer becomes louder and louder

scene_heading: 9 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - PAN SHOT WITH STURGEON
text: The great atom sub glides past camera, but now, as we
text: are shooting from her stern over the bow, we see the
text: screws halt, then go into reverse, and she begins to
text: back away, back TOWARD CAMERA. Then, in the b.g., we
dialog: see the saucer, the great, eerie 'eye' or whatever it
text: is, looming like a searchlight on her top, and the
text: oval shape seeming like a great mass of glowing energy.
text: The saucer is easily overtaking the reversed Sturgeon,
dialog: when:
scene_heading: 10 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER
text: It moves to a position nearly filling screen, when...
text: A great bolt of sheer high-frequency energy - like an
text: undersea lightning bolt - stabs out from somewhere in
text: the saucer, and lances out TOWARD CAMERA.
scene_heading: 11 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER AND STURGEON
text: The great, stabbing bolt of energy impinges on the hull
text: of the Sturgeon, and for an instant, the entire sub
text: seems to glow with radiant light. Then, in closer de-
dialog: tails, we see the effects...
scene_heading: 12 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - BOW OF STURGEON
text: It seems to melt away (or collapse) like a shell of
text: paraffin over a fire. The water boils and hisses
dialog: about it.
scene_heading: 13 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CONNING TOWER
text: The radio antenna, the periscope, the mast, the tower
text: itself - all seem to melt, and collapse.
scene_heading: 14 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE STURGEON
text: What is left of the Sturgeon, glowing and hissing,
text: still red hot, begins rising to the surface, towards
dialog: the ice-layer.
scene_heading: 15 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER
text: It reverses, draws back into the ice-cave from which
dialog: it issued.

scene_heading: 16 SPECLAL EFFECT SHOT - ABOVE ICE - DAY
text: And now, she seems to be rising in a tremendous crunch-
text: ing, grinding, writhing activity. Finally, it breaks
text: completely, and for a moment, the red-hot hull of the
text: Sturgeon is visible in the cracking, grinding masses
text: of ice. Then, a larger hiss of steam, and finally a
text: ROAR of earthquake volume, a fireball, then a mushroom
text: cloud. The atomic reactor of the Sturgeon has blown up,

text: This room is, more than anything else, a system of maps

scene_heading: 22 CLOSE SHOT - ADMIRAL TERHUNE
text: The burly, grim-faced Admiral, in uniform, is at the
text: head of the conference table. There is an intercom
text: on a small stand beside his position at the table. The
text: Admiral has a sheaf of reports and photographs, also
text: a stack of mimeographed 'briefs' at his elbow. No
text: nonsense; Terhune speaks in clipped, brief phrases,
text: almost as if he has digested sentences down to short,
text: terse bursts before 'releasing' them from his lips.
text: The Admiralts lips are moving as we first see him,
text: but we do not hear his speech until the Narrator is
dialog: finished.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Admiral Terhune, in charge of the
dialog: Arctic Theater for the Joint Chiefs,
dialog: well knew the effect the 'leak' of

text: Secretary Murdock, distinguished, white-haired.
text: There is a KNOCK. Admiral Terhune presses the button,
text: the lock BUZZES, and the door opens.
text: COMMANDER WENDOVER steps inside. He is a hard-bitten,

text: them all in turn to command attention, the Admiral says:
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL
dialog: Gentlemen, to begin, let me read

text: deeply. Reef shakes his head, like a boxer who has
text: sustained a knockout punch, trying to clear it. CAMERA
text: PULLS BACK for MED. TWO. Julie, unable to speak for a
text: moment, throws a quick look at Reef, who seems to be
text: gulping for air, then she reaches for a cigarette from
text: a box on the coffee table. She drops two or three as
text: she fumbles for one and finally gets it in her mouth.
text: Reef picks up a table lighter, strikes it, holds it to
text: her cigarette. But his arm is trembling so he cannot
text: hold it steady. Finally, Julie grasps his wrist, holds
text: the flame steady, then contrives to bring the tip of the
text: cigarette in contact with it. She leans back, takes a
text: deep drag, only now dares to speak.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: What was I saying...about thawing

speaker_heading: SIR IAN
dialog: Here is a chart of the Arctic

text: He unrolls the chart on the table top. Reef and Wendover

scene_heading: 109 INSERT - CLOSEUP - THE CHART OF THE ARCTIC

speaker_heading: WENDOVER

text: Now Reef explains an idea he has been toying with:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: Suppose there's an atmosphere,
dialog: of some kind, inside Cyclops?
speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: (blankly)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: If we could get inside the saucer
dialog: - use our torches - maybe we could
dialog: cut the Shark loose?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: 252 (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: SIR IAN
dialog: That's all very fine, young man.
dialog: But how would one go about get-
dialog: ting inside Cyclops?
text: Reef takes a deep breath, throws a glance at Carl, then
dialog: says:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: Through the eye - with the
dialog: Depth-Explorer!
text: Carl seizes this eagerly.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yes - the Explorer was built to
dialog: operate at even greater depths --
speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: (disturbed)
dialog: But suppose there isn't an atmos-
dialog: phere inside the saucer?
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: (bluntly)
dialog: Then the idea's no good. But
dialog: we're no worse off than we are
dialog: right now.
text: Dave picks this up eagerly.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You've got to let us try, Skipper --
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: (startled)
dialog: 'Us?'
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: Reef and I can take the Explorer
text: down, clamp it around the eye,
dialog: and ---
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: No, you can't. But I can --
dialog: (to Reef)

dialog: to ban flying saucers!
text: Carl bridles angrily.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: That's enough, Holloway. I've
dialog: told you before, wearing boards
dialog: on your shoulders, and parading
text: with a stiff spine doesn't auto-
dialog: matically endow you with back-
dialog: bone - !
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: - any more than being the son

text: Wendover is watching this exchange with growing dis-
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: However our ideas disagree, as
dialog: I've said before, I'm not a
dialog: coward! And it happens you've
dialog: got no choice: Either I take
dialog: you down there, in the Lungfish,
dialog: or you don't get there -
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: I'd sooner swim!
speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: That's enough, Reef! Both of
dialog: you!
dialog: (to Reef)

speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: You better take Powell and
dialog: Carney with you --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The frogmen?
speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: With their underwater experience,
dialog: they'll be invaluable. Take
text: sidearms, and flare pistols --
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (puzzled)
text: Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: (holding up crossed
dialog: fingers)
dialog: We hope!
text: Wendover holds out his hands, shakes both theirs.
text: Reef turns to Dave.
speaker_heading: REEF

scene_heading: 256 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - BELLY OF TIGER SHARK

speaker_heading: REEF

text: He inches his way tortuously across the slender support,

scene_heading: 296 MATTE SHOT - BEHIND REEF - TOWARD SPHERE
text: He crawls cautiously towards the opening.
scene_heading: 296A INT. PLATFORM - BLACK BACKING - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - DAVE
text: Angry, impatient, he sets Reef's weapons down. Then he

scene_heading: 297 INT. SPHERE - DAY - MED. SHOT - FROM INSIDE - IRIS
speaker_heading: OPENING
text: Now Reef appears, crawls cautiously up into the opening,
text: then stands, looks inside. His eyes nearly start from
text: his head as he takes in the incredible sight.
scene_heading: 298 TRICK SHOT - FROM REEF'S P.O.V. - INTERIOR OF SPHERE -
speaker_heading: SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT
text: His eyes range over the ceiling of the glove, then as he
text: shifts his gaze to the bottom of the sphere, we see 'it'
text: - a horrendous organism, like a giant sea urchin, the
text: long, black, writhing spines now all in proper contact
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: - - -
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: 298 (CONTINUED)
text: with their grommet-sockets. And out of the center of
text: the pulsating central 'body' rises a long stalk, and on
text: the very tip of it a great, glowing 'eye.' The setup
text: is like a monstrous rendering of the eye of a snail.
scene_heading: 299 MATTE SHOT - UP PAST 'EYE' AT REEF IN IRIS
text: So he appears a tiny, miniature man compared to the
text: cavernous size of the sphere. And now, apparently
text: from the 'eye' itself, which seems to flicker and
text: glow like an electron beam spectrometer, comes the
dialog: saucer-voice again:
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: So, Commander Holloway - as
dialog: you Earth inhabitants would
dialog: express it - we meet 'face to
dialog: face.'
scene_heading: 300 CLOSE SHOT - REEF
text: As he says with sardonic inflection:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: That's a face???
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: Point of view is everything.
dialog: To us, your form of life is
dialog: ugly as we appear to you.
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: Tell me something: Why can I
dialog: hear you, when the others
dialog: couldn't?
scene_heading: 300A FROM REEF'S P.O.V. - THE EYE
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: You do not 'hear' me! Our in-

scene_heading: 300B CLOSE SHOT - REEF
text: Listening.
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: It is not necessary for you to
dialog: speak. Your 'thought-response'
dialog: will suffice.
dialog: (Note: From here on, in speech with the saucer, Reef's
text: lips do not move - his responses, except to Dave, are
dialog: all 'voice over')
scene_heading: 300C INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - DAY - DOWN SHOT - PANNING WITH
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: He cannot contain himself any longer, is now crawling
text: out onto the bridge, toward Reef; cradling the sub-
text: machine gun on his forearm as he goes.
scene_heading: 300D INT. SPHERE - DAY - MATTE SHOT - UP PAST 'EYE' - AT
speaker_heading: REEF IN IRIS
dialog: The conversation continues:
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: My mission is to study various
dialog: solar systems, and planets -
dialog: select the most suitable for
dialog: colonization -
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: - for horrors like yourself?
speaker_heading: SAUCER
dialog: Of course. It may interest you

scene_heading: 300E CLOSE SHOT - REEF
text: He looks a bit bewildered:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: He did!
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: I am afraid not. Therefore -
text: Now, to Reef's consternation, Dave suddenly appears be-
dialog: side him:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: (to Dave, lip sync)
dialog: Dave - !
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: What's goin' on in here, Lad?
dialog: What - ?
text: Then, Dave's mouth drops open, and he stares, incredulous.
scene_heading: 300F MATTE SHOT - AS BEFORE - DAVE'S P.O.V. - THE CREATURE
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: Stand away from him, Commander!
scene_heading: 300G TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF
text: As Dave, before Reef can stop him, steps forward
text: belligerently, levels and submachine gun down at the
dialog: creature.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (menacingly)
dialog: So this is 'headquarters,' huh?
dialog: Well, you've sunk your last ship,

scene_heading: 300H SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - DAVE - PRODUCTION SHOT
text: With a BOOM of tympany, a LIGHT STRIKES Dave, and

text: machine gun falls o.s.
scene_heading: 300I CUT TO COVER - THIS ACTION
scene_heading: 300J CLOSE SHOT - REEF
text: As he looks on, shocked, sobered, shaken. Then, in
text: his thought-voice, he asks slowly:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: Why not me? What am I - the
dialog: closing act?
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: On the contrary. I want you -
dialog: unharmed - perfect.
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: I have selected you, to return
dialog: with me - along with several other
dialog: specimens, for study. We will
dialog: examine you and the others, discover
dialog: desirable features to incorporate
dialog: in our 'earth-colonizers.'
scene_heading: 301 MATTE SHOT - REEF'S P.O.V. - THE ORGANISM
speaker_heading: REEF O.S.

scene_heading: 302 CUT TO COVER
scene_heading: 303 MED. CLOSE SHOT - REEF
text: Awed, frightened, he looks about him at the construction
text: of the chamber in which he is standing.
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: It is a living thing. When damaged
dialog: - you would say 'wounded' - it
text: immediately 'heals' itself.
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: (understanding)
dialog: That's why no water leaked inside
dialog: when we rammed you?
speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: Of course. But it is time to be-
dialog: gin the return voyage --
scene_heading: 304 CLOSE SHOT - REEF'S HAND
text: And we see it creep up under his coat, grabbing the
dialog: Very pistol.
scene_heading: 305 MED. CLOSE SHOT - REEF
text: as he says grimly, threateningly:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: To navigate, won't you have to...

speaker_heading: SAUCER VOICE
dialog: Obviously.
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: That might be a little rough!
text: And Reef raises the Very pistol, fires.

dialog: 107.
scene_heading: 306 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE 'EYE' OF THE ORGANISM
text: as the flare strikes it and bursts. There is a SCREAM,
text: an unearthly, shattering WAIL from the organism itself.
scene_heading: 307 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE ON 'EYE'
text: as the flare burns a hole in the iris, and the water,
text: or whatever it contains, seems to drain from it, like
text: a plastic bag when it is torn.
scene_heading: 308 CLOSE SHOT - REEF
text: He reacts quickly, astonished at the effect of his
text: shot. But then he wastes no time - turns and scrambles
text: back out. SCREAMS OF PAIN from the creature follow
dialog: him.
scene_heading: 309 INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - DAY - FAST PAN - WITH REEF
text: Heedless of the danger of falling, he scrambles madly

speaker_heading: 310 (OMITTED)
scene_heading: 310A PANNING WITH REEF
text: He reaches the platform, races madly for the ramp.

scene_heading: 312 INT. DEPTH-EXPLORER - DAY - AT HATCH WINDOW - OVER
speaker_heading: CARL'S SHOULDER
text: Carl reacts as the iris begins closing. Quickly, he
text: grabs a crowbar, or other prop, wedges it into the
text: iris, holding it open momentarily. A moment later,
text: Reef literally hurls himself into the little sub,
text: slams the hatch behind him, and exclaims:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: Back to the Shark - right
dialog: now!
text: Carl does not hesitate, begins working the controls.
speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: 312 (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: REEF

dialog: This is Reef, Skipper -- in the

scene_heading: 313 INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

scene_heading: 314 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK PROPELLERS

scene_heading: 315 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - SHARK AND DEPTH-EXPLORER

scene_heading: 316 INT. LOWER CHAMBER OF SAUCER - DAY - SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT
scene_heading: - CLOSE ON 'EYE'
text: And now we see, through a SERIES OF DISSOLVES that the

scene_heading: 317 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE 'FINGERS'

scene_heading: 318 INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - AT AIRLOCK
text: As Griff superintends preparations to open the lock door,

text: door, and in a moment, Reef staggers out, then helps Carl
text: from the Explorer. Wendover frowns, glances inside:
speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: What about --- ?
text: Reef only shakes his head. Faces are tense, then Reef
dialog: declares bitterly:
speaker_heading: REEF
dialog: We didn't kill it, Skipper. And
dialog: if it ever gets...back where it
dialog: came from...the Earth is doomed,
dialog: and everything and everybody on it!
scene_heading: 319 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - TIGER SHARK AND SAUCER
dialog: And now, the mighty engines of the Shark succeed - the
text: bow of the Shark pulls out of the hull of the saucer,
text: and the two vehicles float freely in the water.
scene_heading: 320 INT. FORWARD TORPEDO ROOM - DAY - GROUP SHOT
text: The scene JUMPS AND LURCHES. Then there is an exultant
dialog: voice:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (over intercom)
dialog: We've pulled loose, Skipper!
dialog: We're free!
text: Wendover and Reef exchange an exultant look. Then they

text: Carl and Sir Ian follow more slowly.
scene_heading: 321 INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY - FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
text: As Wendover and Reef come scrambling up the ladder and

dialog: 110.
scene_heading: 322 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - OPTICAL SHOT - THE TV SCREEN

speaker_heading: REEF (o.s.)
dialog: (despairingly)
dialog: There it goes!

speaker_heading: REEF

speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: Nothing we can do, now.
speaker_heading: KENT
dialog: Excuse me, Captain - there may

speaker_heading: WENDOVER
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: Anything ---
speaker_heading: KENT
dialog: It's possible I could adapt one of

scene_heading: 332 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

scene_heading: 335 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE ICE
text: It breaks up, boils, tremendous rending, tearing NOISES.
text: Then, from the depths of the water below, a familiar oval

scene_heading: 337 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE TIGER SHARK

dialog: for the surface.
scene_heading: 338 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE HOLE IN THE ICE
text: Now, from the black water, the ICBM leaps into-the air,
text: like a suddenly released, air-filled ball. As it leaps

text: a ROARING BLAST, and the ICBM leaps high into the air,
text: roars up o.s.
scene_heading: 339 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - WITH ICBM

scene_heading: 340 SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

text: The explosion is tremendous - a mighty, nuclear fireball,
