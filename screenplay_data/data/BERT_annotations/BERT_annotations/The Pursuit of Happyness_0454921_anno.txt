speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: (calling Chris to the bus)
dialog: We have to get back to the ship!
text: Chris ignores the guy. Something heavy’s going on between
text: Linda and Chris. They both seem blue.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (to Linda, calmly)
dialog: I’m almost out. One more year. Then
dialog: I’1l get a good job. And I’1l take
dialog: care of him. Hey.
dialog: Chris has said “hey” to get Linda to face him because she
dialog: hasn’t been. She does.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: I never had a dad. That’s not going
dialog: to happen to him. I’1l always take
dialog: care of him.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You didn’t want to be in this kind
dialog: of thing.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What kind of thing?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Kid. Not married. No jobs. No real
dialog: jobs. Neither did I
text: She’s sad over the event of her pregnancy. Chris tries to
text: cheer her in his calm way.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’1l get some good work after the
dialog: navy. It’s going to be fine. It’s
dialog: going to be.
text: Chris makes a brave face for Linda, but something about his
text: demeanor shows he knows, because of the pregnancy, that he’s
dialog: in a hard spot now he never wished to be in.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY (1981)
text: In the more urban setting of San Francisco, trash in City of

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Well, you know, you’re just going
dialog: to get a couple things.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

dialog: can choose better.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Can you spell everything you’re
dialog: thinking of?
text: Christopher thinks about it.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Okay. Make a list. That’s smart.
text: The light changes. They start to cross.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you doing okay in here?
text: Chris has nodded up ahead to a city-neighborhood, cut-rate

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Yeah... Can we go to the park

dialog: home.
scene_heading: EXT. MRS. CHU’S DAYCARE, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris leaves the daycare building after leaving Christopher
text: there. But he turns and looks back at the building.
text: He’s looking at their poorly-maintained mural of kids
text: playing. The paint’s peeling. There’s graffiti over kid’s
text: faces. And someone’s written Fuck in spray paint on it.
text: Then Chris looks at the daycare motto painted above. mrs.
text: Chu’s Daycare. Fun, Joy, Happyness. Chris looks at the word
text: Happyness. Time passes. Then he speaks to a Chinese daycare
text: maintenance worker who’s sweeping out there.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That’s misspelled.
scene_heading: MAINTENANCE WORKER
dialog: Hui hyu tsa.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Happiness? There’s no y. After p.
text: The guy keeps sweeping. Chris keeps looking at the wall, then

text: Christopher’s playing with blocks by himself - he looks more
text: lonesome than pleased.
scene_heading: INT. DAYCARE PLAYROOM - SAME
text: While Christopher plays quietly, Chris stands outside the

scene_heading: EXT. MRS. CHU’S - SAME

text: looking in at his son.
text: He’s watching Christopher play with the blocks alone inside.
text: There, a dog no one’s paying attention to walks right across
text: the kid’s play area over to a food bowl; there’s spilled food
text: laying around his bowl. It’s a cramped, unhappy setting for
dialog: kids.
text: Then Chris looks away from the window.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: This is part of my life story.
text: He looks at his watch. Late for something, Chris starts
text: running off with his machine.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris sits on a bus bench in the city; the guy beside him’s a
text: drunk Filipino with a screw loose, 60, in a T-shirt that
text: reads World’s Greatest Dad. Chris keeps the machine on his
text: lap. The two sit there waiting for the bus.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: This part, in the eighties... this
dialog: part’s called Riding the Bus.
text: All of a sudden, the Filipino guy faces Chris and looks
text: astonished.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: Holy shit, did you just crystallize
dialog: from nowhere?
text: The guy points at Chris’s machine.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s a time machine. Holy shit.
text: The bus arrives.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY (CONT’D)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Holy shit, man.
text: Chris’s expression shows the guy’s disturbing his peace. He
text: stands up to catch the bus.
scene_heading: INT. CITY BUS, MOVING - LATER
text: Chris rides through east San Francisco; he’s staring out the
text: window like he’s got something heavy on his mind. He keeps
text: the machine on his lap.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: That’s a bone density scanner.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: This guy has a time machine! This
dialog: one fucker!

scene_heading: EXT. BUS BENCH, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris waits for a transfer bus on a bench alone; he’s staring

speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: Where would I go if it was one? If
dialog: it was a time machine I wondered.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris carries his scanner as he walks through the city.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: Two years back, probably, before I
dialog: took this job.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: A DOCTOR and Chris part company before the entranceway to St.
text: Francis Hospital. Chris still has his scanner.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: This thing was unnecessary and
dialog: expensive. It gave a slightly
dialog: denser picture than an x-ray, for a
dialog: ton more money.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: We just don’t need it, Chris. It’s
dialog: unnecessary. And expensive.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: A still image of Chris standing among a crowd of San
text: Franciscans waiting for a walk light; he’s staring at the
text: scanner like he has personal hard feelings toward it.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: This was the business I bought
dialog: into, when we moved to San
dialog: Francisco.
text: *what follows is a montage of still images of Chris with his

speaker_heading: CHRIS

text: Chris looks at the car. Then he looks at the guy again.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How are you doing?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES OWNER
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Did you have to go to college to do
dialog: your job?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES OWNER
dialog: (smiling back)
dialog: Yeah. I’m a structural engineer
dialog: Yeah.
text: Chris nods. The light changes. Chris starts to cross the
text: street. Then he checks his watch and starts to run.
scene_heading: EXT. OAKLAND CA. - LATER
text: Chris runs along the sidewalk beyond a busy Oakland street;
text: he’s carrying his scanner.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: That’s my car.
text: In the foreground, among the cars parked on the streetside,

scene_heading: EXT. OAKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - LATER
text: Chris jogs with the scanner up the walkway to the main

speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: I made four hundred and eighteen
dialog: dollars on each sale.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL OFFICES - LATER
text: Chris carries his scanner down a long hallway.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: A thirty dollar ticket every three
dialog: days was a business expense. I
dialog: thought I’d take it out of the
dialog: commission on my scanners. As I
dialog: sold them.
scene_heading: EXT. OAKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - LATER
text: Chris walks out the same doors he entered on his way in; HE
text: STILL HAS THE SCANNER, THOUGH.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: I just wasn’t selling any.
scene_heading: INT. CHRIS’S HAZEL RIVIERA - LATER
text: This is a shot through the windshield of Chris’s parked car
text: Bright orange tickets cover the lower half of the windshield.
text: Chris is visible through the clear space of the glass
text: walking across the street up ahead, carrying his scanner.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: And I needed at least one
dialog: commission a week to cover rent and
dialog: daycare.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP, OAKLAND - LATER
text: Later, Chris sits on a bus bench beside an unaccompanied
text: Chinese kid trying to play a trumpet; it’s nearly evening.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (facing the kid)
dialog: Would you stop that?
text: The kid stops and faces Chris.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (to Chris)
dialog: Hu xia tu hi ma.
text: The kids sits quietly for a moment, then he resumes playing
dialog: the trumpet.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: So... the bus...
text: The bus pulls up.
scene_heading: INT. BUS, MOVING - LATER
text: Chris rides beside the window, with his bone scanner, looking
text: out at the landscape.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: All I’m saying... riding the bus
dialog: somedays is a drag.
text: The kid’s playing the trumpet somewhere behind him. Chris
text: sits there for a while. He’s sharing the row with a real
text: heavy guy and he’s sort of over against the wall with his
dialog: machine.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: I remember... I think it was this
dialog: day... I remember I actually tried
dialog: it.
text: Chris looks down at his scanner.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: Just in case that crazy fucker was
dialog: somehow right.
text: Chris keeps staring at the machine.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: I had this stupid thought, or wish
dialog: that maybe he was right and
dialog: everyone else was crazy, and maybe
dialog: I was a time traveler and didn’t
dialog: know it and could really go
dialog: somewhere else if I pushed the
dialog: button.
text: CLOSE ON CHRIS as he considers this. He puts his finger on
text: the black button.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: And I actually pushed the button...
dialog: like an idiot...
text: Chris pushes the button on his medical machine.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: ...and went nowhere.
text: Chris sits there for a moment. He’s gone nowhere of course.
text: Soon, he turns and looks out the window. The city’s going by
text: beyond him.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK, SAN FRACISCO - LATER
text: Chris walks down the sidewalk with the scanner. He comes upon
text: a young man paying a meter for a parked Ferrari; Chris has
text: looked at the guy and the car.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (to the guy, saying hi)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: FERRARI OWNER
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Can I ask you something?
speaker_heading: FERRARI OWNER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (to the guy)
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: FERRARI OWNER
dialog: (looking over)
dialog: What? For a job?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FERRARI OWNER
dialog: I’m a stockbroker.
text: Time passes.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Do you have to go to college?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: FERRARI OWNER
dialog: Have to?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah.
text: More time goes by.
speaker_heading: FERRARI OWNER
dialog: You don’t have to.
text: Chris nods. The guy’s said it to mean you don’t have to but
text: you sure should. Then Chris starts to cross the street.
scene_heading: INT. CHRIS’S APARTMENT - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Chris and Linda eat dinner at the kitchen table without
text: speaking. Linda wears a grocery worker’s uniform. The
text: apartment’s small and unadorned with anything. Some time
text: passes during which there’s the heavy silence between a
dialog: couple not getting along.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Linda cleans up after dinner. Chris walks past and sees a
text: RUBIK’S CUBE resting on a kitchen counter
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: A gift for Christopher.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: From who?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Cynthia. From work. It’s for
dialog: adults. It’s an adult thing. Chris
dialog: can’t use it. She didn’t know.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You’re supposed to make every side
text: a solid color.
text: Chris picks the thing up.
speaker_heading: LINDA (CONT’D)
dialog: Did you pay the taxes?
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I filed an extension...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You already filed an extension.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I had to file another one. The bill
dialog: was six hundred and fifty. I’1l
dialog: have it in September.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: That means interest. Right?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. Some.
text: Money seems to be a source of conflict for them. Rather than
text: deal with it further, Linda leaves the room. Chris remains
dialog: there.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIO, APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)
text: Chris has come out on the patio idly with the cube; it’s not
dialog: a patio in the sense that one would derive enjoyment from
text: sitting there. It’s cement space outside the kitchen. Each
text: small apartment in the complex has one, so Chris is sitting
text: five feet from his neighbor’s patios on either side. He’s
text: started messing with the cube. Time passes like this while
text: Chris, over a minute or so in real time, SOLVES THREE SIDES
text: OF THE RUBIK’S CUBE COMPLETELY. His thoughts are somewhere
text: else, though, so he doesn’t care to finish. He just puts the
text: thing down and goes back inside.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY (MORNING)
text: Chris and Linda share the real small space of their bathroom;
text: Chris brushes his teeth. Linda’s finishing dressing for work;
text: they’re in the middle of an argument.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (upset about it)
dialog: Does he have to be in daycare from
dialog: 6:30 in the morning?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (pissed too)
dialog: Can you watch him?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I need to be in the financial
dialog: district. Before work.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I have to open. It’s the
dialog: nineteenth. We have to pay rent
dialog: next week. I need both shifts.
text: Linda tries to leave and bumps Chris’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: LINDA (CONT’D)
dialog: Fuck...
text: Linda walks out. Chris is left alone. He stands there for a
text: while. Then he resumes brushing his teeth. A few moments go
text: by. Chris rises up and looks in the mirror for a while; he’s
text: sizing himself up. Time passes while Chris looks at himself.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Chris has followed Linda into their bedroom.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I just want to go by Dean Witter.
dialog: Before work.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I want to see about a job.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What job?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I want some information about a job
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What job?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Stockbroker.
text: Linda looks at Chris like he’s aiming off the mark for what’s
dialog: likely or best for them.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: I could go through a math book ina
dialog: week when I was a kid. I want to
dialog: see about it.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I have to open. So you have
dialog: Christopher.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’1l go by during the day.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You should probably do your sales
dialog: calls. Sell what’s in your contract
dialog: and get us out of that business,
dialog: Chris. Fuck, Chris. Okay?
text: Linda has finished dressing and leaves the room. Chris
text: watches her go.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTOPHER’S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Christopher’s sleeping. The clock beside his bed reads 5:30.
text: Chris sits on the bed, waking him up.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Christopher...
scene_heading: INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - LATER
text: Chris and his son have breakfast. The table’s in the kitchen.
dialog: The kitchen’s real small. It’s pretty early. Christopher’s
text: holding a cereal spoon. But his eyes are closed and he’s
text: motionless. Chris looks over at him.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (trying to wake him up)
dialog: Pssst.
text: Christopher’s eyes open. Chris looks at him. There’s a small,
text: black and white TV on the counter that plays local news;
text: there, a field reporter’s holding a Rubik’s Cube up for the
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: ...is shaping up to the be the gift
dialog: sensation of 1981. Don’t expect to
dialog: solve it easily, although we
dialog: encountered a math professor at USF
dialog: who took just thirty minutes on
dialog: his.
text: Chris notices the TV. He’s getting the idea the cube’s a
text: challenge he could pass easily. He looks back at Christopher
text: Christopher’s eyes are closed again. Chris looks at him with
dialog: bad feelings he’s got his son up so early.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris is freshly dressed for work and is holding a scanner as
text: he sits waiting for the San Francisco city bus.
dialog: 14.
text: The kid with the trumpet sits beside him, playing it. Chris
text: stares straight ahead like he’s determined about something.
scene_heading: EXT. DEAN WITTER OFFICE, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Businessmen and women walk around the financial district.
text: Soon, Chris becomes visible, turning a corner onto the same
text: sidewalk, joining the group of traders and brokers. He stops
text: and looks across the street at a Dean Witter branch office;
text: he’s holding the scanner. Then he turns back the way he came.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Down the street, Chris speaks with a GIRL JUNKIE who sits a
text: couple steps up apartment stairs off the sidewalk. The
text: scanner rests at Chris’s feet; Chris holds some dollar bills.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Can I give you a couple dollars?
dialog: You can watch this for me? I’m
dialog: going in for a meeting. I don’t
dialog: want to bring this in and look
dialog: small time.
speaker_heading: GIRL JUNKIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Chris hands the girl the money. Something occurs to him.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (doesn’t want her to steal
dialog: it)
dialog: It can’t be sold anywhere. It’s
dialog: medical equipment. It can’t be sold
dialog: anywhere. I can’t even sell them,
dialog: and it’s my job. I’1l give you some
dialog: more money when I get back.
speaker_heading: GIRL JUNKIE
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA, DEAN WITTER BRANCH - LATER
text: Chris sits alone in the reception area. Then TIM BROPHY
text: enters the room.
speaker_heading: TIM BROPHY
dialog: Chris?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (standing quickly)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: TIM BROPHY
dialog: (offering his hand)
dialog: Tim Brophy. Resources. I was going
dialog: out to grab a coffee. Do you want
dialog: to come?
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC SQUARE, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris and Tim Brophy have come outside to a nearby public
text: park square. They’re mid-conversation, sitting together on
text: the low, perimeter wall of the park fountain.
speaker_heading: TIM BROPHY
dialog: Here’s an ap. For our internship.
dialog: That’s all we can do for you here.
text: Brophy hands the application to Chris.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thanks...
speaker_heading: TIM BROPHY (CONT’D)
dialog: We have a resume sheet, too. We’ve
dialog: had a lot of applications, though.
dialog: We're out.
text: CHRIS HAS NOTICED SOMETHING ACROSS THE PARK, THOUGH; THE GIRL
text: JUNKIE’S CARRYING HIS SCANNER OFF. She’s walked away with it
dialog: into the city.
speaker_heading: TIM BROPHY (CONT’D)
dialog: You can pick one up at your school.
dialog: We send them out.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Mr. Brophy, I have to go.
speaker_heading: TIM BROPHY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I have to. Thanks.
text: Then Chris rises and runs off.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris sprints through a large group of young market traders
text: on break.
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET/TRAIN STATION, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: The girl junkie with the scanner takes the stairs up to the
text: train. It’s a long shot that shows city sidewalk a good
text: distance behind her; Chris is visible down there running
text: toward her. But the train comes and blocks the view. The
text: train sits there, obscuring anything that’s happening behind
text: it. After a while, it moves along, and when it’s totally out
text: of frame it reveals Chris standing on the station platform
text: all alone without his scanner, having reached it too late.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: I rode up and down looking for her.
dialog: That day.
scene_heading: INT. CITY TRAIN, MOVING - LATER
text: Chris stands near the window of the moving train, watching
text: the city landscape pass outside.
scene_heading: INT. CITY TRAIN, MOVING - LATER
text: This train’s moving the other way. Chris is seated now. He
text: looks at the papers Brophy gave him.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: There were three blank lines after
dialog: “High School” to list more
dialog: education. The program took just
dialog: twenty people every six months. One
dialog: got a job. The internship paid
dialog: nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY TRAIN PLATFORM, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Chris leaves a train later with some others. He walks across
text: the platform toward the stairs, then he puts the application
text: in the trash can by the steps and keeps walking.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, SAN FRANCISCO - MORNING
text: It’s just sunrise so there’s little traffic. Chris and
text: Christopher leave Linda at a bus stop bench for her ride to
text: work and start walking off on their own somewhere; Chris
text: carries a scanner, Christopher a backpack.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (to Chris, about the
dialog: scanner, kidding sort of)
dialog: Come back without that, please.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (trying to be light-
dialog: hearted about it)
dialog: I’m going to. Say goodbye to it.
dialog: Because I’m coming back without it.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (to the scanner, just
dialog: slightly amused)
dialog: Goodbye. And good riddance.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (trying to kid)
dialog: You didn’t have to add “good
dialog: riddance.”
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (to Chris and Christopher)
dialog: Goodbye.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - LATER
dialog: Chris and Christopher have walked farther into east San
text: Francisco, past a park where one guy’s shooting baskets.
text: Christopher’s watching him.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That’s not how you spell it.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: P-p-y. It’s an “i.” Happiness.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: That’s an adjective?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. It’s just not spelled right
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Is “fuck” right?
text: Chris doesn’t say anything for a while.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. But that’s not part of the
dialog: motto. So... you’re not supposed to
dialog: learn that. It’s a grown up word.
dialog: To show anger, and other things.
dialog: Drop it, okay?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What’s it say on your bag? That
dialog: tape?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: My nickname. We picked nicknames.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What’s it say?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Hot Rod. Did you have a nickname?
text: Chris thinks for a while.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Ten Gallon Head...
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I lived in Louisiana, near Texas.
dialog: Before I joined the navy. People
text: wore cowboy hats. A ten gallon’s a
dialog: big hat. I was good at school. I
dialog: was smart when I was a kid, so they
dialog: called me Ten Gallon Head.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Hoss wears that hat.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hoss?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
text: Hoss Cartwright. On Bonanza.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How do you know Bonanza?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
text: I watch Bonanza at Mrs. Chu’s.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You watch Bonanza at daycare?

speaker_heading: FIRST PARTNER

text: and starts to run.
scene_heading: INT. CITY BUS, MOVING - SAME

text: PARKING TICKET ON THE WINDSHIELD.
scene_heading: INT. CITY TRAIN - LATER
text: Later, Chris rides the metro train. Pretty soon, he sees
text: OFFICE MANAGER ALAN FRAKESH, having just boarded, walking
text: down the aisle. They make eye contact.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why are you on the train?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I’m just cruising up to Morgan
dialog: Stanley. For a presentation.
text: Parking in the financial district’s
dialog: a pain in the ass.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah.
text: Alan takes an empty space beside Chris.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Thanks for moving my car.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That’s all right. It’s on Sierra.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (like Sierra’s pretty far)
dialog: Sierra?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah.
text: Chris reaches into his work bag.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: There weren’t any spaces around
dialog: Lowery. Where you said.
text: Chris TAKES THE PARKING TICKET OUT.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: I missed an appointment at Bell
dialog: Western. With Walter Ribbon. Walter
dialog: Ribbon left.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Man...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I was twenty-three minutes late.
text: Now Chris is A LITTLE MORE THAN VAGUELY HOLDING THE TICKET
text: OUT TOWARD ALAN TO ALLOW ALAN TO ASSUME IT AND THE
text: RESPONSIBILITY OF PAYING FOR IT. Alan has seen the ticket but
dialog: isn’t taking it.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Tell him some Dean Witter business
dialog: came up.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Something for a current client.
dialog: That’11 seem industrious.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah...
text: Chris HAS CONTINUED TO HOLD THE PARKING TICKET OUT. FRAKESH
text: CONTINUES TO IGNORE IT. So Chris just reaches over and puts
text: the ticket on Alan’s body. Alan, though, will not take
text: possession of the parking ticket. He merely allows it to
text: slide slowly down his sportcoat sleeve and come to rest on
text: the train seat between him and Chris. HE DOESN’T EVEN
text: ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT JUST HAPPENED either; he’s just kept
text: looking straight ahead.
text: Chris looks at Alan. Alan won’t make eye contact.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: What follows is a series of dissolves featuring the train
text: interior with Alan and Chris sitting with the ticket equally
dialog: between them.
dialog: 78.
text: Through dissolves, the passage of time is indicated by the
text: changing crowd of passengers around Chris and Alan Frakesh.
text: New riders appear and disappear. Throughout the sequence,
text: though, the ticket remains exactly between the two men. Soon
text: the train comes to a stop. Alan rises.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Thanks again for moving my car.
text: Alan walks down the aisle to leave the train. He leaves the
text: ticket behind. Chris remains beside it. Alan has disembarked.
text: The train begins moving again, taking Chris and his parking
text: ticket somewhere else. Then Chris puts it in his workbag.
scene_heading: INT. DINER, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Chris and Christopher sit across from one another at a booth.
text: Chris pays the parking ticket with his checkbook
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We should get home pretty soon.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (kindly)
dialog: Finish up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (looking at the checkbook)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: Paying bills. A parking ticket.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: You don’t have a car anymore.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I know.
text: Chris looks down at his checkbook.
speaker_heading: CHRIS’S POV
dialog: The amount he’s just written as his balance is $64.08
text: Chris looks at that for a while. He’s worried.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I need to take you with me to a
dialog: couple doctors’ offices tomorrow.
dialog: Okay? For a sales call.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Then... possibly... we’ll go toa
dialog: baseball game. Possibly. Okay?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUS, SUBURBS - LATER
text: It’s a jarring cut because for the first time, the setting is
text: not the city. Chris and Christopher ride in the bus together.
scene_heading: THEY’RE WEARING BRAND NEW SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS BASEBALL CAPS
text: SO FRESH THEIR BRIMS AREN’T BENT. Chris has a scanner with
text: him. Out the window pass spread out suburban homes and trees.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN TOWN - LATER
text: Later, Chris and Christopher, in their fresh caps, walk past
dialog: suburban houses.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You don’t understand what?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Are we going to the game?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We’re possibly going to the game.
dialog: Do you know what possibly means?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Like probably.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No... Possibly means we might, we
dialog: might not. Probably means there’s a
dialog: good chance we’re going.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (testing him)
dialog: What does probably mean?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: It means there’s a good chance.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What does possibly mean?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I know what it means.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: It means we’re not going to the
dialog: game.
text: Chris laughs. He looks at his son for a while.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How’d you get so smart?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Because you’re smart.
text: Chris smiles. They fall silent and keep walking. After a
text: while, Chris’s expression shifts to doubt and concern whether
dialog: his son’s really right about that
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - LATER
text: Chris has knocked on the door of a large private home.
text: Christopher waits beside him. Soon, Walter Ribbon answers the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Mr. Ribbon?
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’m Chris Gardner.
text: Ribbon’s wearing a Giants cap as well.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Dean Witter.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: Hi... what are you doing up--
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I came to apologize for missing our
dialog: appointment.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: You didn’t need to come up.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I wanted to thank you for your
dialog: time. You probably waited for me.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: A little bit.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I didn’t want you to think I took
dialog: that for granted.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: (nodding at the scanner)
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: An Acro density scanner. I sold
dialog: them before I began at Dean Witter
dialog: I have a few remaining on a sales
dialog: lease. I have an appointment. After
dialog: the game.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: You guys are going to the game?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. This is my son Chris.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: We’re going too. I’m taking my son
dialog: Tim. My sixteen-year-old. We were
text: just leaving.
dialog: (calling back into the
dialog: house)
dialog: Tim.
text: Chris waits in the doorway. He begins to go.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Well, we’1l leave you alone. I’m
dialog: sorry about yesterday. It just
dialog: wasn’t enough time to finish my
dialog: work and get across the district. I
dialog: was eager, and probably too
dialog: optimistic about getting over
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: I appreciate that.
text: Chris waves goodbye. He begins to leave with Chris. Some time
text: passes as they walk farther away from Ribbon.
text: Walter Ribbon watches Chris and his son walk off and approach
text: a car on the streetside that isn’t Chris’s.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: Hey.
text: Chris seems relieved. He turns.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON (CONT’D)
dialog: You guys want to come with us?
text: Chris looks at Ribbon; A BALLGAME TRIP WITH RIBBON IS WHAT HE
text: WAS TRYING TO PULL OFF BY COMING OUT.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: To Candlestick?
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: Yeah. We’re going now. Come with
dialog: us. Where are your seats?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Upper deck.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: We have a box. Come on.
dialog: (to Christopher )
dialog: Do you want to sit in a box?
text: Christopher thinks about it for a while.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: (plainly)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (to his son)
dialog: It’s not an actual box.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CHRIS(cont 'd)
dialog: It’s a closed off area. It’s more
dialog: comfortable.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Okay.
text: Chris looks at Ribbon and smiles.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, that would be great.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: (calling back to the
dialog: house)
dialog: Tim!
text: Chris has come over to Walter’s car. He’s starting to enter
text: with his scanner.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON (CONT’D)
dialog: Why don’t you just put that in your
dialog: car?
text: Chris looks over at the strange car he was just pretending to
text: enter; He looks at Ribbon for a while, trying to come up with
text: something. Then HE DOES SOMETHING PRETTY WEIRD.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Ah!
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: (meaning what happened)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I just got stung by a bee.
text: Ribbon looks at Chris. He didn’t see any bee anywhere. It
dialog: functioned as enough of a subject change though that Ribbon
text: opens his driver’s door without bringing up the scanner
text: again. So Chris is able to get in the car without dealing
dialog: with the issue.
scene_heading: INT. WALTER RIBBON’S CAR, MOVING - LATER
text: Chris rides in the passenger seat. Ribbon’s driving them
dialog: toward San Francisco.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: You’re not allergic or anything?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: Where did it get you?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Like... back of my head.
text: No one speaks for a little while.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: Thomas Jefferson mentions happiness
dialog: a couple times in the Declaration
dialog: of Independence.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
text: CLOSE ON the phrase effect their safety and happiness.
text: CLOSE ON the phrase road to happiness.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: It may seem like a strange word to
dialog: be in that document. But he was
dialog: sort of... he was an artist.
scene_heading: EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - LATER
text: Chris and his son are in the midst of a Bell Western tailgate
text: party. Christopher plays with some of the younger kids in the
text: party. Chris sits on a lowered tailgate of an SUV, drinking
dialog: soda.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: He called the English, “the
dialog: disturbers of our harmony.” And I
dialog: remember sitting there that day
dialog: thinking about the disturbers of
dialog: mine.
text: CLOSE ON CHRIS as he considers.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: Mrs. Chu. Running. Christopher
dialog: maybe going with Linda to Los
dialog: Angeles. That idea.
dialog: 85.
text: Christopher runs around in the grass lot. Chris watches him.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: My bent thumb.
text: When Chris lifts his soda, WE SEE HIS WAYWARD THUMB.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
text: I sat on the tailgate of someone's
dialog: truck for forty minutes because of
text: the lack of an actual bee sting on
dialog: the back of my head. I couldn’t get
dialog: up and get a hot dog. And I was
dialog: pretty hungry. And I thought about
dialog: all this.
text: Chris looks at something significant.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: But Walter Ribbon and his Bell
dialog: Western pension money, which was
dialog: millions, was a way to leave it
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: CHRIS’S POV
text: Walter Ribbon speaks with a group of colleagues nearby.
text: They’re laughing it up with pregame good cheer.
text: Chris looks over at Walter.
scene_heading: INT. CORPORATE BOX, CANDLESTICK PARK, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Walter Ribbon holds a conversation with other work friends in
text: the crowded Bell Western corporate box. When he has a quiet
text: moment, Chris comes up to him. Ribbon turns to see Chris as
text: he arrives.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thank you again for having us.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: That’s my pleasure, Chris.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Mr. Ribbon, I’d love the chance to
dialog: introduce you to what Dean Witter
dialog: could do for your company. I’d be
dialog: pleased to come meet you whenever
dialog: you have the chance. We can beat
dialog: your arrangement with Morgan
dialog: Stanley.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: Chris, I didn’t have a notion you
dialog: were a first year over there. I
dialog: like you. But there’s not a chance
dialog: I’d let you direct our fund. That’s
dialog: not going to happen, buddy. Come
dialog: on. Relax. Enjoy the game.
text: Walter has patted Chris on the shoulder kindly and walked
text: off. Chris remains behind.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT, CANDELSTICK PARK - LATER
text: The Ribbons and Gardners part company with other Bell Western
text: corporate employees in a parking lot of Candlestick. A couple
text: of the younger ones exchange cards with Chris.
speaker_heading: YOUNG EXECUTIVE
dialog: (to Chris)
dialog: Give me a call.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: SECOND YOUNG EXECUTIVE
dialog: (handing Chris his card)
dialog: Nice to meet you, Chris.
text: Chris heads off with the Ribbons. THE VIBE HERE IS PRETTY
text: BLUE BECAUSE CHRIS DIDN’T SCORE WITH RIBBON THE WAY HE HOPED.
scene_heading: EXT. WALTER RIBBON’S HOUSE, SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER
text: Ribbon has pulled his car up to his home. The group is
text: splitting up - the Ribbon’s going inside and Chris and his
text: son walking off toward the street
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thank you again.
speaker_heading: WALTER RIBBON
dialog: My pleasure.
text: The Ribbons head in. Chris and Christopher walk out to the
text: street. Chris waits there for a moment, making sure the
dialog: Ribbons have gone into their house for sure. They have. So
text: Chris and Christopher start walking off down the street, back
dialog: to whatever bus stop brought them there.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER (NIGHT)
text: A wide shot of the Gardner’s motel room gets across for the
dialog: first time what threadbare conditions they’re living in.
dialog: 87.
text: Christopher sleeps on the side of the room on a cot. Chris
text: reads a financial textbook in the kitchenette. The scanner
text: stack of four is visible in the frame. THE IMAGE BECOMES
text: STILL, LIKE THE STILL IMAGES USED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE
text: PICTURE.
text: What follows is a series of these still photographs of the
text: same setting. In each of them, Christopher sleeps and Chris
text: sits in different positions around the kitchen table,
text: studying. BUT IN EACH PASSING PICTURE THERE IS ONE FEWER
scene_heading: SCANNER UNTIL NONE REMAINS.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL OFFICE, MOTEL - DAY
text: On another day, after work, Chris has taken his mail from his
text: slot. He’s checking out something that’s got him worried.
text: He’s opened the letter. Christopher hangs around in the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: CHRIS’S POV
text: The header reads IRS. The section beneath it
dialog: reads...immediate payment of full balance of $645.14. The IRS
dialog: will effect garnishment of wages from your employer....
text: Chris stares at the letter like it bears an unexpected,
dialog: critical difficulty.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Chris is back in the setting of the still photos. He’s
text: writing this check at the kitchen table. Christopher sleeps.
text: THE SCANNERS ARE ALL GONE. Chris looks up after finishing the
text: check. He’s grown deeply concerned.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
text: On a day off, Chris has caught up with his acquaintance Wayne
text: outside a city grocery.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Do you have the fourteen dollars
dialog: man?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I thought I didn’t owe you that
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Why what?
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why did you think that?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I helped you move.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You drove me across Kelsey Street.
dialog: That’s five yards. Wayne. Fuck.
dialog: It’s been four months. Come on
dialog: man.
text: Christopher has come out of the market and joined them. He
text: starts walking off with his dad.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Are we going to school?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: It’s Saturday.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

scene_heading: INT. DINER, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris and Christopher have met one of the YOUNG EXECUTIVES

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How much are you putting in your
dialog: pension?
speaker_heading: YOUNG EXECUTIVE
dialog: All of it.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Well, here’s what it could look
dialog: like if you put a quarter in an
dialog: index.
text: Chris hands the guy the graph.
speaker_heading: YOUNG EXECUTIVE
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: Chris, I have to run. Do you want
dialog: to finish up later this week?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. Ben wanted to meet, too. Your
dialog: colleague?
speaker_heading: YOUNG EXECUTIVE
dialog: Yeah. Ben March. You want to all
dialog: just get together?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That would be great. If there’s
dialog: anybody else at Bell Western that
dialog: would like to sit down, let me
dialog: know.
scene_heading: INT. REGISTER, DINER - LATER
text: Chris, with his son, pays at the register.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: There was a month left in the
dialog: program. I was broke.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris has come outside with Christopher. They’re about to
text: cross the street to their residence motel. But Chris sees
text: something that makes him keep from going.
speaker_heading: CHRIS’S POV
text: Chris can see in the open door of his motel room. The motel
text: manager’s in there, putting Chris’s clothes into Chris’s
dialog: suitcase.
text: Chris stares at him.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (to Christopher )
dialog: Let’s go for a walk.
text: After a moment, they head off another direction.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY PARK - LATER
text: Chris sits off to the side of a sand box area where
text: Christopher plays with some other kids. Chris seems pretty
text: distressed. A while goes by. Then CHRIS CATCHES SIGHT OF
speaker_heading: SOMETHING.
text: He’s seen, vaguely, a couple blocks up ahead, the Filipino
text: walk across an intersection with his scanner.
dialog: 90.
text: Chris looks in that direction, though the guy’s slipped from
dialog: sight.
text: Then Chris looks over at Christopher who he doesn’t want to
dialog: leave.
text: Then looks back the two blocks away where the guy’s gone off
dialog: to.
text: Then Chris picks Christopher up.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: Chris runs with Christopher.
scene_heading: EXT. WHARF, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER
text: The guy’s sitting on a bench at the end of the wharf. Soon
text: Chris comes up to it; he sees that he can walk now because
dialog: there’s nowhere else for the guy to go.
text: CLOSE ON the guy, he’s got his eyes closed.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hi...
text: Chris has walked up beside him. The guy looks at Chris for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Hey, Time Man.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey...
text: Chris stands there for a while with his son.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Where did you find it?
speaker_heading: FILLIPINO GUY

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: (nodding at the scanner)
dialog: That’s broken, right?
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Do you have all the pieces?
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: Yeah.
text: As Chris looks on, the guy takes a couple stray pieces from
text: his coat pocket. He hands them to Chris.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I have to go away to fix it. Okay?
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: Okay.
text: He looks at Chris.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY (CONT’D)
dialog: You’11 come back?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah...
text: Chris starts to go.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: Because I want to go back to the
dialog: fifties, man. When I was thirty
dialog: three, man. That’s what I want to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: When I had all my days ahead, man.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY
dialog: I want to see Jimi Hendrix do that
text: guitar on fire.
text: They look at one another.
speaker_heading: FILIPINO GUY (CONT’D)
dialog: Bring my time machine back.
text: Chris waves, then turns and starts to leave with his machine.
scene_heading: INT. CITY TRAIN, MOVING - LATER
text: Chris and his son ride on the train with the scanner.
dialog: 92.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER
text: Chris sits in a doctor’s office waiting area, waiting for the
text: chance to sell the machine. Christopher sits beside him,
text: reading. Then the receptionist comes in from the inner-
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Chris, Dr. Telm’s not going to be
text: able to get back from the hospital.
text: Chris tries not to come off disheartened.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Okay...
scene_heading: INT. CITY TRAIN, MOVING - LATER
text: Chris and Christopher take the train elsewhere.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: To Dr. Strauk’s.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I’m tired.
speaker_heading: CHRIS

text: Chris looks worried he can’t sell his machine. The train
text: comes to a stop. Chris picks the scanner up.
scene_heading: INT. DR. STRAUK’S OFFICE - LATER
text: Chris speaks with a doctor in his meeting room. Chris has
text: just tried to fire up the machine, but it’s not working.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It’s not...
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Fuck...

dialog: ...functioning right now. There was

dialog: tried to--
speaker_heading: DR. STRAUK

dialog: I’m going to put some money into
dialog: the office.
dialog: 93.

scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - LATER (EVENING)
text: It’s night now. Chris and Christopher walk up to their motel
text: door. There’s a large piece of luggage left outside. Chris
text: looks at it. Then Chris tries his key in the lock. It doesn’t
text: work. Chris stands there for a while. More time passes. Then
text: he lifts the luggage.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: (growing upset)
dialog: Where are we going now?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Christopher.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I don’t want to go.
text: Christopher’s worn out. He slumps down to stay right there.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Come on, hon.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: I don’t want to.
text: Chris lifts him up.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT DOORWAY, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER (NIGHT)
text: It’s later now. Chris knocks on the door. No one answers.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (knocking again)
dialog: Wayne!
text: Chris keeps knocking. He waits for an answer. None comes.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: INT. CITY TRAIN STATION, SAN FRANCISCO - LATER (NIGHT)
text: Chris and his son stand with Chris’s things in front of the
text: station signs that give commuters a choice for trains north

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Where are we going?
text: Chris stares up at the signs a while longer.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I don’t know.
text: Then Chris walks over and sits on a rest bench in the station
text: lobby. There’s no one else there. It’s dark outside. Soon,
text: Christopher comes over and sits beside Chris. A pretty long
text: time goes by.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: That’s not a time machine.
text: Chris isn’t listening.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s not a time machine.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Like that guy said.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What guy?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: That guy said it’s a time machine.
text: Chris looks at his son.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, it is.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: No, it’s not.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You push that black button. Then

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Are you going to do it?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Let’s just push the button and see.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Okay.
text: Christopher pushes the black button.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Close your eyes.

text: Christopher begins to stand up.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (stopping him)
dialog: Watch out.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: SHELTER WORKER

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: CHRIS

text: It got caught in the train.
speaker_heading: SHELTER WORKER

dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: PASTOR
dialog: (to the line of men)
text: Four left. There’s four more.
text: Chris sees he’s fourth in line. He seems relieved until the
text: LARGE GUY SIDESTEPS IN FRONT OF HIM LIKE HE WAS NATURALLY
text: THERE. Chris stares at him for a while. He’s waiting, maybe
dialog: for the guy to leave, maybe for the guy to realize his
text: mistake. But the guy doesn’t leave.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey, man.
text: The guy doesn’t do anything.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, come on.
speaker_heading: LARGE GUY

speaker_heading: LARGE GUY
dialog: Back up.
text: This guy elbows Chris back.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You cut.

speaker_heading: LARGE GUY
dialog: Back the fuck up.
text: Chris has been startled by the violence he’s using.
text: Christopher looks on; he’s scared. Chris seems scared, too.
text: But he shoves the guy. Then Chris holds him around the head,
text: bends him and takes him to the ground. They start fighting
text: down there while the line scatters then starts cheering them
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: PASTOR
dialog: Out of the line!
text: THE PASTOR HAS COME OUT FROM THE SHELTER. He yanks Chris off
text: the larger man.

dialog: (to the pastor)
text: He sliced in front of him in line.
speaker_heading: PASTOR
dialog: Who did?
text: The homeless guy doesn’t want to say it out loud. He nods at
text: the larger man.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (to the Pastor)
dialog: I got here first.
text: Chris is catching his breath.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: I was here first.
text: The Pastor looks at Chris. Then he looks at Christopher.
text: Chris looks at the Pastor with the clearest communication of
dialog: desperation he’s shown yet
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: I came from my job. We got here. We
text: got in line. This guy just came up.
dialog: He shoved in front. I went and got
dialog: my son and we got here. We were
dialog: here on time. Someone told me we
dialog: had to be here on time. We were on
dialog: time.
text: The Pastor stares at him for a while.
speaker_heading: PASTOR
dialog: All right.
dialog: (to the large man)
dialog: Get out of line, Rodney.
text: The large man shuffles off. Chris takes his place in the line
text: again. Chris tries to calm himself. Christopher’s holding

text: his dress shirt’s ripped.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Fuck...
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER ROOM - LATER
text: The room is small and real basic. There’s a wood desk and a

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I have to go sit in the hall and

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’m just going to be right out
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Okay. I trust you.
text: Chris looks at his son; he smiles, waves, then takes the
text: scanner out to the hallway.
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY, SHELTER - LATER
text: Chris sits on the hallway floor near the open door of his
text: room. He’s using the hallway light to help him repair his

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (to the scanner)
dialog: You fucking piece of shit.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: What did you call me?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Not you. This.

text: for a while. Then he walks off.
dialog: 105.
text: Chris tries to rig the thing another way. It fails as well.
text: Then he gets up. He goes into his room. He’s gone for a
text: moment, then he comes out to the hallway again with one of

scene_heading: INT. CHRIS’S SHELTER ROOM - LATER
text: It’s pretty dark in their room. Chris sits near the window,

text: stops. He stares at the room. Before long, he starts to break
text: up. He seems to be losing it like he lost it in the apartment-
text: painting scene, but this time he can’t make any noise. His
text: feelings this time just take the form of silent, anguished
text: crying. Then Christopher, who’s apparently awake in bed
text: across the room, asks him something.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: How are you going to tie your tie?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (didn’t catch all of it)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: How are you going to tie your tie?

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’1l get it done.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’1l get it done. Go to sleep.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: No way. That’s why animals can’t
dialog: make tools. Because of no thumbs.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Go to sleep. The sooner you get to
dialog: sleep, the shorter the night’1l be.
text: Christopher doesn’t say anything else. Chris leans against

scene_heading: INT. SHELTER ROOM - MORNING

speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: Do you have a Thompson wire?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: That won’t work.

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Your wife works at Bell Western,

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: For real?
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah... because you’re using your

speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.0.)
dialog: I was able to finish this stuff
dialog: pretty quickly.

dialog: I want to read this.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: On the bus.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Just this part.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Goddamnit. Get up! Come on!
dialog: It’s hurting Chris to talk to his son this way. When
text: Christopher catches up to him, they find the bus so full
text: there’s not room for all the commuters waiting on the
text: sidewalk. Chris is shoulder to shoulder with an older lady.
text: He jockeys his arm past her to get a front position. A young

speaker_heading: GUY

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT’D)

text: Christopher smiles.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
