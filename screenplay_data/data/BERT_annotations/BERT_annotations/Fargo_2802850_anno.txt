text: FLARE TO WHITE
scene_heading: FADE IN FROM WHITE
text: Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image: white
text: particles wave over a white background. A snowfall.
text: A car bursts through the curtain of snow.
text: The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,
text: a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales

speaker_heading: HOTEL LOBBY

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: And how are you today, sir?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Real good now. I'm checking in
dialog: - Mr. Anderson.
text: The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card,

text: As she types into a computer:
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're

speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You bet.
speaker_heading: HOTEL ROOM

speaker_heading: ANDERSON

scene_heading: THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN

dialog: Shep said 8:30.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: We been sitting here an hour.
dialog: I've peed three times already.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told
dialog: me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I
dialog: guess.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: Ya got the car?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, you bet. It's in the lot
dialog: there. Brand-new burnt umber
dialog: Ciera.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.
dialog: I'm Carl Showalter and this is
dialog: my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we
dialog: all set on this thing, then?
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why
dialog: wouldn't we be?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep
dialog: vouched for you and all. I got
dialog: every confidence in you fellas.
text: They stare at him. An awkward beat.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... So I guess that's it, then.
dialog: Here's the keys -
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, that's not it, Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: The new vehicle, plus forty
dialog: thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, but the deal was, the car
dialog: first, see, then the forty
dialog: thousand, like as if it was the
dialog: ransom. I thought Shep told you -
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, okay, it's -
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Except that you were gonna be
dialog: here at 7:30.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah, you already said that.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah. But it's not a whole pay-
dialog: in-advance deal. I give you a
dialog: brand-new vehicle in advance and -
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'm not gonna sit here and debate.
dialog: I will say this though: what Shep
dialog: told us didn't make a whole lot
dialog: of sense.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh, no, it's real sound. It's
dialog: all worked out.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You want your own wife kidnapped?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah.
text: Carl Stares. Jerry looks blankly back.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... You - my point is, you pay
dialog: the ransom - what eighty thousand
dialog: bucks? - I mean, you give us
dialog: half the ransom, forty thousand,
dialog: you keep half. It's like robbing
dialog: Peter to play Paul, it doesn't
dialog: make any -
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay, it's - see, it's not me
dialog: payin' the ransom. The thing is,
dialog: my wife, she's wealthy - her dad,
dialog: he's real well off. Now, I'm in
dialog: a bit of trouble -
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What kind of trouble are you in,
dialog: Jerry?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, that's, that's, I'm not go
dialog: inta, inta - see, I just need
dialog: money. Now, her dad's real
dialog: wealthy -
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: So why don't you just ask him
dialog: for the money?
text: Grimsrud, the dour man who has not yet spoken, now softly
text: puts in with a Swedish-accented voice:
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: Or your fucking wife, you know.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, it's all just part of this -
dialog: they don't know I need it, see.
dialog: Okay, so there's that. And even
dialog: if they did, I wouldn't get it.
dialog: So there's that on top, then. See,
dialog: these're personal matters.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Personal matters.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah. Personal matters that
dialog: needn't, uh -
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us

text: - and looks up.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Okay, here goes nothing.
text: The scraping sound persists. Jean sets down her coffee cup
dialog: and rises.
dialog: From the studio audience:
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: Awoooo!
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: We track toward the back door. A curtain is stretched tight
text: across its window.
text: Jean pulls the curtain back. Bright sunlight amplified by
text: snow floods in.
text: A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.
text: Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -
text: - a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.
text: We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.
text: The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.
text: She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps
text: her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites
text: down hard.
text: He drops her wrist. As Carl enters, she races up the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: Unguent.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Huh?
text: Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: I need ... unguent.
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
text: As the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming
text: shut. A cord snakes in under the door.
scene_heading: MASTER BATHROOM
text: Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
dialog: phone.
text: The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
text: floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
text: cord ripped free.
text: With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
text: and frame, and is working it.
speaker_heading: BATHROOM
text: Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
text: open. Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
text: lightly in. Jean steps up onto the toilet.
text: The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.
text: Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
dialog: the tank.
text: The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
text: splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.
text: The door swings open.
text: Grimsrud and Carl enter.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: Room empty, window open.
text: Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out.
text: Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
text: aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.
text: He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
text: something in the mirror.
text: The shower curtain is drawn around the tub.
text: He steps toward it.
text: As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
text: by thrashing limbs.
text: Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
text: rings and stumbles out into the bedroom. Grimsrud follows.
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
text: but awkwardly trying to push it off.
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS LANDING
text: Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
text: trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
dialog: stairs.
text: Grimsrud trots down after her.
scene_heading: A PLAQUE: WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED
scene_heading: INT. WADE'S OFFICE
text: Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry
text: enters.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: How ya doin' there, Stan? How
dialog: are ya, Wade?
text: Stan Grossman shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Good to see ya again, Jerry. If
dialog: these numbers are right, this
dialog: looks pretty sweet.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh, those numbers are all right,
dialog: bleemee.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: This is do-able.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Congratulations, Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What kind of finder's fee were
dialog: you looking for?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Huh?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: The financials are pretty thorough,
dialog: so the only thing we don't know
dialog: is your fee.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... My fee? Wade, what the
dialog: heck're you talkin' about?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Stan and I're okay.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: We're good to loan in.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: But we never talked about your
dialog: fee for bringin' it to us.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, but, Wade, see, I was
dialog: bringin' you this deal for you
dialog: to loan me the money to put
dialog: in. It's my deal here, see?
text: Wade scowls, looks at Stan.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Jerry - we thought you were
dialog: bringin' us an investment.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, right -
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You're sayin' - what're you
dialog: sayin'?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You're sayin' that we put in
dialog: all the money and you collect
dialog: when it pays off?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you
dialog: back the principal, and interest
dialog: - heck, I'd go - one over prime -
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We're not a bank, Jerry.
text: Wade is angry.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted
dialog: bank interest on seven hunnert'n
dialog: fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest
dialog: Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: He's at Norstar.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: He's at -
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, see, I don't need a finder's
dialog: fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,
dialog: ten percent, heck that's not gonna
dialog: do it for me. I need the principal.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Jerry, we're not just going to
dialog: give you seven hundred and fifty
dialog: thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What the heck were you thinkin'?
dialog: Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank
dialog: interest, I'd look for complete
dialog: security. Heck, FDIC. I don't
dialog: see nothin' like that here.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd
dialog: guarantee ya your money back.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I'm not talkin' about your damn
dialog: word, Jerry. Geez, what the
dialog: heck're you?... Well, look, I
dialog: don't want to cut you out of the
dialog: loop, but his here's a good deal.
dialog: I assume, if you're not innarested,
dialog: you won't mind if we move on it
dialog: independently.
speaker_heading: PARKING LOT
text: We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
text: Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly
text: out at his sides, his breath vaporizing. He goes to his
text: car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper
text: and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
text: that has developed on his windshield.
text: The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.
text: Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the
text: windshield and the hood of his car.
text: The tantrum passes. Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing
dialog: in particular.
text: Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
dialog: windshield.
speaker_heading: FRONT DOOR
text: A beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.
text: The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,
text: holding a sack of groceries.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Hon?
text: He shuts the door.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Got the growshries...
text: He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor. He
text: frowns, pokes at it with his foot.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Hon?
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS BATHROOM
text: Jerry walks in. He sets the groceries down on the toilet
dialog: tank.
text: He looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts
text: in. He shuts it.
text: He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,
text: frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.
text: He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.
speaker_heading: FOYER
text: Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.
dialog: From another room:
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.
text: Then, slightly more agitated.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's
dialog: Jerry...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Wade, it's Jerry, I - we
dialog: gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: LIVING ROOM
text: Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a
dialog: telephone.
text: After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
dialog: a number.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.
speaker_heading: BLACK
text: Hold in black.
text: A slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
text: paper-mache figure into frame. It is a flannel-shirt
text: woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder. As
text: we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing
text: tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a
text: pedestal.
text: A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:
scene_heading: WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.
text: The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
text: background. The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: Carl drives. Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.
text: From the back seat we hear whimpering.
text: Grimsrud turns to look.
text: Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
text: tarpaulin.
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: Shut the fuck up or I'll throw
dialog: you back in the trunk, you know.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Geez. That's more'n I've heard
dialog: you say all week.
text: Grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.
text: At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
text: window. Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
text: his gumballs.
text: Carl eases the car onto the shoulder.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Ah, shit, the tags...
text: Grimsrud looks at him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... It's just the tags. I never
dialog: put my tags on the car. Don't
dialog: worry, I'll take care of this.
text: He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
text: the gravel shoulder.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... Let's keep still back there,
dialog: lady, or we're gonna have to, ya
dialog: know, to shoot ya.
text: Grimsrud stares at Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... Hey! I'll take care of this!
text: Both cars have stopped. Carl looks up at the rear-view
dialog: mirror.
text: The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,
dialog: writing in his citation book.
text: Carl watches.
text: We hear the trooper's door open.
text: The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly
text: on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night
dialog: air.
text: Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: How can I help you, officer?
text: The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.
text: Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.
dialog: Finally:
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: This is a new car, then, sir?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It certainly is, officer. Still
dialog: got that smell!
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: You're required to display
dialog: temporary tags, either in the
dialog: plate area or taped inside the
text: back window.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Certainly -
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Can I see your license and
dialog: registration please?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Certainly.
text: He reaches for his wallet.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... I was gonna tape up the
dialog: temporary tag, ya know, to be
dialog: in full compliance, but it, uh,
dialog: it, uh ... must a slipped my
dialog: mind...
text: He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-
text: dollar bill protruding from it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... So maybe the best thing
dialog: would be to take care of that,
dialog: right here in Brainerd.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: What's this, sir?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: That's my license and regis-
dialog: tration. I wanna be in
dialog: compliance.
text: He forces a laugh.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... I was just thinking I could
dialog: take care of it right here. In
dialog: Brainerd.
text: The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
text: and hands the billfold back into the car.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Put that back in your pocket,
dialog: please.
text: Carl's nervous smile fades.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: ... And step out of the car,
dialog: please, sir.
text: Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.
text: There is a whimpering sound.
text: The policeman hesitates.
dialog: Another sound.
text: The policeman leans forward into the car, listening.
text: Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair
text: and slams his head down onto the car door.
text: The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and
text: throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car.
text: With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment. He
text: brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
text: into the back of the trooper's head.
text: Jean screams.
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: Shut up.
text: He releases the policeman.
text: The policeman's head slides out the window and his body
text: flops back onto the street.
text: Carl looks out at the cop in the road.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Whoa... Whoa, Daddy.
text: Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails
text: it out the open window.
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: You'll take care of it. Boy, you
dialog: are smooth smooth, you know.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Whoa, Daddy.
text: Jean, for some reason, screams again. Then stops.
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
text: Clear him off the road.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah.
text: He gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: Carl leans down to hoist up the body.
text: Headlights appear: an oncoming car.
scene_heading: INT. CIERA
text: Grimsrud notices.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: The car approaches, slowing.
text: Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen
text: in the headlights.
text: The car accelerates and roars past and away. We just make
text: out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.
scene_heading: INT. CIERA
text: Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat. He squeals into a U-
text: turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.
text: Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead. The pursued car
text: churns up fine snow.
text: Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
text: his ashtray. We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
text: pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.
text: In the back seat, Jean starts screaming.
text: Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.
text: He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.
text: The red tail lights ahead start to turn. With a distant
text: crunching sound, they disappear.
text: The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.
text: Grimsrud frowns and slows.
text: His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled
text: around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.
text: Grimsrud brakes.
text: Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.
text: Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his
text: door and gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield
text: abutting the highway. A young man in a down parka is
text: limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.
text: Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy. He
text: raises his gun and fires.
text: With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back
text: and he pitches into the snow.
text: Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
dialog: door.
text: A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage,
dialog: injured.
text: Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.
text: Grimsrud raises his gun and fires.
scene_heading: AN OIL PAINTING
text: A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland. The
text: room in which it hangs is dark. We hear off-screen snoring.
text: We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
text: completed oil of a grey mallard.
text: The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping. The
text: man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied. His
text: mouth is agape. He snores. His arms are flung over a woman
text: in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not
text: snoring.
text: We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and
text: snoring.
text: The phone rings.
text: The woman stirs.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh, geez...
text: She reaches for the phone.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: ... Hi, it's Marge...
text: The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Oh, my. Where?... Yah...
dialog: Oh, geez...
text: The man sits up, gazes stupidly about.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Okay. There in a jif...
dialog: Real good, then.
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... You can sleep, hon. It's
dialog: early yet.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Gotta go?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah.
text: The man swings his legs out.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'll fix ya some eggs.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.
dialog: I'll fix ya some eggs.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Aw, you can sleep, hon.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
text: He clears his throat with another deep rumble.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ... I'll fix ya some eggs.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Aw, Norm.
speaker_heading: PLATE
text: Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast.
text: Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform. A
text: patch on one arm says BRAINERD POLICE DEPARTMENT. She wears
text: a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various
text: other jangling police impedimenta. Norm is in a dressing
dialog: gown.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Love ya, Margie.
text: As she struggles into a parka:
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Love ya, hon.
text: He is exiting back to the bedroom; she exits out the front
dialog: door.
scene_heading: EXT. GUNDERSON HOUSE
text: Dawn. Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to
text: her prowler.
scene_heading: INT. GUNDERSON HOUSE
text: Norm sits back onto the bed, shrugging off his robe. Off-
text: screen we hear the front door open.
speaker_heading: FRONT DOOR
text: Marge stamps the snow off her shoes.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Hon?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: (off)
dialog: Yah?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Prowler needs a jump.
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of
text: the road, a pair of men inside each car.
text: The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka
text: emerges, holding two styrofoam cups. His partner leans
text: across the seat to close the door after him.
text: The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Hiya, Lou.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Margie. Thought you might need
text: a little warm-up.
text: He hands her one of the cups of coffee.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's
dialog: the deal, now? Gary says triple
dialog: homicide?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah, looks pretty bad. Two
dialog: of'm're over here.
text: Marge looks around as they start walking.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Where is everybody?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Well - it's cold, Margie.
scene_heading: BY THE WRECK
text: Laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car, a
text: pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange
text: parka face down in the bloodstained snow, and one pair of
text: footsteps leading back to the road.
text: Marge is peering into the car.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Ah, geez. So... Aw, geez.
dialog: Here's the second one... It's
text: in the head and the ... hand
dialog: there, I guess that's a defensive
dialog: wound. Okay.
text: Marge looks up from the car.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Where's the state trooper?
text: Lou, up on the shoulder, jerks his thumb.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Back there a good piece. In
text: the ditch next to his prowler.
text: Marge looks around at the road.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Okay, so we got a state trooper
dialog: pulls someone over, we got a
dialog: shooting, and these folks drive
dialog: by, and we got a high-speed
dialog: pursuit, ends here, and this
dialog: execution-type deal.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I'd be very surprised if our
dialog: suspect was from Brainerd.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah.
text: Marge is studying the ground.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah. And I'll tell you what, from
text: his footprints he looks like a big
dialog: fella -
text: Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her
text: knees down near the snow.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Ya see something down there, Chief?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Geez, you okay, Margie?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I'm fine - it's just morning

speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Well, that passed.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: You had breakfast yet, Margie?
speaker_heading: MARGE

speaker_heading: LOU

speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Let's go take a look at that
dialog: trooper.
text: BY THE STATE TROOPER'S CAR
text: Marge's prowler is parked nearby.
text: Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch,

dialog: the road:
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: There's two of 'em, Lou!
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah, this guy's smaller than
dialog: his buddy.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Oh, yah?
text: DOWN IN THE DITCH
text: In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing
text: us. Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and
text: knees, is Marge.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: For Pete's sake.
text: She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out
dialog: of the ditch.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: How's it look, Marge?
speaker_heading: MARGE
text: Well, he's got his gun on his hip
dialog: there, and he looks like a nice

speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You haven't monkeyed with his car
dialog: there, have ya?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: No way.
text: She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Somebody shut his lights. I guess
dialog: the little guy sat in there, waitin'
dialog: for his buddy t'come back.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah, woulda been cold out here.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open

scene_heading: INT. PROWLER
text: Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You look in his citation book?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah...
text: He looks at his notebook.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: ... Last vehicle he wrote in
text: was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
dialog: Under the plate number he put
dialog: DLR - I figure they stopped him
dialog: or shot him before he could finish
dialog: fillin' out the tag number.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: So I got the state lookin' for a

dialog: They don't got no match yet.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I'm not sure I agree with you a

speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Yah?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah, I think that vehicle there

speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Oh...
text: Lou gazes out the window, thinking.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: ... Geez.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one

speaker_heading: LOU

speaker_heading: MARGE

speaker_heading: THE ROAD
text: The police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight-

scene_heading: EMBERS FAMILY RESTAURANT

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Where's Shep?
text: The mechanic points.
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Talkin' to a cop.
text: Jerry looks.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Cop?
text: Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor
text: in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle.
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Said she was a policewoman.

scene_heading: INSIDE THE CUBICLE
speaker_heading: MARGE

speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, you do reside their at

speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Anyone else residing there?
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
dialog: came in past three in the morning.
dialog: It's just hard for me to believe
dialog: you can't remember anyone calling.
text: Shep says nothing.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Now, I know you've had some
dialog: problems, struggling with the
dialog: narcotics, some other entanglements,
dialog: currently on parole -
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, associating with criminals,
dialog: if you're the one they talked to,
dialog: that right there would be a
dialog: violation of your parole and would
dialog: end with you back in Stillwater.
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Now, I saw some rough stuff on
dialog: your priors, but nothing in the
dialog: nature of a homicide...
text: Shep stares at her.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... I know you don't want to be
dialog: an accessory to something like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: SHEP
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: So you think you might remember
dialog: who those folks were who called
dialog: ya?
scene_heading: JERRY'S OFFICE
text: Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk. At a noise he

text: Marge has stuck her head in the door.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Mr. Lundegaard?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Huh? Yah?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I wonder if I could take just a
dialog: minute of your time here -
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: What... What is it all about?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Huh? Do you mind if I sit down
dialog: - I'm carrying quite a load here.
text: Marge plops into the chair opposite him.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... You're the owner here, Mr.

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, you can help me. My name's
dialog: Marge Gunderson -

speaker_heading: MARGE

text: Jerry stares at her, his mouth open.
speaker_heading: MARGE

dialog: No. No, ma'am.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll

dialog: then.
text: As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on
text: the desk in front of him.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Yah, okay.
text: He looks up at Marge's retreating back. He looks back down
text: at the papers. He looks over at the phone.
text: he picks up the phone and dials four digits.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... Yah, gimmee Shep... The
dialog: heck d'ya mean?... Well, where'd
dialog: he go? It's only... No, I don't

speaker_heading: HOTEL BAR
text: Marge enters. She looks around the bar, a rather
text: characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Marge?
text: It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising
text: from a booth halfway back. His features are broad,

speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Mike!
text: He approaches somewhat carefully, as if on his second drink.
text: They hug and head back toward the booth.
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: C'mon, brother, it's late - Unghh!
text: Shep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts
text: banging his head against the wall.
text: The hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks
text: her in the ass as she passes.
text: He spins and goes back into the apartment.
text: Carl is hopping desperately into his pants.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Stay away from me, man! Hey!
dialog: Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man!
dialog: Don't you dare fuckin' - Unghh!
text: After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out

scene_heading: CHAIN RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Oh! Oh, geez!
text: He bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him

text: walks back to pop the trunk. He wrestles Wade's body into

speaker_heading: EXIT BOOTH

scene_heading: HOLD IN BLACK
text: HARD CUT TO: BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD
text: It is a starky sunny day. We are cruising down a street of
text: humble lookalike houses.
text: We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular. In
text: its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow. He
text: notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave.
text: The driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer. He gives
text: a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
text: in the snow.
speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Mr. Mohra?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yah.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Officer Olson.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yah, right-o.
text: The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
text: without standing particularly close. They stand stiffly,
text: arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
text: parka hoods. Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head
text: drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face
text: from protruding into the cold.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ... So, I'm tendin' bar there at
dialog: Ecklund &amp;&amp; Swedlin's last Tuesday
dialog: and this little guy's drinkin'
dialog: and he says, 'So where can a guy
dialog: find some action - I'm goin' crazy
dialog: down there at the lake.' And I
dialog: says, 'What kinda action?' and he
dialog: says, 'Woman action, what do I
dialog: look like,' And I says 'Well,
dialog: what do I look like, I don't
dialog: arrange that kinda thing,' and he
dialog: says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there
dialog: at the lake' and I says, 'Well,
dialog: this ain't that kinda place.'
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: So he says, 'So I get it, so you
dialog: think I'm some kinda jerk for
dialog: askin',' only he doesn't use the
dialog: word jerk.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I unnerstand.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: And then he calls me a jerk and
dialog: says the last guy who thought he
dialog: was a jerk was dead now. So I
dialog: don't say nothin' and he says, 'What
dialog: do ya think about that?' So I
dialog: says, 'Well, that don't sound like
dialog: too good a deal for him then.'
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Ya got that right.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead
dialog: and I don't mean a old age.' And
dialog: then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'
dialog: crazy out there at the lake.'
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: White Bear Lake?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, Ecklund &amp;&amp; Swedlin's, that's
dialog: closer ta Moose Lake, so I made
dialog: that assumption.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh sure.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
dialog: don't think a whole great deal of
dialog: it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the
dialog: homicides out here and she thought
dialog: I should call it in, so I called
dialog: it in. End a story.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: What'd this guy look like anyways?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
dialog: funny-lookin'.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Uh-huh - in what way?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Just a general way.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.
dialog: Mohra. You're right, it's probably
dialog: nothin', but thanks for callin'
dialog: her in.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh sure. They say she's gonna

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Yah, got a front movin' in.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Ya got that right.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER
text: In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to
text: his mangled jaw. He is staring down at something in the
text: front seat next to him.
text: His other hand holds open the briefcase. It has money
dialog: inside - a lot of money.
text: Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
text: looks at it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... Mmmnphh.
text: He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
dialog: for the amount.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... Jeshush Shrist... Jeshush
dialog: fuchem Shrist!
text: Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
text: the back seat.
text: He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
text: pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to
text: his skin by clotted blood.
text: He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
dialog: again.
text: He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
text: remains adhering to his jaw.
speaker_heading: EXT. CAR
text: It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road. THe
text: door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.
text: He slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the
text: embankment to a barbed-wire fence. He kneels at one of the
text: fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
text: hands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.
text: He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
text: red, frozen hands.

text: He looks to the left.
text: A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
text: against unblemished white.
text: He looks at the fence post in front of him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Mmmphh...
text: He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker. Finding
text: none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to
text: scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
dialog: against the post.
text: He bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it
text: against his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.
speaker_heading: HOTEL ROOM
text: Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.
text: She is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back
dialog: up to Brainerd.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Mm. But ya think he's all right?
dialog: I saw him last night and he's -
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, it was nothin' specific
dialog: he said, it just seemd like it
dialog: all hit him really hard, his
dialog: wife dyin' -
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: His wife?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Linda.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Linda Cooksey?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: No. No. No. They weren't -
dialog: he, uh, he was bothering Linda
dialog: for about, oh, for a good year.
dialog: Really pestering her, wouldn't
dialog: leave her alone.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: So ... they didn't...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: No. No. They never married.
dialog: Mike's had psychiatric problems.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh. Oh, my.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yah, he - he's been struggling.
text: He's living with his parents now.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh. Geez.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yah, Linda's fine. You should
dialog: call her.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Geez. Well - geez. That's a
dialog: suprise.
speaker_heading: MARGE'S CAR
text: Marge drives, gazing out at the road.
scene_heading: MARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH
text: She leans out of her open window and yells at the order
dialog: panel:
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: MARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE
text: She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich.
scene_heading: JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE
text: Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers
text: onto a form. Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper
text: and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically
text: checks. The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible
dialog: entries.
text: Jerry hums nervously.
text: Glass rattles as someone taps at his door.
text: Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit
text: with worry.
text: Marge sticks her head in the door.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Mr. Lundegaard? Sorry to bother
dialog: you again. Can I come in?
text: She starts to enter.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda
dialog: busy -
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I unnerstand. I'll keep it real
dialog: short, then. I'm on my way out
dialog: of town, but I was just - Do you
dialog: mind if I sit down? I'm carrying
dialog: a bit of a load here.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, I -
text: But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a
text: sigh of relieved weight.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you
dialog: about yesterday. I was just
dialog: wondering -
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had
dialog: any vehicles go missing.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,
dialog: how do you know? Because, see,
dialog: the crime I'm investigating, the
text: perpetrators were driving a car
dialog: with dealer plates. And they
dialog: called someone who works here, so
dialog: it'd be quite a coincidence if
dialog: they weren't, ya know, connected.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Yah, I see.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: So how do you - have you done any
dialog: kind of inventory recently?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: but do you know that for sure
dialog: without -
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, I would know. I'm the
dialog: Executive Sales Manager.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah, but -
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: We run a pretty tight ship here.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I know, but - well, how do you
dialog: establish that, sir? Are the
dialog: cars, uh, counted daily or what
dialog: kind of -
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Ma'am, I answered your question.
text: There is a silent beat.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... I'm sorry, sir?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Ma'am, I answered your question.
dialog: I answered the darn - I'm
dialog: cooperating here, and I...
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sir, you have no call to get
dialog: snippy with me. I'm just doin'
dialog: my job here.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.
dialog: I'm cooperating... There's no, uh
dialog: - we're doin' all we can...
text: He trails off into silence.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?
text: Jerry stares at her.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Mr. Lundegaard?
text: Jerry explodes:
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Well, heck, if you wanna, if you
dialog: wanna play games here! I'm
dialog: workin' with ya on this thing, but
dialog: I...
text: He is getting angrily off his feet.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sir? Right now?
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Sure right now! You're darned
dialog: tootin'!
text: He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door
text: and grabbing a pair of galoshes.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: ... If it's so damned imporant
dialog: to ya!
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: I'm sorry, sir, I -
text: Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes
text: pinched in his hand.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Aw, what the Christ!
text: He stamps out the door.
text: Marge stares.
text: After a long moment her stare breaks. She glances idly
text: around the office.
text: There is a framed picture facing away from her on the
text: desktop. She turns it to face her. It is Scotty, holding
text: an accordion. There is another picture of Jean.
text: Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the
dialog: ceiling.
text: She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.
text: She fiddles idly with a pencil. She pulls a clipboard
text: toward her. It holds a form from the General Motors Finance
dialog: Corporation.
text: She looks idly around. Her look abruptly locks.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Oh, for Pete's sake.
text: Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the
dialog: building.
text: Marge's voice is flat with dismay:
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Oh, for Pete's sake...
text: She grabs the phone and punches in a number.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... For Pete's s- he's fleein' the
dialog: interview. He's feelin' the
dialog: interview...
text: Jerry makes a left turn into traffic.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Detective Sibert, please...
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
text: We are looking across a steam table at a man in blue. He
text: moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a
text: cafeteria line. Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an
text: eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of
text: uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff.
text: We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Well, so far we're just saying he's
dialog: wanted for questioning in connection
text: with a triple homicide. Nobody at
dialog: the dealship there's been much help
dialog: guessing where he might go...
text: The woman is entering frame sliding a tray. Marge enters
text: behind her, sliding her own. We move laterally with them as
text: they slowly make their way along the line.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: We called his house; his little
dialog: boy said he hadn't been there.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: And his wife?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: She's visiting relatives in Florida.
dialog: Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,
dialog: he's also disappeared. Nobody at
text: his office knows where he is.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Geez. Looks like this thing goes
dialog: higher than we thought. You call
dialog: his home?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: His wife's in the hospital, has
dialog: been for a couple months. The big C.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, my.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: And this Shep Proudfoot character,
dialog: he's a little darling. He's now
dialog: wanted for assault and parole
text: violation. He clobbered a neighbor
dialog: of his last night and another
dialog: person who could be one of your perps,
text: and he's at large.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Boy, this thing is really ... geez.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Well, they're all out on the wire.
dialog: Well, you know...
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah. Well, I just can't thank you
dialog: enough, Detective Sibert, this
dialog: cooperation has been outstanding.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: Ah, well, we haven't had to run
dialog: around like you. When're you due?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: End a April.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: Any others?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: This'll be our first. We've been
text: waiting a long time.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll
dialog: change your life, a course.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, yah, I know that!
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: They can really take over, that's
dialog: for sure.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: You have children?
text: Detective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture
text: sleeves from her purse to show Marge.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: I thought you'd never ask. The
dialog: older one is Janet, she's nine, and
text: the younger one is Morgan.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, now he's adorable.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: He's three now. Course, not in that
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, he's adorable.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: Yah, he -
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Where'd you get him that parka?
text: They have reached the end of the cafeteria line. With a nod
text: to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's
text: trays.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: Both of these.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: Oh, don't be silly.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE SIBERT
dialog: Oh, don't be silly.
speaker_heading: GAEAR GRIMSRUD
text: He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has
text: set up in front of an easy chair.
text: He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
text: might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
text: diffused by snow. The audio crackles with interference.
text: Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds
text: Grimsrud's complete attention.
text: At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.
text: Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw.
text: He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You should she zhe uzher guy!
text: He glances around.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... The fuck happen a her?
text: Jean sits slumped in a straight-backed chair facing the
text: wall. Her hooded head, resting on her chin, is motionless.
text: There is blood on the facing wall.
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: She started shrieking, you know.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Jezhush.
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... Well, I gotta muddy.
text: He is plunking down eight bank-wrapped bundles on the table.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... All of it. All eighty gran.
dialog: Forty for you...
text: He makes one pile, pockets the rest.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... Forty for me. Sho thishuzh
dialog: it. Adiosh.
text: He slaps keys down on the table.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... You c'n'ave my truck. I'm
dialog: takin' a Shiera.
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: We split that.
text: Carl looks at him.
speaker_heading: CARL
text: HOW THE FUCK DO WE SHPLITTA FUCKIN'
dialog: CAR? Ya dummy! Widda fuckin'
dialog: chainshaw?
text: Grimsrud looks sourly up. There is a beat. Finally:
speaker_heading: GRIMSRUD
dialog: One of us pays the other for half.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU
dialog: FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN'

text: Carl waits for an argument, but only gets the steady sour

text: Carl pulls out a gun.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... YOU FUCKIN' ASH-HOLE! I
text: LISHEN A YOUR BULLSHIT FOR A WHOLE
dialog: FUCKIN' WEEK!
text: A beat. Carl returns Grimsrud's stare.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... Are we shquare?
text: Grimsrud says nothing.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... ARE WE SHQUARE?
text: A beat.
text: Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: ... Fuckin' ash-hole. And if
dialog: you shee your friend Shep Proudpfut,
dialog: tell him I'm gonna NAIL hizh
dialog: fuckin' ash.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car. Behind him
text: we see the cabin door opening. Carl turns, reacting to the
dialog: sound.
text: Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's
text: cap, but no overcoat. He is holding an ax.
text: Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun.
text: Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the ax in Carl's neck.
speaker_heading: MARGE
text: In her cruiser, on her two-way. Through it we hear Lou's
text: voice, heavily filtered:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: His wife. This guy says she was
dialog: kidnapped last Wednesday.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: The day of our homicides.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yah.
text: Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through
text: the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs
text: down to a large frozen lake.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: And this guy is...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Lundegaard's father-in-law's
dialog: accountant.
speaker_heading: MARGE
text: Gustafson's accountant.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yah.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: But we still haven't found Gustafson.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (crackle)
dialog: - looking.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Sorry - didn't copy.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Still missing. We're looking.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Copy. And Lundegaard too.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
text: We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as
text: of a chainsaw or lawnmower.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving
text: around Moose Lake.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole
dialog: state has it, Lundegaard and
dialog: Gustafson?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yah, it's over the wire, it's
dialog: everywhere, they'll find 'em.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Copy.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: We've got a -
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: There's the car! There's the car!
text: We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down
text: to a cabin. Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Whose car?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
text: Marge is straining to look. The power-tool noise is louder
text: here but still muffled, its source not yet visible.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ... Chief Gunderson?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich
dialog: and he takes February off to go to
dialog: Boundary Waters.
speaker_heading: ROAD EXTERIOR
text: Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
text: She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
text: lined hood.
text: For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
text: the power tool. Then, with one curved arm half pressing
text: against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
text: steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
text: trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
text: grinding noise.
text: She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
text: downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
dialog: next.
text: The roar grows louder. Marge stands panting by one tree,
text: her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood. She squints
text: down toward the cabin's back lot.
text: A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
text: jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
text: large power tool which his body blocks from view.
text: Marge advances.
text: The man is forcing downward something which engages the
text: roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.
text: The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
text: cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears. His breath steams
text: as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
text: shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.
text: The roar is very loud.
text: Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.
text: Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
text: can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.
text: Marge's eyes shift.
text: A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.
text: Grimsrud works on, eyes watering. With a grunt he bends
text: down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
text: He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.
text: Marge is advancing. She holds a gun extended toward
text: Grimsrud, who is still turned away.
text: Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.
text: Marge closes in, grimacing.
text: Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
text: that pushes down into the machine.
text: The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
text: Carl Showalter's body.
text: Marge has drawn to within twenty yards. When she bellows it
text: sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
text: roar of the power tool.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Stop! Police! Turn around and
dialog: hands up!
text: Startled, Grimsrud scowls. He turns to face her.
text: He stares.
text: Marge bellows again:
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Hands up!
text: Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her
text: shoulder the armpatch insignia.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Police!
text: Grimsrud stares.
text: With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
text: Marge and then starts running away.
text: Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.
text: No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
text: in the snow several feet short of her.
text: Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
dialog: snow.
text: Behind him:
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Halt!
text: She fires in the air.
text: She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Halt!
text: She fires.
text: Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.
text: Marge sights again.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Halt!
text: She fires again.
text: Grimsrud pitches forward. He mutters in Swedish as he
text: reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.
text: Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
text: reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.
text: It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
text: a snap of the wrist.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... All right, buddy. On your
dialog: belly and your hands clasped
dialog: behind you.
speaker_heading: THE CRUISER
text: Marge drives. Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed
text: behind him.
text: For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and
text: the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
text: grimly shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
dialog: in there?
text: She glances up in the rear-view mirror.
text: Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the
dialog: road.
text: Marge shakes her head.
dialog: At length:
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... I guess that was your
text: accomplice in the wood chipper.
text: Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is
text: motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... And those three people in
dialog: Brainerd.
dialog: No response.
text: Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... And for what? For a little
dialog: bit of money.
text: We hear distant sirens.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... There's more to life than money,
dialog: you know.
text: She glances up in the rear-view mirror.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Don't you know that?... And
dialog: here ya are, and it's a beautiful
dialog: day...
text: Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.
text: The sirens are getting louder. Marge pulls over.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... Well...
text: She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling
text: WHOOPS on her siren.
text: She turns on her flashers.
text: She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.
text: She stares forward, shakes her head. We hear the dull click
text: of her flashers.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... I just don't unnerstand it.
text: Outside it is snowing. The sky, the earth, the road - all
dialog: white.
text: A squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.
text: It approaches in slow motion.
text: An ambulance punches through after it.
text: Another squad car.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL
text: It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.
text: One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
text: police cruiser.
scene_heading: MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY
text: We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
text: who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting
text: lightly on their holstered sidearms. One of them raps at
text: the door.
speaker_heading: COP ONE
dialog: Mr. Anderson...
text: A title fades in: OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA
text: After a pause, muffled through the door:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ... Who?...
speaker_heading: COP ONE
dialog: Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy
dialog: 88 out here?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ... Just a sec.
speaker_heading: COP ONE
dialog: Could you open the door, please?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ... Yah. Yah, just a sec.
text: We hear a clatter from inside.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ... Just a sec...
text: One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
text: whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.
text: This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.
text: The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel
dialog: room.
text: The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
text: men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.
text: The room is empty.
text: Cop one indicates the open bathroom door.
speaker_heading: COP ONE
dialog: Dale!
text: The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the
text: ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.
text: A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.
text: The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and
text: drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.
text: His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,
text: piercing screams.
text: The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
text: continues. The policemen struggle to restrain him.
speaker_heading: COP ONE
dialog: Call an ambulance!
speaker_heading: COP TWO
dialog: You got him okay?
text: Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
text: into uncontrolled sobbing.
speaker_heading: COP ONE
dialog: Yah, yah, call an ambulance.
text: Jerry sobs and screams.
speaker_heading: A BEDROOM
text: We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.
text: After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and
text: climbs into bed, with some effort.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oooph!
text: Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.
text: At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: They announced it.
text: Marge looks at him.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: They announced it?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Yah.
text: Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay
text: fixed on the television.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: ... So?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Three-cent stamp.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Your mallard?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Yah.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Norm, that's terrific!
text: Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: It's just the three cent.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: It's terrific!
speaker_heading: NORM
text: Hautman's blue-winged teal got the
dialog: twenty-nine cent. People don't
dialog: much use the three-cent.
speaker_heading: MARGE
dialog: Oh, for Pete's - a course they do!
