scene_heading: INT. THE CHASEN'S DEN - DAY
text: The CAMERA is at floor level. A young man enters but we
text: see only his shoes and the cuffs of his pants. We TRACK
text: with him as he walks across the room and stops at a record
text: player. Pause. We HEAR a record drop and begin playing
text: a light classical melody. The SUPERIMPOSED TITLES BEGIN.
text: After a moment the feet move off and we TRACK with them,
text: past a low table, and around a couch to the window curtains.
text: The feet pause there for a moment. A piece of heavy
text: window cord drops INTO FRAME. We FOLLOW as it is dragged
text: along to the low table. Then the feet move over to a large
text: ornate desk. The cord is pulled up OUT OF FRAME. Pause.
text: The feet walk over to a chair by the wall. It is picked
text: up, carried to the center of the room, and carefully
text: placed. Pause. The feet get up onto the chair and the
text: CAMERA RISES to their level. They shuffle about for a
text: moment. At an appropriate musical break the CREDITS STOP.
text: Suddenly the feet knock over the chair and drop into
text: space. They kick about for a bit, then go slack and still.
text: The FINAL CREDITS are SUPERED OVER the suspended appendages
text: while the music comes to a lilting conclusion. As we HEAR
text: the record player turn itself off, the CAMERA BEGINS a
text: half circle tour around the hanging feet and stops at the
text: heels. Pause. Outside we HEAR a woman's footsteps
text: approaching and we change focus as the door to the den
text: opens. Through the blurred hanging feet we see a tall,
text: middle-aged, fashionably dressed woman enter and we PAN
text: with her as she walks to the desk. This is MRS. CHASEN.
text: She seems rather tired and preoccupied as she begins to
text: remove her long white gloves. Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS a
text: vertical rise up the side of the hanging corpse until we
text: are watching Mrs. Chasen over his left shoulder. The rope
text: and his stretched neck frame the right side of the SCREEN.
text: We hold. Mrs. Chasen puts down her gloves and looks up.
text: (NOTE: THE ABOVE IS ALL ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT.)

text: hanging body.
scene_heading: MRS. CHASEN
dialog: I suppose you think this is very
dialog: funny, Harold.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP HAROLD
text: The rope chokes his throat; his eyes bulge; his tongue

scene_heading: MED. SHOT - MRS. CHASEN
text: Her party answers and she speaks into the phone.
scene_heading: MRS. CHASEN
dialog: Hello. Fay, darling. Be a dear
dialog: and cancel my appointment with

dialog: he'll be furious, but I've had

dialog: guests coming this evening...
dialog: Would you? Oh, that's sweet.
dialog: Tell him I promise to be in

dialog: you, Fay. You're a darling. Yes.
dialog: Yes. Bye.
text: She replaces the receiver, stands up, takes her purse and

scene_heading: MRS. CHASEN
dialog: Dinner at eight, Harold...
text: At the door she stops and turns.

dialog: I was so shook I needed three

text: Everyone laughs. The CAMERA BEGINS PULLING BACK and
text: PANNING past the guests till we come to Harold sitting
text: morosely at the other end of the table. He listlessly toys
text: with his food as his mother continues.
scene_heading: MRS. CHASEN
dialog: Of course, Harold's father had a
dialog: similar sense of the absurd. I
dialog: remember once in Paris he stepped
dialog: out for cigarettes and the next I
dialog: hear he's arrested for floating
dialog: nude down the Seine - experimenting
text: in river currents with a pair of
text: yellow rubber water wings. Well,
dialog: that cost quite a little bit of
dialog: "enfluence" and "d'argent" to

dialog: dear, stop playing with your food.
dialog: Don't you feel well?
speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: I have a sore throat.
scene_heading: MRS. CHASEN
dialog: Well, I want you to go to bed
dialog: directly after dinner. You know

scene_heading: INT. MRS. CHASEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Mrs. Chasen sitting before her vanity table, humming to
text: herself as she readies herself for bed. She wears a night-—
text: gown, a cover for her hair, and she has just finished
text: putting on several different face creams. She gets up,
text: walks over to the bathroom, and opens the door. Blood is
text: everywhere -- on the walls, the floor, the mirror - and in
text: the tub is Harold, his throat slit and his wrists dripping
text: blood onto the razor on the tile floor. The effect is one
text: of instant shock. Mrs. Chasen screams and backs up in
text: horror. Sobbing hysterically, she clutches her robe about
text: her and rushes from the room crying.
scene_heading: MRS. CHASEN
dialog: Oh! No! Oh! No! I can't stand
dialog: it. My God! This is too much.
dialog: This is too much to bear!

dialog: behavior.
scene_heading: MRS. CHASEN
dialog: Yes, dear. Here is Harold now.
text: Harold enters from the side door.
scene_heading: MRS. CHASEN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Candy, this is Harold.

scene_heading: INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT — DAY
text: The front door opens slowly and Harold enters.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maude. Maude. Anybody home?
text: He gets no answer and steps into the room. He looks over
text: the fireplace, where a furled umbrella is hung up like a
text: rifle. Nearby he sees a glass cabinet full of sea shells
text: and glass work. He walks over to a large table and is
text: puzzled by the odd-shaped, machine-like boxes on top. He
text: looks over at the wood sculpture, a highly polished work
text: with very smooth curves and holes. Instinctively he puts
text: out his hand to touch it, but decides he shouldn't. He
text: walks over to the piano and examines the silver frames
text: standing on it. They have no photographs in them and this
text: interests him. He goes to the window. Over his shoulder
text: we see MADAME AROUET hoeing in her vegetable patch.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BACK YARD - DAY
text: A MEDIUM SHOT of Madame Arouet. She is dressed in the
text: black peasant's dress of Southern France. She is thin and
text: wrinkled and wears a large straw sun hat. She is con-
text: tinually working. Harold comes up to her.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Excuse me, have you seen Maude?

text: He goes off toward the building. Madame Arouet continues
dialog: hoeing.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MADAME AROUET
text: She looks up from her work and watches Harold. There is a
text: strange sadness in her old weathered face - time lost,
text: pleasures past over, the resignation to a lifetime of work.
text: She turns back to her garden.
scene_heading: INT. GLAUCUS'S STUDIO - DAY
text: Harold comes through the door, sees where he is at, and
text: becomes embarrassed.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh. Excuse me.
scene_heading: HAROLD'S POV - AN ARTIST'S STUDIO
text: The first thing we notice is the large block of ice in the
text: center of the room - seven to eight feet tall - and
text: through it, as if looking through the glass on a shower
text: door, we can see a naked female body posing as Venus. The
text: sculptor, GLAUCUS, a frail, little, white-haired old man,
text: dressed in winter clothing, turns from the ice with a
text: chisel and hammer in his gloved hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLAUCUS
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm sorry. I was looking for

speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: How about some ginger pie?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Eh, fine.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: I'll heat some up. My, it's nice
dialog: to see you again, Harold. How's
dialog: your hearse?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh, it's fine. Fine.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: She seemed yare to me.
text: Maude lays out the table. Harold gets up. He has some-
text: thing on his mind.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (nonchalantly)
dialog: Do you often model for Glaucus?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Heavens no! I don't have the time.
dialog: But I like to keep in practice
dialog: and poor Glaucus occasionally needs
text: his memory refreshed as to the
text: contours of the female form.
dialog: (she stops)
dialog: Do you disapprove?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Me! No. Of course not.
speaker_heading: MAUDE

dialog: (he smiles)
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Oh, I'm so happy you said that
dialog: because I wanted to show you my
dialog: paintings. This is the "Rape of
dialog: Rome" and, of course, there in
dialog: the corner is quite a graphic
text: depiction of Leda and the Swan.
text: Harold looks at the corner of the painting and then back at
dialog: Maude.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: (coquettishly)
text: A self-portrait.
dialog: (she walks on)
dialog: But over here is my favorite. It's
dialog: titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath
dialog: and an Elephant." Do you like it?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes. Very much.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: It was my last. I then became
dialog: infatuated with these -- my
dialog: "Odorifics."
text: She points to the odd-shaped boxes with the tubes and
text: handles attached to them.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Give the nose a treat, I thought.
dialog: Have a kind of olfactory banquet!
dialog: So I began first on the easiest -
text: roast beef, old books, mown grass,
dialog: then I went on to these -
dialog: (she reads the
dialog: labels on the
dialog: boxes)
dialog: "An Evening at Maxim's." "Mexican
dialog: Farmyard." Here's one you'd like.
dialog: "Snowfall on 42nd Street." Put
dialog: it on.
text: She helps him put on the oxygen-type mask.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now I'll pump it up...
dialog: (she does so)
dialog: and you just turn the handles.

dialog: Snow!
speaker_heading: MAUDE
text: It goes on and on.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That's really great.
text: He takes it off.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Thank you. I thought of continuing
dialog: - graduating to the abstract and
dialog: free-smelling - but then I decided
dialog: to switch to the tactile.
dialog: 
text: She gestures at the wood sculpture.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh. Eh, I like it.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: No, you have to touch it.
dialog: (she demonstrates)
dialog: You have to run your hands over it,
dialog: get close to it, really reach
dialog: out and feel. You try it.
text: Harold tries. He gingerly moves his hand over a rather
text: sensuous curve.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: That's right. How's the sensation?
text: A low RISING WHISTLE is heard.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Oh, that's the kettle.
dialog: (she goes to
dialog: kitchen)
dialog: Go ahead, Harold. Stroke, palm,
dialog: caress, explore.
dialog: 
text: Harold watches Maude leave the room. He hears her invita-
text: tion and looks at the sculpture. A battle is going on
text: inside him. ("Go ahead touch it! - Better not!") Maude
text: begins humming in the kitchen. She won't be out for a while.
text: Harold begins moving his hand over the polished wood. His
scene_heading: haroldandmaudehomepage.com/xhigginnsscreenplay txt
scene_heading: 3/6/12 haroldandmaudehomepage.com/xhigginnsscreenplay.txt
text: face is expressionless, but he moves his body closer and
text: his hand becomes more daring. He brings his other hand
text: onto the sculpture. He is enjoying
text: looks at the large hole before him.
dialog: 
dialog: e sensations. He
text: is hand moves around
text: it. ("Go ahead - Better not!") His eyes scan the room.
text: Suddenly he sticks his head in the hole,
dialog: pulls it out,
text: steps back quickly, and looks over to the kitchen. Maude
text: is still out there humming. Harold relaxes, straightens
text: his suit, looks at the sculpture, and braves a short smile.
text: Maude enters with the tea.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Here we are, Harold. Oat straw
text: tea and ginger pie.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Certainly a new experience for me
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Wonderful! Try something new each

text: to find it out. It doesn't last

text: They sit down at the table.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You look as if you could.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be
dialog: eighty on Saturday?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You don't look eighty.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: That's the influence of the right

dialog: breathing.
dialog: (she gestures)
dialog: Greet the dawn with the Breath of
dialog: Fire!
dialog: (the demonstration
dialog: leaves her a
dialog: little winded)
dialog: Of course, there's no doubt the
dialog: body is giving out. I'm well into
dialog: autumn. I'll have to be giving

scene_heading: 68 EXT. DEMOLITIONS - DAY
text: Shots of falling buildings. The giant demolition ball

scene_heading: 73 EXT. FLOWER FARM - DAY
text: SHOTS of flowers growing, all different varieties, in

dialog: fields.
text: Maude and Harold are walking down a row of flowers.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
text: They grow and bloom, and fade, and
dialog: die, and some change into something
dialog: else. Ah, life!
text: They stop by some flowers.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: I should like to change into a

speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: See - some are smaller, some are
text: fatter, some grow to the left,
dialog: some to the right, some even have
dialog: some petals missing - all kinds
dialog: of observable differences, and we
dialog: haven't even touched the bio-
dialog: chemical. You see, Harold, they're
dialog: like the Japanese. At first you
dialog: think they all look alike, but
dialog: after you get to know them you see
dialog: there is not a repeat in the bunch.
dialog: Each person is different, never
dialog: existed before and never to exist
dialog: again. Just like this daisy -
dialog: (she picks it)
dialog: - an individual.
text: They stand up.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well, we may be individuals all
dialog: right but -
dialog: (he looks out
dialog: at the field)
dialog: - we have to grow up together.
text: Maude looks up. She is very struck by what Harold said.
text: She speaks very softly and we see she has tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Yes, that's very true. Still I
dialog: believe much of the world's
dialog: sorrow comes from people who know
dialog: they are this -

dialog: A long time ago.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What were you fighting for?
speaker_heading: MAUDE
dialog: Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights.
dialog: Justice. Kings died and kingdoms
dialog: fell. I don't regret the kingdoms
dialog: - what sense in borders and nations
dialog: and patriotism - but I do miss the
dialog: kings. When I was a little girl
dialog: I was taken to the palace in

dialog: on the development of my instrument.

speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: An ancient Japanese ceremony.
speaker_heading: SUNSHINE
dialog: Like a tea ceremony?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. Like this.

speaker_heading: SUNSHINE
dialog: Oh, that was marvelous, Harold.
dialog: It had the ring of truth.
dialog: Harold... Who did you study with?
dialog: . Oh, I'm sorry. I don't want

dialog: The two best wars this country has

text: and most of the blows fall on him. Much ad-libbing.
text: Despite only having one arm the General manages to
text: pull the sign away from Harold and throw it over the
text: dam. It is quickly churned up by the treacherous
text: water. Harold is holding Maude's umbrella. Maude is
text: gamely trying to hold on to it and at the same time keep

text: The General finally wrenches it free. A pause. Harold
text: looks at Maude's position, standing next to the General.
