speaker_heading: MARC GUGGENHEIM
dialog: First Draft
dialog: June 9, 2008
dialog: 
dialog: We begin...
text: IN GREEN. Vibrant, verdant. The longest, fastest continuous
text: pullback ever begins. A steady VOICE accompanies us:
speaker_heading: A MALE VOICE
dialog: We are not alone in the universe.
text: Still pulling back to reveal... an emerald LANTERN, sky-
text: scraper tall and breathtaking. THE CENTRAL BATTERY. Then
text: the breathtaking liquid spires and towers of OA whip past...
speaker_heading: A MALE VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: For years now, we’ve known of a group of
dialog: extraterrestrials who patrol our universe
dialog: and keep it safe.
text: Break orbit to reveal... HUNDREDS OF GREEN LANTERNS. Aliens
text: in a universe’s worth of variety, each wielding POWER RINGS.
speaker_heading: A MALE VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: We don’t know where they come from. Or
dialog: where they get their power. But we know
dialog: this much... they’re good.
text: They spar, mastering ASSORTED WEAPONS of GREEN LIGHT. Fluid.
text: Beautiful. A sci-fi martial art.
speaker_heading: A MALE VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: And they protect us. Just as they
dialog: protect all life in the universe.
text: And we're off! Suddenly flying through space. Hyper-speed.
text: Zipping past planets, slaloming around suns and moons.
speaker_heading: A MALE VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Impossible to imagine? No more
dialog: impossible than when Columbus suggested
dialog: the Earth was round or when Copernicus
dialog: posited that it orbited the Sun.
text: Then a familiar planet: Neptune, Then Uranus. Saturn.
text: Jupiter. All raging past us until we arrive at...
speaker_heading: A MALE VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: There are heroes out there.
text: EARTH. Tumbling down into the atmosphere... before landing:
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEW YORK - DAY
text: It’s FULL. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE stand in SHOCK and SILENCE,
text: staring up at the trademark GIANT ASTROVISION TV SCREEN.
speaker_heading: A MALE VOICE
dialog: And now, one of our own has joined them.
dialog: Taking up arms against the forces of
dialog: evil. Here... and everywhere.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: ON THE SCREEN: A weathered, GREYING MAN (60’s) whom we’1l
text: come to know as PIPE. He’s at the end of a press conference,
dialog: three seconds from changing the world:
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE / PIPE (ON SCREEN)
dialog: One of us. Now one of them.
dialog: (then)
dialog: A Green Lantern.
text: SMASH TO BLACK.
scene_heading: A LEGEND APPEARS: FIFTEEN YEARS AGO
speaker_heading: HAL (V.O.)
dialog: Jim says there’s gonna be thousands of
dialog: people here today.
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: It's an air show. Not the Superbowl.
text: The blackness parts, revealing DAYLIGHT. We're in:
scene_heading: INT. AN AIRPLANE HANGAR - A PERFECT MORNING ON EARTH
text: Two massive doors split, pushed by MARTIN JORDAN and his son
dialog: HAL (12). We’re immediately jealous of their connection.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Does it completely freak you out? All
dialog: those people coming to watch you fly?
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN
dialog: Naah. It’s not me they’re coming to see.
dialog: It’s this...
text: The FLUORESCENTS FLICKER on, revealing a fourth generation-
text: style JET, the RAMJET. Hal races toward it.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Sweet. When can I take her up?
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN
dialog: When you’re big enough to get in the
dialog: cockpit without my help.
speaker_heading: HAL
text: Mr. Ferris lets me use the simulator.
dialog: I’m getting pretty killer.
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN
dialog: Carol lets you use the sim. If her pop
dialog: knew he'd kill you both.
text: Martin lifts Hal up onto the wing.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Does it bother you that Mom doesn’t come
dialog: watch you fly?
dialog: 
dialog: |
dialog: |
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN
dialog: It’s not me flying planes she has a
dialog: problem with. It’s me testing them.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: So... why do you?
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN
dialog: Someone’s gotta be first, Hal.
text: The concern in Hal’s look draws Martin closer to his son.
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Someday, if your brothers let you live
dialog: long enough, you're gonna be an adult.
dialog: And you’re gonna make a million choices.
dialog: Like where to live. What kinda car to
dialog: drive. Who your friends are. But every
dialog: now and then, if you’re really lucky,
dialog: something chooses you. When that
dialog: happens, there’s no fighting it. Your
dialog: mother might not agree with what I do,
dialog: but she understands that much.
text: Martin watches the concept sink in with Hal. Then:
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (CONT'D)
dialog: So... Wanna checkout the cockpit?
dialog: (Hal leaps up)
dialog: Wait. You’re gonna need this.
text: Martin strips off his bomber jacket, places it on Hal. The
text: call sign “SABRE” on the chest. As Hal gets in:
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You think Mom will understand if I’m
dialog: chosen to be a Samurai?
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN
dialog: She’s handled worse.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS FIELD - A GORGEOUS DAY
text: WE'RE SOARING over open fields, CARS lined up eight rows
text: deep. LOCALS sit on hoods and roofs. A BANNER shouts: “THE
scene_heading: FERRIS AIR SPECTACULAR - A 5-YEAR TRADITION!!!”
text: A DEAFENING CHEER erupts as the RAMJET BUZZES the field.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL TOWER - SAME TIME
text: Hal (still in the bomber jacket) turns from the glass --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: That must’ve been Mach-Two!
text: CAROL FERRIS (12), a few years and orthodontist visits away
text: from growing into her looks, steps beside him. She does her
text: best to hide a blossoming crush.
dialog: |
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Mach-Three. When’re you gonna learn how
dialog: to read a sonic boom?
dialog: (then, notices)
dialog: Nice jacket. Does it come any bigger?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Nice braces. Do they come any brighter?
text: Hal crosses to a BOTTLE of chilled DOM.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Ferris, can I crack her open?
text: Amidst a half-DOZEN ADULTS stands an imposing CARL FERRIS
text: (40's). He dons a rare smile. Into his headset:
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: Tower to Sabre. Your son wants to know
dialog: if you’re done showing off and we can get
dialog: this party started.
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (OVER RADIO)
dialog: Roger that, Tower. Tell my son I said
dialog: two fingers worth for him and that’s it.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: (to Hal
dialog: You heard him, Hal. Knock it out.
text: Hal’s about to do that when... BOOM! And not the sonic kind.
text: AN_EXPLOSION. Hal races to the window. The RAMJET SPIRALS
text: through the air, leaving a CORKSCREW of BLACK SMOKE.
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (OVER RADIO)
dialog: Tower, I got a flameout in the starboard
text: engine. Over.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
text: She can’t fly on one engine. Eject.
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (OVER RADIO)
dialog: Can’t do it, Tower. The jet’ll go
text: straight into the crowd.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: Sabre, get outta that plane! Now!
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (OVER RADIO)
dialog: I’m pushing her to the runway first!
text: Carol turns to Hal, but Hal is half-way out the room. We
text: FOLLOW HAL DOWN THE STAIRS, bounding two at a time.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS (V.0.)
dialog: It’s too far away, Martin!
scene_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (V.0.) CARL FERRIS (V.0.)
dialog: I can do it! Sabre, I said EJECT!
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (V.O.) CARL FERRIS (V.0O.)
dialog: I’m clear. Ejecting now -- Sabre, I’m ordering you to
dialog: eject now!
text: An EARTH SHATTERING CRASH as Hal flies out of the building.
text: Carol is right after him, watching Hal frantically search the
text: PLUME of BLACK SMOKE in the distance.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Where is it? Where’s his ‘chute?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hal...
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Where’s his ‘chute?!
text: Carol looks at him, heartbroken. GO SLOW MO as Hal, losing
text: it, tries to run toward the crash site but an OLDER BOY
text: (JIM), grabs hold of him.
text: We gaze down at the DEVASTATION. Amongst the flames and
text: metal, the SHATTERED COCKPIT tells us everything we need to
text: know. We FOLLOW the rush of SMOKE into the blue sky. HIGHER
text: and FASTER. MUSIC BUILDS. Then the pitch black of:
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTELLAR SPACE
scene_heading: A LEGEND APPEARS: SPACE, SECTOR 2814
scene_heading: IT FADES. THEN ANOTHER: TODAY
text: A SHIP SHRIEKS BY -- a small, otherworldly SPACECRAFT.
scene_heading: INT. ABIN SUR’S SPACECRAFT
text: A complex NAVIGATION DISPLAY. Operating it is the craft’s
text: pilot: ABIN SUR. Noble features. Magenta skin. Abin’s
text: RING FLICKERS and a HOLOGRAM in GREEN LIGHT appears. It’s a
text: prissy fin-headed fishman, TOMAR-RE. VIA RING:
speaker_heading: TOMAR-RE
dialog: You could have been there and back by now
dialog: if you’d gone by ring.
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR
dialog: Markot deserves the proper return home.
dialog: It is not often a Lantern falls.
text: In a corner, a METALLIC COFFIN.
speaker_heading: TOMAR-RE
dialog: What will you tell them about how he was
dialog: lost?
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR
dialog: All that we know. He was overpowered in
dialog: the service of protecting his sector.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMAR-RE
dialog: And that three Lanterns were slaughtered
dialog: before him --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR
dialog: There’s no cause to spread fear.
text: A BUMP makes his ship LURCH -- the nav system GOES OUT.
speaker_heading: TOMAR-RE
dialog: If you insist on traveling by ship, Abin,
dialog: at least learn to operate one.
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR
dialog: We've been friends a long time, Tomar-Re.
dialog: Perhaps one day I’1l understand why.
text: The hologram shuts off. Abin’s RING PULSES. He is instantly
text: enveloped in a BRILLIANT GREEN AURA.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - MINUTES LATER
text: Abin, protected by that aura, FLOATS OUTSIDE his ship. He
text: takes a moment to appreciate the view... a ballet of 63
text: MOONS, rotating around... SATURN. Small universe.
text: Abin surveys his ship’s hull. He floats toward a BROKEN
text: DISH. As he does, a FLASH BEHIND HIM -- a GOLD BLUR. Abin
dialog: doesn’t see it. But we do.
text: Abin’s Ring creates TOOLS to fix the dish (the Ring just gets
text: cooler and cooler). The FLASH BEHIND HIM comes round again.
text: This time Abin sees its GOLD LIGHT. He turns to see --
text: A MASSIVE CREATURE blocking out the Sun. The size of a WHALE
text: with tentacles of an OCTOPUS and a SHARK’S KILLER GRIN. This
dialog: is LEGION. And we fear it.
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR
dialog: (holy fuckshit)
dialog: Great Krona --
text: Abin FIRES A FULL FORCE RINGBLAST AT LEGION! Everything his
text: ring has, deployed in one massive, magnificent pulse.
dialog: But nothing happens! His ring didn’t work on Legion -- which
text: fires forth A SERIES OF GOLD BLASTS. Abin’s ring calls up a
text: GREEN SHIELD deflecting the incoming fire. Barely.
text: Legion’s tentacles LASH OUT, grabbing Abin and curling him up
text: to the YELLOW FANGS of its DRIPPING MAW.
text: Abin summons a huge GREEN HAND, grabs a passing ASTEROID and
text: sends it RAMMING -- SMASH -- INTO LEGION. Legion drops Abin,
dialog: buying him enough time to climb back into --
scene_heading: INT. ABIN SUR’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
text: Abin slams down the controls so that the ship’s GUNS FIRE
scene_heading: SIMULTANEOUSLY AT LEGION!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
text: The force sends Legion flying back -- and propels Abin’s ship
text: ahead... BURSTING THROUGH ONE OF SATURN’S RINGS! Legion is
text: lost in the distance.
text: Abin looks to a GAPING WOUND in his side. A PURPLISH STAIN
text: colors his uniform, Struggling for consciousness, Abin’s
text: Ring generates a beam of light.
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR
dialog: This is Abin Sur, chosen protector of
dialog: Sector 2814. I have seen what hunts
dialog: us... Legion... it lives. The Ring holds
dialog: no effect, no defense -- You must take
dialog: action. Legion is real.
dialog: (a raspy gasp, then)
dialog: I have escaped... but not with my life.
dialog: I shall proceed to the nearest sentient
dialog: planet for selection.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE - OUTSIDE THE SHIP
text: REVEAL what he’s aiming for: Some 820 million miles away...
text: . Our comforting, familiar blue home. As Abin’s ship
text: straightens to find its course we DISSOLVE TO...
text: ANOTHER SPACESHIP? No, it just looks like a spaceship. It’s
text: actually the SABRE JET, the latest brainchild of Carl Ferris.
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.O.)
dialog: Pilots are obsolete.
text: We're watching the Sabre as it’s put through its paces on a
text: VIDEO playing on ALL FIVE FLATSCREEN DISPLAYS in:
scene_heading: INT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - DESIGN SHOWROOM - DAY
text: Smart and modern. Models of the SABRE in various design
text: stages. CAROL FERRIS, braces long gone and replaced with an
text: MBA, mesmerizes A FEW SUITS and TWO GENERALS.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I know conventional wisdom says planes
dialog: can’t think like people. And I know
dialog: conventional wisdom says U-CAVs aren’t
dialog: ready for mass deployment. That the tech
dialog: isn’t there yet.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Conventional wisdom is for followers.
dialog: Ferris Air is about to make all aerial
text: combat missions unmanned. Today.
text: The SUITS look intrigued -- except for one, who speaks with
text: the confidence of a former astronaut, current SENATOR.
speaker_heading: SENATOR
dialog: And what do you expect all those pilots
dialog: we spent thirteen billion taxpayer
dialog: dollars training to do?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: If our skies are safer and their lives
dialog: protected... I expect them to thank me.
speaker_heading: SENATOR
dialog: Then you don’t know pilots, Ms. Ferris.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Enough to know pilots like you are few
dialog: and far between, Senator. Most aren’t
text: four-star NASA icons. Most pilots are
dialog: far more human than that. There are
text: pilots who are cocky... Pilots who are
dialog: irresponsible...
text: CLOSE ON: A WELL-WORN BOMBER JACKET on a floor. If it looks
text: familiar it should. It’s the one Hal’s father gave him.
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.0O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And pilots who are both.
scene_heading: INT. OCEAN VIEW APARTMENT - COAST CITY - THAT MOMENT
text: PAN to the bed and UP the INTERTWINED LEGS of JENNA, a yoga-
text: toned hottie, and... HAL JORDAN. 15 years older and not all
dialog: that much more mature.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Now I remember why yoga’s my second
dialog: favorite thing in life.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Yeah? What’s the first?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Yoga instructors. It’s a photo finish
dialog: with flying.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: (they kiss, then)
dialog: . And what was that little maneuver
dialog: called again?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: A Split-S. Also known as an Immelmann
dialog: Turn. Dangerous stuff. It should only
dialog: be performed by a certified professional.
text: The sound of a CAR pulling in interrupts their good time.
text: Then a DOORSLAM. Jenna sits up sharply. Not good.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Oh no -- he’s early.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Who's early?
text: Jenna starts throwing clothes at Hal, a mile a minute --
dialog: /
dialog: |
dialog: i
dialog: |
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Okay, so remember after we did those
dialog: shots how I said how weird it was that
dialog: Tibet was your favorite place in the
dialog: world too and I broke up with my
dialog: boyfriend because he wouldn’t ever go
dialog: with me and you were so my type --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Yeah, I may have exaggerated my
dialog: enthusiasm for Far East travel --
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: That's okay. I may have exaggerated how
dialog: much I broke up with my boyfriend.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: And he’s here?
dialog: (she nods, he is)
dialog: Now?
text: Yep. Hal takes a glance out the window -- and sees her
text: MOTHERFUCKING HUGE BOYFRIEND walking towards the house.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re sure that’s just one guy...
text: Hal puts his pants on both legs at once, as --
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.0O.)
dialog: It comes down to fear...
scene_heading: INT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - DESIGN SHOWROOM - RESUMING
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: All pilots are susceptible. It’s a human
dialog: instinct. Train them for years, spend
dialog: billions, you can’t get rid of it. And
dialog: it’s fear that causes mistakes.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN VIEW APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hal is out the window, pulling on his clothes, when he
text: spots... HIS BOMBER JACKET. Still on the floor. Inside,
text: Jenna fends off her boyfriend’s suspicions.
scene_heading: MOTHERFUCKING HUGE BOYFRIEND
dialog: I texted you all night, babe. Where were
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: I taught a late Bikram class. The steam
dialog: made my phone all sweaty.
text: He’s about to believe the lie when he turns to find -- Hal
text: reaching in to retrieve his bomber jacket. Busted.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Forgot this. Don’t let me interrupt you.
text: And Hal TAKES OFF -- up the fire escape -- as --
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.0.)
text: End of the day, pilots are only human.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - HANGAR - RESUMING
text: Carol leads the SUITS into the ultra-modern hangar where an
text: even more ultra modern jet rests. A SABRE PROTOTYPE.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Whereas the Sabres are more than human.
text: Each has SAR/MTI and EO/IR sensors which
text: feed into a sub-symbolic neural net.
dialog: These aren’t drones. They’re the chess
text: machine that can beat the grandmaster.
speaker_heading: SENATOR
dialog: Our pilots live for combat, Ms. Ferris.
dialog: No machine can compete with the fire we
dialog: put in our boys.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: In that case... maybe you’d be willing to
dialog: suit up and fly against them in our
dialog: demonstration.
text: The Senator decides to LAUGH it off. CARL FERRIS, himself
text: older and crankier, sidles up to Carol. Sotto:
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: Explain how pissing off the guy with the
dialog: government checkbook gets us closer to
dialog: congressional funding.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I can handle him Dad. You worry about
dialog: getting a backup pilot. You’re still
dialog: missing your third.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: He'11 show.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Really? Because I’m running out of
text: shpiel and looking at an empty F-16.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: I’ve been preparing for this day for
dialog: fifteen years, I know what I’m doing.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: There are better pilots out there than
dialog: Hal Jordan. Who show up.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We don’t need better pilots. We need the
dialog: ones who’1ll make the Sabre look good.
text: Carol clocks her father’s savvy. Checks her watch.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Three, two, one...
dialog: 11.
text: As they exit the hangar doors to the tarmac, on perfect cue,
text: A SABRE BUZZES clean over all their heads!
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Gentlemen... the future of flying.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH COMMUNITY - ROOFTOPS - RESUMING
text: Hal FLIES across the rooftops, reminding himself:
speaker_heading: HAL
text: Next time, down the fire escape.
text: A glance backward. JENNA’S BOYFRIEND is gaining. And
text: homicidal. Hal whips out his cellphone as he runs.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hey. It’s me. I need a favor... I’m
text: running a little late.
text: With that Hal LEAPS off the roof’s edge. As he’s mid-flight
dialog: we MATCH CUT TO:
text: A 1967 MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE skidding to a dead stop.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - PARKING LOT - A LITTLE LATER
text: Hal gets out as his best friend TOM KALMAKU (late 20's) RUNS
text: UP, carrying a flight suit. Tom’s part Eskimo, all dedicated
text: nerdling. Hal snags the suit, putting it on as they walk.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: They didn’t start yet, did they?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No. ‘Cause they’re waiting. For you.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Nice how everything works out.
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE TARMAC - MOMENTS LATER
text: Tom and Hal round the corner toward the JETS. Carol is
text: coming at them. Tom suddenly shifts course away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: To the tower. She scares me.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You’re late.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: And your candy machine’s out of those
text: peanut butter crackers. A guy skips
dialog: lunch because he makes certain
dialog: assumptions about snack availability.
dialog: 
dialog: |
dialog: |
dialog: |
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We’re making history with the Sabre today
dialog: -- not even you can ruin my mood.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Nice name by the way. Sabre. I’m sure
dialog: your dad gave himself a good bonus pat on
dialog: the back for that one.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s in your father’s honor, Hal.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: My father would’ve hated it. It’s a
text: piece of metal, with an X-Box for a
dialog: brain. It’ll never replace a pilot.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s beaten most of them already.
text: He climbs up and into his jet. As he does:
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Hasn’t beaten me. How about, if I win,
dialog: we go down to the riverbed and recreate a
dialog: little night I like to call Junior Prom?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It wasn’t a night, more like three
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Then make it dinner. You, me, lobster,
dialog: your company card.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We'll see how hungry you are after you
dialog: get your ass kicked. Fly safe.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Never learned how.
text: Hal watches her go. A sight he’ll never get over...
scene_heading: INT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - CONTROL TOWER - MINUTES LATER
text: A 360 degree view of the sky. ON TOM at the CONTROL STATION,
text: headset on. Carol takes her place beside him. The Generals
text: and Carl arc around. Into his headset:
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Gentlemen, you are about to engage the
dialog: fearsome and mighty Sabre U-CAV. I wrote
dialog: half the code on ‘em myself, so I should
dialog: warn you...
scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - TARMAC - SAME TIME
text: The THREE F-16s LINE UP. ACROSS FROM THEM on the other side
text: of the runway, the THREE SABRES line up opposite.
dialog: 
dialog: |
dialog: |
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: TOM (OVER RADIO)
dialog: This is gonna suck hard for you.
text: MUSIC RISES, POUNDING LOUDER as the JET ENGINES flare...
text: and... THE SIX PLANES take off! WE INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: EXT. THE CRISP BLUE SKY
text: A LIGHTING-FAST 3-ON-3 DOGFIGHT over the California
text: FOOTHILLS. Hal breaks formation, going after one of the
text: Sabres. He’s more than a pilot, he’s a natural. A sharp
text: left and Hal’s got one CROSSHAIRED.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Tower, this is Highball, I’d like to
text: report a yawn fast approaching.
text: Hal’s missile lock CHIMES, but the Sabre DIVES in a
dialog: phenomenal, physics-shattering move. Dammit if the Sabre
text: isn’t pursuing Hal now.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn’t mention they could teleport.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to the Suits)
dialog: The Sabres utilize the same targeting
dialog: algorithms as your current U-CAVs, but
dialog: the flying protocols are as close to
dialog: human-grade as you can get...
text: Hal's F-16 TEARS down towards the other two -- which are
text: struggling in their own dogfight with Sabres 2 & 3. A LASER
text: SPRAYS from Sabre 2, TARGET LOCKING right onto an F-16's
text: tail. Sabre 2 births a MISSILE -- which EXPLODES out and --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Ion! Break right!
text: But the missile CONNECTS, splattering the fuselage in YELLOW
text: PAINT. Dead. Hal FIRES a MISSILE at the Sabre. But the
text: Sabre BANKS -- and SOMERSAULTS -- to come around, laser
text: target and... NAILS the third jet. SPLAT!
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you feeding those things?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: F-16s.
speaker_heading: . CAROL
dialog: For those keeping score, it’s now three
dialog: against one.
text: ALL THREE SABRES target Hal now. Hal pulls every move he can
text: think of -- SKIMMING THE TREES -- HUGGING the GROUND -- but
dialog: nothing works. They’re flies on shit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: The Sabres are programmed to perform
dialog: every flight maneuver within known
dialog: parameters.
text: The Sabres stream closer... TARGETING... he’s a split-second
text: from toast when HAL SUDDENLY YANKS his throttle! His F-16
text: CLIMBS MANIACALLY FAST. The THREE SABRES fly hard after him.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Highball, what’re you doing?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: These things are programmed within known
dialog: parameters... thought I’d try out the
dialog: other kind.
dialog: 
text: Tom reads the screen, so does Carol. JUh oh.
dialog: |
dialog: |
speaker_heading: TOM |
dialog: He’s taking them into -- i
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: A coffin corner. Can they follow?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: They don’t know not to. We never
dialog: accounted for self-destructive behavior. |
dialog: 
text: One of the suits speaks up, sending the concern --
speaker_heading: A suIT
dialog: What's a coffin corner?
speaker_heading: SENATOR
text: The altitude where a plane’s stall speed
dialog: equals its Mach.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
text: If a plane hits it... it stalls out.
text: Carol grabs Tom’s headset. Pissed and a little scared:
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Hal, the F-16 you’re flying is a nineteen
dialog: million dollar aircraft --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: It’s insured, right?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You're not. You won’t have enough oxygen

scene_heading: INT. THE CITADEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Like the Roman Senate set against the starry heavens. Above

speaker_heading: THE GUARDIANS

speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: When the first Lantern fell I came to

dialog: Will you ask that same mindless devotion
dialog: of me now? Something is out there --
text: strong enough to kill three Lanterns, now
dialog: four. We must fight back! We must arm

speaker_heading: GUARDIAN (V.0.)
dialog: You already wield the greatest weapon the

speaker_heading: ANOTHER GUARDIAN (V.O.)
dialog: What greater arms would you carry?
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: You know better than I that there is a

dialog: Ringbearer --
speaker_heading: ANOTHER GUARDIAN (V.O.)
dialog: -- Begged for the right to defend your

speaker_heading: SINESTRO

dialog: about her killing you. There'll be a
dialog: line. Got it?
text: A hug goodnight. Jim goes inside. Hal slides into the
text: Mustang, starts it... only the damn thing WON’T turn over.
text: He tries again -- then it dies again. No dice.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Come on, not now. You start and I go
dialog: home and today can be over --
text: He turns the key again -- and for a second Hal notices in the
text: rearview mirror a GLIMMER OF THAT SAME GREEN LIGHT he thought
text: he saw before... but it’s gone just as the car STARTS!
text: Just then, the RADIO DIAL BEGINS TO GLOW -- and guess what
text: color... That’s weird. Hal SMACKS the dash a couple of
text: times. But the GLOW SPREADS, slowly ENVELOPING THE CAR...
text: Hal pulls his hands off the steering wheel,
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: ...the hell is that? Coolant?
text: In a moment the car is surrounded by a HONEYCOMB OF EMERALD
text: LIGHT. But before he can properly lose his shit -- the CAR
text: SUDDENLY JOLTS. Hal falls to the floor. He pulls himself up
dialog: just in time to see --
text: THE CAR LIFT UP OFF THE GROUND! AND GODDAMMIT IF IT DOESN'T
text: FLY! Taking out a POWER LINE as it RISES INTO THE NIGHT SKY!
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoawhoawhoa --
dialog: Very reasonably, Hal freaks the fuck out --
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Car flying! Not cool!
text: He sees the ground diminishing as the car ROCKETS UP! He
text: tries steering, realizes that’s stupid, so he buckles up.
text: Hal leans over the window and realizes he’s 2000 FEET UP!
text: Through the GREEN SHELL surrounding the Mustang, he can see a
text: CESENA FLYING not a hundred feet off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: REVERSE ANGLE: The CESNA PILOT looks in Hal’s direction --
text: SEEING NOTHING. The car is CLOAKED.
text: Hal’s body is suddenly bathed in the most beautiful GREEN
text: LIGHT he’s ever seen coming from the AC vents. It calms him
text: as WE HEAR A RESONANT VOICE coming through the RADIO:
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR’S VOICE
dialog: Listen well. For you have been chosen.
text: A FOCUSED BEAM OF LIGHT from the AC vent projects INTO HAL’S
text: EYES. A SHOTGUN BLAST of IMAGES and INFORMATION unfolds:
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR’S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Chosen by the Guardians of the
dialog: Universe...
text: A SPIRAL into the Guardians’ CITADEL. The blue-skinned robed

dialog: Chosen to join the bravest of all

text: The CORPS. Standing like an army on the foothills of TRINITY
text: CANYON on OA. They raise their POWER RINGS in unison, a
text: salute, emitting a blinding GREEN GLOW.
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR’S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Charged with maintaining peace...
text: QUICK CUTS: All manner of GREEN LANTERNS performing acts of
text: selfless heroism. Rescuing a crippled spaceship...
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR’S VOICE (CONT'D)
text: Across all 3600 sectors of the universe.

speaker_heading: ABIN SUR’S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: To serve is the highest honor.
text: And on “honor” the EMERALD LIGHT DISAPPEARS so that Hal is
text: looking out the windshield at the DESERT FIFTY FEET BELOW --
text: and the car PLUMMETS TOWARD IT!
text: POOOOM! His car CRASHES into the SAND. As the dust settles,
text: we catch a familiar GREEN STREAK moving away, to...
dialog: 24.
text: CLOSE UP: Of the RING, power depleted, falling into a
text: MAGENTA HAND. The hand closes around it.
text: BACK ON THE TOTALLED MUSTANG. The door POPS open. A shaky
text: and freaked out Hal FALLS OUT. He looks back to the car.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: That was so wrong!
text: He backs away from the car like it was possessed... backing
text: towards the jutting TAIL END of --
speaker_heading: ABIN’S SHIP!
text: BONK. He whacks his head on the surface -- and turns to see:
text: The strange craft illuminated by the Mustang’s highbeams...
text: Hal stops. SOMETHING IS STIRRING inside the wreck -- Hal
text: goes straight in. WRENCHES a metal plate off the pilot.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on, I‘ll get you outta there!
text: One last effort and CLANG -- he throws the heavy fragment
text: off. And then... Hal sees ABIN SUR. Sees his strange alien
text: features. There’s no mistaking what he is. But Hal shows no
text: fear -- he tries to help Abin.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Man, I don’t know what you’re supposed to
dialog: look like, but you don’t look so hot.
text: Abin Sur is beyond concern for his own life now.

speaker_heading: ABIN SUR
dialog: This Ring will take you... to what you

text: Hector turns to see... PIPE approach.
speaker_heading: PIPE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not to mention, highly... unusual.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: I guess you read my paper on atypical

speaker_heading: PIPE
dialog: You're here because you’re the only

speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Underground and in secret. Who am I
dialog: autopsying? Bin Laden? The president’s

speaker_heading: PIPE
dialog: I’m quite certain his planet of origin is

speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: PIPE
dialog: He was... a friend. And I want to know

speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)
dialog: What. Are. You?
text: We know it’s a friggin’ PIECE of LEGION. And a chunk of an

speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)
dialog: These HazMats don’t shield against

speaker_heading: HAL (CONT’D)
dialog: “In Brightest Day. In Blackest Night.”
text: A LINE of GREEN ENERGY SHOOTS from the LANTERN to Hal’s ring

speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: “No Evil Shall Escape My Sight.”
scene_heading: INT. UNDISCLOSED GOVERNMENT FACILITY - THAT MOMENT

speaker_heading: HAL (V.0.)

speaker_heading: ARMED GUARD
dialog: He’s alive, sir. What should we do?
speaker_heading: PIPE
dialog: Take him home. We’re done with him.
text: Pipe gives a last look to Abin. We sense there’s a story

scene_heading: INT. BEACHSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: Big open windows, bigger drinks. Think Gladstones on PCH.
text: Carol’s with Hal, who seems a million miles away.
speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: HAL

text: She looks at him sadly.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What didn't I? After my dad’s breakdown,

speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, you got it. Thanks.

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - SECONDS LATER

dialog: 
text: It FLIES AT THEM! -- PUNCHING the THREE MEN across their

text: The big GREEN HAND is back! Hal stares and... the GREEN HAND
text: MOVES. WAVES. He’s controlling it. He thinks... it GROWS
text: BIGGER! Hal’s eyes go wide. What else can this thing do?
scene_heading: ON A NAVIGATIONAL BUOY

text: RESUME HAL ON THE BEACH
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
text: as a TENDRIL OF GREEN LIGHT arcs to the GREEN FIST which

speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Nonononononononono!
text: Hal decelerates. Coming in for a soft stop. A few feet

speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)

text: The BUILDINGS in the distance are tall as mountains. Liquid
text: towers of living silver. The Emerald City of Oz is a dump
text: by comparison. Sinestro notices Hal’s awe:
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: I have seen sights in this Universe to
dialog: make the blindest eye water, and I can
dialog: tell you... there is nothing to compare
dialog: with Oa.
text: Hal is struck silent. Tomar-Re approaches.
speaker_heading: TOMAR-RE
dialog: Ah. Our newest recruit. He looks...
dialog: warm-blooded. I am Tomar-Re, chosen
dialog: protector of Sector 2813, sector nearest
dialog: to your own.
text: Hal can’t get over the site of a fish-man talking.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Pretty convenient you all speak English.
speaker_heading: TOMAR-RE
dialog: (his top fin ruffles)
dialog: I speak chkgqrvchk. The ring translates
dialog: 98 percent of the universe’s known
dialog: linguistic forms. Surprisingly, your
text: English is among them.

speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: Your ring is the most powerful weapon in
dialog: the universe.
scene_heading: INT. THE TRAINING ARENA - OA - MOMENTS LATER
text: Corps members train. An elegant ballet as they conjure an
text: endless variety of WEAPONS. Like Samurai running through
text: morning exercises. Hal watches, boyhood fantasy blown away.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.0.)
dialog: Its constructs are limited only by your
dialog: imagination. Its strength limited only
dialog: by your will.
text: Hal turns to what looks like a PILE of struggling GLs.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: What are they fighting?
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: Your instructor. Killowog.
text: The GLs suddenly go FLYING in all directions, having been
text: thrown off by KILLOWOG, a gargantuan rhino-creature. He
text: lumbers over. Looks down on Hal from ten feet high --
speaker_heading: KILLOWOG
dialog: So you're the Poozer from 2814.
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: You smell funny.
dialog: (leans in close, heheheh)
dialog: We’re gonna have fun training you.
dialog: We're not sure if Hal will ever speak again.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.)
dialog: The Ring’s power comes from the Central
dialog: Battery.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CENTRAL BATTERY - OA - MOMENTS LATER
text: High atop an opaline plinth stands THE CENTRAL BATTERY (from
text: our opening). Majestic. Enormous. CRACKLING with energy.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.0.)
text: It fuels every lantern, which in turn
dialog: fuels every ring.
text: LANTERNS fly around and up to it, charging their rings with
text: the formality of the righteous on pilgrimage to holy ground.
text: FIND Hal and Sinestro below, minute in comparison.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: So this is what makes all that... green.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: Green... the light you see, is only a
dialog: manifestation of what your mind cannot
dialog: comprehend.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You lost me at “manifestation.”
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: All life is connected. By love, by hope,
dialog: by all the noblest instincts of the soul.
text: This is the center of that connection.
dialog: The power drawn from that connection is
dialog: what you see simply as “green.”
dialog: (gestures to the Battery)
dialog: All that power... collected, channeled,
dialog: here delivered. Entrusted to us.
text: We can tell Hal is daunted by the grandeur of it all.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Come, let us pay our respects.
text: Sinestro motions toward a waiting LINE of LANTERNS. All
text: manner of CREATURES assembled before a MAGENTA-SKINNED WOMAN.
text: Abin’s widow, LIANA. Regal in her sadness. She sees them
text: approach. Breaking ceremony she goes straight to Hal.
speaker_heading: LIANA
dialog: You bear my husband's ring.
text: Hal doesn’t know how to answer.
speaker_heading: LIANA (CONT'D)
dialog: You saw him. You were with Abin Sur when
dialog: he died.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LIANA
dialog: A thousand years together and a thousand
dialog: more taken from us.
text: Hal can see the pain of loss. He knows it too well.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: He told me... to tell you he loved you.
text: With his last breath.
text: These words give her more comfort than the hundreds of well-
text: wishers. She restrains a well-spring of emotion.
speaker_heading: LIANA
dialog: You wear the ring of a fine soldier.
dialog: There are many who will miss him. Even
dialog: more who owe him thanks. Do it justice.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CENTRAL BATTERY - MOMENTS LATER
text: As Hal and Sinestro re-enter, Hal studies the Battery closer
text: now. A mixture of emotions cascading over him.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: You lied to her and think it kind. You
dialog: are human.
dialog: 45.
text: Hal TOUCHES the base wall of the Battery, as he does his ring
text: FLICKERS. A HOLOGRAM manifests, a rotating CORPS SYMBOL.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Um... is it supposed to do that?
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
text: A fallen Lantern will sometimes dictate a
dialog: final transmission, to reveal itself
dialog: before the Central Battery --
text: Sinestro waits. The logo FLICKERS into the face of...
text: LEGION! Ferociously ATTACKING ABIN! We’re re-watching
text: Abin’s spacefight with Legion as a GIANT GREEN HOLOGRAM.
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR’S VOICE
dialog: This is Abin Sur -- I have seen what
dialog: hunts us -- Legion -- it lives --
scene_heading: INT. THE CITADEL - OA
text: Sinestro stands beside Hal, projecting Abin’s message for the
text: GUARDIANS to see. The horrible hologram REPLAYS on a loop.
speaker_heading: ABIN SUR’S VOICE
dialog: The ring holds no effect, no defense --
dialog: You must take action. Legion is real.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: “Legion is real.” The dying words of our
dialog: most noble soldier.
text: He points to the image of the snarling hellbeast.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (CONT'D)
dialog: Legion -- taking its revenge for offenses
dialog: long forgotten to all but itself... And
dialog: ou, the Guardians of our Universe.
speaker_heading: A GUARDIAN (V.O.)
dialog: What is it you desire, Thaal Sinestro?
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: A Golden Light to match Legion’s. If our
dialog: enemies command such power, we must too!
speaker_heading: A GUARDIAN (V.O.)
dialog: It is agreed action must be taken.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER GUARDIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Gather your Lanterns. Seek the beast out
dialog: and contain it.
speaker_heading: A GUARDIAN (V.0.)
dialog: Return with Legion defeated. And we will
dialog: consider your request.
text: Sinestro is far from sated with their answer.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: A GUARDIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We have faith in you, Thaal Sinestro.
dialog: And in the Lanterns at your side.
text: Hal takes one last look at Legion... which is currently
text: ROARING in his face, as we HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE GREAT HALL - OA
text: Hal storms out, moving somewhere, anywhere --
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: We were given leave to find Legion.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You were. I’m going home. If you’re ever
dialog: near Gaia, pop over, we'll grab a drink.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: You are a member of the Corps now.
dialog: You took an oath.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I recited a poem floating in my
dialog: apartment! It doesn’t make that giant
dialog: Spacemonster my problem.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: The Ring chose you, Hal.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: The Ring made a mistake!
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: Rings do not make mistakes. Lanterns do.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: And I’d make a million of ‘em. Trust me.
dialog: (then, re: his Ring)
dialog: Look, I had a good life before this
text: showed up. Before rhino instructors and
dialog: purple widows, who quite frankly made me
dialog: feel really guilty. This whole alien
dialog: army deal... it’s not my thing.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: Legion was in your sector, Hal. In your
dialog: home system. If any trace of that demon
dialog: fell to your planet along with Abin... it
dialog: will ravage your homeworld like a cancer.
text: A look crosses Hal’s face. Is it worry? He catches himself.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: See, the Ring did make a mistake.
dialog: Because another guy -- he would care.
scene_heading: EXT. TRANSPORT BAY - OA
text: Hal’‘s on a PLATFORM. Tomar-Re and Sinestro instruct him.

speaker_heading: TOMAR-RE
dialog: Leaving? Well, the Ring adheres to your
dialog: will. “Simply will yourself home.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Where do I FedEx it when I’m done?
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: The Ring has selected you. It is yours
dialog: until you fall in battle. Or elsewhere.
dialog: (a little grim)
dialog: We await your return, Hal Jordan.
text: Hal gives a nervous look -- then LIGHTING UP IN HIS GREEN

text: INSIDE THE COCKPIT, the SENATOR SCREAMS. Unable to eject...
text: THE GREEN BOLT OF LIGHT races the runaway jet -- blindingly
text: fast, outpacing it -- until the green blast MORPHS into --
text: A HUGE NET. WHICH CATCHES THE FALCON! It pulls taut,
text: straining. THE SHOT RUNS THE LENGTH OF THE NET to its
text: source: THE GREEN LANTERN, pulling with all his strength.
text: It nearly yanks his shoulders from their sockets.
text: BACK WITH HECTOR -- Concentrating on his father’s Falcon,
dialog: fighting against Green Lantern’s amazing strength -- and
text: losing. PAIN surges through Hector’s body ~- as he “pushes”
dialog: harder with his power -- but --
text: Green Lantern has the Falcon secure. The strain becomes too
text: much for Hector -- and the buildup of his power is RELEASED!
text: FIRING OUT in a WAVE -- which blindsides Falcon 3. The jet
text: is suddenly PROPELLED with the full force of Hector’s mind.
text: The PILOT EJECTS -- but --FALCON 3 CRASHES INTO THE BASE OF
dialog: THE CONTROL TOWER!
text: A massive EXPLOSION of jet fuel! A scream of tortured metal
text: as THE TOWER LURCHES FORWARD!
text: Defeated, Hector ducks into the crowd, instinctively grabbing
text: his head in pain to quell the mounting pain, as --
text: INSIDE THE TOWER
text: The room PITCHES FORWARD. Nathan FLIES towards the
text: observation window -- now perpendicular to the ground --
text: SMASH! The window FRACTURES... spider-webbing under his
dialog: weight... but doesn’t break!
speaker_heading: ON FALCON 2
text: as it skids gently onto the tarmac. THE GREEN NET tape
text: measures back into GL’s Ring. But there’s no time to
text: celebrate as he BLAZES towards the tower.
text: INSIDE THE TOWER
text: Nathan keeps low, precarious, like crawling on thin ice.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Stay there, Nathan!
text: No thought to her own safety, Carol climbs onto the glass to
text: get him! CRACKS spindle even further. She reaches out
text: and... HEAVES Nathan up, OVER TO SAFETY -- but...
text: The momentum CATAPULTS her forward... further on to the
text: sloooowly shattering window... and -- THROUGH IT!
text: CAROL FALLS to the fiery ground below! Seconds become
text: milliseconds. Death’s arms opening wide, until --
text: GREEN LANTERN catches her! Holding her close as he ZIPS her
text: away from the rushing ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: (pitching his voice)
dialog: Easy, Miss.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Am I dead?
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: (um, something a “hero” would
dialog: say)
dialog: Not on my watch.
text: She clutches GL even tighter. Which he doesn’t mind one bit.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We're flying --
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: It gets better.
text: And in one fluid motion, GL whips around, ring blazing to
text: project a GIANT HAND that PUSHES the leaning tower upright!
text: A SECOND BLAST fuses the metal at the base. The tower
text: stabilizes.
text: ON CAROL -- who can’t believe it all. For the first time in
text: Hal's life, someone looks at him like a hero. It feels good.
text: So does the ROAR from the euphoric crowd below as the GREEN
text: LANTERN flies off with Carol on his arm over their heads and
text: into the night sky. Brilliant green against midnight blue.
scene_heading: INT. AIRFIELD BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: SLAM! Hector stumbles to the sinks. His hands pressed to
text: his THROBBING forehead in electric pain. A gale-force
text: migraine burrowing into his brain.
text: He reaches to splash water on his face, but can’t make it,
text: SLUMPING to the floor. Something is happening to him... his
text: head... He howls in pain as his glasses SNAP OFF HIS FACE!
text: It's too much -- he PASSES OUT. As we PUSH IN on Hector, the
text: vein in his head PULSING sickeningly, CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE SKY OVER THE BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
text: GL flies into view. Carol in his arms. They glide towards
text: the coast. He lands softly on the sand beside her.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Who... are you?
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: Sorry. No names on the first flight.
dialog: Maybe next time.
text: The emerald aura does a slow creep up his uniform. The Green
text: Lantern slowly floats upward. Carol calls after him:
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Next time?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As he disappears into the sky. A green rocket. And savior.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - TARMAC - LATER
text: Fire truck sirens illuminate the night and paramedics help

dialog: Calm down, Flyboy. Catch your breath.
text: A SERIES OF CUTS:
text: As Hal walks Nathan home...
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Do you think he’s an alien or mutant or
dialog: both? Or maybe he’s a regular guy who
dialog: got his powers from a nuclear accident!
text: As Nathan brushes his teeth. Hal watches...
speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Wait then there'd be radiation from all
dialog: his laser beams and everybody he saved’'d
dialog: grow like extra arms or a third eye!
dialog: 60.
text: As Hal puts Nathan to bed...
speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe he gets his powers from his suit so
dialog: anybody who wears it’d be able to fly
dialog: around! What do you think, Uncle Hal?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (spitballing)
dialog: Maybe he’s one of 3600 space police who
dialog: work for blue-skinned aliens and patrol
text: the universe using their power rings.
text: Nathan looks at Hal like that’s the dumbest idea in history.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)

text: ON THE TV: Grainy footage of Green Lantern flying over the
text: crowd as captured by someone’s CELL PHONE CAMERA.
speaker_heading: HELEN JORDAN (CONT’D)
dialog: It has to be a stunt. Like how they made

dialog: Yeah. Gotta be.

dialog: Could you imagine? If it’s all real.

scene_heading: INT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - HANGAR - NIGHT
dialog: Reminiscent of our opening because it’s exactly the same

speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN

dialog: us this shindig is to celebrate its completion.
text: But all attention turns when the DOORS FLING OPEN of their
text: own accord and... Hector makes his entrance. He struts his
dialog: stuff like a man without limits.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
text: Senator Hammond, glad-handing with A SENATOR, sees his son as
text: the center of attention. The desired effect. Hector spots
text: his father, approaches, snatching a drink as he walks.
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: Hector. What a... surprise. You're
dialog: looking a little puffy. Are you okay?
text: He’s reacting to the odd bulge at Hector’s temples.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Never better. Lately I’ve been
dialog: interested in space exploration. I was
dialog: thinking of making a major donation...
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND (V.O.)
dialog: Good thinking. It’s a fine cause.
dialog: (V.0.)
dialog: On my credit card, I’m sure.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: I can afford it. I recently came into a
dialog: fair amount of bank.
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: That’s great, Son. I’m glad to hear it.
dialog: (v.0.)
dialog: What am I going to do with you?
text: Not what Hector was hoping for. He tries, weakly --
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Isn’t this what-- You always told me you
dialog: wanted me to be more successful.
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: I told you I wanted you to find some
dialog: direction.
dialog: (thinks )
dialog: Now you’re just a well dressed
dialog: disappointment.
text: Trying to blunt the pain, Hector knocks back his drink.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Nothing’s ever gonna be enough, will it?
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: I've got a speech to give. Think about
dialog: making it an early night, okay?
dialog: (thinks )
dialog: Go home before you embarrass us both.
text: A knife-pierce of paternal disappointment. He claps Hector
text: on the shoulder. That familiar paternal gesture, insincere.
scene_heading: FOLLOW SENATOR HAMMOND
text: as he approaches the Dais. Until he’s buttonholed by Pipe,
text: who grips his arm. Urgent.
speaker_heading: PIPE
dialog: Senator Hammond. I need to talk to you
dialog: about your son. We have a problem.
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: Story of my life. Talk to him yourself.
dialog: He’s here somewhere.
text: News to Pipe, whose eyes instantly memorize the terrain. The
text: Senator breaks free of Pipe, heading up towards the stage.
text: Pipe speaks into his cuff --
speaker_heading: PIPE
text: Set a perimeter. Subject’s inside.
text: As a STEALTHY TEAM OF PIPE’S MEN hone in on the exits --
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
text: climbs the dais, commands the microphone. The crowd
text: instantly silences. He looks to the ISS, speaks genuinely.
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: Few things unite all people. For me,
dialog: it’s the way we all look at the stars.
dialog: For answers. For inspiration. For hope.
dialog: No matter who I talk to, anywhere in the
dialog: world, we all share that. And now the
dialog: stars have started giving us answers.
dialog: Who knows what else we'll find up there,
dialog: so long as we’re brave enough to look --
text: Suddenly, the Senator lifts from the podium! Floating, free
text: of gravity, up and over the heads of the GUESTS.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (V.O.)
dialog: Just out of curiosity, when exactly did
dialog: you decide I was such a disappointment?
text: The question drives painfully into his mind.
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: Hector?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (V.O.)
dialog: You think it’s easy having a living
dialog: legend for a father?
text: The giant windows EXPLODE OUT. Wind rushes in. PEOPLE
text: SCREAM. The Senator struggles.
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: Hector, if you’re doing this somehow --
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (V.O.)
dialog: Would that finally be enough to impress
dialog: you? Would it, Dad?!
text: SIRENS and ALARMS WAIL as a mob rushes the exits. But one
text: man surges upstream: Hector. Marching towards his father.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: What if I told you I could read your
dialog: mind? That I could hear your shame! or
dialog: that I could rip you in half with a
dialog: single thought!
dialog: 
text: Hector stands in front of him now. Out loud:
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)
dialog: Maybe now I’m the one who’s disappointed
dialog: in you!
speaker_heading: VOICE BEHIND HECTOR (0.S.)
dialog: Put him down, Hector.
text: Hector turns to see he’s surrounded by Pipe and his MEN. A
text: DOZEN GUNS trained on him. He turns to Pipe, recognizing --
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: You. You did this to me. You exposed
dialog: me. Changed me... Into this.
speaker_heading: PIPE
dialog: We didn’t know-- We had no idea there
dialog: would be this kind of infection --
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: It was an alien corpse! What could
dialog: possibly go wrong?
text: 12 Berettas CHAMBER in unison as Pipe tries to hold his men
text: back, reasoning with Hector, voice soothing --
speaker_heading: PIPE
dialog: Hector, we don’t want anyone to get hurt--
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Then I’d suggest you put away your guns.
text: Pipe’s eyes go wide with realization. Starts to bark an
text: order -- STOP! -- but too late: The guns FIRE! -- only...
dialog: the bullets all WHIP UPWARDS! --
dialog: 73.
text: Riddling Senator Hammond! CRIMSON blossoms on his chest,
text: eating up the white of his shirt. He drops to the ground.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT'D)
dialog: (dry) |
dialog: You guys killed my Dad.
text: And in one insane fury -- FOOM! -- Hector launches the GUNMEN
text: up and out and through the atrium glass walls! Hector
text: advances on Pipe.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT'D)
dialog: So there are these headaches I’ve been
dialog: meaning to ask you about --

dialog: Hector --
text: Hector turns to discover his father is still alive. For now.
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)
dialog: I'm... sorry...
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SENATOR HAMMOND
dialog: You... may’ve read my mind... But you
dialog: couldn't read my heart. I always
dialog: loved...

speaker_heading: CAROL (PRELAP)
dialog: Do you know what’s happening?
scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - RUNWAY - THAT MOMENT
text: Walking through the “Paris” lights, wandering its amazing

dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: Me? I haven’t done that much.
text: Carol stops, looking straight at him. Meaning it.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We stopped believing something amazing
dialog: was still possible. I’m not talking
dialog: about the flying or Paris. I mean...
dialog: what you are. Normal people... they

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: Not everyone.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Most. You’re someone they can count on.
dialog: When there’s nothing else left. Now
dialog: everyone knows... there’s a hero.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: Maybe the world just hasn’t been paying
dialog: attention. Maybe there’ve been heroes
dialog: all along, right in front of you, but you
dialog: didn’t know it... Maybe he-- they...

text: Carol stops. Facing him.
speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN

text: With a BLUR OF GREEN -- he’s gone. Paris fades around her...
scene_heading: INT. NATIONAL AIR & SPACE MUSEUM - ATRIUM - NIGHT
text: Eerie stillness. Broken only by SOBS and helicopters circling

text: HECTOR, cradling his father, HOWLING, grief struck.
speaker_heading: PIPE
dialog: It’s alright, Hector. It’s gonna be
dialog: alright. Just come with me.
text: Hector sees Pipe. A moment of childlike submission. Then
text: the grief darkens, instantly transmuting into RAGE.
text: Hector glares. Pipe drops to the floor, stricken with PAIN.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: That’s what it feels like in here. Like
dialog: someone scraping the inside of your
dialog: skull, right? Forks in your eyes. And
dialog: it keeps getting worse. That’s my whole
dialog: life now. Thanks to you.
text: Pipe is writhing. Hector stands over him, ready to kill.
text: Pipe is in agony, death fast approaching -- when --
speaker_heading: A GREEN ROPE
text: entwines around Pipe’s ankle -- YANKING him to safety.
text: Similar GREEN LINES snake around anyone still in harm’s way,
text: pulling them all OUT, to safety. Hector turns to see --
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
text: drop from the sky. GL lands in front of the fallen Senator.
text: His ring quickly wraps Hector in GIANT MANACLES.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: No one else needs to die today.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Oh, I can think of at least one more
dialog: person.
text: GL is suddenly seized -- as if hit with 1000 volts of
text: current. We experience it as he does -- as A VOICE INSIDE
text: OUR HEADS. LOUD. PESTILENT. VILE. The manacles fade.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You think you can stop me? Because your
dialog: jewelry can lift things?
text: GL's hand -- his ring hand -- extends. The Ring GLOWING.
text: With telltale spasticity, his fist jerks. The Ring SURGES --
text: and -- the APOLLO LUNAR MODULE EXPLODES!

dialog: No!
dialog: Oh yes. The RING FIRES! The will of all that lives misused
text: in a blast that SENDS INNOC: MEN FLYING! DEAD.
text: GL CRIES OUT. But he’s powerless to stop the mayhem.
text: GL struggles. FOCUSING HIS RAGE. Until -- with a PRIMAL
text: SCREAM -- GL BREAKS FREE! Regaining control of his body --
dialog: and the Ring -- and --
text: HE SHOOTS towards Hector! A green bullet flying right at him.
text: HECTOR doubles over, the exertion causing him a NEW level of
text: agony. But he raises his hand in defense, sending --
text: THE PIONEER 10 SATELLITE CRASHING INTO GL! Hector is
text: literally HURLING spaceships at GL! -- the BELL XP-59 -- the
scene_heading: NORTH AMERICAN X-15 -- the MARINER PROBE -- each snapping off
text: its cables and RAINING ON GL! Who flies and dodges, fluid

text: HECTOR presses his palms to the sides of his head -- the
dialog: torment culminating, as --
text: His scalp starts to split and crack! Blood trickles from

scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE WASHINGTON, D.C.

text: Hector’s head is GROTESQUELY LARGE. Like Pipe’s mouse.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: The pain... it’s exquisite...
text: Hector’s bloodshot eyes go wide, on fire with madness. He's

dialog: He focuses on GL and --

speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: YOU. You’re the reason this happened to

text: before, CALLING HIS NAME from that tarmac, VOICE ECHOING --
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (repeating what he hears)
dialog: “Hal... Jordan.”
text: RESUME: Green Lantern blanches. Hector knows his name.
text: This last taunt sends GL over the edge -- his AURA EXPLODES --
text: a BURST OF ENERGY that SEPARATES the two -- SHOOTING them

scene_heading: THE JEFFERSON MONUMENT!
text: HE BASHES into the base of Jefferson’s statue! Marble

scene_heading: EXT. D.C. MALL - REFLECTING POOL - THAT MOMENT
text: Hector drops like a meteor, about to hit the shallow pool --
text: until he FREEZES -- inches from the surface. Then rights

text: TWO TOURISTS drop their cameras and their jaws -- stunned to
text: see the giant-headed man pull a Jesus. Remarks:
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Not as hard as you’d think.
text: He steps off the water to solid ground.
text: A speeding car suddenly STOPS. As if it hit an invisible

speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I don’t get it... What is Legion anyway?

speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: Legion is the Guardians’ shame.
text: Sinestro extends his ring up and FIRES. IMAGES UNFURL.
text: Beginning with: A GIANT BOOK, pages fluttering open.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. TRINITY CANYON - OA - FLASHBACK
text: The Guardians float in a ring over a continental crevasse.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.0.)
dialog: In their efforts to protect the Universe,
dialog: the Guardians sought to harness the
text: emanations of light. But they did not
text: begin with Will. They began with a force
text: far more potent... With Will’s opposite.
text: Their cumulative concentration culminates and... A Guardian
text: swipes the air. A THIN YELLOW FLAME -- the color of Legion --
text: appears in his palm.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Fear.
text: The Guardian passes the meager flame to his neighbor. It
text: grows. Until the flame becomes a BLAZE, burning one of them.
text: The blaze widens, beyond their circle...
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But the light of Fear could not be
text: controlled. Even by the Guardians.
text: The YELLOW BLAZE rips out of orbit towards the stars. A wash
text: of toxic light spanning Creation.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: It spread. Throughout Creation. Taking
dialog: what is good and polluting it with Fear.
dialog: And all things changed.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY PLANET - FLASHBACK
text: Craggy, barren. Two LIZARD CREATURES share their scavengings
text: as... THE YELLOW BLAZE passes over them like a tide.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.)
dialog: In trying to bring order to the cosmos,
dialog: the Guardians unleashed chaos.
text: The lizards’ expressions turn malevolent. Distrusting their
text: brother. They ATTACK EACH OTHER with a new ferocity.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: The Guardians saw their mistake. And
dialog: they took action. They collected this
dialog: light of Fear...
scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE OA - ORBIT - FLASHBACK
text: The Guardians, in a circle again. Only now FACING OUTWARD.
text: With their combined efforts the thin tendrils of Golden Light

scene_heading: EXT. THE LOST SECTOR - FLASHBACK
text: A starless space. Blacker and bleaker than the singularity

speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.0.)
dialog: To the Lost Sector. A place of
dialog: containment. A place to keep safe the
dialog: Guardians’ failures.
text: The yellow torrent is cast within. It spirals inside -- a
text: cyclone of fear and rage. It twists and writhes, coalescing.
text: No longer merely a Light. But a Life. A nascent Beast lets
text: out a wild, PRIMORDIAL HOWL.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: But in that dark place, the Fear grew
dialog: strength. And form. And shape.
text: The swirl of fire MORPHS into a very familiar shape: Legion.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: And its rage was legion.
text: The HOLOGRAM FADES AWAY, as we TUMBLE down through --
scene_heading: INT. SCIENCELLS - UNDERGROUND - OA - RESUMING
text: Sinestro leads Hal through an UNDERGROUND EDIFICE. A
text: catacomb of CRYSTALLINE structure, repeated matrices of GREEN
text: CELLS stretching on into fractal infinity.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: They made Legion?
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: That is why it hunts us. To take revenge
text: on its captors. And creators.
text: In answer, Sinestro SWOOPS down lower into the Sciencells.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (CONT’D)
dialog: With the Guardians’ permission I led a
text: phalanx of Lanterns to scour all sectors.
dialog: Even with our combined efforts, our
dialog: combined will, it killed thirty-three of
dialog: our number.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Finally Sinestro LANDS at his destination.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO

dialog: horror -- at the sight of --
text: LEGION. Captured. Trapped by CHAINS OF GREEN ENERGY.
text: A DOZEN LANTERNS (some wounded) keep a STEADY STREAM OF

text: with effort to escape the pain and confinement. SHRIEKING
text: with a rage to make the Devil piss his pants.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You didn’t kill it?
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: The Corps does not kill. Certainly not
dialog: before Legion can repay its debt of
dialog: death...

speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: A piece of that is still on my planet.
dialog: If the Guardians let you go after the

speaker_heading: A GUARDIAN (V.0.)
dialog: The Ring is the most powerful weapon in

text: Sinestro conjures a row of SHARP PRECISION INSTRUMENTS.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER GUARDIAN (V.O.)
dialog: It is why we have imparted rules

dialog: They grow TAUT...
speaker_heading: A GUARDIAN (V.O.)
dialog: To prevent catastrophe.

speaker_heading: A GUARDIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Do you understand, Hal Jordan of Gaia?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: If your training is just gonna teach me
dialog: how to let people down... I already know
dialog: how to do that.
text: Plink. Hal has just set his Ring down on the marble pillar.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Earth may be a primitive planet, but you
dialog: guys, with your whole bureaucracy...
dialog: you'd fit in just great there.
text: Hal’s Uniform SHIMMERS off him, replaced by his clothes. All
text: his power gone, refused. The Guardians stare in disbelief.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT’D)
dialog: Keep your Ring. I might not have the
dialog: will of all that lives behind me... but I
dialog: have my will to do what I can. I’11 beat
dialog: this guy on my own.
text: And Hal turns his back on the gods.
scene_heading: INT. THE GREAT HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hal exits, quickly met by TWO GREEN LANTERNS, a WING-EARED
text: WOMAN and an ivory-colored FEATURELESS MAN. They flank him
text: ominously, leading him towards the landing/flight platform.
text: Wing-Ears says something in a SQUALKY ALIEN LANGUAGE.

dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Sorry. No ring, no speaky alien. So how
dialog: do we do this? You fly me home? Or do
dialog: you give me a loaner Ring --
text: Instead of an answer -- Wing-Ears drops suddenly. Cut down
text: by a YELLOW BLAST. Hal looks up to see it:
speaker_heading: LEGION
text: is clawing its way out of the Sciencells! Featureless
text: Lantern shouts at Hal in alien before... Legion’s BLAST
text: knocks him to the ground. Hal looks up. Lanterns mobilize
text: from all directions, FLYING. Falling into --
text: AN INSTANT FORMATION OF LANTERNS.
text: Hal ducks for cover as they whip overhead, calling up weapons
text: and ATTACKING LEGION. But Legion lets loose with its hot
text: hateful BLASTS -- the Lanterns are easily repelled.
text: TWO MORE DIE in an instant. Hal looks down to the fallen
text: Lanterns at his feet... kneels down to them...
dialog: They might look different... but these are his brothers.
dialog: PUSH IN ON HAL, as --
text: He takes off the fallen Lantern’s ring. And does the same
dialog: thing with the others!
scene_heading: EXT. OA - OUTSIDE THE SCIENCELLS
text: Glass and metal rain down as LEGION’S CLAWS explode through
text: the outer wall! The monster wrenches its way out of
text: captivity, like a demon hatching from a egg.
text: EVERY AVAILABLE LANTERN mobilizes -- Kilowog and Tomar-Re and
text: the CADETS -- all swarming like hornets, conjuring all manner
text: of weapons and blasts, all useless, as --
text: LEGION FLIES UP!
text: In unison, the Lanterns CRISSCROSS the sky with weblike-
scene_heading: BEAMS. Legion SWATS LANTERNS ASIDE, PULSES EXPLODING from
text: its jaws! Lanterns fall and die, making a hole in the sky
text: cover. Legion is about to escape through it -- when --
text: A SCIMITAR SLICES OFF ONE OF ITS CLAWS.
text: SINESTRO stands in its way. His four blades swinging.
text: Valiant, but no match for Legion. In an instant, Sinestro is
text: grabbed. Legion enjoys a moment of delight... about to take
text: his head off in its endless fangs when --
text: A SHOCKINGLY POWERFUL RINGBLAST STRIKES LEGION!
text: The momentary distraction causes it to RELEASE Sinestro --
dialog: turning its attention to its new attacker --

dialog: 
dialog: 86.
text: WIELDING A POWER RING ON EACH FINGER! A master of ten Rings!
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Yeah. I really need more training.
text: Hal’s Rings conjure up an army of objects -- SAMURAI SWORDS,
text: ASSORTED WEAPONRY -- anything he can think of to distract
text: Legion from the others. He succeeds -- Legion has a taste
dialog: for only his blood now... And RACES for Hal! Bait taken...
text: THE CHASE BEGINS!
scene_heading: EXT. THE OAN SKIES
text: Hal flies fast, leading Legion away -- slaloms and twists,
text: weaving around the towers that rocket past. Legion just
text: SMASHES through them. Pursuing relentlessly.
text: Hal rockets HIGHER -- where SINESTRO flies to his side --
text: matching his speed. Hal couldn’t be happier for the help.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Glad you could make it.
text: Together they FIRE an arsenal of GREEN WEAPONS that work in
text: elegant SEQUENCE to whittle away at Legion’s strength. We
dialog: see in these two the makings of a legendary team.
text: But Legion is only scuffed, not stopped. Sinestro and Hal
text: barely dodge an EXPLOSIVE PULSE that takes out a BUILDING.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Am I allowed to kill him yet?!
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: No number of rings will be enough to slay

speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I wasn’t gonna use the Rings!
text: Hal loops around a DOME. Legion SWIPES, CRACKING THE DOME
scene_heading: WIDE OPEN -- REVEALING, inside --
scene_heading: THE CENTRAL BATTERY!
text: Crackling with infinite power. He flies right for it --
text: FIRING AHEAD! RIGHT INTO THE BATTERY! We start to get the
dialog: idea that Hal has a plan. And it’s a dumb one.
text: He FIRES again -- right into the core -- which starts to
text: GLOW, a nuclear bomb arming itself... Growing LOUDER and
text: LOUDER until we feel its power surging... OVERLOADING!
text: LIGHTNING FIRES ALL AROUND! STRIKING HAL! But he holds his
dialog: fire INTO the Battery.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: Get out now! You'll die.

dialog: 
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (straining)
dialog: Just promise you’ll help my people!
text: Sinestro nods. He will. Hal, made braver by that promise...
text: FIRES ONE LAST TIME -- INTO THE BATTERY -- which PULSES --
text: and ROILS -- until... it... finally gives out --
text: EXPLODING WITH POWER!
text: A GREEN DETONATION like the Big Bang itself, traveling...
text: STRAIGHT THROUGH HAL.
text: Coursing through his body! It’s too much! Hal holds it
text: together just long enough to bring his hands together --
dialog: channelling all that endless energy to --
text: FIRE WITH EVERYTHING HE HAS AT LEGION!
text: A RINGLBLAST THE LIKES OF WHICH GOD HAS NEVER SEEN! The
text: combined power of all life expended at once. So much energy
text: the RINGS ON HIS HAND DISINTEGRATE!
text: It is finally enough. Legion is stricken. And dies.
text: The Lanterns who have come to witness the unthinkable feat
text: watch as Legion drops. The nightmare ended. The Corps’
text: surprise only outdone by their shock when they see --
speaker_heading: HAL
text: still hanging in the sky... ile plummets. Lifelessly. He
text: POUNDS into the ground at then foot of the CRACKED and SPENT
dialog: battery.
text: Sinestro and Tomar-Re are the first to reach him. The smoke
text: starts to clear, REVEALING... Hal. Unmoving.
dialog: He is a hero today. And he is dead.
text: At least, that’s what we think. Until... Hal shudders and
text: coughs. Life returning. Beaten up... but still Hal.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: (weak; @ la post-dogfight)
dialog: Well... that was easy.
text: Sinestro helps him to his feet. Hal’s temples are now GREY.

speaker_heading: TOMAR-RE
dialog: You should be dead.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Don’t sound so disappointed.

dialog: Hal Jordan of Gaia came here seeking our

dialog: (then)
dialog: Today we show him how the Corps defends

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We'll get the funding, Dad. Venture

speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: No. It’s time for me to get on with my

text: A hug that says he understands the sacrifices she’s made.
text: Appreciative, holding her father, Carol is distracted by

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I thought Hangar 18 was closed?
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: The old fallout shelter? It is. Why?
text: Carol’s not sure either. Curiosity piqued, she beelines to --
scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - LATER
text: Carol is standing at the head of the metal staircase she

dialog: metal door, and into:
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. FALLOUT SHELTER - CONTINUOUS
text: Tom faces his bank of monitors/displays, so he doesn’t see
text: CAROL push through the metal doors and down the stairs. She

text: Abin’s alien ship. Tom turns. Sees her. Shits.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Tom... Anything you’d like to tell me?
scene_heading: INT. SHOWROOM HANGAR - THAT MOMENT
text: Carl moves through his workspace, flicking off the lights one
text: by one. He lingers over a Sabre model. Saying goodbye.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: Sorry, Martin. Let you down again.
text: A moment of regret. And Carl is suddenly SUCKED out of the
text: showroom -- CRASHING THROUGH a glass partition -- into --
text: The hangar. He hangs in mid-air, floating above one of the
text: SABRE PROTOTYPES, terrified by the sight of...
text: A GARGANTUAN HEAD. It lists to one side, neck no longer able
text: to support it fully. We PAN DOWN over the cracked and
dialog: mottled scalp to recognize --
text: HECTOR. His body useless. He drools slightly. His hands
text: tremble, curled into claws around the arm of a WHEELCHAIR,
text: pushed by haggard and disheveled BROOME, a hellish orderly.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Excuse me. I’m looking for a Mr. Hal
dialog: Jordan. You know where I can find him?
text: Carl stares back, bloody and scared.
speaker_heading: CARL FERRIS
dialog: What are you -- ?
text: Hector sighs, as if he’s being put out.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Not here?
text: Hector looks over to Sabre. An idea flashes.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine. How about we bring him to us?

scene_heading: INT. FALLOUT SHELTER - RESUMING

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It’s a... prototype I’m working on, a
dialog: cross-model design sorta thing, took some
dialog: fuselages and... probably won’t even fly,

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Do you honestly think I can’t recognize a

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (flinching)
dialog: It’s not my fault -- just don’t hit me --
text: Before Carol can press, the room is ROCKED by a THUNDERCLAP

scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - TARMAC - SECONDS LATER
text: -- THE ENTIRE FLEET OF SABRES pulls out of the hangar and...
text: TAKES OFF, soaring into the horizon.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: We didn’t have a test flight scheduled
dialog: for tonight, did we?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No!
text: Carol and Tom race across the pavement back to:
scene_heading: INT. SHOWROOM HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Carol runs in -- Tom behind her -- but the sight of her
text: father, writhing in mid-air, freezes them in their tracks.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Dad--!
text: Her gasp snares Hector’s attention. A MEMORY HIT: Carol’s
text: face from Hal’s minds eye. Hector grins, “recognizing” her.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: I know you.
text: Focusing on Carol, Hector’s brow furrows, using his new

scene_heading: EXT. COAST CITY PIER - THAT MOMENT

dialog: What're those?
text: Jim glances up to see two SABRES bearing down on them!
text: No time to panic or answer as -- the Sabres split, DIVING
text: towards the base of the ride -- GUNS BLAZING --
text: The wheelhouse CRUMPLES! Metal cries in protest and...
text: The entire structure starts to topple! Like a redwood felled
text: and falling, casting its vast SHADOW on the ground... over...
text: HELEN! Feet rooted by fear.
text: NATHAN lets out a SHRIEK -- Jim pulls Nathan close as they
dialog: fall -- it’s over --
text: Until the ENTIRE WHEEL is suddenly awash in GREEN LIGHT.
text: Nathan and Jim open their eyes to see...
text: A RHINO-SHAPED LANTERN. KILLOWOG. A FORCEFIELD from his

speaker_heading: KILLOWOG
dialog: (to Nathan; a greeting)
dialog: Poozer.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
scene_heading: OHMYGODTHATISSOCOOOOOOL!

scene_heading: Manifested by TOMAR-RE’S Ring.
text: The Sabre comes around for another try... buzzing the

text: SINESTRO stands his ground, awaiting the Sabre’s approach
text: like a gunfighter.
text: THE OTHER LANTERNS crisscross over the city. One stops a
text: LANDSLIDE with a GIANT GREEN SHOVEL. Another rescues a
text: family from a collapsing building. A SCHOOL BUS is set right
text: after teetering over an overpass.
text: The PEOPLE’S appreciation overwhelms their fear of the
dialog: strange creatures saving them...
text: BACK ON THE BOARDWALK
text: Sinestro and Hal, side by side, manifest the weapons that

text: through the horde of U-CAVs flying right at them!
text: Through the SMOKE they see two last Sabres coming at them.

speaker_heading: SINESTRO

speaker_heading: HAL

scene_heading: INT. SHOWROOM HANGAR - 1.8 SECONDS LATER
text: A human-sized bullet hole RIPS open as GL bursts through. He

text: TOM and CARL are held captive, lifted high above, a WHIRLWIND
text: of TOOLS and HEAVY EQUIPMENT SWIRLING around them dangerously
text: close. All by HECTOR... who’s slavering for the fight. A
text: monster in a chair, his vile head housing his murderous mind.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: You‘re late. I almost had to kill
dialog: everyone without you.
text: Hector tries to penetrate Hal’s mind with his own -- to
text: CONTROL HIM -- but Hal’s aura shines brighter than ever.
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: Let them go.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Sure.
text: With a raised brow... Carl and Tom go flying out the hangar.
scene_heading: EXT. TARMAC - CONTINUOUS
text: THAT GREEN HAND catches Carl and Tom. Places them safely.
scene_heading: INT. SHOWROOM HANGAR - RESUMING
text: Annoyed, Hector FIRES the maelstrom of metal at GL -- who
text: conjures a SHIELD to deflect it (A PIECE KNOCKS BROOME back
text: and unconscious). Hector’s chair wheels toward GL
text: confidently. He makes a rag rise to wipe his sticky chin.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Nice. But not enough to save her...
dialog: Your Carol.
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: I could see you all over her mind...
dialog: years of disappointment. Only to
text: disappoint her now. One last time.
text: Hal turns to Hector, rage in his eyes --
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT'D)
dialog: Every memory she had of you is filled
dialog: with regret... the years wasted, waiting
dialog: for you. You never did a thing for her
dialog: until someone gave you that ring.
dialog: (eyes lighting up at the RING)
dialog: You don’t deserve all that power.
dialog: Without that ring, you’re not a hero.
dialog: You're barely even a man.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: (through his teeth)
dialog: Where. Is. She?
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Relax. She’s right here.
text: Hector glances over to that first Sabre prototype. GL’s eyes
text: go wide when he sees... Carol. In the translucent PAYLOAD of
text: the U-CAV. Trapped. Pounding on the soundproofed plexi.
text: Hector relishes the obvious pain on GL’s face.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT’D)
dialog: Now from what I’ve seen of your
dialog: childhood, you don’t have such a good
dialog: history with plane crashes.
text: Hector’s eyes close. The Sabre’s engines FIRE.

dialog: You're paralyzed. Get it?
dialog: (laughing, the point of it all)
dialog: Now you know what it’s like to be me.
text: The Sabre’s engines ready for take-off. GL steals a look
text: back at Carol. Their eyes lock. Sympathy. Regret.
dialog: GL can’t let her down. Not again.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: But you don’t know what it’s like to be
dialog: me. You want power? Real power? Just
dialog: let her go. And I’1l give you this.
text: He shows HIS RING. We fear for the choice he is making.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN (CONT'D)
dialog: This Ring can give you more power than
dialog: you knew existed. Its only limit is what
dialog: you can hold in your mind. And your mind
dialog: is a lot bigger than mine.
text: Hector’s eyes light up at the thought.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN (CONT'D)
dialog: With this you can do anything. Be
dialog: anything. You can kill me as many times
dialog: as you want. You can rule the world.
dialog: (a final bargain)
dialog: All you have to do is let her go.
text: Hector considers the shiny offer. The WHINE of the Sabre’s
text: engines MOUNTS. And finally -- SLOWING. It’s a deal.
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND
dialog: Fine. Take her...
text: In response, GL... removes his Ring. He opens his palm and
text: the Ring FLOATS UPWARD. Pulled towards Hector by his mind.
text: As the ring leaves Hal, GL’s uniform dissolves. And...
text: FOOM! THE SABRE TAKES OFF! With Carol still trapped inside!
text: (And before she could see GL’s true face.)
speaker_heading: HECTOR HAMMOND (CONT'‘D)
dialog: Sorry. I lied.
text: The ring flies to Hector’s hand. And the second it does --
text: Carol BLASTS into the sky. Off to her death.
text: Hector EXPLODES the GUIDANCE COMPUTER with his mind. Fear
text: fills Hal’s face as he watches his love recede into the sky --
text: he turns to see -- HECTOR -- as he --
text: PUTS ON THE RING!

dialog: He knows now what true power is.
text: A flick of his wrist and he makes the WALL EXPLODE with GREEN
text: LIGHTNING. Another and CRAGGLY CLAWED FINGERS (his version
text: of the Green Hand) RIP THE GROUND OPEN underfoot.
text: SOMETHING GROWS out of the Ring. RIPPING THROUGH THE GROUND
scene_heading: -- UP HIGHER -- THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE HANGAR -- A MASSIVE
text: CONSTRUCT -- Hector has the exultant look of a man just
dialog: named messiah.
text: As Hector’s mountainous creation grows... its spires begin to
text: CHANGE, MORPHING into TENTACLES. The entire construct’s
text: shape momentarily takes on the full form of
speaker_heading: LEGION!
text: IT FLARES! Twisting and writhing. The Ring’s power is too
text: much for Hector. There’s A FLASH OF WORRY on HECTOR’S FACE
text: as the energy becomes TOO MUCH FOR HIM. Hal grins.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I lied, too. You weren’t chosen.
text: Hector gets it now. He doesn’t possess the will to control
dialog: the Ring -- until finally --
text: The ENERGY SURGES BACK DOWN! Hector WAILS as all that energy
text: FIRES BACK AT HIM.
scene_heading: AN EXPLOSION OF LIGHT AND HEAT -- SEARING HECTOR!
text: And it’s all gone. Mangled, mutated Hector has fallen back
text: into his chair, twitching, cataplectic. And so he’ll stay.
text: Of its own accord THE RING zips off Hector’s finger and...
text: Flies right back into Hal’s hand.
text: CLOCK! Broome gives Hector a WALLOP, straight to the jaw.
speaker_heading: BROOME
dialog: That’s for making me rob a bank, asshole!

scene_heading: EXT. TARMAC - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: MOUNTAIN RANGE!
text: Hal looks around -- his eyes landing on something... and it
dialog: fills him with courage:
speaker_heading: AN F-16
text: waiting on the tarmac! Without a second’s hesitation, HAL
text: POUNDS FOR IT. TOM approaches, catching up --
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What are you doing? Use your ring!
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: There isn’t enough time to charge it!
text: She’s heading for the Maker Cliffs. It’s
dialog: gonna crash!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (as he climbs in the jet)
dialog: Stop it.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How?!
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I got the ride to figure that out.
dialog: But he doesn’t need a ring. Just aman. Still a hero. As
text: the canopy SLAMS SHUT --
scene_heading: EXT. SKY / INT. HAL’S F-16 - INTERCUT
text: Carol’s flying prison sweeps into view, a runaway train. Her
text: struggle muffled. She sees the CLIFFS coming up ahead -- her
text: fear doubles. She BASHES helplessly against the glass, as --
speaker_heading: HAL'S F-16
text: swoops down in pursuit. He’s caught up to the Sabre -- just
text: a few feet behind Carol now. Hal swerves his F-16 ahead --
text: TRYING TO CATCH IT IN HIS SLIPSTREAM AND FORCING A TURN --
text: but the Sabre presses on relentlessly, making its straight
dialog: line for
dialog: THE MAKER CLIFFS!
text: From back in the TOWER -- TOM comes on the HEADSET:
speaker_heading: TOM (FROM HEADSET)
dialog: Can you see her?
speaker_heading: HAL (INTO HEADSET)
dialog: I can’t move it. Shut it down!
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: TOM (FROM HEADSET)
dialog: The system’s blown! It won’t respond.
text: Hal tries again, BARRELLING over the U-CAV dangerously close,
text: trying to PHYSICALLY PUSH IT DOWN. But the Sabre is able to
text: maneuver out of every move Hal can think of. And the CLIFFS
dialog: are DEAD AHEAD! How the hell is he going to stop that thing?
speaker_heading: TOM (FROM HEADSET) (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s nothing you can do.
speaker_heading: HAL (INTO HEADSET)
dialog: I can’t let her die!
text: Hal fights panic. Ghosts of old deaths haunting him.
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (V.O.)
dialog: I’m pushing her to the runway. I can do
dialog: it!
text: ON HAL. Inspired by his father’s memory. There's still one
text: thing left. He races his plane in front of the Sabre --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Tom... What do you guess the blowback on
dialog: an ejector is?!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: A hundred feet easy at the speed you’re
dialog: flying!
text: PULLS a switch that ARMS A WARNING LIGHT. Tom reacts to what
text: he sees on his display. Hal's “plan.”
speaker_heading: TOM (INTO HEADSET) (CONT’D)
dialog: Hal? Nonono. You can’t do it! You’ll
dialog: hit the jet, you'll both die!
text: And without a single thought for himself, Hal YANKS a RED
text: LEVER. Hard. In an instant --
speaker_heading: MARTIN JORDAN (V.O.) HAL
dialog: I’m clear. Ejecting now -- I’m clear. Ejecting now --
text: THE COCKPIT CANOPY EXPLODES! HAL LURCHES UPWARD OUT OF THE
text: PLANE AND INTO THE SKY. HE JUST HIT THE EJECTOR SEAT!
text: In an instant Hal’s PARACHUTE deploys and entangles onto the
text: SABRE. He SLAMS PAINFULLY AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE SABRE.
text: CONTACT! Like he just jumped from one train car to another
text: only at 10,000 feet and nearing the sound barrier!
text: Hal pulls against the crushing WINDSHEAR up the ‘chute --
text: closer... His fingers SNAG the wing of the U-CAV. With
text: impossible effort, he PULLS himself up to the nose.
text: CAROL is POUNDING on the payload from the inside now.
text: SCREAMING. And then she sees him. HAL JORDAN. What the
dialog: fuck is he doing on her plane?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: Hal sees the CLIFFS AHEAD -- they are SECONDS away from
text: impact. He reaches for a PANEL on the top of the fuselage.
text: Digs in and... RIPS it open -- exposing a BUTTON. Which he
text: PUNCHES! THE PAYLOAD CANOPY goes FLYING! Hal reaches in and
text: pulls Carol up. Wind rips into them.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: HAL! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: SAVING YOU!
text: He grabs her, FALLING BACKWARDS! And --
text: THEY FALL.
text: Above them the Sabre speeds off ahead -- and --
text: EXPLODES INTO THE CLIFFS!
dialog: They may have been saved from that -- but they’re in FREE-
text: FALL. No Ring. No chute. Just Hal and Carol clutching each
text: other as they achieve bone pulverizing terminal velocity.
text: Tumbling in each other’s arms... The air ROARING... The
text: GROUND COMING UP FAST... Death is seconds away.
text: They hold each other tight. The wind to painful too speak.
dialog: But they don’t have to -- they both know it. They have loved
text: each other their whole lives. They love each other still.
text: Nothing left to do, they clutch each other even harder and...
text: They kiss. A lifetime's worth of love shared in the one
text: moment left before their deaths. The tenderest goodbye.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.)
dialog: All life is connected. By love, by hope,
dialog: by all the noblest instincts of the soul.
dialog: If ever a kiss embodied those noblest instincts... it is this
dialog: one. All that passion unbridled...
speaker_heading: SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: The power drawn from that connection is
dialog: what you see simply as “green.”
text: The Ring feels it first. It SHIMMERS -- DRAWING FROM ALL THE
text: POWER IN THAT KISS! The radiance spreads. Up his arm.
text: Brightening... the AURA REKINDLING, enveloping them BOTH...
text: his clothes recrystallizing back into... the uniform of:
scene_heading: THE GREEN LANTERN!
text: Recharged! Hal/GL and Carol are so lost in their embrace...
text: their kiss so long awaited... they don’t even notice
text: THEY'VE STOPPED FALLING.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
text: Hal/GL realizes. He looks to his Ring, which SHIMMERS.
text: Carol opens her eyes. And looks. Exhilaration replacing
text: terror as she sees it -- she’s being carried by the GREEN
text: LANTERN. BY HAL. The pieces fall together. Life changes.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (hits him)
dialog: I_knew it was you!
speaker_heading: HAL/GREEN LANTERN
dialog: Yeah, right.
text: He smiles, taking soft hold of Carol, and... FLYING across
dialog: the sky...
speaker_heading: HAL/GREEN LANTERN (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: How ‘bout we land in Paris?
text: The blue sky MATCH DISSOLVES into the blue curtain of:
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM
text: THE PRESIDENT is at the podium, addressing a standing-room
dialog: only crowd of MEDIA:
speaker_heading: THE PRESIDENT
dialog: My fellow Americans. The past days have
text: seen events so miraculous, they shatter
dialog: every conception we have about
dialog: ourselves... our world... our place in
dialog: Creation. We can look on these wonders
dialog: with fear... or we can find hope. A new
dialog: beginning. To provide answers and to
dialog: quell anxieties, I’d like to turn this
dialog: briefing over to Special Counsel to the
dialog: President... Mr. Alan Scott.
text: A weathered older man steps to the podium. A familiar face.
dialog: And, now, a NAME.
speaker_heading: PIPE / ALAN SCOTT
dialog: The President has given me the honor and
dialog: solemn responsibility of making this
dialog: announcement, one I suspect will be long
dialog: remembered.
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: We are not alone in the universe.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST CITY PIER - DAY
text: THE LANTERNS use their Rings to repair the widespread damage.
text: PEOPLE marvel at the sight of ALIENS on Earth. Tomar-Re
text: bristles his top fin, slightly offended.
speaker_heading: PIPE / ALAN SCOTT (V.O.)
dialog: For years now, we’ve known of a group of
dialog: extraterrestrials who patrol our universe
dialog: and keep it safe.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEW YORK - DAY
text: And we realize that we’ve caught up with our OPENING.
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT (ON ASTROVISION)
dialog: Impossible to imagine? No more
dialog: impossible than when Columbus suggested
dialog: the earth was round or when Copernicus
dialog: posited that it orbited the sun.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. OTHER CITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD - THAT MOMENT
text: People stare at the impossible news projected there as well.
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT (V.O.)
dialog: There are heroes out there. And now, one
dialog: of our own has joined them. One of us.
text: Now one of them.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON: GREEN LANTERN.
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: A Green Lantern.
dialog: Widen to REVEAL we're:
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND GOVERNMENT FACILITY - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Green Lantern walks with Scott down a long concrete hallway.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: Nice speech.
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT
dialog: I’ve known about the people you work for
dialog: since I was... younger than you. Ever
dialog: since, I’ve worked for the goverment.
dialog: Helping them get ready for a day just
dialog: like this... when this planet finds out
text: it’s just a tiny pebble on a very large
dialog: beach.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And people need to know it’1l be okay
dialog: when you’re gone.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: I haven’t said I was going anywhere.
text: Scott nods. Eyeing the Ring with a bit of... nostalgia?
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT
dialog: The Ring came to you, so that’s your
dialog: decision to make. But I’1l tell you
dialog: this: If I could do what you can do...
dialog: I wouldn’t stay here. I’d fly around
dialog: this Universe, seeing things no human's
dialog: ever seen... No one who wears one of
dialog: those belongs to any one planet. You
dialog: belong to the stars.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: i
dialog: |
dialog: |
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: (sensing, re: The Ring)
dialog: You've... worn it, haven’t you?
text: A long silence. Then, through the haze of smoke and memory --
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT
dialog: One like it, a lifetime ago...
dialog: (a sad smile)
dialog: But it wasn’t mine to keep. I wasn’t
dialog: chosen. Not like you.
text: A story for another day/movie. The gruff returns.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: What if there’s more trouble?
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT
dialog: I'll contact you. The same way I used to
dialog: contact your predecessor on occasion.
dialog: A knowing wink. Man, this guy is cool as shit.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: And Hammond?
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT
dialog: Hammond? I wouldn’t worry about him...
text: Pipe keys a pad to take them where they’re headed:
scene_heading: INT. SECURE FACILITY - CONTINUOUS
text: On a catwalk, overlooking the centerpiece of the facility: A
scene_heading: STADIUM-SIZED CONCRETE-LINED LAB. Filled with --
text: ROW AFTER ROW of RATS and MICE in cages. As we saw before.
dialog: Experiments. At the far end --
text: IN A SEALED CELL
text: HECTOR HAMMOND sits. Huge cranium, burned and shrivelled
text: body. Utterly grotesque. No sign of life behind his eyes.
dialog: Just another rat.
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT (0.S.)
text: He doesn’t do much anymore.
text: BACK WITH GL AND PIPE
text: Pipe offers GL his hand. And his advice:
speaker_heading: ALAN SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: The stars are waiting, Jordan. Don’t
dialog: screw it up.
text: GL reacts. Scott knows his identity.
speaker_heading: TOM (PRELAP)
dialog: It’s not fair.
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRIS AIRCRAFT - TARMAC - MAGIC
text: Hal, in uniform, stands with Carol and Tom. This is goodbye.
text: Floating a few thousand feet up are Sinestro, Tomar-Re and
text: OTHER LANTERNS. Tom stares a little too much.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You get to go off with them and I’m stuck
dialog: here. I can’t even play games with
text: aliens now, just seems like a rip off.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: I got a surprise for you.
text: GL FIRES his ring... into HANGAR 18. A RUMBLE and... ABIN’S
text: SHIP RISES OUT! The ship HOVERS on its own. Fixed. The
dialog: single greatest thing that ever happened to Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It's flying! I have a space ship! That
dialog: flies! Oh my god, I can visit you --
text: Tom hugs GL hard enough to hurt. Then makes way for...
text: Carol. Time for her goodbye. Not an easy thing.
speaker_heading: GREEN LANTERN
dialog: (to Tom)
dialog: Can I get a minute.
text: Tom moves to his hovering craft by the hangar. The Lanterns
text: in the sky fly off even higher. Into the upper atmosphere.
text: GL de-uniforms, suit shimmering back into clothes. Just Hal.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Do me a favor. Give my family a good
dialog: excuse why I left --
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (missing her already)
dialog: I could be gone awhile.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It’s okay. I’ll be here. Besides,
dialog: you're worth the wait.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: So are you.
text: And her lips meet his in a kiss that shows an understanding
text: words can’t. His Ring SHIMMERS with it. The SHIMMERING
scene_heading: BRIGHTENS, MERGING INTO... PURE SUNLIGHT...
scene_heading: EXT. EARTH'S ORBIT
text: The Sun shines unobstructed. Surely The Brightest Day, as...
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: Green Lantern comes up through the stratosphere. Where
text: Sinestro alone waits for him. Hal takes a longing look down
text: at the brilliant blue Earth. Sinestro senses Hal’s sadness.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: It is a beautiful planet.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: It’s everything I love.
speaker_heading: SINESTRO
dialog: (then)
dialog: If we train you well, there will be a
dialog: thousand planets you will love just as
dialog: much.
text: The promise of things to come. Of Adventure. Hal drinks in
text: the Earth. One last look.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Then let’s go see ‘em.
text: And with a smile... and an explosion of LIGHT...
text: Two GREEN STREAKS PAINT The Blackest Night...
dialog: And we end where we began.
text: IN GREEN.
dialog: End.
