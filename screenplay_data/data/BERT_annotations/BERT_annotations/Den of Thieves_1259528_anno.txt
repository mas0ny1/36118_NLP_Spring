text: Silence. Which is then broken by a coarse VOICE as it speaks
text: to us, in distinct Californiaese. The voice is that of an old-
text: timer. His words and tone bespeak a life lived hard,
text: illicitly, and unhealthily. And yet with joy. The sense one
dialog: gets is, he wouldn’t have had it any other way, that his path
dialog: through life, was chosen... By him.
text: Although we don’t see him yet, he is WILLY LUMP LUMP, 60s.
dialog: And he will tell us, tell SOMEONE, all they need to know.
speaker_heading: WILLY LUMP LUMP (V.O.)
dialog: ...to this day, when I just think of
dialog: robbing a bank, I get a boner. I get
dialog: butterflies... Now that’s love... See,
dialog: whatever it is you decide to do in
dialog: life, do it because you love it...
scene_heading: INT. CELL - DAY 1
dialog: And now we see him.
text: WILLY LUMP LUMP looks right at us. His is a face one doesn’t
dialog: forget. A face that inspires...articles, novels, movies. Like
dialog: the one we’re about to see.
speaker_heading: WILLY LUMP LUMP
dialog: .-.I fucken love robbing banks.
dialog: Unfortunately for me, it happens to be
dialog: illegal. That’s why I’m sitting here
dialog: talking to you. Kinda a bummer, but
dialog: then again, whatever...
text: A TITLE reads, “Federal Correctional Institute, Terminal
dialog: Island. San Pedro, California.”
speaker_heading: WILLY LUMP LUMP (CONT’D)
dialog: There are 5 rules to robbing a bank.
dialog: And that’s the first rule. Do it for
dialog: the love. For the doing of the thing.
dialog: Make it your masterpiece. Like Ali,
dialog: Ludwig Van, Musashi, Plato, Da Vinci.
dialog: Make it your Rumble in the Jungle, your
dialog: 9th, your Samurai Sword, your Apology,
dialog: your Mona Lisa... Don’t do it for the
dialog: money. Or because you’re pissed off at
dialog: the world and you wanna do the whole
dialog: bullshit whoop de whoop gangster thing,
dialog: and you wanna shoot somebody. Like
dialog: those whack job amateurs in North
dialog: Hollywood.

dialog: They had it going good for a while, but
dialog: then they fucked it all up because they
dialog: wanted to shoot it out with the cops,
dialog: because they probably couldn’t get any
dialog: ass and had small cocks. If mommy
dialog: didn’t treat you good, go start a fire
dialog: or some shit. But don’t rob a bank...
text: Willy takes a sip of his piping hot coffee. The coffee mug is
text: metal, and small. He wears an orange jumpsuit emblazoned with
text: black, faded block letters across it that read “FCI”.
text: In the unseen surrounding environs, the cold, reverberant,
text: hollow SOUNDS OF PRISON can be heard.
speaker_heading: WILLY LUMP LUMP (CONT’D)
dialog: Second rule, don’t do chump change.
dialog: Whether you steal 1 dollar, or 100
dialog: million, the length of your visit to
dialog: Hotel Federal Prison will be the same. So
dialog: when you pick your score, make sure it
dialog: don’t come with fries and a shake. Make
dialog: sure it’s so much goddamn money, stuffing
dialog: it in your pockets ain’t an option... The
dialog: third rule, once you got the money, don’t
dialog: spend it. Because remember, you didn’t do
dialog: it for the money. And if you spend it,
dialog: you'll run out. And if you run out,
dialog: you'll become a junkie. Because you’1l1
dialog: want more. And if you want more, you'll
dialog: make mistakes... Junkies come in all
dialog: shapes and sizes, not all of them Crack
dialog: Ho's...
text: Willy takes a drag from a cig. Doesn’t bother ashing. Old,
text: diffused tats dot his forearms. The thick black-rimmed
text: glasses he wears, “Mafias”, ID him as a convict of high
dialog: standing.
speaker_heading: WILLY LUMP LUMP (CONT’D)
dialog: The fourth rule. Prepare for the worst.
dialog: Because if shit don’t go according to
dialog: plan, which it won’t, and drama starts
dialog: popping off, which it will, you better
dialog: be down for the get down, homeboy...
text: Willy finally exhales. The VOICE of a younger man we do not
dialog: see, asks Willy the same question some of you may have.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What’s the last rule? You said 5.
text: Willy crunches his eyes, holds his hand up, annoyed.

text: The voice doesn’t respond. Willy takes another sip of his
text: coffee, savors it. In a rush, Willy isn’t.
speaker_heading: WILLY LUMP LUMP (CONT’D)
dialog: The last rule.
text: Willy takes a long drag from his cig, then exhales slowly.
speaker_heading: WILLY LUMP LUMP (CONT’D)
dialog: When you get caught, honky...
dialog: (waves cig back and forth
text: while slowly shaking his
dialog: head)
dialog: No sharing showers...

dialog: face.

scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - DAWN
text: High above the Los Angeles basin. So high, the city spreads
text: out below us like the Thomas Guide.
text: CAMERA PUSHES DOWN ON the VAPOR LIGHTS that line endless
text: boulevards. On the horizon, dawn approaches.
dialog: A TITLE reads, “2400 times a year. 44 times a week. 9 times a
dialog: day. Every 48 minutes, a bank is robbed here... This is the
dialog: real bank-robbery capital of the world..."
text: Only a few vehicles out this time of day. COME IN ON one of
text: them -- A BRINKS ARMORED TRUCK. It winds the barren streets.
text: TITLE reads, “Los Angeles”.
scene_heading: INT. ARMORED TRUCK - DAWN
text: Four Brinks employees inside. Two up front -- DRIVER,
text: driving, and MESSENGER, riding shotgun. The HOPPER and the
text: SWAMPER in back. Nextel radios perched atop their shoulders.
text: Sidearms issued to all. An AR-15 CARBINE slotted up front.
text: Nobody talks. Too early for that. The Driver struggles to
text: keep his eyes open. He starts to nod off, when the truck
text: swerves. Messenger hits his arm. Driver's eyes snap back
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 3
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Shit. Sorry.
text: The Armored Truck pulls into a parking lot. Messenger and
text: Swamper hop out. Driver and Hopper remain in the vehicle.
scene_heading: EXT. DONUT SHOP, GARDENA - DAWN
text: A TITLE reads, “Gardena. 5:14 am”. The only sound heard is
text: that of the TRUCK’S ENGINE IDLING.
text: ARMORED TRUCK’S POV -- Messenger and Swamper order, pay the
text: KOREAN GUY behind the counter inside.
text: ON DRIVER -- staring blankly ahead. Messenger and Swamper
text: exit, coffees and boxes of donuts in hand. Quiet still.
text: Driver’s hand reaches for the “unlock” button.
text: ON MESSENGER -- 10 feet from the Armored, hands full. Another
text: morning, another donut run. Same as every other day. Almost.
text: SOUNDS approach. ENGINES. Driver's hand pauses just above the
dialog: unlock button.
text: 2 SUV'S EMERGE FROM THE DARK, LIGHTS OFF, AND COME TO STOPS
text: TO THE FRONT AND REAR OF THE ARMORED, BLOCKING IT IN.
text: DOORS FLY OPEN AND MEN EMERGE -- 1 from the front SUV and 2
text: from the rear, their bodies covered in black BDUs and KEVLAR
text: BODY ARMOR, GAS MASKS COVERING FACES. THEY LEVEL SHOTGUNS
text: and HK ASSAULT RIFLES at the Brinks guys. These OUTLAWS move
text: in a precise military like fashion, covering fields of fire.
text: ON MESSENGER -- literally frozen in indecision. Tension
text: racking his body, HIS HAND GRIPS HIS JUMBO COFFEE TOO TIGHT.
text: His eyes go to the SIDEARM on his belt. Albeit unfortunate,
dialog: occasions like these do fit within the particulars of his job
dialog: description. He’s supposed to do something here. But can’t.
text: ON DRIVER -- fumbling with his nextel, frantic, can’t get the
dialog: words out fast enough -
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: (into nextel)
text: -3170!! WE’RE BEING HELD UP BEING HELD UP-
text: Hits a 911 BEACON in the dash, then suddenly can’t speak
text: anymore as a monster of a man, OUTLAW#1, RUSHES HIM, JUMPS
text: ONTO THE HOOD of the Armored.
text: ON OUTLAWS#2 and #3 -- rushing Messenger and Swamper, barrels

speaker_heading: OUTLAW #3
dialog: (to trembling Messenger)
dialog: Relax homes, we’re not here for you.
text: ON DRIVER -- looking up at Outlaw#l AIMING AN HK-416 RIGHT AT
text: HIM through the “bulletproof” window. God does he hope it is.
speaker_heading: OUTLAW#1
dialog: (muffled by the gas-mask)
scene_heading: ARMOR-PIERCING ROUNDS ARE CHAMBERED IN
text: THIS FIREARM. DO NOT BE THE IDIOT THAT’S
text: GOING TO FORCE ME TO PROVE IT! JUST HIT

text: Driver hesitates, quivering, foot an inch above the gas
dialog: pedal.
speaker_heading: OUTLAW#1 (CONT’D)
dialog: FUCKING DO IT!! Now!!
text: ON MESSENGER -- hand shaking violently, when he involuntarily
text: CRUSHES THE CUP OF COFFEE. The steaming hot liquid SPILLS ALL
text: OVER HIS HAND and leg. HE SCREAMS IN PAIN and makes an
dialog: untimely flinching motion--
text: BOOM. Outlaw#2 doesn’t hesitate. Messenger’s shoulder and
text: neck are blown apart. He drops. Donuts spill. Swamper
dialog: horrors.
text: DRIVER PUNCHES IT. SLAMS INTO THE FRONT SUV, GRINDS IT
text: FORWARD. OUTLAW#1 LURCHES FORWARD FROM IMPACT, spills onto
text: the Armored’s roof. He grabs for anything to hold on to.
text: ON OUTLAW DRIVER -- in the front SUV, trying in vain to peel
dialog: off. The Armored is too powerful.
text: ON OUTLAW#1 -- pulls himself back onto the hood. Gains
text: balance. AIMS THE HK INTO THE WINDSHIELD AND UNLOADS. The
text: high-pitched rounds are deafening. THE WINDSHIELD AND DRIVER
text: ARE OBLITERATED.
text: ON OUTLAW#2 -- bringing the butt of his shotgun across
text: Swamper’s jaw. Swamper collapses.
text: OUTLAW DRIVER hops out of the SUV with a SLEDGEHAMMER. He
text: jumps onto the Armored’s hood and SWINGS IT INTO THE ARMORED
text: TRUCK’S WINDSHIELD, CAVING THE WINDSHIELD IN.

speaker_heading: OUTLAW #1
dialog: (to Outlaw Driver)
dialog: Get in get in!!
text: Outlaw Driver slips through the windshield into the cab. Hits
text: “unlock”, PUSHES OUT THE BODY OF THE DRIVER.
text: Outlaws#2 and #3 rush the rear of the Armored, RIP OPEN THE
text: REAR DOORS. SMOKE BILLOWS out of the Armored. Inside,
text: Hopper’s ears bleed. He chokes violently.
text: Outlaw#1 hops in the Armored passenger seat. Outlaw Driver
text: throws the Armored into gear.
text: As Outlaw#2 drags Hopper out onto the pavement, 3 GARDENA PD
text: CRUISERS squeal to a halt in the middle of the street, 50
text: meters back. Doors swing open. UNIFORMED GARDENA COPS OPEN
text: FIRE WITH THEIR .9MM SIDEARMS.
text: The rounds ping off of the Armored and pavement. OUTLAW#2
text: SPINS TOWARD THE COPS, DROPS TO A SEATED-FIRING POSITION, AND
text: OPENS FIRE. Outlaw#3 drops his shotgun, presents his .45, and
text: UNLOADS HIS CLIP. Their HK rounds are deadly accurate,
text: ripping thru the Gardena PD Cruiser’s doors, DROPPING 1 COP.
text: Outgunned, the cops ball up for cover, don’t return fire.
speaker_heading: OUTLAW#2
dialog: LETS GO LETS GO LETS GO!
text: Outlaw#2 and #3 sprint for the SUV while the Cop’s gunfire is
text: suppressed. Suddenly, 3, 4 SHERIFF’S DEPT CROWN VICS RESPOND
text: ONTO THE SCENE, tires smoking as they brake to stops. COPS
text: JUMP OUT WITH AR-15 CARBINES, OPEN FIRE ON THE SUSPECTS.
speaker_heading: OUTLAW #1
dialog: THEY GOT CARBINES!!!
text: The high-velocity rounds ricochet and TEAR INTO THE SUV.
text: OUTLAW#3 IS HIT IN THE GROIN AND NECK AS HE TRIES TO JUMP
text: INTO THE SUV. He drops, scream drowned out by gunfire.
speaker_heading: OUTLAW #1 (CONT’D)
scene_heading: MOTHERFUCKER!
text: Outlaw#2 takes cover, desperate to reload, then returns fire.
text: A BLIZZARD OF ZIPPING LEAD FILLS THE DAWN AIR.

dialog: Den of Thieves February 6, 2016 Draft 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3) 4
dialog: If something isn’t done fast, they’1ll never get out of here.
text: So Outlaw#1 flips his HK 416 onto “full-auto”, hops out of
text: the Armored, WALKS DIRECTLY AT THE COPS, AND OPENS FIRE.
text: OUTLAW#1 PEELS OFF THE ENTIRE CLIP ON FULL AUTO, BLOWING UP
text: THE CROWN VIC WINDSHIELDS AND HOODS. SHELL-CASINGS bounce
text: off the street at his feet. A FEW ROUNDS THUMP INTO HIS
text: BODY ARMOR, EXPELLING THE AIR FROM HIS LUNGS. Clip done, he
text: drops it out, rips a fresh clip off his torso, pops it in,
text: and repeats. All in one fluid motion. Empties the next
dialog: clip.
text: The Cops return fire no more, pressed into the pavement.
text: Outlaw#1 turns, runs back in the Armored. Outlaw#2 TOSSES
text: SMOKE GRENADES INTO THE STREET, clouds the Cops visual,
text: cloaking their exfil, jumps into the SUV. BOTH THE ARMORED
text: AND SUV PEEL AWAY FROM THE SCENE.
scene_heading: INT. ARMORED TRUCK - DAWN
text: Outlaw#1 rips off his gas mask.
speaker_heading: OUTLAW #1
dialog: How the fuck those chase cars here?!!
text: This is RAY MERRIMEN, 38, and clearly the leader. His
text: muscular neck and ferocious demeanor belie great intelligence
text: that can be seen in those hard, icy blue eyes. He’s very,
text: very dangerous, yes. But not wild. Calculating. He keys a
text: Nextel “push-to-talk” phone:

scene_heading: EXT. HAWTHORNE STREETS - DAWN 7
text: The SUV rolls to a quiet stop in a RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.
text: OUTLAW#2 QUICKLY WIPES DOWN THE INTERIOR OF THE SUV WITH
text: WINDEX AND BABY-WIPES. POURS GASOLINE on the dash, steering
text: wheel and seats. Walks away from the SUV.
text: He peels out a CAR-KEY TAPED TO HIS CHEST, quietly sticks it
text: into the door of a nondescript TOYOTA MINIVAN parked there.
text: Hops in and drives off, unnoticed.
text: In the distance, SIRENS can be heard.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CRENSHAW BLVD. TUNNEL - DAWN 8
text: The ROAR OF THE ARMORED’S ENGINE REVERBERATES throughout the

scene_heading: INT. “PACIFIC HORIZON FREIGHT” 3PL WAREHOUSE - DAWN 12
text: Outlaw#2 and a TONGAN CARGO HARD shut the warehouse sliding

dialog: parks.
text: “Pacific Horizon Freight” is written on the warehouse wall. A

text: home to a 3PL, “Third Party Logistics”, shipping-freight biz.
text: The Outlaws are exhausted. No one speaks as they strip off
text: kevlar, gas masks, body armor, the mood tense. Around them:
text: stacks of empty pallets, shrink-wrapped freight, forklifts,
text: high-tech security equipment, radios, stripped cars, gas
text: cans, pvc piping, highway flares, a weight bench...

text: Their laptop Datong navigator, BO “BOSCO” OSTROMAN, 42. A

text: some faded military tat on his thick arms.
text: Lastly, the Outlaw Driver, DONNIE ALISON, 33, edgy white guy,
dialog: quiet-type, which are usually the most dangerous, just not in
dialog: this case. They don’t come much more intimidating than this.
text: Everyone wears SURGICAL GLOVES when handling the Armored.
speaker_heading: MERRIMEN
dialog: Checked for trackers?
dialog: (Enson nods “of course”)
dialog: Do it again.

speaker_heading: MERRIMEN
dialog: Why didn’t we know about the chase cars?
dialog: How did the call get through-
speaker_heading: ENSON
dialog: —-Ray.
text: All heads turn to Enson. No one usually speaks when Merrimen

speaker_heading: ENSON (CONT'D)
dialog: We knew the risks. Shit popped off. We
dialog: handled it... That’s it.
text: Merrimen doesn’t respond. Then to Bosco:
speaker_heading: MERRIMEN
dialog: Get back over there, see who responded.
dialog: Probably LASD. They’1ll supercede
dialog: Gardena... If it’s Major Crimes, we got

text: Bosco pulls on a hoodie, grabs a DIGITAL CAMERA, and leaves.
text: Merrimen and Donnie turn their attention to the Armored

text: engine. Merrimen runs his hands over the bulletholes:
speaker_heading: MERRIMEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Patch these up. Need it like new.
text: Donnie nods. Merrimen circles the truck, inspecting it

text: FLANAGAN, 41, white, cock-strong muscles, the kind that come
dialog: from genetics, not from doing a lot of reps on Cybex machines
text: at Bally’s. He’s sporting a Rolex, a bit of bling, couple
text: tats, got a shaved head a bushy ZZ-TOP style goatee, and the
text: bad skin that accompanies too many cycles of ‘roids.
text: Nick dumps Visine in his eyes while driving. Fast. Zips
text: through LA’s South Bay streets by braille, doesn’t bother
text: even peeking at the road ahead. All windows are down. He
text: breathes into his hand, checks his breath. Fumbles around his
text: glovebox for gum. Finds some, pops it in his mouth. He’s
text: doing a decent job pulling himself together, despite the fact
text: that he looks like he’s spent the last week on the dark side.
text: Nick dials down the radio as he turns onto a working-class
text: suburban residential street. Kills the lights and engine
text: before coasting quietly into a driveway, parks.
scene_heading: EXT. NICK’S HOUSE, REDONDO BEACH - DAWN 14
text: Nick takes his boots off, walks barefoot up to his house, a
text: single-story “modern” built in the 50's, typical of suburban
text: SoCal. Yet with nouveau upgrades -- fountains, marble columns
text: frame the front door, plexi-hoop court in back, and lots of
text: gangster’d-out land yachts parked on the lawn.
scene_heading: INT. NICK’S HOUSE - DAWN 15
text: The jangle of keys. But they don’t work. Nick tries in vain
text: to open the back pantry door. Opts to jimmy open a window
text: instead, crawls and squeezes his way through it. His clothes
text: catch and tear on something. He silently curses himself.
text: Tip-toes into the kitchen. It’s quiet and dark. Only a few
text: night-lights on. The house is home to a family, as kids’ toys
text: and baby stuff is scattered throughout.

text: Nick gingerly opens the fridge, bends down to see what’s on
text: the menu when a CRASHING SOUND shatters the quiet. He
text: cringes, squeezes his eyes shut. Then peeks down -- a HANDGUN
text: lies at his feet, fell out of his waistband.
text: He carefully picks it up, sets it on the counter with wallet
text: and keys. Listens in the house. All remains quiet. Phew.
text: He grabs a water, gulps it down while checking his cell. He
text: erases all “recent calls”, when he freezes. Gets a weird
text: feeling someone's there. Turns his head, and gasps. A WOMAN
text: SITS IN THE NEARBY DARK, WATCHING HIM. Nick clutches his
text: chest, sighs in relief.
speaker_heading: BIG NICK
dialog: Jesus Christ, babe, scared the shit out
dialog: of me! I might’ve shot you. Can’t do
dialog: that.
text: His wife, DEBBIE, late 30s, once hot and sweet, now jaded and

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh really? “That was SO hot"?
text: Nick sees the text he sent. To his wife. At 5am. Whoops. Nick

speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: You used to have such tight game...

speaker_heading: DONNIE
dialog: Ho!

text: plated handguns are piled on the table. Looks like they

text: interesting is the fact that they all have BADGES hanging

speaker_heading: MERRIMEN (V.O.)
dialog: This is where it all happens, where the
dialog: armored car companies deliver their

dialog: anywhere from 3 to 30 million each,
dialog: depending upon denomination. They're
dialog: passed onto the Fed employees who always

speaker_heading: MERRIMEN (V.O.)
dialog: The serial number of every bill in the

speaker_heading: MERRIMEN (V.O.)
dialog: But, there’s a hitch. When the Fed

dialog: thing they do is bring the notes into the
dialog: count rooms, and run the notes through
dialog: their counting machines. They're
dialog: accomplishing two things here. One,

dialog: sister SANDEE, South African pro golfer-type brother-in-law
text: RUUD, and her “DATE”, one of Ruud’s boys.
text: Debbie cranes her neck to see into the entryway, when she
text: almost faints. Her jaw drops as she mouths, “oh my God.”
text: And then he appears. History’s most uninvited guest. A
text: position that, at least in this instance, he relishes. Nick
text: stands in the middle of the kitchen, nodding hello to them
text: all. He sways a bit, reeks of saké. Debbie’s mouth still

speaker_heading: BIG NICK

speaker_heading: BIG NICK (CONT'D)
