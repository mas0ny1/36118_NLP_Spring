scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: A sign featuring the U.S. flag tells us that we're on the
text: premises of "R & D: IMAGINING OUR FUTURE".
text: STAN (twenties) waits. Nervously. A GUARD waits with him.
text: Stan taps instructions into his "Bee", a device he wears like
text: a wristwatch. STAN'S GUIDE (a hologram that is his
text: information interface with the world) pops up in front of
text: him, in the form of a SEXY BLONDE, who smiles seductively:
speaker_heading: STAN'S GUIDE
dialog: Hey Stan.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Messages?
speaker_heading: STAN'S GUIDE
dialog: Sorry, sweetie.
text: Stan taps his Bee, and she changes looks and voices as she
text: continues (he's scrolling through different versions of his
dialog: Guide):
speaker_heading: STAN'S GUIDE
dialog: How 'bout some music while you
dialog: wait? You love that new cut by --
text: A door opens. Stan taps his Bee; his Guide disappears.
text: 0 walks in. He's a male android who looks completely
text: human -- like an executive in a business suit: calm, easy,
text: self-assured -- except that he's quicker, sleeker, more
text: efficient. His (human) assistant, MANDY, accompanies him.
dialog: 0
dialog: Sorry to keep you waiting, Stan,
dialog: busy day.
text: 0 nods to the Guard, who leaves. Stan blurts out anxiously:
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Listen, I know I blew the last --
dialog: 0
dialog: We don't expect anybody to get it
dialog: right all the time, humans aren't
dialog: capable of that.
text: Stan isn't sure whether this is good or bad...
dialog: 0
dialog: Joke, Stan, loosen up. What we
dialog: look for is imagination, nobody
dialog: bats a thousand. I've got good
dialog: news: we're going to promote you.
text: Stan relaxes: maybe everything is okay.
dialog: 0
dialog: They're going to adjust your
dialog: retinal scan for security, Mandy
dialog: will fill you in. If you have any
dialog: questions, just give me a shout.
text: Mandy opens a door to an anteroom. Stan, heartened, goes
text: through the door. Smells something. Stops, panicked. Turns
text: back -- but the door slams shut.
text: A blinding red light flashes around the door frame.
dialog: 0
dialog: It's the smell that frightens
dialog: them, we need to work on that.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: (making a note)
dialog: Smells like X bombs -- that kind
dialog: of sensory-inspired fear is hard
dialog: to get rid of in us humans --
dialog: 0 smiles -- a smile that turns your blood cold. Mandy
text: realizes she's committed a faux-pas -- and is frightened:
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Sorry about that "us humans",
dialog: wasn't thinking.
dialog: 0
dialog: I'm not sensitive, you know that.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: I also know you want to be treated
dialog: as if you're like us.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE CITY - DAY
dialog: Welcome to America a few years from now. It doesn't look
text: very different from today. It's much more crowded -- large
text: buildings hunch up against each other, soaring shafts of
text: steam plume out of buildings and up from beneath the
dialog: streets -- but everything is organized, clean and
text: emphatically fun: more Disneyland than Blade Runner.
text: The busy masses of people are polite -- if very much in their
text: own worlds, occupied with their Bees and Guides.
text: They pay little attention to (if they notice at all) the bomb
text: sites everywhere. A cafe, a church, the whole front of a
dialog: building are all being repaired by efficient, partially
dialog: automated crews.
text: The destruction is hidden by temporary walls, onto which
text: (like the walls of all the buildings) is projected news,
text: entertainment and ads. It's all bright, upbeat and
dialog: distracting... like this ad:
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Upgrade to your new, free Bee 6.0
dialog: today and receive TwO THOUSAND
dialog: free credits, plus fifteen points
dialog: toward Premiere Status.
text: The Announcer morphs as people pass, their own Bees altering
text: the Announcer's look and voice:
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Bee 6 features SenseWorks, our
dialog: fresh new interface that makes it
dialog: easier than ever to change your
dialog: Guide. Don't like blondes? Gone.
dialog: Want your Guide's voice lower?
dialog: Your sense is our command. And
dialog: your own custom images and
dialog: vocabulary styles are easier than
dialog: ever to upload.
text: The Bee device in the ad morphs into a smiling honey bee.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Remember, we're your Bee -- but to
dialog: us, you're always A.
text: A BOY passes the ad. The bee winks at him. He pulls his
text: MOTHER's sleeve:
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: Mommy mommy, I want it --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
text: A WOMAN IN A LEATHER JACKET AND JEANS (TINA) puts a jar of
text: mayonnaise into her grocery bag and walks out of the store.
text: There's no checker; nowhere to pay. Instead, as she leaves,
text: her hologram Guide (a studly guy) pops up in front of her:
speaker_heading: TINA'S GUIDE
dialog: Yo Tina, that's thirty-six bucks,
dialog: twenty cents. Want to take that
dialog: outa your general account?
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Tina comes upon a BANK that has just been bombed. It's still
text: smoldering, workers are pulling out bodies, and sliding in
text: temporary walls to mask the devastation.
text: Tina is the only passer-by who stops and looks. Her studly
dialog: Guide tries to distract her:
speaker_heading: TINA'S GUIDE
dialog: This branch is closed, babe,
dialog: there's one at Main and Sixth.
text: Tina peers at the damage inside the bank. Smiles.
speaker_heading: TINA'S GUIDE
dialog: Hey Tina, I got real-time video of
dialog: Michael Jackson being released
dialog: from prison right this minute!
dialog: VIDEO of, yes, Michael Jackson getting out of prison is
text: projected from Tina's Bee onto a temporary wall as it is
text: fixed into place, blocking Tina's view of the bombed bank.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SEEDY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Tina passes a lamp-post. ZOOM INTO THE LAMP --
scene_heading: SURVEILLANCE VIDEO (FROM THE LAMP-POST)
text: Tina goes into the building.
scene_heading: INT. SEEDY APARTMENT - DAY
text: Tina walks into the microscopic one-room apartment. The only
text: window is blacked-out with aluminum foil, which is covered on
text: the inside with a something white and gooey.
text: Two other CELL MEMBERS (a MAN dressed as a GARDENER and a
text: TEENAGED BOY) assemble three bombs at the kitchen table.
speaker_heading: GARDENER
dialog: You get them?
text: Tina takes three metal vials of liquid out of her purse.
text: Hands one to the Gardener, another to the Teenager, and slips
text: the third into her pocket.
text: The Teenager starts to open his vial --
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Not now!
text: Rattled, the Teenager puts the unopened vial into his pocket.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: 0 strides in, trailed by Mandy. TWO ASSISTANTS who have been
text: arguing with each other immediately quiet themselves.
dialog: 0
dialog: So. Replacement for the brother
dialog: in the Holloway family.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: (jumping in quickly)
dialog: Hank Skinner --
text: The four walls come alive with surveillance video of HANK
dialog: (twenties; a normal, worker-bee, upwardly mobile guy -- or
text: that's what he wants to believe; underneath, he's intuitive,
dialog: creative, bright -- but he denies these qualities even to
text: himself, sensing that they are not useful, even suspect).
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: Smart, funny, loyal, hard worker --
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: He's risky, his parents were
dialog: revolutionaries -- members of the
dialog: so-called Free Republic.
dialog: 0
dialog: Do I detect sarcasm? They had the
dialog: right to call themselves whatever
dialog: they liked, it's a free country.
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: They engaged in illegal acts
dialog: against the State --
dialog: 0
dialog: And they failed, nobody remembers
dialog: anything about them any more, they
dialog: didn't engage the popular
dialog: imagination. Not surprising with
dialog: a name like "Free Republic".
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: (pointedly, to Second
dialog: Assistant)
dialog: Anyway, they're dead.
dialog: (to 0)
dialog: Years ago, car accident --
dialog: 0
dialog: That works for us.
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: Unless the apple doesn't fall far
text: from the tree.
dialog: 0
dialog: Any sign of revolutionary
dialog: sympathies?
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: Hard to say, he keeps his head
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: We'd know. I mean...
text: He gestures to the surveillance info that surrounds them.
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: But we don't necessarily know,
dialog: surveillance doesn't tell us
dialog: everything -- isn't that why we're
dialog: recruiting these people for R & D?
dialog: 0
dialog: It's about balance. You want them
dialog: to have initiative, be curious,
dialog: creative -- but not too much.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: And that's why Hank's perfect.
dialog: This was taken this morning --
text: The walls display SURVEILLANCE VIDEO shot through windows,
dialog: from satellites, etc. It's much better than back in 2004:
text: crisp and clear, if always from outside.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S APARTMENT - DAY (SURVEILLANCE VIDEO)
text: (A nice but miniscule apartment.) HANK, in his boxers, sits
text: beside his bed, drawing on a sketchpad.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT (0.S.)
dialog: Wait till you see this...
scene_heading: SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM ANOTHER ANGLE OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT
text: MOVES IN ON HANK'S SKETCH:
text: The sketch is of his girlfriend VAL, who is asleep in bed.
text: Looks just like her -- except that he has drawn her pregnant,
text: and she doesn't look it.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT (0.S.)
dialog: Val Abbott, they've been together
dialog: off and on since college, she
dialog: moved in for the first time five
dialog: months ago when she lost her job --
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT (0.S.)
dialog: Live-in girlfriend, that's a
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: 0 (0.S.)
dialog: Or something we can use.
text: Val wakes up. Hanks puts away the sketchpad -- but not quick
text: enough. She reaches for it. He holds it away. She thinks
text: it's a game, tickles Hank to make him let go of the pad:
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Come on, let me see --
text: She sees that he has drawn her pregnant. Freezes.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: How'd you know?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I just found out yesterday, I was
dialog: going to but...
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Not a good sign, is it? About us.
text: He forces a smile. Gets up and heads to the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Photos of Hank's sketches pop up on the wall screens. They
text: uncannily capture the subjects' moods, thoughts, secrets.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
text: He sees people -- perceives who
dialog: they are, what they want, what
dialog: they're hiding. Right up our
dialog: alley.
dialog: 
dialog: 0
dialog: Very promising.
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: But she's pregnant -- would he be
dialog: willing to leave her behind?
dialog: 0
dialog: He seems ambivalent, maybe we can
dialog: take advantage of that if we move
dialog: fast. Have we got a way into him?
text: INTERCUT WITH SURVEILLANCE VIDEO from the wall screens:
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S APARTMENT - DAY (SURVEILLANCE VIDEO)
text: One-room, puny (all the homes are claustrophobic). A sickly
text: man (DAVE SKINNER, thirty) stumbles from bed to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: Hank's older brother Dave. Only
dialog: sibling, no other relatives.
dialog: Neuroendocrine carcinoma. Stable
text: now but still suffers.
dialog: 0
dialog: He can't afford an SCI? And
dialog: neither, I suppose, can Hank.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
text: Neither of them are even close to
dialog: Premiere Status.
dialog: 0
dialog: That's a nice shiny carrot.
text: Other images are projected onto the wall screens: Hank at
text: work, at the gym; out to dinner will Val, on vacations, etc.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
text: Hank doesn't lose his cool.
dialog: Anything goes wrong, he sucks it
dialog: up and keeps everything under
dialog: control. Doesn't even vote --
text: seems politically indifferent. A
dialog: perfect citizen.
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: Or he's a revolutionary in
text: disguise, keeping a low profile.
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: There's no sign of that. Also,
dialog: he's a great match for the
dialog: Holloway family. He had a strong,
dialog: creative mother, a preoccupied
dialog: father, one sibling --
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: The Holloway matriarch is a
dialog: grandmother, not a mother, the
dialog: sibling is a sister, not a
dialog: brother --
speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: The psychological and emotional
dialog: dynamics match, the all bode well
dialog: for an easy adjustment.
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: I've got some troubling file
dialog: footage --
text: A new video file appears on a wall screen:
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT (SURVEILLANCE VIDEO)
text: Hank is out with some BUDDIES, among them DUANE. Different
text: sports games with odds tickers are broadcast on screens, as
text: the guys eagerly place bets with their Bees:
speaker_heading: HANK DUANE
dialog: Get it, get it away from -- Catch the ball you --
text: Duane's Guide, a NAKED BIMBO, pops up:
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DUANE'S GUIDE
dialog: Hey handsome, that dickhead Palmer
dialog: just lost you two hundred bucks.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You bet on Palmer? Palmer?
dialog: What's wrong with you?
text: He grabs Duane's arm, slips Duane's Bee off his wrist --
dialog: Hank taps
speaker_heading: DUANE'S GUIDE
dialog: Duane, your Bee's off!
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: I'll lose points -- !
dialog: some instructions into Duane's Bee --
speaker_heading: DUANE'S GUIDE
dialog: Hey stud, they just docked you
dialog: twenty Premiere points -- and you
dialog: were so close to Premiere status --
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: Hank come on, quit messing --
text: Hank points his Bee at Duane's bee. Laser communication
dialog: shoots between them --
text: Duane's bimbo Guide hiccups and rewinds, then giggles at him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUANE'S GUIDE
dialog: Ooo -- you just upgraded, sexy,
dialog: you're more massive than ever!
dialog: Welcome to Bee 6.0.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Your bet's erased. Check it out.
text: Hank slips the Bee back on Duane's wrist.
speaker_heading: DUANE
dialog: How'd you do that?
text: Hank makes sure nobody's watching, then whispers to Duane --

speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: Do we want those people working

speaker_heading: FIRST ASSISTANT
dialog: They're exactly the people we
dialog: need -- resourceful, imaginative --
speaker_heading: SECOND ASSISTANT
dialog: Anti-establishment? Maybe even
dialog: revolutionary? I know it's a
dialog: balancing act finding the right
dialog: kind of recruit, but we can't keep
text: erring in the wrong direction.

dialog: That's why I'm here -- androids
dialog: are much better equipped for risk-

text: Hank and Val grab breakfast, moving around each other with

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I got these chem-berries for you.
speaker_heading: VAL

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Don't worry about it.
speaker_heading: VAL

speaker_heading: VAL

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: These are sweeter.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: (diving in:)
dialog: I didn't tell you about... that I
dialog: was pregnant because I didn't want
dialog: it to be the reason. The reason
dialog: we split up or stay together.
text: Hank nods, pours ingredients into a blender.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I know you're scared, I'm scared,
dialog: too --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm not scared.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Hank -- let me in for once...
text: Hank turns on the blender. She turns it off.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: You know, the world won't come to
dialog: an end if you let me know how you
dialog: feel once in a while.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I don't feel things as strong as
dialog: you do --
text: He turns the blender back on. She speaks over it:
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I see you sketching -- you see
dialog: things, you feel things most
dialog: people can't -- how else could you
dialog: have known I'm --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: They're just drawings, they don't
dialog: mean anything.
text: She turns off the blender:
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Just cause your mother was an
dialog: artist and got in trouble --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: This has nothing to do with them.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Then what're you scared of?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm not scared. It's just -- the
dialog: only thing that's private any more
dialog: is how you feel, it's the only
dialog: thing that's all yours.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: (not what she wanted
dialog: to hear)
dialog: You want this baby? Otherwise...
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Otherwise what?
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: .» I don't know. Sanctioned
dialog: abortions are expensive.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Not like we don't have the money.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I don't -- I don't have a job, I
dialog: don't have an apartment --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You have here.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: Not if we split up.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You can stay here, I've got a job,
dialog: I've got money, we can do whatever
dialog: we want.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: . So what does that mean, you
dialog: want to? Get an abortion?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: VAL
dialog: I want to know what you want.
speaker_heading: HANK

dialog: steam? It's weird, nightmarish...
text: Alarmed, Hank rises, trying to peer through it. He slides
text: silently out of bed, treads carefully toward the kitchen --
text: A hand grabs his arm. Hank spins toward the intruder.
text: Through the fog, all he can see is a powerful man --
text: The man (REB) drags Hank to the stove, pushes Hank's head
text: down toward a pot of boiling water. Hank desperately
dialog: struggles to free himself --
dialog: 
text: But Reb is too strong -- he twists Hank's head so that Hank's
dialog: 
text: ear is right over the boiling water --
dialog: 
text: Hank furiously fights to get free --
text: Suddenly, Reb lets go of Hank's head -- but then he grabs
text: Hank's arm and holds it over the boiling water:
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: I'm not going to hurt you. Their
dialog: surveillance doesn't work through
dialog: steam -- I temporarily disabled
dialog: your earwig, now I'm going to do
dialog: your Bee.

speaker_heading: REB
dialog: I've only got a minute before
dialog: they're back online.

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: I don't have a name, I don't

text: Hank nods. Reb lets him go.
text: Hank lunges for the door. Reb grabs him. They struggle.
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: Listen to me, listen! Your job,
dialog: it's bogus, they're lying to you.
text: Reb gets Hank in a clinch:
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: You think your bank accounts just

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (floored)

speaker_heading: REB
dialog: Your brother's cancer, why do you

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: ...What're you saying? They
dialog: somehow spread his cancer so I'd --
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: They're going to tell you your
text: girlfriend is dead.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: what??
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: They're going to tell you she's
dialog: dead, it's the way they work, cut
dialog: you off so you have nobody but
dialog: your new "Family". They did it to
dialog: your predecessor, but he wouldn't
dialog: play along, that's why they

scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: I'm sure you must have a better

speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: (thinking out loud)
dialog: McMahon's is the fattest kind of

speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: I hope you're not vegetarian.

scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
text: Eyes in the back of her head.

scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON

scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON

scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: We need to get back to work ASAP.

speaker_heading: GILMAN

scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: My sainted father loved reading

speaker_heading: GILMAN

dialog: So, what? there's no terrorists?
dialog: Is that what you're saying?
dialog: There's bombs, killings every --
speaker_heading: REB

speaker_heading: HANK

dialog: Hank is taken aback: That's even weirder.
text: As the Police drag Tina off, Hank looks down at the sketch:
text: In his sketch, Tina is dead!
text: Hank, stunned, snaps his eyes back at the unopened jar of
dialog: McMahon's mayonnaise.
text: The penny drops. He's on his feet, stuffing the sketch in
text: his pocket, racing out the door, shouting into his earwig:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: O -- get me O.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOLLOWAY HOUSE FAMILY ROOM - DAY
text: Hank bursts in. Susanna, Gilman and Mrs. Jackson are quickly
text: flipping through wall-screen images:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I can't get O --
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: They're in operation mode --
speaker_heading: GILMAN
dialog: The bombs went off --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I was there when they arrested
dialog: Tina, she wanted to be arrested --
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Wanted to be...?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: She smiled --
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: Pleased the bombs went off --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No it was more than that -- the
dialog: mayonnaise, she didn't eat any
dialog: mayonnaise --
scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: Jesus, the fucking mayonnaise
dialog: again, what's wrong with you.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It blocks surveillance --
speaker_heading: GILMAN
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: HANK
text: Surveillance can't see through
dialog: it -- they've been eating it
text: nonstop, they're trying to hide
dialog: something inside themselves!
text: Susanna has brought up surveillance video of the diner arrest:
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: He's right, look, she smiles --
speaker_heading: GILMAN
dialog: Freeze and Xray --
text: The image of Tina FREEZES INTO AN XRAY IMAGE. Everything
text: looks normal.
speaker_heading: GILMAN
dialog: MRI it.
text: The image CHANGES TO AN MRI IMAGE, revealing Tina's soft
text: tissue and organs -- except for the area of her stomach,
text: which doesn't register on the image.
speaker_heading: GILMAN
text: Can't see anything of her stomach.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: The mayonnaise coated it --
scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: . She's a Trojan horse!
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: She wanted to be arrested --
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: -- so she could bring something in
dialog: her stomach to wherever they're
dialog: taking her.
text: Gilman has projected surveillance videos of the Teenaged Boy
text: and Gardener being arrested.
speaker_heading: GILMAN
text: Freeze and MRI.
text: Same thing: their stomachs don't register on the images.
text: O appears on the video hook-up:
dialog: 0
dialog: I received your images -- I've
dialog: been supervising the arrests and
dialog: interrogations --
speaker_heading: GILMAN
dialog: Where are they?
dialog: 0
dialog: The Federal Center. This is real
dialog: time surveillance:
text: Real-time surveillance videos appear: Tina, the Teenaged Boy
text: and the Gardener are escorted separately from their
text: individual cells by Guards down separate hallways:
scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: Where are they taking them?
dialog: 0
dialog: Arraignment.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Wait wait wait, they were arrested
dialog: separately, right?
scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: (thinking aloud)
dialog: -- taken to different cells, they
dialog: haven't been near each other since
dialog: they were arrested --
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: The kid, look, he's walking fast,
text: faster than his guard, like he's
dialog: rushing toward something --
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: HANK
text: The gardener's terrified -- but
text: she's smiling, smiling again!
dialog: Something's about to happen --
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: When they're all together --
speaker_heading: GILMAN
dialog: Interactive agents! They've got
dialog: something in their stomachs that's
dialog: going to interact when they get
dialog: together -- !
scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: That courtroom at the Federal
dialog: Center is a symbol of oppression
dialog: to these terrorist groups --
text: Hank pulls the sketch of Tina dead from his pocket, realizes:
speaker_heading: HANK
text: The bombs are inside them, blocked
dialog: from surveillance! They're a bomb!
scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: Together -- ! When they're all
dialog: together!
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: You've got to stop them before
dialog: they meet in the courtroom -- !
dialog: 0
dialog: (issuing an order:)
dialog: Federal Center: Stop the guards,
dialog: return prisoners to their cells --
text: They watch breathlessly as the Guards escorting the three
text: cell members separately stop, listening to their ear-pieces.
text: Suddenly, at the same time:
text: - The Teenaged Boy makes a run for the door to the courtroom.
text: His Guard tackles him.
text: - Tina knees her Guard in the groin. He slumps over,
text: releasing her. She runs toward the door to the courtroom.
text: He grabs her feet, bringing her down. She tries to crawl to
text: the door that is only a few steps away --
text: - The Gardener grabs the gun of his Guard, who is distracted
text: by the instructions he's listening to. The Gardener shoots
text: his Guard, and runs to the door to the courtroom --
dialog: 61.
text: The Gardener makes it into the courtroom -- but the other two
dialog: have been stopped.
speaker_heading: THE FAMILY
text: breathes a sigh of relief. It's over.
dialog: 0
dialog: You just saved hundreds of lives
dialog: and denied the terrorists a huge
dialog: symbolic victory.
speaker_heading: HANK
text: is congratulated by the Family. He can't help but be proud.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOLLOWAY HOUSE - HANK'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Hank is unpacking when Susanna comes in:
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: We just got the debrief. They had
dialog: swallowed chemical agents, they
dialog: would have mixed through the
dialog: air -- the charge would've taken
text: out a half-mile.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: The chemicals could mix through
dialog: their skin?
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Skin is porous...
text: She takes his hand. He tenses up.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: I don't bite.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (covering with a joke)
dialog: You're my sister.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: (seductively)
dialog: We're a very tight family.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What happened to Stan?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: He was promoted.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: To what?
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: (dare she tell him
dialog: the truth?)
dialog: . To Glory.
text: She leaves.
text: Hank lifts a photo of Val out of his suitcase. He's startled
text: to find something taped to the back of it:
text: It's a business card, for the MIDTOWN SAUNA.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 0 (V.0.)
dialog: (in Hank's earwig,
dialog: startling Hank)
dialog: Could you step into the family
dialog: room, please, Hank?
text: Hank slips the business card into his pocket.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOLLOWAY FAMILY ROOM - DAY
text: Video and photos of the Family's new assignments fill the
text: wall screens as O briefs them via video hologram:
dialog: 0
dialog: -- with this chip and wiring
text: implanted in a paraplegic's brain,
text: he can move his prosthetic arm by
dialog: just thinking about it.
scene_heading: MRS. JACKSON
dialog: Surveillance of the research
dialog: facility doesn't show who stole
dialog: the chip?
dialog: 0
dialog: The chip wasn't stolen from the
dialog: facility -- it was stolen from the
dialog: subject of the experiment --
text: Video of a dead paraplegic whose head has been sliced open.
dialog: 0
dialog: -- at a time when he was off
dialog: surveillance. We've upgraded our
dialog: systems so they can see through
dialog: condiments, but we still have a
dialog: problem with steam.
dialog: 63.
text: Hank fingers the business card for the Sauna in his pocket.
dialog: 
dialog: 0
dialog: We need you to tell us what uses
dialog: terrorists might make of the
dialog: chip -- that should help us find
dialog: the people who stole it.
speaker_heading: GILMAN
dialog: They could build an army of robots
dialog: controlled by thought, which can't
dialog: be traced --
dialog: 0
dialog: Yes, that's an application we have
dialog: envisaged. But what uses might it
dialog: have in the hands of evil-doers
dialog: that we haven't imagined?
text: The Family kicks into gear, pulling up video, etc.
dialog: -- except
text: for Hank, who shoves the sauna card deeper into his pocket:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'd like to take a couple of hours
dialog: off -- I'm not really useful
dialog: unless I "get involved" with the
dialog: subject, right? And since you
dialog: don't know who the subject is
dialog: yet...
dialog: 0
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: We know how to find you.
text: Hank heads for the front door --
dialog: 0
dialog: Hank -- how did you know about the
dialog: mayonnaise?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (covering alarm)
dialog: . What?
dialog: 64.
dialog: 0
dialog: McMahon's Mayonnaise -- how'd you
dialog: know it was impenetrable to
dialog: surveillance?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I didn't know, I figured it out.
dialog: 0
dialog: Pretty big leap.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: . That's what you hired me for.
text: He leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MIDTOWN SAUNA - DAY
text: Hank, wearing a towel around his waist, pads through the
text: sauna, not sure what he's looking for.
text: He heads into the steam room...
scene_heading: INT. STEAM ROOM - DAY
text: Hank sits in the steam room with a couple of other guys in
text: towels. The steam gets thicker and thicker -- the other guys
text: get uncomfortable and leave one by one.
text: Finally, Hank can't take it. He heads for the door -- to
text: find REB suddenly beside him, in a towel, carrying a gym bag:
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: For what? Stopping three of your
dialog: comrades?
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: They weren't our comrades. They
dialog: were blood-thirsty murderers.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: And you're better than that.
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: There are many groups working
dialog: against the State who want to
dialog: create fear and terror so that
dialog: they can rule.
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: REB (cont'd)
dialog: They would overthrow one set of
dialog: tyrants for another. We're the
dialog: only group fighting to turn this
dialog: country back to the people. we
dialog: don't believe in symbolic
dialog: violence --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No, you like your murders more
dialog: specific -- like Val.
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: I told you, she isn't dead.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: How do you know that? Cause your
dialog: group or whatever the hell you
dialog: are, you're the ones holding her?
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: No. But we can help you find her.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: That's what you got me here to
dialog: tell me? Bring her to me, then
dialog: we'll talk.
dialog: Hank gets up to leave --
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: Your parents believe in our cause.
dialog: That stops Hank:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Believe? You mean, believed.
text: Reb doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: My parents are dead.
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: I was with your father when he was
dialog: killed --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: They died in a car accident --
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: He died fighting for the cause.
text: Reb reaches into his gym bag:
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: She didn't want to do this --
text: Hank eyes on Reb's hands -- what's he taking out of the bag?
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: You knowing that she's alive makes
dialog: it more dangerous for all of us...
text: Reb hands Hank an old, much treasured folded piece of paper.
text: Hank, his hands trembling, unfolds it...
text: It's a child's finger-painting of a sunflower.
dialog: 
text: Hank cuts his eyes, misty from steam or tears, up to Reb:
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: Our group has a name: We are the
dialog: resistance fighters of The Free
dialog: Republic.
speaker_heading: OFF HANK --
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT.
dialog:
