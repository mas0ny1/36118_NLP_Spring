speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: When it runs again, I’1l just jump
dialog: in and get back to my life--
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: --You can’t let them run it. I’m
dialog: supposed to destroy it so it never
dialog: runs again or everyone’s gonna die--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: --Or everyone’s going to die. That
dialog: is what they always say.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: But there’s always a little bit of

dialog: that’s when I do my best work.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Aren’t you going to need this?
dialog: Miles produces the goober.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Ah you have a goober. Give it.
text: Peter reaches out. Miles holds it back.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (holding it back)
dialog: Wait, no. Not so fast. He called it
text: an override key.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There’s always a bypass key, a
dialog: virus key, a who-cares key I can
dialog: never remember so I just call ita
dialog: goober. Give it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I need it to destroy the collider.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I need it to go home!
text: Miles puts it in his mouth.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: No! I‘’1l swallow it, don’t play
dialog: with me!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
text: Peter starts to walk again, knowing he’ll provoke a response.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: I said--
text: Without even looking at Miles, Peter nonchalantly webs the
text: goober right out of Miles mouth.
speaker_heading: MILES (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: The collider created a portal that
dialog: brought me here. And I have to g--
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Did you break this?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No, it... broke. I don’t remember
dialog: what happened.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: This is why I never had kids, this
dialog: is why I never did that.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Can’t we make another one?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, we can't do anything. Thanks to
dialog: you I have to re-steal what your
dialog: guy stole from Alchemax and make
dialog: another one of these.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Look, if I don’t turn off the
dialog: collider after you leave, everyone
dialog: in this city, my parents, my uncle,
dialog: and millions of others will die,
dialog: and you're just gonna go home and
dialog: leave me here to figure this out
dialog: for myself? You good with that,
dialog: Spider-Man?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah.
text: Peter walks away over the top of the building and disappears
dialog: from sight.
text: Miles, utterly defeated sits down on the wall. With his head
text: in his hands.
text: Peter peeks his head back over the ledge. Not so far below
dialog: the surface is the guy who used to care, but...
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Making you feel guilty. Is it
dialog: working?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How could it, no-- Look at me, does
dialog: it look like it’s working? No
dialog: it’s.. no it’s... ohhhh...
dialog: (screaming into his
dialog: jacket)
dialog: Ahhh!!! No! No! Do not let him win!
text: Miles raises his head up to see Peter walk back towards him.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright kid you win.

dialog: (the check arrives)
dialog: You have money right? I’m not very

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: The other Peter--
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You got any Spider-Man tips you can
dialog: tell me now?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah I got plenty. Disinfect the
dialog: mask. You’re gonna want to use baby
text: powder in the suit, heavy on the
dialog: joints. You don’t want any chafing,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nope, that was everything.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I think you’re going to be a bad

speaker_heading: PETER
text: Mhmm.. Look up where Alchemax is.
speaker_heading: MILES

scene_heading: INT. VISIONS ACADEMY - MILES’ DORM - EVENING

speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN NOIR

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: JEFFERSON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JEFFERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Look call me when you can, ok? I

speaker_heading: GWEN

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Well, Einstein said time was

speaker_heading: GWEN

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Yeah yeah right...
text: Peter looks down and hesitates. HE’S SCARED TO GO--

text: Peter look down to see Kingpin has left the observation room
text: and is now leap-frogging his way across buildings towards
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: KINGPIN
dialog: You’re not going ANYWHERE!
text: Peter assesses the situation.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'll hold him off, you shut this
dialog: down!
text: Peter jumps away from the panel, going towards Kingpin. Miles
speaker_heading: is SURPRISED.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Peter, that wasn’t the deal!
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Push the green button! Do not wait
dialog: for me!
text: But Peter is LEAPING AWAY ALREADY, SWINGING, when A WEB STOPS

speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Peter, you gotta go home!
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s OK.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Yeah, it is ok.
dialog: 119.
text: Miles DROP KICKS Peter and holds him suspended over the

speaker_heading: MILES (CONT’D)
dialog: (with empathy)
dialog: You gotta go home man.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (suddenly sad and scared)

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You won't.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Right. It’s a leap of faith.

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Kingpin!

speaker_heading: MILES (CONT’D)
dialog: Nope! Sorry. That’s cheating!

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Oh no...
speaker_heading: KINGPIN
dialog: Not so easy doing it on your own is

speaker_heading: KINGPIN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KINGPIN
dialog: Vanessa it’s me. You know me!
speaker_heading: VANESSA 5
dialog: ...we’re leaving now.
text: Vanessa and Richard are frightened. They don’t recognize

text: through the door behind them.
speaker_heading: KINGPIN
dialog: Don’t go! Stay with me! Please!
text: Kingpin reacts and runs after them, dropping Miles. He enters
text: the train car and finds it empty... his family has gone back
dialog: into the multiverse.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN
text: Miles climbs out of one of the windows and onto the side of
text: the speeding train. He looks around and locates the panel. He
text: is about to web away when Kingpin BURSTS through the side of
text: the train and lands in front of Miles. He’s LOST EVERYTHING,
text: but he’s not losing the fight.
speaker_heading: KINGPIN
dialog: You're not stopping this. Not

text: standing, unsteady but still dangerous.
text: Kingpin and Miles square off, two exhausted boxers. Kingpin
text: suddenly reaches out.
text: He brutally shoves Miles to the ground. Miles rolls away and
text: tries to get up. He’s hurt. He looks up and sees Kingpin

text: Miles smashes into the ground, tries to get up and slips.
speaker_heading: KINGPIN
dialog: The real Spider-Man couldn’t even
