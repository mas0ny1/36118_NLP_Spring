text: An old Packard coup√© pulls up to a roadside gas pump. Two
text: men get out and stretch their legs. The older man, Charlie
text: Burns, a balding, desiccated man in his mid-forties, shambles
text: toward the bar across the street. Eddie Felson remains behind
text: to speak to the attendant.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Yes sir?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I think I got a little grease in
dialog: this lining here.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Oh yeah. Well, it will take me about
dialog: thirty minutes to check it. You want
dialog: me to fill her up too?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah. You better check the oil too.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Yes sir.

scene_heading: INT. ARMSTEAD'S BAR - AFTERNOON
text: Armstead's is a typical small town pool hall. It has a bar,
text: a short order counter, a skee-ball machine, and pool tables
dialog: for small, friendly games. The few people in Armstead's this
text: day are not playing; they sit and read the papers. Charlie
text: and Eddie are at the bar, drinking straight bourbon.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Boys just passing through?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Pittsburgh?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Mm hmm.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Comin' in or goin' out?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Goin' in. We got a sales convention.
dialog: Gotta be there tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What do you guys sell?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Druggist supplies. Buster here is
dialog: gonna get an award.
text: (Eddie scoffs, as if
dialog: embarrassed)
dialog: No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks'
dialog: worth of stuff last month. Fastest
text: boy in the territory.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey,
dialog: give us another round, will ya? One
dialog: for him, one for yourself.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving.
dialog: Late afternoon is better. You guys
dialog: have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh
dialog: in two, maybe three hours.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Hey, he's right!
dialog: (eyes the unused pool
dialog: table)
dialog: Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a
dialog: little pool? Wait out the heat?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: It's gonna cost ya money. It always
dialog: does.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab
dialog: yourself a cue.
text: Charlie rises from his barstool.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Good thing he can afford it.
text: Eddie is already at the table.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to the bartender)

scene_heading: INT. ARMSTEAD'S BAR - TIME LAPSE
text: The game is in mid-progress. It's Eddie's shot. He downs his
text: bourbon, weaves a bit, bends over the table, and awkwardly
text: pokes at the white cue ball with his stick, missing an easy
text: shot. Several more townspeople have come in from the street
text: and are following the play. The bartender refills the glasses
text: as soon as they are emptied.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You miss again, you lose again.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (at the bar)
dialog: What's the kid in hock for so far?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: About sixty, seventy bucks.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (racking the balls,
dialog: to Charlie)
dialog: Next game, ten bucks.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Nice lookin' boy. Clean-cut. Too bad
text: he can't hold his liquor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ARMSTEAD'S BAR - TIME LAPSE
text: Two balls lay side by side on the table. Eddie peers at them,
text: trying to figure his shot, blinking his eyes to focus better.
text: Some of the onlookers seem skeptical. But Eddie pats the
text: corner pocket confidently, leans over, and raps out his shot.
text: The ball banks in.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I made it, boy! I finally made it!
dialog: C'mon, pay up. Pay up, sucker.
text: He pounds his pal Charlie on the shoulder and collapses into
text: a nearby chair.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You ought to take up crap shooting.
dialog: Talk about luck!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know what I mean. You couldn't
dialog: make that shot again in a million
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set
dialog: 'em up the way they were before.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they
dialog: were before. Bet ya twenty bucks.
dialog: Make that shot just the way I made
dialog: it before.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nobody can make that shot and you
dialog: know it. Not even a lucky lush.
text: Stung, Eddie lies across the table and sets them up himself.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How's that?
dialog: (to the bystanders)
dialog: Hm? Is that the way they were before?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yeah, that's right.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: C'mon, put it up.
text: They toss their money on the table, and Eddie shoots, but
text: his shot is too hard and his ball leaps over the side of the
text: table. The bartender cannot contain his staccato laughter.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em
text: up again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (putting up his cue)
dialog: You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet
dialog: ya any more.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Whaddya mean?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let's get back on the road. You gotta
dialog: be at that convention in the morning.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Up the flagpole with the convention.
dialog: C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now.
dialog: I got my money on the table.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't want it.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I'll try you.
text: Eddie pauses, smiling.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well... well, now.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more
dialog: money on that damn fool shot.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm
dialog: a little drunk, and I'm loaded on
dialog: the hip, and you just want in, real
dialog: friendly, while the money's still
dialog: floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set
dialog: 'em up.
text: Sheepishly, the bartender replaces the balls in their original
dialog: positions.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: All right, you want some easy money,
dialog: huh? Here's a hundred and five
dialog: dollars. That's one week's commission.
dialog: Now you want to take the whole thing,
dialog: and then you get a crack at your
dialog: easy money.
speaker_heading: BYSTANDER
dialog: I'll take a piece of that action.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (viciously)
dialog: No. I want him.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I'll take it out of the till.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: I'll meet you in the car, chump.
text: Eddie chalks up his cue, waiting impatiently for the bartender
text: to return with the money from the cash register. Then he
text: downs his drink and quickly strokes out his shot, the ball
text: banking crisply and directly into the corner pocket. There
text: is a cocky leer on his face as he reaches for the dollar
dialog: bills.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON
text: The door of the Packard coupe slams shut. Eddie Felson holds
text: up his stuffed billfold for his pal, Charlie Burns, to see.

speaker_heading: QUICK FADE:
scene_heading: MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE
scene_heading: INT. AMES POOL HALL - MORNING
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Henry, the elderly Negro janitor, draws up the Venetian blinds
text: to let the early morning light flood into AMES POOL HALL.
text: Henry is the janitor of Ames, the sexton of this immense,
text: shabby cathedral of pool, in which the pews are pool tables
text: covered with oilcloth slipcovers and the great vault of a
text: room is lit by brass-and-globe chandeliers. Henry ambles
text: through Ames righting overturned ashtrays and replacing
text: yesterday's abandoned cue sticks. The cashier enters. He
text: looks at his watch, then checks his time against that of the
text: clock on the wall.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Morning, Henry.
text: Henry nods, then steps up on a stool to fix the minute hand
text: of the clock. It now stands at ten o'clock.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. AMES POOL HALL - DAY
text: It is twelve-thirty when Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns first
text: enter into Ames. Only one table is in use; the hall is empty.
text: In Eddie's hand is his leather cue case. They stand before
text: the swinging doors and look around.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: It's quiet.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, like a church. Church of the
dialog: Good Hustler.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Looks more like a morgue to me. Those
text: pool tables are the slabs they lay
text: the stiffs on.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
text: They saunter over to the cashier's cage. A sign on the brass
text: bar reads NO GAMBLING ALLOWED...
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Any table?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Any table.
text: Eddie's arrival is noted by Big John and Preacher, a gambler
text: and an addict, who hang out at Ames at all hours, waiting
dialog: for action.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to the cashier)
dialog: No bar?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (with some annoyance)
dialog: No bar, no pinball machines, no
text: bowling alleys. Just pool. Nothing
dialog: else. This is Ames, mister.
text: Eddie takes his cue ball from the cashier's cage and heads
text: for a table.
text: As he passes Charlie, he mimics the cashier wickedly:
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: This is Ames, mister.
text: The two go to a table. Eddie selects a house cue, then rolls
text: it over the table top to test the roll. He seems pleased. He
text: runs his hand over the green felt as if he were caressing
text: it. His last test is to sweep the cue ball into the corner
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Nice clean pocket drop.
text: Eddie takes some balls out of the return box and throws them
text: on the table.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (chalks his cue)
dialog: How much am I gonna win tonight? Hm?
text: Charlie doesn't reply. But Big John and Preacher lean forward
text: in their chairs to listen in.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand
dialog: in one night.
text: (Charlie stares at
dialog: him)
dialog: ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon,
dialog: Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom
dialog: is there in the country where a guy
dialog: can walk out with ten grand in one
dialog: night? Jeez, you know, I can remember
text: hustling an old man for a dime a
dialog: game.
text: Big John, stubbly cigar between his fingers, drifts over to
text: their table.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Eddie, off Big
dialog: John)
dialog: You got company.
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: (approaching Eddie)
dialog: You looking for action?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Maybe. You want to play?
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Who's he?
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: What's your game? What do you shoot?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You name it, we shoot it.
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: Look, friend, I'm not trying to
dialog: hustle. I don't never hustle people
text: that walk into poolrooms with leather
dialog: satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot
dialog: straight pool. You got any straight
dialog: pool shooters in this here poolroom?
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: What kind of straight pool game you
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: The expensive kind.
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: Come up here to play straight pool
dialog: with Minnesota Fats?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, that's right.
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: Want some free advice?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (interrupts, sourly)
dialog: How much'll it cost?
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: (turns to Charlie)
dialog: Who are you -- his manager, his
dialog: friend, his stooge?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: He's my partner.
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: You well-heeled, partner?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We got enough.
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: Go home. Take your boy and go home.
dialog: Fats don't need your money, there's
dialog: no way you can beat him. Nobody's
dialog: beat him in fifteen years. He's the
dialog: best in the country.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You got that wrong, mister. I am.
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: Okay, I told you what I wanted about
dialog: Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead
dialog: and play him, friend.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Just tell me where I can find him,
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: BIG JOHN
dialog: Comes right in this poolroom every
text: night, eight o'clock on the nose.
dialog: Just stay where you are. He'll find
dialog: you.
text: As Big John walks off, Eddie smiles at Charlie.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. AMES POOL HALL - NIGHT
text: Eight sharp. A departing customer holds the door for an
dialog: incoming one:
text: Minnesota Fats. Heads turn when he makes his punctual
dialog: appearance.
text: Fats' clothes reflect his high station at Ames Pool Hall: a
text: gray felt bowler hat, and an expensive, tailored overcoat,
text: with a carnation in its lapel and two silk handkerchiefs
text: peeking up from its breast pocket.
text: He moves like a sultan through the room, past Big John, whose
text: eyes dip significantly, and over to the coat rack, where
text: Henry respectfully takes his coat and hat. The buzzard-like
text: eyes of the cashier direct his gaze toward Eddie's table.
text: Fats withdraws a cigarette from his gold case, then casually
text: strolls toward Eddie's table standing apart and quietly
text: observing the sharp, precise movements of his prospective
text: opponent. Even though Ames is filled with players, there is
text: little noise other than the clicking of pool balls.
speaker_heading: MINNESOTA FATS
dialog: You shoot a good stick.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Thank you. Gee, you shoot straight
dialog: pool, mister?
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Now and then. You know how it is.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats,
dialog: aren't you? You know, uh, they say
dialog: Minnesota Fats is the best in the
dialog: country out where I come from.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Is that a fact?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say
dialog: that old Fats just shoots the eyes
dialog: right off them balls.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Where do you come from?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: California. Oakland.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: California? Is your name Felson?
dialog: Eddie Felson?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: I hear you've been looking for me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah. That's right, too.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Big John! You think this boy is a
dialog: hustler?
text: Fats and Eddie regard each other with amusement, sharing the
text: private joke of pool hustlers.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble
dialog: money on pool games?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fats, let's you and I shoot a game
text: of straight pool.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Hundred dollars?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats.
dialog: I mean, that's what everybody says,
dialog: you shoot big-time pool. Let's make
dialog: it two hundred dollars a game.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Now I know why they call you Fast
dialog: Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of
dialog: talk...
dialog: (moving to the main
dialog: table)
dialog: Sausage! Rack 'em up!
text: At his command, Ames comes to life. Players drag their chairs
text: across the floor and position them around the main table.
text: Eddie, hand to his mouth, realizes that the big moment has
text: arrived and beckons to Charlie for his leather cue case. The
text: uniformed maids withdraw the cover off the green felt top,
text: and Sausage, the racker, begins to bang the balls into the
text: wooden racking triangle.
text: Fats is in the washroom, scrubbing his hands and nails. Eddie
text: stands and screws together his inlaid, ivory-pointed cue as
text: Fats dries his hands. He and Fats eye one another.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fast and loose, man.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: In the gut, I mean.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I feel tight -- but good.
text: Henry helps Fats on with his coat. Sausage finishes racking.
text: Fats carefully extends his palms so that Henry may sprinkle
text: on some talcum powder. They are ready to start. Fats,
text: immaculate in jacket and tie, tosses a wad of bills -- his
text: stake money -- onto the table. Charlie does the same, counting
text: the bills out one by one.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: (off the cash)
dialog: Willie, hang onto that.
text: Willie takes the money. Two balls are rolled to the end of
text: the table, and Fats and Eddie, like two duelers, prepare to
dialog: shoot for the break.
text: In the silence of the room, they bend over their cues and
text: softly stroke out their shots. The balls roll down the table,
text: bank off the far shoulder, and slowly return toward the two
text: players. Fats' ball hits the closer shoulder.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: You break.
text: The balls are returned and Eddie makes his break shot, a
text: glancing blow that leaves the pack of balls nearly intact
text: and the white cue ball lying far away at the end of the table.
text: Eddie looks up, with a smile.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Didn't leave you much.
text: Fats walks around the table and peers at the balls.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: You left enough... six in the corner.
text: Placing his cigarette on the wooden rim of the table, Fats
text: rams the cue ball into the pack, dropping the six ball into
text: the pocket. The table is now his. Eddie sits down unhappily.
text: Fats plays quickly, moving from shot to shot with studied
text: authority, his eyes and hands working fluidly together.
speaker_heading: FATS
text: Fifteen in the corner...
dialog: (shot goes in)
text: Ace in the side.
text: The shot goes in. As Eddie watches, the prancing, elegant
text: Fats maneuvers around the table.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Eight.
dialog: (shot goes in)
dialog: Ten...
dialog: (shot goes in)
dialog: Eleven.
text: The shot goes in.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (whispers, to Charlie)
dialog: Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat
dialog: man. Look at the way he moves. Like
dialog: a dancer.
speaker_heading: FATS
text: Twelve. Cross side.
text: We see Fats' bejeweled fingers curl around the cue stick,
text: the stick then darting out to send a ball caroming off a far
text: bank and into a side pocket.
speaker_heading: EDDIE (O.S.)
text: And them fingers, them chubby fingers.
dialog: And that stroke. It's like he's, uh,
text: like he's playing a violin or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Nine ball.
dialog: (shot goes in)
text: Three ball.
text: Fats keeps sinking shots.

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Four ball.
text: The shot goes in and he lines up another.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Cross-corner.
text: The shot is a difficult one involving a combination of balls.
text: As it rolls in, the crowd breaks into applause, and Fats
text: bangs the butt of his cue stick on the floor to show his
dialog: appreciation.
speaker_heading: SAUSAGE
dialog: Game.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE GAME AT AMES - TIME LAPSE
text: A high angle of the table. Fats plays defensively, playing a
text: safety, leaving Eddie with little to shoot at.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Safe.
text: So Eddie does the same.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Safe.
text: Fats peers at the pack of balls huddled together, then points
text: to one that lies in the middle of the pack.
speaker_heading: FATS
text: Seven ball in the corner.
text: Big John looks around -- the shot seems impossible. Fats
text: slams the cue ball into the pack. The balls carom outward in
text: all directions. Only the seven rolls slowly into the corner
text: pocket. Eddie slumps back in his seat as the crowd applauds.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE GAME AT AMES - TIME LAPSE
text: It is twelve o'clock, and Fats dominates the play. As he
text: calls out the litany of his shots, we see, superimposed over
text: his hands and his face and the sound of socking pool balls,
text: the spectators, stupefied by the action; Charlie, swallowing
text: hard; Eddie, looking on, waiting to play; and the bills
text: endlessly unfolding out of Charlie's hands and floating onto
text: the table.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE GAME AT AMES - TIME LAPSE

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You miss?

dialog: and chalks his cue)
dialog: Well, you don't leave much when you
dialog: miss, do you, fat man?
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: (from his seat)
dialog: That's what the game's all about.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
text: The shot goes in. Fats pounds his stick on the floor. No one
text: else makes a noise.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Very good shot.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I
dialog: gotta hunch it's me from here on
dialog: in... One ball, corner pocket.
dialog: (shot goes in)
dialog: I mean, that ever happen to you?
dialog: When all of a sudden you feel like
dialog: you can't miss? I dreamed about this
dialog: game, fat man. I dreamed about this
dialog: game every night on the road... five
dialog: ball...
dialog: (shot goes in)
dialog: You know, this is my table, man. I
dialog: own it.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE GAME AT AMES - TIME LAPSE
text: It is two-thirty. Now it's Eddie's voice we hear calling out
text: the shots.
text: He circles the table, a proud, cocky smile on his face, and
text: superimposed over his movements we see the spectators, hunched

speaker_heading: SAUSAGE

text: and returns to his seat. It is almost four o'clock.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Pay the man again, Fats.
text: Fats draws himself slowly out of his chair and hands the
dialog: money to Charlie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Hey, how much are we ahead?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Approximately? One thousand bucks.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fats, let's you and I shoot a game
dialog: of pool for a thousand dollars a
dialog: game.
text: Fats hesitates for a moment, then reaches in his pocket for
dialog: some bills.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Preach! Go down and get me some White

dialog: ice.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Preacher! Go on down and get me some

scene_heading: INT. JOHNNY'S BAR, THE BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: As Preacher opens the door to the back room, clutching a
text: paper bag filled with bottles to his chest, we see six men
text: seated around a table, playing poker. Preacher approaches
text: one of them and whispers something hurriedly in his ear. The

text: pass for a conservative businessman out for an evening with
text: the boys, sipping milk instead of alcohol to soothe an ulcer.

speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE

dialog: I'm the best there is. Now even if

speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I thought you said this game was
dialog: over when Minnesota Fats said it
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Now, it's over now.
text: Fats emerges from the washroom, dries his hands, looks at

text: jacket with the carnation still in the lapel. Eddie grins at
text: this. So does Bert. Fats opens his palms for the sprinkling

text: takes out his cigarette case.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Fast Eddie, let's play some pool.
text: Bert smiles in appreciation.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let's go, Eddie.

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You look beautiful, Fats. Just like
text: a baby... all pink, and powdered up.
text: Eddie looks down at his own dirty, disheveled shirt. He and

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: You beat him. You beat him bad. You

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay, here...

dialog: Be a damn fool.

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You know, you really look beautiful,
dialog: Fats.
text: Everyone stares at Eddie as he scratches his head, alone

dialog: away.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (casually)
dialog: I'll break.
text: A worried Charlie picks up the case and stands by mutely,
text: watching Eddie disintegrate. Eddie leans over to shoot, then

text: soberly, patiently.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

speaker_heading: SAUSAGE
dialog: That's one twenty-five.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: We lose again.
text: Eddie bangs his head against the wall. He knocks over a bottle
text: as he tries to get up off the stool. The noise startles him.
text: Charlie watches sadly. Eddie gropes through his pockets and
text: comes up with a few crumpled bills.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Is this all we got left?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If that's all you got, that's all we

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fats, look, I got about two hundred

speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: You watch me.
text: Fats steps by Eddie and heads for the coat rack, slapping
text: the stake money into Bert's hand as he goes by. Bert returns
text: the money to his billfold, wordlessly. The blinds are drawn
text: and the light strikes Eddie in the eyes, but still he stumbles
text: after Fats, holding his money out before him, pleading.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fats, c'mon. C'mon. Hey, Fats?
text: He bangs against the corner of the table and falls onto the
text: floor. Fats hears him go down and pauses, turning to see

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: FADE IN:

text: asleep in the next bed. He rolls out of bed and goes to the
text: window. We see a neon sign flashing across the street. It
text: reads AMES BILLIARDS. Then Eddie returns to his bed, leaves
text: the keys to the Packard and some money on the night table
text: next to Charlie. He picks up his valise, his hanging bag,

text: cue case on a chair, then turns to face his image in the
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to the attendant)

text: and a cup of coffee, and an ashtray filled with cigarette
text: butts. She looks up for an instant as Eddie appears. He now
text: has on a clean shirt and is clean and freshly shaven. He
text: locks his bags in a locker. Her eyes return to the printed
text: page. Moving toward the counter, Eddie notices Sarah. He
text: goes to the lunch counter, still looking at her. He sniffs
text: some wrapped sandwiches.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Can I get you something?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Later.

text: She ignores him.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Long wait for a bus?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Yes.
text: She returns to her reading. Eddie keeps looking at her. Her
text: hair is brown, cut short, practically straight. Her lips are
text: pale and thin, and the bone structure of her face, although
text: delicate, is much in evidence.
text: There is a suggestion of tired wakefulness, of self-
text: sufficiency, about her. And a frank, open regard which has
text: nothing in it to imply flirtation -- or the lack of it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How long you been waiting?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Then why go to the bus station?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Same reason you went: at that hour

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep,
dialog: not without a drink. The bars don't
dialog: open until eight. Mack over there

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So why go to college?
speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: All right.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's all right.

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why me?
text: He takes her head in his hands and kisses her. She responds

speaker_heading: SARAH

text: She carries the carton across the street to her apartment
text: house, quietly saying hello to a couple of neighbors along
dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Sarah's apartment is a typical city studio apartment: one
text: cluttered room for sleeping and eating, and a small
text: kitchenette. As Sarah knocks, Eddie is perched on the window
text: sill. He goes to open the door. Sarah enters.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Where you been all day?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: At school. It's Thursday.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, I forgot.
text: He pulls her schoolbooks out of the carton and takes her
dialog: purse.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You were asleep when I left. I didn't
dialog: want to wake you. Did you go out?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, I went out for a couple of
dialog: hours.
text: She unloads liquor and canned goods from the carton, then
text: goes to join Eddie by the window. Sarah takes a cigarette
text: lighter out of her purse and hands it to Eddie.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (off the lighter)
dialog: Present...
text: He takes it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You know, I've been living here for
dialog: almost three years. Now in three
dialog: days it seems as if I know everybody.
dialog: When I pass people on the street I
dialog: want to stop and say, "Listen, I got
dialog: a fella."
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (strokes her hand)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Eddie, where do you go when you go
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: Museums... art galleries... concerts.
text: She smiles, then she gets up and returns to the kitchenette.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, I believe you when you say you
dialog: go to school.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You want to go with me?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What, are you kidding? See that book?
text: (holds up a book)
dialog: I've been trying to get through that
dialog: book ever since I first got here. I
dialog: haven't finished the first chapter.
dialog: (off her bookcase)
dialog: Did you read all them books?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Mm hmm.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You got it all in your head?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: When I'm sober. They get a little
dialog: mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the
dialog: time they're mixed up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Oh, stop talking about yourself like
dialog: you're a lush or something. I don't
dialog: like it.
dialog: (genuinely concerned)
dialog: Maybe you ought to go to a clinic,
dialog: get some treatments.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm getting treatments right here.
text: He comes up behind her and puts his arms around her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm hungry.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Take your choice. I've got enough so
dialog: we won't have to go out of the house
dialog: till Tuesday.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What did all this stuff cost you?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: When you've got money, you'll pay.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna
dialog: keep score.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: The bills are right here. You didn't
dialog: say what you wanted.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (off the canned goods)
dialog: Don't you ever cook anything?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Eggs. How do you like them?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Raw.
text: She cuts her hand opening a can.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh, cut my finger.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I've got something in my bag.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Oh, it's not bad.
text: As he rummages through the closet for his bag he pulls out
text: his leather cue case.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Eddie, what's in that case?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Haven't you opened it?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No, why should I? It's yours.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: It's a machine gun. This guy told me
dialog: when I came to the big city I'd have
dialog: to have a machine gun, so I bought
dialog: one.
dialog: (bandages her finger)
dialog: Where do you get the money? To pay
dialog: for all this? I mean the liquor, and
dialog: the groceries, and the rent?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: From a rich old man who used to be
dialog: my lover.
text: They kiss. Someone knocks on the door. Sarah goes to open
text: it. We stay on Eddie, who examines the lighter in his hand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (O.S.)
dialog: Hello, Eddie.
text: He enters the room, awkwardly, toying with the rim of his
dialog: hat.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hello, Charlie...
dialog: (turns)
dialog: C'mon in...
dialog: (off Sarah)
dialog: That's my girl.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: Hello, Eddie's girl...
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: I looked all over for you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I asked around.
text: There is a long silence.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Do you want me to go?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: No, stick around.
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Can I get you something? Drink?
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, I don't want to be no bother to
dialog: nobody.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It
dialog: don't look good on you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How do you want me to play it? I'm
dialog: broke.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So am I... Sit down.
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: Would you get us a couple of drinks?
text: She starts to make the drinks. Charlie sits.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You walked out on me like that. No
dialog: goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in
dialog: the dark. We were partners. We were
dialog: more than partners.
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: He was like a... like --
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: A son.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, yeah, like a son.
dialog: (to Sarah who brings
dialog: drinks)
dialog: I've known this boy since he was
dialog: sixteen. The first time I saw him,
dialog: back in Oakland, I said, "This is a
dialog: talented boy. This is a smart boy."
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Talk to me, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I want you to come back on the road
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Aah! I've got no stomach for that
dialog: any more. I've had that kind of life.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What kind of life have you got here?
text: Scufflin' around the small rooms,
dialog: picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'll connect. I'll get you your money
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Are you figuring on going back to
dialog: Ames to play Minnesota Fats again?
dialog: Is that what's on your mind?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat
dialog: that fat man... with that curly hair,
dialog: and those diamond rings, and that
dialog: carnation.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: This boy's crazy. They wiped the
text: floor with him. They beat his brains
text: out and he wants to go back.
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: What for? To take another beating?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I told you you'd get your money back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: He thinks I care about the money.
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: I care about you. Do you care about
dialog: me, Eddie? We're together a long
dialog: time, night and day. So how do you
dialog: say goodbye?
dialog: (rises)
dialog: You gimme the car and a hundred bucks.
dialog: You think I care about the dough,
dialog: the car? I care about you.
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: This boy is the greatest pool hustler
dialog: you ever saw. A real high-class con
dialog: man. He can charm anybody into
dialog: anything. Did he ever tell you how
dialog: well we were doing on the road? We
dialog: had everything: we ate good, we slept
dialog: late, we had money to burn. Whisky,
dialog: dames...
dialog: (apologetic, to Sarah)
dialog: Excuse me...
dialog: (to Eddie, off Sarah)
dialog: I'll tell you what -- take her along.
text: Eddie leans up against the wall, listening. Sarah watches
text: them both, curious, confused.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll tell you what else: you don't
dialog: want to start right away, we won't
dialog: start right away. We'll get in the
dialog: car and drive down to Miami, get all
dialog: this crud out of your system, have a
text: few laughs, lie in the sun for a
dialog: couple of weeks.
text: Suddenly Eddie becomes tense.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't worry about it. I'll raise the
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh yeah? Where?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What's the difference where? I'll
dialog: raise it.
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: Is it all right if I have another
dialog: drink?
text: Sarah turns to fix the drink. Eddie signals her to stay where
dialog: she is.
text: He moves forward, confronting Charlie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Did you hold out on me, Charlie?...
dialog: How much?
text: Charlie doesn't answer, so Eddie snatches hold of his jacket
text: and shoves him back into a chair.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: HOW MUCH?!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: My twenty-five per cent. Approximately
dialog: fifteen hundred bucks.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen
dialog: hundred I coulda beat him. That's
dialog: all I needed, Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Aw, Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What for? To play Fats again?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, to play Fats again.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You wanna come back on the road with
dialog: me, okay, the money's yours. But if
dialog: you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats...
dialog: nothing doing. What do you say?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (viciously)
dialog: You still don't see it, do you,
dialog: Charlie? You are nothing but a small-
dialog: time Charlie. You'd love to keep me
dialog: hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya?
dialog: I mean, a couple more years with me,
text: scuffling around them little towns
dialog: and those back alleys. You might
dialog: make yourself enough to get a little
text: poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables
text: and a handbook on the side. Is that
dialog: when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Is that what you think?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, that's what I think.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: All right. That's what I want.
text: Poolroom with a little handbook on
text: the side. Getting old.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Lay down and die by yourself. Don't
dialog: take me with you.
text: Eddie walks off. A pause.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just like that?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah. Just like that.
text: A tear rolls down Sarah's cheek as she hears this. She stands
text: near the door, with her back to both of them. Charlie gets
text: up and moves toward the door.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thanks for the drink, Eddie's girl.
text: Sarah, her cheek wet, says nothing. Charlie puts on his hat
text: and leaves.
text: Eddie empties his glass and slaps it on the shelf next to
dialog: Sarah.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Give me another drink.
text: She pours it out, saying nothing.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Boy! Everybody, everybody wants a
dialog: piece of me!
text: Sarah hands Eddie his drink without looking him in the eye.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Aren't you gonna have one?
text: She pours herself a very stiff drink as Eddie moves about
text: restlessly.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What did he have to come back here
dialog: for anyway?
text: Sarah drinks her drink.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: C'mere.
text: She keeps drinking.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Come here!
text: Still drinking, she turns to him. They embrace and kiss one
text: another without putting down their glasses.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: The room is a mess and Sarah is drunk. She sits on her knees
text: on the floor, pecking at the keys of her typewriter with one
text: finger. Her bottle and her glass are beside her. A bare-
text: chested Eddie is in the kitchen behind her, tossing empty
text: cans and bottles from the sink into a garbage bag. He
text: carelessly wipes the sink, then throws down the dishrag and
text: goes to the closet, pulling out his leather case.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You going out?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah. For a little while.
text: Reaching for the bottle, Sarah abruptly lurches forward over
text: her typewriter, and knocks the bottle over.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (atop the typewriter)
dialog: Ohhhhh...
text: Eddie quickly moves to help her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Hey!
text: He helps her up.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Okay?
text: She doesn't answer. Eddie stares at Sarah as she sways limply
text: on her knees, unmindful of her open robe. Eddie picks up the
text: bottle and sets it before her. Taking her ashtray, Eddie
text: rises, runs his hand through her hair for a moment, and then
text: carries off the ashtray and empties it in the garbage bag.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - TIME LAPSE
text: Sarah, still hopelessly drunk, is sprawled out on her bed,
text: futilely attempting to dial a telephone. Eddie, in a clean
text: shirt and pants, watches her. He sets the bottle down near
text: the typewriter and notices the sheet of paper stuck in the
text: typewriter's carriage. He bends down to read it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What are you writing?
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: (looks up from the
dialog: phone)
dialog: Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making
dialog: up.
text: She falls back on the bed. Eddie pulls the paper out of the
text: carriage and reads it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Give it to me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What's this supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Give it back to me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What's this supposed to mean: "We
dialog: have a contract of depravity. All we
dialog: have to do is pull the blinds down."
text: She doesn't answer. He thinks for a moment, then angrily
text: crumples the paper in his hands and throws it at her.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Write yourself another story.
text: Eddie walks off.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (with a sardonic laugh)
dialog: Well, what else have we got? We never
dialog: talk about anything. We stay here in
dialog: this room, and we drink, and we make
dialog: love.
dialog: (sits up in bed)
dialog: We're strangers. What happens when
text: the liquor and the money run out,
dialog: Eddie?
text: Eddie gives her a look, then lowers his eyes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You told Charlie to lay down and
dialog: die. Will you say that to me too?
text: (rises and stumbles
dialog: over to him)
dialog: What happens, Eddie?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You'll find yourself another rich
dialog: old lover.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's right! And I'm sure you'll
dialog: help me.
text: Eddie turns and slaps her on the cheek.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You waiting for me to cry?
text: (stares at him coldly)
dialog: You bum... You poolroom bum.
text: He reaches for his jacket.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOHNNY'S BAR - NIGHT
text: As Eddie pushes through the glass doors to the front room of
text: Johnny's bar. He looks around at the unused pool tables,
text: then goes to the bar.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Give me a bottle of beer.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Right.
text: A man in a business suit comes out of the back room and joins
text: him at the bar.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: How did you make out?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I made a couple of bucks.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Poker game?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Is it open?
text: The man looks to the bartender for his answer.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: It's open...
dialog: (to the man)
dialog: What'll you have?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Gimme a beer.
text: Eddie takes his beer to the back room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOHNNY'S BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: The poker game is in progress. Four men are playing. One of
text: them is Bert Gordon. His glass of milk is beside him on the
text: table. He takes note of Eddie's presence with a quick dart
text: of his eyes.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Sit down.
text: He takes a seat next to Bert.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What's the limit?
speaker_heading: PLAYER
dialog: Half and a dollar.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Gimme ten bucks.
speaker_heading: PLAYER
dialog: Ten dollars.
text: He takes the chips, then throws out another bill.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Make it twenty.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: Cut.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Deal.
text: As the cards are dealt Eddie steals a glance at the man he
text: has come to see.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. JOHNNY'S FRONT ROOM - TIME LAPSE
text: The game is over. Bert is already in the front room. He sits
text: at a table with a drink, and watches Eddie pass him by on
text: the way to the bar.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Two.
text: Eddie looks at Bert.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (pleasantly, to Eddie)
dialog: I'm buyin'.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Thought you only drank milk.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Only when I work.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Yeah? Why?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I like it. It's good for you. Besides,
dialog: you start drinking whisky gambling
dialog: and it gives you an excuse for losing.
dialog: That's something you don't need --
dialog: an excuse for losing. How did you
dialog: make out in the poker game?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I lost twenty bucks.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Poker's not your game.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Pool.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You being cute?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I don't think there's a pool player
dialog: alive shoots better pool than I saw
dialog: you shoot the other night at Ames.
dialog: You got talent.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So I got talent. So what beat me?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Character.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yeah. Sure, sure.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: You're damned right I'm sure.
dialog: Everybody's got talent. I got talent.
dialog: You think you can play big-money
dialog: straight pool, or poker, for forty
dialog: straight hours on nothing but talent?
dialog: You think they call Minnesota Fats
dialog: the best in the country just 'cause
dialog: he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's
dialog: got more character in one finger
dialog: than you got in your whole skinny
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I got drunk.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: He drank as much whisky as you did.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Maybe he knows how to drink.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: You bet he knows how.
dialog: (sips his drink)
dialog: You think that's a talent too, huh?
dialog: Knowin' how to drink whisky? You
dialog: think Minnesota Fats was born knowin'
dialog: how to drink?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie
text: down on the floor and, uh, bow from
dialog: the ankles? What do I do, go home?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: That's your problem.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: So I stay. Stay until I hustle up
dialog: enough to play Fats again. Maybe by
dialog: that time I'll develop myself some
dialog: character.
text: Amused, Bert gets up and joins Eddie at the bar.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Maybe by that time you'll die of old
dialog: age. How much do you think you'll,
dialog: uh, need?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: A thousand.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: No, three thousand at least. He'll
dialog: start you off at five hundred a game --
dialog: he'll beat the pants off you. That's
text: the way he plays when he comes up
text: against a man who knows the way the
dialog: game is. He'll beat you flat four or
dialog: five games -- maybe more, depending
dialog: on how, uh... steady your nerves
dialog: are. But he might -- he just might
dialog: be a little scared of you, and that
dialog: could change things. But I wouldn't
dialog: count on it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How do you know? Huh? When nobody
dialog: knows that much?
speaker_heading: BERT
text: See that big car parked out by the
dialog: fireplug on the way in? Well, that's
dialog: mine. I like that car. But I get a
dialog: new one every year because I make it
dialog: my business to know what guys like
dialog: you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do.
dialog: I made enough off of you the other
dialog: night to pay for it twice over.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: In that case, you owe me another
dialog: drink.
text: Bert laughs and signals the bartender for another round.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Eddie, is it all right if I get
dialog: personal?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Whaddya been so far?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Eddie, you're a born loser.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: First time in ten years I ever saw
text: Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked.
dialog: But you let him off.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I told you. I got drunk.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Sure, you got drunk. That's the best
dialog: excuse in the world for losing. No
dialog: trouble losing when you got a good
dialog: excuse. And winning! That can be
text: heavy on your back too. Like a monkey.
dialog: You drop that load too when you got
dialog: an excuse. All you gotta do is learn
dialog: to feel sorry for yourself. It's one
dialog: of the best indoor sports: feeling
dialog: sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed
dialog: by all, especially the born losers.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: (slaps down his glass
dialog: and rises)
dialog: Thanks for the drink.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota
text: Fats again.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also
dialog: there's something in it for me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Seventy-five per cent.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: For who?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: For me.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: That's a -- that's a pretty big slice.
dialog: Who do you think you are, General
dialog: Motors?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: How much you think you're worth these
dialog: days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm
dialog: puttin' up the time. For that I get
dialog: seventy-five per cent return on my
dialog: money -- if you win.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You think I can lose?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I never saw you do anything else.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for
dialog: eighteen thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't
dialog: you? This game isn't like football.
dialog: Nobody pays you for yardage. When
dialog: you hustle you keep score real simple.
dialog: The end of the game you count up
dialog: your money. That's how you find out
dialog: who's best. That's the only way.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Why back me then? Why not back
dialog: yourself? Go find yourself a big fat
dialog: poker game and get rich. You know
text: all the angles.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I'm already rich. But I like action.
dialog: That's one thing I think you're good
dialog: for is action. Besides, like I say...
dialog: you got talent.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Yeah, you already told me that. You
text: cut that slice down to bite-size and
dialog: maybe we can talk.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: No, we don't talk. I don't make bad
dialog: bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five.
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Kiss off.
text: He starts to go.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Hey, wait.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you gonna do about the money?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: There are places. I'll scuffle around.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk
dialog: in the wrong kind of place and they'll
dialog: eat you alive.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Now, when did you adopt me?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (with a friendly grin)
dialog: I don't know when it was.
text: Eddie exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT
text: Sound of ship's horn. Eddie walks past the piers and
text: warehouses toward a small waterfront bar called Arthur's
dialog: Pool Hall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ARTHUR'S POOL HALL - NIGHT
text: The atmosphere at Arthur's is stifling, oppressive. A few
text: lonely drinkers, dock workers, sit stooped over their beer
text: bottles at the bar.
text: In the back is a pool table. As Eddie enters, we see two
text: burly men, cue sticks in hand, watching as a pale, skinny
text: young man lines up his shot.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (to young man)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Hi.
text: They exchange glances, sizing each other up. Then the young
text: man puts in his shot.
speaker_heading: PLAYER

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Okay.

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You sure you don't want to quit,

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (suddenly irked)
dialog: Let's cut out the small stuff, huh?
dialog: Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games,

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You quittin', friend?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Yeah, I'm quittin'.
text: Sensing what is about to happen, the young man pays up. He
text: drops the cash on the table and leaves quickly. Then one of
text: the other men steps forward, a thick-fleshed, obscene-looking
text: man named Turk. His mouth twists into a mock smile. As Eddie
text: looks about him at the circle of silent men, each one glaring
text: at him, his fury gives way to fear.
speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: Why, you're a pool shark, boy. A

speaker_heading: TURK

speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: There's your money, boy.
text: Eddie tries to back off but there is nowhere to go, so he

speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Okay.
text: Suddenly, the men grab Eddie and pin his arms. One man grabs

speaker_heading: TURK
dialog: (to Eddie)
dialog: We got no use for pool sharks around
dialog: here.
text: They drag Eddie into the men's room and shove him up against
text: the ground-glass partition. We see his cheek pressed against
text: the glass, and the foggy silhouettes of the others behind
text: him. Eddie, his mouth open, screams horribly. There is a
text: pause. He screams again. They let go of his arms and he slumps

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: SARAH

dialog: Pool cue's part of me. You know,

text: at the party below. Holding the rail with one hand, and a
text: champagne glass in the other, she maneuvers her way down the
text: steps. She stops a waitress on the way upstairs and exchanges
text: her glass for a new one. We follow her unsteady, doll-like
text: descent. She moves slowly, dreamily past the combo; past
text: Eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dress;
text: past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests;
text: past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, until she
text: comes to the bar.
text: Bert is there too, his head bobbing to the Dixie beat, his
text: eyes running over her body so plainly covered by a cotton
text: print dress. Spinning away from him, she takes her glass and
text: goes to a corner of the room. Bert walks casually to her
text: side. He leans over and whispers something in her ear. Her
text: face hardens. Angrily she turns and throws her champagne in
text: his face and smashes her glass on the floor. Then she starts
text: to cry and starts to fall, but Bert holds her up by the
text: shoulders. The music stops. The dance couples strain to get
text: a look at what has happened.
text: Eddie shoves through the gawking crowd.
speaker_heading: EDDIE

speaker_heading: BERT

text: He stands over her, pulling a wad of bills from his pocket.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Put it on the bed. That's the way
dialog: it's done, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (tossing it there)
dialog: That's the way it's done.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: And the way you're looking at me, is
dialog: that the way you look at a man you've
dialog: just beaten? As if you'd just taken
dialog: his money, and now all you want is...
dialog: his pride?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: All I want's the money.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Sure, sure, just the money, and the
dialog: aristocratic pleasure of seeing him
dialog: fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert.
dialog: You have to win them all.
text: He picks her up and tries to kiss her but she is cold and
text: limp in his arms, so he lets go and she drops back on the
text: bed. Then he turns and walks back into his room. She waits
text: for a moment. Then she takes a cigarette out of a pack, gets
text: up, and goes into his room.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (at the door)
dialog: You got a drink?

text: In the bathroom mirror we see Bert asleep on his bed. The
text: sheets are rumpled and tossed about. Then we see Sarah, in
text: her slip, enter the bathroom and shut the door. She takes
text: out her lipstick and scrawls across the image of herself in
text: the glass "Perverted, twisted, crippled." She underlines the
dialog: word "crippled."

text: at the desk.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Give me my key, please. Room fifty-
dialog: seven.
text: The concierge stares dumbly.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, c'mon, give me my key.
text: The concierge hands it to him. Eddie walks quickly toward
dialog: the elevators.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE - TIME LAPSE
text: He enters, sees the money on Sarah's bed, puts down his cue
text: case, and turns to see a crowd in the adjoining room. Bert,
text: laying in bed, talks to a plainclothesman who stands over
text: him, taking notes. A photographer with a flash camera stands
text: by the bathroom.
scene_heading: PLAINCLOTHESMAN
dialog: Now, let's go over this again. You
dialog: say you were in the other room...
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: No, she closed the door. I told you
text: she closed the door. I was in the
text: other room. She closed the door,
dialog: went in there, maybe, I don't know,
text: ten minutes, five minutes...
text: Bert stops when he sees Eddie through the open door. A
text: uniformed policeman bars Eddie's entrance.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (to the policeman)
dialog: Hey. Let him come in, huh?
text: Eddie comes in. He looks at the detectives around Bert's
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Eddie?
text: The photographer's bulb flashes as he takes a picture of the
dialog: bathroom.
text: Eddie pushes by the photographer, then stops as he sees
text: Sarah's body laid out on the tiled floor. He drops to his
text: knees beside her.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Eddie?
text: Eddie reaches out to touch her, then pulls back his hand.
text: Bert appears at the bathroom door behind him.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Eddie? She come in here, Eddie. She
dialog: asked me for a drink. I give her
dialog: one. We had a few more.
text: Eyes closed, he writhes as he listens to Bert.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Eddie, she came in here.
text: Suddenly he uncoils and lunges at Bert, grasping him by the
text: throat and pushing him back. A policeman untangles them, but
text: Eddie breaks free. We hear Bert scream as he squirms along
text: the floor trying to avoid Eddie's fists.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: INT. AMES POOL HALL - LATE AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: Minnesota Fats sits in his chair, engrossed in the afternoon
text: paper. Big John is at a pool table, trying out a few shots.
text: Bert, in dark glasses, stands near the cashier's cage,
text: chucking dice into a leather shaker.
text: The noise of the dice echoes in the slow, late afternoon
text: gloom of Ames.
text: When Bert sees Eddie push open the glass doors, he draws
text: himself up fearfully like a turtle, and motions with his
text: eyes to his men for protection. Eddie, his cue case tucked
text: under his arm, walks straight toward him. He stops, stares
text: at him for a moment, then turns and walks over to Minnesota
dialog: Fats.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I came to play pool, Fats.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: (after a glance at
dialog: Bert)
dialog: That's good, Eddie. For how much?
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: You name it.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Thousand dollars a game.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Let's make it three thousand dollars
dialog: a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand
dialog: dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's
dialog: savings.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What's the matter, Fats? All you
dialog: gotta do is beat me the first game
dialog: and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Let's go.
text: Fats rises, ready to play. Eddie starts to screw his cue
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Get on me, Bert. I can't lose.
text: He turns to join Fats at the table. The balls are already
text: racked and ready.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Willie.
text: Willie collects their stake money and prepares to toss the
dialog: coin.
text: Preacher, Big John draw up their chairs around the table.
text: Bert also takes a seat, but far away, near the coat rack.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Call it.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Heads.
text: Willie taps Fats on the lapel. It's his break. Sausage sends
text: the cue ball down the table and the game begins at once.
text: Fats makes a good break, leaving the cue ball teetering over
text: the far corner pocket. He looks up at Eddie, and steps back.
text: Eddie looks at the lineup of the balls. Then he sets down
text: his cue and walks over to the washroom. He glances at Bert
text: as he sprinkles the powder on his hands.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How shall I play that one, Bert?
dialog: Play it safe? That's the way you
dialog: always told me to play it, safe,
dialog: play the percentage. Well, here we
dialog: go... fast and loose.
text: He turns and snatches up his cue.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: One ball, corner pocket.
text: (chalks his cue, lines
dialog: up his shot)
dialog: Yeah, percentage players die broke
dialog: too, don't they, Bert?
text: He rams a bank shot into the pack. The one ball rolls in,
text: while others scatter about the table. The crowd applauds.
text: Eddie moves swiftly to his next shot. As he plays, he talks
dialog: to Bert.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: How can I lose? Twelve ball.
dialog: (shot goes in)
dialog: I mean, how can I lose? Because you
dialog: were right, Bert. I mean, it's not
dialog: enough that you just have talent.
dialog: You gotta have character too. Four
dialog: ball.
dialog: (shot goes in, a pause)
dialog: Yeah and I sure got character now. I
text: picked it up in a hotel room in
dialog: Louisville.
text: Bert and Fats exchange glances.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: (from his seat)
dialog: Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss
dialog: you can shoot.
text: Eddie returns to his game and Fats waits for his turn, puffing
text: steadily on his cigarette. Bert shifts uneasily in his chair
text: and we hear the pool balls knock together, then slowly roll
text: down the track through the belly of the table.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Five ball.
dialog: (shot goes in)
dialog: ...Fourteen ball.
dialog: (shot goes in)
dialog: ...Four ball.
text: The shot goes in. Eddie looks significantly at Fats who lowers
text: his eyes and puffs on his cigarette.

speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: That's game.
text: The balls are racked. Eddie sinks shots right and left --
text: some tricky, some not. Bert and Fats exchange uneasy looks.
text: Eddie circles the table like a hawk. Then, Fats is up; his
text: jacket is off, his tie is pulled loose. He makes a shot,
text: chalks his cue.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Eight ball.
text: It's a hard shot and he misses. Eddie moves to take his shot,
text: ignoring Fats altogether.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Thirteen ball.
text: Bert looks on. But Eddie is shooting pool now, making all
text: his shots quickly and accurately. A depressed Fats watches
dialog: him shoot.

scene_heading: INT. THE GAME - TIME LAPSE
text: The clock over the door reads six o'clock. Fats is still in
text: his seat.
text: He has a drink in his hand.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you.
dialog: Willie, give him the stakes.
dialog: (rises, to Bert)
dialog: You got yourself a pool player.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
text: (softly, as he counts
dialog: his money)
dialog: Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Where do you think you're going?
text: Eddie slips into the jacket, helped by Preacher.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Eddie?...
dialog: (loses it)
dialog: YOU OWE ME MONEY!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: And just how do you figure that,
dialog: Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Half.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: In Louisville it was seventy-five
dialog: per cent.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Well, here it's half.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: You don't pay me? You gonna get your
text: thumbs broken.
dialog: (stands up and paces)
dialog: And your fingers. And if I want them
dialog: to, your right arm in three or four
dialog: places.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Better pay him, Eddie.
text: Eddie unscrews his cue, thinking it over. Bert's bodyguards
text: stand around, waiting for the word.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: So you figure you're still my manager,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: I'm a businessman, kid.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Well, you got a lot of games lined
dialog: up for me?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money
dialog: together, from now on.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fifty per cent?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: No, it don't have to be fifty. It
dialog: can be thirty... twenty-five.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: We really stuck the knife in her,
dialog: didn't we, Bert?
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: (disgustedly)
dialog: Aaaahhhh!
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Boy, we really gave it to her good.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: If it didn't happen in Louisville,
dialog: it'd happened someplace else. If it
dialog: didn't happen now, it'd happen six
dialog: months from now. That's the kinda
dialog: dame she was.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert?
dialog: Course, maybe that doesn't stick in
dialog: your throat cause you spit it out
dialog: just like you spit out everything
dialog: else. But it sticks in mine. I loved
dialog: her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool
dialog: game. But that wouldn't mean anything
dialog: to you. Because who did you ever
dialog: care about? Just win, win, you said,
dialog: win, that's the important thing. You
dialog: don't know what winnin' is, Bert.
dialog: You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead
dialog: inside, and you can't live unless
dialog: you make everything else dead around
dialog: ya.
text: Fats listens, his head bowed.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Too high, Bert. Price is too high.
dialog: Because if I take it, she never lived,
dialog: she never died. And we both know
dialog: that's not true, Bert, don't we,
dialog: huh? She lived, she died. Boy, you
dialog: better... You tell your boys they
dialog: better kill me, Bert. They better go
dialog: all the way with me. Because if they
dialog: just bust me up, I'll put all those
text: pieces back together again, and so
dialog: help me, so help me God, Bert... I'm
dialog: gonna come back here and I'm gonna
dialog: kill you.
text: Bert's men start to move forward but he stops them with a
text: gesture of his hand. He tries to smile. A friendly smile.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: All right... All right.
text: Eddie puts away his cue.
speaker_heading: BERT
dialog: Only, uh, don't ever walk into a big-
text: time pool hall again.
text: Eddie just stares at Bert, then looks over at the downcast
text: face of Minnesota Fats.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: Fat man...
text: Fats looks up at Eddie.
speaker_heading: EDDIE
dialog: ...you shoot a great game of pool.
speaker_heading: FATS
text: (saluting him with
dialog: his glass of whisky)
dialog: So do you, Fast Eddie.
text: Eddie takes his cue case and heads for the door. He stops
text: for a moment, looks around at the rows of empty tables, and
text: goes out. Then Ames returns to normal. Fats puts on his coat;
text: Henry sweeps up. And Bert takes his seat again on his throne
text: overlooking Ames, sipping his glass of milk.
