speaker_heading: TIM (CONT'D)

dialog: through my X-Box 360. No one will
dialog: ever tell you this, then ran it
dialog: through Ershon’s company’s hard
dialog: drive...unnoticed! And got the
dialog: last million keystrokes. Back
dialog: tracked it and I found some
text: dripping wet juicy stuff. Turns
dialog: out his foreign banking clients
dialog: bought about 90 billion from him
dialog: in CDSRs. Credit default swap
dialog: reverses.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: What’s that? Smack?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No. How did you get that from what
dialog: I just said? Anyway, Ershon sold
dialog: several foreign banks Credit
dialog: Default Swaps which are basically
dialog: insurance that the reserves won’t
dialog: fail, except you can sell and buy
text: them. But he then adds a reverse
dialog: which allows him to invest the
dialog: default swaps with other banks. He
dialog: created his own financial product.
dialog: Made billions off of this.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: That’s fantastic work Tim.
speaker_heading: TIM
