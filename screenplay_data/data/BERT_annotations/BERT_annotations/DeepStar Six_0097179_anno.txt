text: Finally the CAMERA SPLASHES below the surface of

text: Hundreds of bubbles rise past as the camera swims
text: lazily through azure seas sparkling with sunlight
text: and teeming with brightly colored tropical fish.
text: The bubbles swirl past as we dive down, the water
text: turning paler, the fish becoming duller and more
dialog: scarce.
text: A large shark swims past us, on the prowl.
text: Deeper and deeper we dive.
text: Soon the water is black as night. Only the
text: faintest slivers of light penetrate down here, and
text: then quickly flicker and die.
text: Large shadowy creatures of the ultra-deep haunt the
dialog: edges of our vision.
text: Strange luminescent fish with long pointy teeth
text: dart past.
text: The sea bottom draws near, a flat plain scarred by

text: glide over the outer wall, the crater floor looms
dialog: beneath us.
text: On the bottom, a faint light glimmers.
text: It is an undersea station, a series of five

text: Several hundred yards beyond the station, the faint
text: lights of the bio-lab can be seen. This is where

text: DR. ABERNATHY glances across at DR. JERKINS.
text: Jerkins is late fourties, high strung. His eyes

dialog: night.
text: Abernathy takes out a small harmonica from his

text: Jerkins freezes in mid-bite at the sight of the
dialog: harmonica.
text: Abernathy takes his hankerchief, polishing the
text: harmonica. He taps it in his palm, breaking the

text: Abernathy puts the harmonica to his lips and and is
dialog: about to blow...
text: Jerkins starts to say something...
speaker_heading: 2-DRAFT
text: .... when Abernathy slips the harmonica back into
text: his pocket. In some way, he‘has been teasing
dialog: Jerkins.
text: DIANE NORRIS M.D. has seen-this. She doesn’t find

text: DREW PIERCE takes a seat at the other end of the
text: table with three of his fellow "support group",
scene_heading: JAMES RICHARDSON (Diver), TONY SNYDER
scene_heading: (Communications), and JOYCE COLLINS (Diver). There

speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Good morning, campers.
text: (looking down at his
dialog: plate) .
dialog: I thought we were out of oatmeal.
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: That’s eggs...
text: Pierce gingerly shoves them around on his plate,

text: letter written in a childish scrawl.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: What have you got there, Ace?
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Letter from Julie.
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: Check it out...
text: Collins holds up a fax of a picture drawn in crayon
text: -- it’s a stick figure man in a dive suit adjacent

text: brightly colored trees, flowers and fish. The
text: caption at the top reads: MY DADDY AT WORK
text: Pierce leans over to get a-look.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Hey, that’s pretty good...
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Well, it ain’t Rembrandt, pal...but to

scene_heading: DEEP SIX: 2-DRAFT
speaker_heading: COLLINS

speaker_heading: RICHARDSON

speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: Whata buncha shit...
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: Must be nice to have a family waiting

dialog: This is a conversation they’ve had a thousand

speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: After six months, it’s the only thing
dialog: that keeps me going.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: I could go another six months...as long
dialog: as they keep laying on that "extra-duty
dialog: pay".
speaker_heading: COLLINS
dialog: Come on, admit it, Pierce. Wouldn’t
dialog: - you like to have a rug-rat of your own

speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: Better get the eggheads to work.

dialog: Did ya get them?
speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: Yeah, I got ’em. You gonna fax my

speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: You bet. First thing.
text: Richardson glances around the galley to make sure
text: no one is watching, then digs into his pocket. He
text: palms Snyder a small bottle of pills.
speaker_heading: PIERCE
dialog: If Norris finds out where you got
dialog: these, you’re dead meat, pal.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: She won’t...thanks, man. I owe you

speaker_heading: RICHARDSON
dialog: (somewhat disgusted)
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
speaker_heading: SNYDER
dialog: Hey, I just use them to help me to

speaker_heading: LAIDLAW
dialog: No. Valdez says they’re on the verge
dialog: of a major breakthrough. He just needs
dialog: a few more days...
speaker_heading: NORRIS
dialog: Valdez has been saying that for weeks
dialog: now. He’s part of the problem...he’s

speaker_heading: LAIDLAW
dialog: Tell you what...why don’t we review

speaker_heading: NORRIS
dialog: Fine. Here’s a list...
speaker_heading: LAIDLAW

dialog: Why do you want to transfer Collins?
speaker_heading: NORRIS
dialog: (simply)

speaker_heading: LAIDLAW
dialog: Does he know?
speaker_heading: NORRIS
dialog: Of course she knows, she asked me to
