dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 1 EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: We're rapidly moving across the water, skimming, towards the
text: dark woods on the far shore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2 EXT. BACK ROAD/INT. TOYOTA CELICA - DUSK
dialog: 
text: ELIZABETH MARCUS drives her Toyota Celica along this heavily
text: wooded road. She's a young woman, innocent looking, sweet
dialog: and pretty.
dialog: 
text: The light is fading. Shadows begin to overtake the land.
dialog: 
text: She is obviously some place remote. A sign caught briefly
text: in her headlights says, "CRYSTAL LAKE - 4 MILES". Elizabeth
text: swings the car around a barely seen curve in the road. She
text: pulls up...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 EXT. DESERTED CABIN - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth parks the Toyota. She gets out, takes a look at
dialog: the cabin.
dialog: 
text: A "FOR RENT" sign hangs, tacked to the porch at an angle.
text: The place looks dark, dirty, uninviting.
dialog: 
text: She moves to her rear door, opens it and bends in to get her
text: over-night bag. Behind her, the darkness gapes with the
text: ominous threat of violence.
dialog: 
text: She comes back out of the car and moves to the cabin. A
text: porch swing, rotted and unusable, BANGS METHODICALLY against
text: the old wood of the house. Elizabeth fumbles for the keys
text: and drops them.
dialog: 
text: As she bends down to pick off, the "FOR RENT" sign snaps it
text: chain and swings down, missing her neck by inches.
dialog: 
text: Startled, she rips the sign off and tosses it onto the porch
text: with a LOUD BANG.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth enters. The place is damp and dank. A layer of
text: moldy dust has gathered. Shadows obscure the corners of the
dialog: room.
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth put down her bag and gropes the wall for a switch.
text: She finds one. Flips it. The light turns on for a few brief
text: moments...then sputters and goes out.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Shit...
dialog: 
text: She turns and goes back outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5 EXT. DESERTED CABIN - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth walks slowly around the cabin, towards a decrepit
text: old woodshed at the edge of a dark, unfriendly woods. She
text: slowly opens the door...a mossy ladder rests against the far
dialog: wall.
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth enters and walks towards the ladder. Suddenly, the
text: woodshed door BANGS CLOSED. Elizabeth SHRIEKS then,
text: scrabbling at the door, flings it open and rushes outside
text: with the ladder.
dialog: 
text: There is a RUSTLE off among the trees. She hesitates again.
text: Footsteps on dry leaves? Just a gust of wind off the lake?
dialog: 
text: With a last look over her shoulder, she drags the ladder back
text: towards the cabin and enters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6 INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth comes back in with the ladder. She picks up her
text: bag, removes a four pack of bulbs and, climbing on the
text: ladder, replaces the bulb in the living room. The light
text: comes on...but it's scant illumination against the dark night.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, her foot slips on the slimy step of the ladder and
text: she drops the old bulb, which SHATTERS LOUDLY on the floor.
dialog: 
text: Grimacing, Elizabeth climbs down the ladder and quickly
text: sweeps up the broken glass. Having done that, she shuts the
text: front door all the way, then puts her bag on the bed and
text: opens it. She takes out a few pairs of jeans and some shirts
text: and moves to the standing wardrobe.
dialog: 
dialog: We know that she will open the doors of that wardrobe and
text: come face to face with her death.
dialog: 
text: She opens the wardrobe.
dialog: 
dialog: Nothing...just a moth.
dialog: 
text: She puts her clothes away. The sound of a branch SCRAPING
text: against the side of the cabin adds to the tension. Now she
dialog: turns...
dialog: 
text: ...there is no one waiting there in the doorway.
text: Elizabeth yawns, stretches and walks up the stairwell to the
text: second floor landing, which leads into a pitch black hallway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7 INT. DESERTED CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: She moves down the hallway, then enters the bathroom and
text: turns on the light. Crossing to the bathtub, she bends down
text: and turns on the hot water. It comes spitting out, brackish
text: and brown at first, then finally clear.
dialog: 
text: She stays, bent over the tub, letting the dirty water run
text: down the drain. Then she puts the plug in, filling the tub
text: for a bath. As it fills, she undresses down to the her
text: T-shirt and underwear.
dialog: 
text: She looks over to discover that the medicine cabinet door is
text: open. She crosses to it and closes it.
dialog: 
dialog: This has got to be the one. She will close that door and
dialog: there, reflected in the mirror will be...
dialog: 
text: ...nothing, just the dim illumination of the bathroom light.
dialog: 
text: She bends down to test the temperature of the tub water.
dialog: It's good.
dialog: 
text: She removes her underwear and t-shirt, then puts one foot in
text: the water, testing it, then eases into the comforting warmth.
dialog: 
text: The light in the bathroom sputters and then burns out.
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth SIGHS, resigned, then continues climbing into the
dialog: tub when -- WHAM!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 8 INT. DESERTED CABIN - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The front door blows open, banging into the wall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9 INT. DESERTED CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth turns, startled. She grabs her towel (brushing by
text: her makeup bag) and, wrapping the towel around her, walks
text: slowly down the dark hallway onto the landing.
dialog: 
text: From downstairs, she HEARS A NOISE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 10 INT. CABIN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bending precariously far out over the landing, she looks down
text: onto the first floor.
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: Nothing but the stirring of leaves, blowing into the cabin
text: through the open doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON ELIZABETH
dialog: 
text: as a cool breeze from the doorway makes her shiver. Slowly,
text: she moves towards the stairs when we HEAR THAT SOUND AGAIN
text: from downstairs. What the hell is it? Once again she leans
text: far out over the landing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: Still nothing. Leaves. The WHINE OF THE WIND.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON ELIZABETH
dialog: 
text: looking -- something must have made that noise. Then,
text: suddenly, from the perfect darkness behind her, JASON
text: VOORHEES steps out, hockey mask in place, machete sharp and
dialog: ready.
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth stands back up, OBSCURING JASON FROM VIEW.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ELIZABETH
dialog: 
text: feeling that something is definitely not right...in fact,
text: something is really, really wrong. With a panicked
text: expression, she turns around to look behind her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: Nothing. Darkness. Jason is gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON ELIZABETH
dialog: 
text: Relaxing -- everything's okay. She turns towards the stairs
text: and right into Jason, who raises his machete high.
dialog: 
text: With a SCREAM, she leaps backwards as Jason swings, flying
text: through the rotted wood of the railing and crashing down onto
dialog: the first floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON JASON
dialog: 
text: yanking his machete from the wooden bolster on the railing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON ELIZABETH
dialog: 
text: looking down at her towel. It's sliced through -- a thin
text: line of blood crossing her stomach in a diagonal. She runs.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. DESERTED CABIN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth leaps from the porch, over an overrun flowerbed,
text: onto the hood of her car. She quickly looks behind her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: to see Jason striding through the front door of the the
text: cabin, coming for her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON ELIZABETH
dialog: 
text: as she skids all the way across the hood of the car onto the
text: far side, then runs through the trees and brush in front of
text: the house -- her feet bare, her eyes panicked. The branches
text: seem to claw at her, tearing, scratching...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON'S POV
dialog: 
text: quickly gaining. God, he moves fast! Elizabeth turns, sees
dialog: us and SCREAMS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON ELIZABETH
dialog: 
text: turning back to face forward when -- WHACK! She's clipped by
text: a tree and knocked to the ground. She scrambles up and looks
dialog: around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: Jason is nowhere to be seen.
dialog: 
text: Elizabeth moves slowly now, turning around, her breathing
text: quick and panicked. Where is he?! Is he toying with her?!
text: She turns and Jason leaps in front of her, machete raised.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Elizabeth reaches into the cleavage at the front of
text: her towel and pulls out a small pistol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Eat me, you bastard!
dialog: 
text: She fires one shot directly into Jason's forehead, knocking
text: him back at step, then turns and bolts towards --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12 EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: She runs into this clearing then turns to see Jason rapidly
text: coming after her, striding out into the open, raising his
text: machete ready to deliver the lethal blow when, suddenly,
dialog: 
text: INTENSE BRIGHT LIGHTS SNAP ON AROUND THE CLEARING
text: stunning Jason for a moment. The girl disappears into the
dialog: treeline as
dialog: 
text: THE DEAFENING ROAR OF GUNFIRE
dialog: 
text: cracks out from the darkness. There are FBI AGENTS hidden
text: behind every tree, bush and rock...and now, they are all
text: firing on Jason at once.
dialog: 
text: Jason jerks as the bullets tear into his body.
dialog: 
text: Then there is a moment...the FBI agents watching...waiting
dialog: for Jason to fall.
dialog: 
text: But he doesn't fall. He stands there. His head turning
text: slowly, searching the darkness for his next kill. Suddenly,
text: from out of the darkness we hear:
dialog: 
scene_heading: FBI AGENT ABERNATHY
dialog: Incoming!
dialog: 
text: We hear a muffled SHOOMP! sound, then a familiar WHISTLING as
text: a mortar shell descends on Jason in the middle of the
dialog: clearing.
dialog: 
text: The grenade lands right at Jason's feet.
dialog: 
text: An anxious beat...then...
dialog: 
text: THE MORTAR EXPLODES!
dialog: 
text: We watch as Jason is blown, irrevocably, limb from limb.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON VARIOUS CHUNKS OF JASON
dialog: 
text: spinning slowly in the air in SLO-MO. An arm, something
text: unrecognizable, his head still in the hockey mask, then,
dialog: finally
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON JASON'S BLACK HEART
dialog: 
text: spinning through the air to finally land, with a WET PLOP, on
text: the field. It beats once, then once more...then stops.
dialog: 
text: A moment of silence...then the rest of the FBI agents emerge
text: from their hiding places. There is an eerie after-the-battle
text: silence to the scene. Jason's crimes have been so heinous
text: that even in death, proximity to his mangled remains seems to
text: render a somber atmosphere.
dialog: 
text: AGENT ABERNATHY makes his way through his quiet, somehow
text: stunned men, and over to Elizabeth. He is clearly the man in
text: charge -- his suit alone says that and his demeanor backs it up.
text: Elizabeth stands and faces him. It is a strange tableau...the
text: bright lights, the smoke in the air, the nearly naked woman
text: facing the man in the suit.
dialog: 
text: Agent Abernathy offers his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABERNATHY
dialog: Good job, Agent Marcus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (shaking his hand)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
dialog: 
text: A T.V. Camera is thrust into Abernathy's face. The MEDIA has
text: apparently caught wind of this event. REPORTERS scream for
dialog: "Agent Abernathy...your comments..." "What was your first
text: thought when..." Abernathy smiles and puts on his best
dialog: "media" face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABERNATHY
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen, please...
dialog: please...
dialog: 
text: The CROWD QUIETS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABERNATHY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It is my pleasure to announce that
text: Jason Voorhees is finally and
dialog: irrevocably...dead.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON A LONE MAN
dialog: 
text: sitting some distance away on the rise of a hill. His
text: weathered face shows a healthy contempt for this somewhat
text: premature celebration. He plugs a twisty, homegrown cigar
text: into the corner of his mouth, light a match off the beard
text: stubble on his chin, then fires up the cigar -- a glowing
text: coal in the darkness. His hawk's eyes stare at something
dialog: with ferocious intent...
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON JASON'S HEART
dialog: 
text: Laying on the ground in the clearing, not beating...but
text: intact.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 13 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Where we see the heart on a rolling metal surgical table.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
dialog: 
text: A CORONER, a big man in his 30's, as he rolls the cart up to
text: a security checkpoint manned by TWO FBI AGENTS. The coroner
text: hands his I.D. to FBI AGENT 1, then lifts his arms as FBI
text: AGENT 2 pats him down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT 1
dialog: Okay, sir.
dialog: 
text: The two sliding doors in front of the coroner slide open and
text: he wheels the metal surgical cart inside, the door closing
text: behind him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 14 INT. FBI MORGUE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Coroner is in the middle of his autopsy. He talks into
text: a microphone as he works, taking the dismembered parts of
text: Jason from a body bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: We have a large male caucasian...age
dialog: unknown...
dialog: 
text: He begins inspecting various organs, weighs them, takes
text: samples. He works methodically, making verbal notes as he
dialog: works.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: (continuing)
text: No indication of cirrhosis.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON JASON'S VILE, BLACK HEART
dialog: 
text: as the coroner inspects it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORONER
text: The heart is nearly twice the size of
dialog: a normal heart. Malformed...
dialog: 
text: He's about to lift the heart when...the heart beats!
dialog: 
text: The coroner stops. He didn't see that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: (trying to keep his
dialog: composure)
text: It appears to be filled with a black,
dialog: viscous fluid...frankly, I don't know
dialog: what the hell it is. It's not blood.
dialog: 
dialog: The heart beats again!
text: The coroner stares, shocked, transfixed.
dialog: 
text: The heart undulates now as it beats...it is a hypnotic,
text: throbbing pulse. Something that has to be stared at.
text: Something that awakens deep, impossible cravings.
dialog: 
text: It draws the coroner towards it, his eyes glassy, transfixed
text: by what he sees.
dialog: 
text: It beats faster, undulating, a gaping, kneading maw...
dialog: 
text: The coroner stares, then reaches down and takes the now
text: furiously beating heart in his hands.
dialog: 
text: He looks at it for a frighteningly long beat. He brings it
text: closer to his face. He would appear to be studying it...
dialog: trying to understand what in God's name this thing is...
dialog: 
text: And then he suddenly smiles, raises the monstrous organ to
dialog: his lips...
dialog: 
text: ...and eats the heart of Jason Voorhees!
dialog: 
text: When he finishes the heart, he stands for a moment, not
text: moving. Then, suddenly, his throat bulges and he begins to
text: SCREAM A HORRIBLE SCREAM and, as he SCREAMS we
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 15 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dead silence. Whatever is going on in that room cannot be
text: heard through the airtight doors.
dialog: 
text: The CORONER'S ASSISTANT walks up, carrying dinner. The two
text: FBI MEN stop him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FBI MAN 1
dialog: I.D.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: You just saw me come out of there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FBI MAN 1
dialog: I.D. please.
dialog: 
text: Annoyed, fumbling, the assistant takes out his I.D.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 16 INT. FBI MORGUE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The assistant walks in to see the Coroner doubled over.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Hey, what's the matter.
dialog: 
text: The Coroner straightens, then turns to the assistant. His
text: mouth is smeared with black liquid of the heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You ate already? I was only gone ten
dialog: minutes.
dialog: 
text: The assistant tosses the food on the counter as the Coroner
dialog: takes
dialog: 
scene_heading: A SHARP DISSECTING PROBE
dialog: 
text: from off the table and walks over to him.
dialog: 
text: The Coroner holds the dissecting probe up to the Assistant's
text: face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Yes. That's a probe.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, using his other hand, the Coroner
dialog: 
text: SHOVES HIS INDEX FINGER
dialog: 
text: up through the soft flesh under the Assistant's jaw hooking
text: his finger through the Assistant's mouth and jerking the
text: assistant's head down to
dialog: 
text: SMASH INTO THE METAL EXAMINING TABLE
dialog: 
text: Then, the Coroner takes the dissecting probe and drives it
text: into the back of the Assistant's skull. The Assistant
text: spasms...then goes still.
dialog: 
text: The Coroner turns and walks to the door, passing by a mirror.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE MIRROR
dialog: 
text: to see the reflection. It is not the coroner walking
dialog: by...it's
dialog: 
text: JASON VOORHEES, HOCKEY MASK IN PLACE!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 17 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Coroner/Jason strides out of the doors and walks past the
dialog: FBI men.
speaker_heading: FBI MAN 1
dialog: So that's the verdict -- is Jason
dialog: gonna be getting up and walking
dialog: around any time soon?
dialog: 
text: The Coroner/Jason stops and slowly turns back to the two
dialog: smiling FBI men -- there will be doom here very soon.
dialog: 
dialog: Over this we hear:

dialog: 
scene_heading: FULL-FRAME ON A TV SET
dialog: 
text: WHOOSHING SFX as the words "American Casefile" are stamped in
text: red across the screen. Behind them, a graphic of Jason's
text: hockey mask ZOOMS UP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: Jason Voorhees -- dead...or deadly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIDEO
dialog: 
text: Photos of the two FBI men from the morgue, dead and bloody,
text: as well as photos of the dead assistant coroner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: These dramatic photos were taken in
text: the aftermath of the autopsy of Jason
text: Voorhees, mere hours after his death
text: at the hands of Federal Forces. The
text: facts: Two security men -- dead. A
text: Coroner -- dead. Another Coroner --
dialog: missing. Are these men victims of
text: a serial killer only believed to be
dialog: deceased? Many say yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 19 INT. TV STUDIO - DAY
dialog: 
text: ROBERT CAMPBELL. In his early 30's, he's got T.V. good
text: looks. He speaks in the overly serious "journalese" of
text: tabloid television.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'm Robert Campbell. Tonight, on
dialog: American Casefile, we'll talk, via
dialog: satellite, to Mr. Creighton Duke --
dialog: the bounty hunter responsible for the
dialog: capture of six of this country's most
dialog: reviled serial killers/
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHOT WIDENS
dialog: 
text: to include Duke, playing idly with a small dagger.
dialog: 
text: We recognize him as the man who we saw watching Jason die.
text: It's difficult to say how old he is -- it's his life that has
dialog: weathered him, not his years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Mr. Duke, how can you claim that
dialog: Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: How many times has Jason been
dialog: reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Eight times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Eight times. They've burned him,
dialog: dipped him in nuclear waste --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: -- But this time they bombed him and
text: then cremated the body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: They coulda danced a jig on it an'
dialog: fed it to goats -- don't matter. Ya'
dialog: can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of
dialog: his body. He'll come back the way he
dialog: always do, to drag the kiddies into
dialog: the darkness and crush their little
dialog: skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr.
dialog: Campbell.
dialog: 
text: Campbell laughs and smiles winningly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Well, let's hope not!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
dialog: 
text: A look between the two of them.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: In the media, you've frequently been
dialog: described as "salty" --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: -- look, just shut up. Let's cut
dialog: through the shit. You asked me here
dialog: because you want me to catch and kill
dialog: Jason Voorhees for ya'. I'll do it,
dialog: but it won't be easy...and it won't
dialog: be cheap. One hundred grand, non-
dialog: negotiable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I understand. However, our audience
dialog: should be aware that you only charged
dialog: forty thousand dollars to catch the
dialog: Idaho skin stretcher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Skin stretcher was human.
dialog: 
text: Campbell takes a moment to make sure that isn't lost on his
text: audience. Duke leans in close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let's get one thing straight, Mr.
dialog: Campbell. This isn't your garden
dialog: variety serial killer -- there's only
dialog: one way to put and end ta' put an'
dialog: end to Jason Voorhees for all time
dialog: and I'm the only one that knows the
dialog: way. If you want him dead truly
dialog: dead -- my fee is one hundred grand.
dialog: You know where to find me.
dialog: 
text: Duke stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to
dialog: offer you your sum of one hundred
dialog: thousand dollars, payable only after
dialog: you provide American Casefile with
dialog: incontrovertible proof of --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: -- yeah, yeah, yeah. You just have
dialog: your hundred grand ready. For that
dialog: you get the machete...the mask...the
dialog: whole damn thing.
scene_heading: 20 INT. DINER STOCKROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: The TV suddenly SNAPS OFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
dialog: 
text: to see DIANA KIMBLE, leaning back after having just shut it
text: off. Sexy, in her early 40's, Diana is a waitress here in
text: "Joey B's Diner". Many people might be disturbed by the
text: notion that Jason Voorhees is still alive, but for
dialog: Diana...this means something much more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY B. (O.S.)
dialog: Hey! Lady Di!
dialog: 
text: Diana whirls around to see JOEY B. -- the frightening, no-
text: bullshit owner of the diner. She's a big woman with a big
dialog: attitude.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY B.
dialog: I'm sorry to cut into your TV time,
dialog: but there's a few customers out here
dialog: who'd like to eat sometime this
dialog: fuckin' month.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 21 INT. JOEY B'S DINER - DAY
dialog: 
dialog: "Joey B's Diner" may not be the last place in the world you'd
text: want to eat, but it's at least the second to last. A couple
text: of hockey masks hang from the ceiling and a banner proclaiming
text: "JASON IS DEAD -- 2 FOR 1 BURGER SALE!" hangs on the far wall.
dialog: 
text: Diana walks out and looks at this with an amused dismay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: This is truly sick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Tell me about it.
dialog: 
text: That comes from VICKI, the other waitress in the diner.
text: Early 20's, she's cute and she's tough. She moves off as
text: Joey B. steps up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY B.
dialog: No, this is not sick, Diana, this is
dialog: business. People are gonna come to
dialog: see Jason's hometown and they're
dialog: gonna come with appetites.
dialog: 
text: SHELBY, Joey B.'s husband and cook, leans out the serving
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: SHELBY
dialog: Di -- food's up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Thanks, Shelby.
dialog: 
text: Besides him, WARD, Shelby and Joey B.'s early 20's son,
text: sticks his head out as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Ma -- you seriously want me to cut
dialog: these like this?
dialog: 
text: He holds up a hamburger patty cut into the shape of a hockey
text: mask -- oval with punched out eyeholes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY B.
dialog: Yes I do!
dialog:

dialog: They look stupid...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY B.
dialog: Well, that's your dumbass fault --
dialog: they're supposed to look like hockey
dialog: masks! Now watch.
dialog: 
text: Joey B. quickly cuts a fresh hamburger patty into the
text: appropriate shape, then balls up the cut-away meat and holds
text: it up in front of Ward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY B.
dialog: This makes a whole new patty...hence
dialog: the 2 for 1 burger sale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELBY
dialog: My God, I love this woman.
dialog: 
text: They kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You guys make me sick.
dialog: 
text: They break apart. Shelby turns to Diana.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELBY
dialog: Table 3, Di.
dialog: 
text: We follow Diana as she picks up several plates and walks
text: towards a table, passing by STEVEN FREEMAN who sits at the
text: counter next to his friend RANDY -- a young cop in uniform.
text: Steven, early 20's and good-looking, turns to Diana -- what's
text: he's about to say is difficult for him but he tries to make
text: it seem casual.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Diana -- you heard from Jessica
dialog: lately?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: She sets a plate down in front of him and continues walking.
text: Randy turns to Steven with a wry smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Allright, you're gettin' somewhere...
dialog: 
text: We follow Diana to the table where JOSH (40's) and SHERIFF
text: LANDIS sit. Diana gives everyone their food as Randy walks
text: over and sits down with them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (to Josh)
text: Burger, side of fries.
dialog: (to Randy)
text: Double burger, side of rings.
dialog: (to Sheriff)
dialog: Meatloaf, side of me.
dialog: 
text: And she leans forward and plants a kiss on his lips. Josh
text: smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Where the hell was that on the menu?
dialog: I'd have ordered a couple.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (mock threat)
dialog: You keep movin' in on my woman and I
dialog: might have to take you out back and
dialog: shoot you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah, I've seen you shoot...
dialog: 
text: They all smile. It's a nice moment, until:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I don't know...
dialog: (baiting him)
dialog: ...I think you two should just go
dialog: ahead and get married.
dialog: 
text: The Sheriff turns to him.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I'm sorry, son, I'm going' a little
dialog: deaf in my old age...what did you say
dialog: again?
dialog: 
text: He stares at Randy fixedly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I said I think I'll just eat my food
text: over by Steven and shut the hell up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (to Josh)
dialog: That's exactly what I thought he said.
dialog: 
text: Randy smiles and walks over to Steven as the Sheriff turns to
text: Diana and affectionately rubs her back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Everything going okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It's going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Legs giving you trouble?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Not so bad, today.
dialog: 
text: The Sheriff watches Randy sit back beside Steven. Steven
text: glances over, catches the Sheriff's eye, then quickly turns
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Steven buggin' you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Do you have to ask?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Jesus, he's relentless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Let me talk to him, Diana. I just
dialog: need three minutes with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: Ed...
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: So how is Jessica? You talked to her
dialog: lately?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Yeah, she's good, considering. That
dialog: kid just takes everything in stride.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (mumbling into food)
dialog: Wonder where she got that from...
dialog: 
text: Diana smiles at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I gotta get back to work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Okay, I'll call you later.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a quick kiss, then walks off. Josh watches her
text: go, then fixes the Sheriff with a knowing stare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Don't say it...
dialog: 
text: Josh grins. He starts HUMMING THE WEDDING BELL MARCH.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How about this -- I'll make you a
dialog: deal...I'll marry Diana when you quit
dialog: banging Edna and concentrate on your
dialog: wife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Poor, lonely Diana...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON DIANA
dialog: 
text: as she arrives at another table. The customer's face is
text: hidden by a menu.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What can I get ya'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'll take a Voorhees burger and a
text: side of Jason Fingers.
text: The man lowers the menu. It's Duke. He smiles. Diana,
text: recognizing him, takes a step back. She recovers quickly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Anything else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Duke extends his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Creighton Duke.
dialog: 
text: Hesitantly, Diana shakes his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I know who you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I need to talk to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I'm kind of busy right now...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees --
dialog: and I need you to help me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
text: Jason Voorhees is dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You know he's not...and he's coming
dialog: for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You food'll be right out.
dialog: 
text: She turns to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I'll give you ten thousand dollars.
dialog: 
text: That stops her. She turns back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: No, I --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Twenty.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Look --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Thirty. Name your price. Everyone
dialog: has a price, what's yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Look, I don't want your money!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Then maybe I should offer it to your
dialog: daughter...
dialog: 
text: Diana does not, at any level, like Jessica being brought into
text: the conversation. She leans in close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: You know what I want. You know why
dialog: I need you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You need to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I know everything about you, Diana.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: That's it, we're done.
dialog: 
text: She turns to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I know who you really are!
dialog: 
text: This stops her in her tracks. Suddenly, we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: What's the problem here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: N...nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: I was just making your girlfriend
dialog: there a little proposition...she's
dialog: thinking it over. Right, luv?
dialog: 
text: The Sheriff steps forward.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Maybe you should be moving on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Maybe you should mind your own
dialog: business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Get up!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Why don't you blow me, Chief.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: After your girlfriend gets through.
dialog: 
text: The Sheriff thinks a second -- then, suddenly, he swings at
dialog: Duke.
dialog: 
text: With surprising speed, Duke's hand darts up, catching the
text: Sheriff's fist. But, with equally surprising speed, Landis
text: brings his gun up under the man's chin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You're talking about my lady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: She's your lady only cause she ain't
dialog: had a taste of the Duke yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Goddamnit!
dialog: 
text: He grabs Duke, pulling him up from the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: Careful, Chief. I don't think you
dialog: know who I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I know who you are and the last thing
dialog: we need around here is some freak
text: show "bounty hunter" making trouble.
dialog: I want you outta town and I want you
dialog: outta town now!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: That's very colorful, chief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (to Randy)
dialog: Take him to my car. I'll be out in
text: a minute.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: He's comin' for you, Diana...and your
dialog: daughter. Lock your doors.
dialog: 
text: Randy takes Duke away. The Sheriff turns to Diana, a little
text: proud, a little manly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I'm sorry if he upset you...
dialog: 
text: Diana angrily turns to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I don't need you to fight my battle.
dialog: I don't need any part-time protection.
dialog: 
text: Saying that, she walks off. The Sheriff glances around at
text: the people in the diner then, a little cowed, goes outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON DIANA
dialog: 
text: as she walks up to the counter where Steven sits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: He seem to think Jason's...
dialog: (in Duke's accent)
dialog: ...comin' fer ya'?
dialog: 
text: He smiles. She doesn't. Vicki walks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 
text: Diana nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Vicki moves off. When she does, Diana turns to Steven.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Steven, I need to talk to you.
dialog: There's something you don't know
dialog: about Jessica, something you should
dialog: know. She was going to tell you
dialog: herself but...
dialog: 
text: Diana looks up and stares out the window.
speaker_heading: HER POV
dialog: 
text: One of Joey B's hockey mask spins slowly in her field of
text: vision, but instead of looking cheesy...it now seems
text: scary...foreboding. Diana turns back to Steven.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: ...but there just may not be enough
dialog: time. If you still care about her,
dialog: if you still want to try to make
dialog: things better between you two...we
dialog: should talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So let's talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: No. Not here. Come by my house
dialog: tonight at eleven. Don't be late.
dialog: 
text: As Steven looks at her worried face, we
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 22 EXT. JOEY B'S DINER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Diana comes out the back door of the diner, taking the
text: garbage out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POV SHOT
dialog: 
text: slowly moving in on her, stalking. There shadows, the dark
text: gaps of night and woods between her and the trash...we just
text: know that she is going to die.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE DUMPSTER
dialog: 
text: as Diana approaches it. She flings it open with a LOUD BANG
text: then dumps the trash in. We stay close...sure she is going
dialog: into that dumpster with her trash...
dialog: 
text: But no...she finishes and turns...
dialog: 
dialog: ...Right into Josh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Jesus!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Sorry, Di. I was just going to my
dialog: car. I didn't mean to frighten you...
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It's...It's all right.
dialog: 
text: Josh takes the trash can from her...carries it back towards
text: the diner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Listen...don't you worry about Ed.
dialog: He'll come around. He's too good a
dialog: Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I'm just too old for going steady,
dialog: Josh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So's he and he knows it.
dialog: 
text: They've reached the diner. He opens the door for her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Everything'll work out. Trust me on
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Good night, beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: 'Night, Josh.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a quick hug, then closes the diner door, going
text: back inside to clean up.
dialog: 
text: Josh steps off the porch and around back to the parking lot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STALKER'S POV
dialog: 
text: following him, moving in, closer...
dialog: 
text: IN THE PARKING LOT
dialog: 
text: EDNA steps out of her car as Josh approaches. She's an
text: attractive woman around Josh's age. He smiles and moves to
text: kiss her. She stops him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Not here.
dialog: 
text: She looks around nervously.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sorry I'm late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Bill didn't go bowling at the regular
dialog: time?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: The League changed the damn
dialog: time...but we've still got 'til ten-
dialog: thirty. Hop in.
dialog: 
text: Josh smiles and hurries to the passenger side of the car as
text: Edna climbs back in behind the wheel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STALKER'S POV
dialog: 
text: Suddenly rushing towards the car, smashing into the driver's
text: door, slamming it shut with tremendous force just as Edna's
text: head is lowered to enter.
dialog: 
text: She is dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STALKER'S POV
dialog: 
text: Turns to Josh who stands frozen in absolute terror.

scene_heading: POV RUSHES AT HIM
dialog: 
dialog: as we --

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: BLACK, then slowly
dialog: 
scene_heading: FADE UP ON:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 23 INT. VOORHEES HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON JOSH
dialog: 
text: Strapped on a metal table. Straps across his body. Even a
text: strap to hold his head firmly in place. FIRELIGHT dances
text: across his apparently nude body and his terror-stricken eyes.
text: His terror grows as a shadow leans in to cover his face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE CORONER/JOSH
dialog: 
text: As he looks down at Josh. It is the coroner we see, but his
text: eyes are those black empty pools of Jason's evil. Many large
text: sores cover the man's face.
text: Even as we watch, another seems to push its way forth from
text: the skin. Clearly, they weaken the man. He sways slightly.
text: Catches his balance... and raises something into view. A
scene_heading: STRANGER RAZOR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON JOSH
dialog: 
text: As he begins to whimper. The man lowers the razor towards
text: his face. The blade glints in the firelight as the
text: Coroner/Jason brings it down, closer... closer... until its
text: sharp edge touches Josh's skin. Then, suddenly,
dialog: 
text: The man begins to give Josh a shave!
dialog: 
text: The SCRAPE of the razor is loud against Josh's unlathered
text: moustache.
dialog: 
text: Now the cornoner/Jason moves the blade across Josh's Adam's
text: apple... carefully, expertly.
dialog: 
text: When the man is finished, there is a long, uncertain beat,
text: then his hands bring a hot towel into view.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH'S POV
dialog: 
text: As the towel is laid over his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
dialog: 
text: Over which we hear the STRANGLED SOUNDS of the Coroner/Jason
text: breathing -- what the hell is he doing? After a long moment,
text: the towel is lifted and, still in
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOSH'S POV
dialog: 
text: We see the coroner/Jason lean in, opening his mouth wide,
text: until his face fills the screen.
dialog: 
text: A beat, then Josh SCREAMS a horrible SCREAM as we
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 24 EXT. VOORHEES HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: There is a dark and evil aura to the house, but it is not the
text: Victorian haunted house of some storybook tale of ghosts. This
text: a place built as a summer home in the forties... abandoned many
text: years ago... it looks now as if it is dissolving slowly back
text: into the small, encroaching corner of the lake behind it and
text: into the woods around it.
dialog: 
dialog: But the sense of evil doesn't come from the rot or the
dialog: decay... those are just symptoms.
dialog: The sense of evil comes from the core of darkness that we can
text: feel in every gaping window. In every shadow. In the dark
text: shadows of the trees and the darker waters of the lake.
dialog: 
text: As Josh continues to SCREAM, we
dialog: 
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:

scene_heading: 25 INT. DINER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Steven and Randy sit by the counter, Vicki stands beside them
text: and we can see Ward back in the kitchen, cooking up some food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (to Vicki)
dialog: What do you mean you've never made a
dialog: prank call?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Never.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You mean never as in really never, or
dialog: never as in it was just so stupid you
dialog: don't want to tell us about it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I mean really never.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that. A famous man
dialog: once said -- there is no worse regret
text: then a temptation resisted.
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really
dialog: lovely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I mean, how can you go through life
dialog: without never having made a prank
dialog: call?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was
dialog: like, having strippers delivered to
dialog: church Bingos and shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: That's disgusting.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Disgusting? Bingo night was sold out
dialog: for six months after that! They
dialog: raised enough money to build a day
dialog: care center.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: It was a community service.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Absolutely. The church even sent me
text: an autographed picture of God.
dialog: (yelling to the back)
dialog: Ward!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: (shouting from back)
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You ever make a prank call?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I called an adoption agency once when
dialog: I was like nine or something and I
dialog: told them I wanted to trade my mom in
text: for a box of Lincoln Logs.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a wet sponge comes flying in from offscreen and
text: hits Ward in the face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY B. (O.S.)
dialog: Why don't you shut the fuck up and
dialog: cook those burgers?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I really wanted those fuckin' Logs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON STEVEN
dialog: 
text: As he gets up and walks over to the pay phone in the diner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
text: Showing Vicki what she missed out on
dialog: by being such a dull kid. Now, the
dialog: first thing you need in making a
dialog: prank call is, of course, a phone.
dialog: (holds up the phone)
dialog: This one, for instance.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Next, you dial a number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Really, Steven, I don't want you to
dialog: do this...
dialog: 
text: Steven dials a number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
dialog: 
text: The receiver to see Steven click it off out of view of the
dialog: others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
text: ...and it's now ringing...ringing...
dialog: and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria?
dialog: Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker
text: over at the station.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just
dialog: have one question for you, Anthony --
dialog: did you fuck my dog?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Oh my God, Steven.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if
dialog: I find out it was you, I'm gonna come
dialog: over there and shoot you in the head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I'm now begging you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Listen, since I got you on the
dialog: phone -- ask the guys there if they
dialog: wanna chip in for a hooker. I'll
dialog: send her right over. Her name is
dialog: Vicki.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Steven!
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: She's a waitress at Joey B's but she
dialog: needs some extra cash. Ward's the
dialog: pimp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: I'm literally going to kill you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to
dialog: you -- you can have her for a pizza.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: A pizza?!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Randy walks up to Steven and quickly handcuffs him
text: to the metal phone cord.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (to Randy)
dialog: Randy, what the fuck? Take these off!
dialog: 
text: Wards sets two paper bags down on the counter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: (to Randy)
dialog: Food's ready. Tell the guys at the
dialog: station the pimp says hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (taking food)
dialog: Sure thing. See ya', Steven.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Randy, you dipshit! Take these off!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Sorry, I'm working now. You see, I
dialog: have a job...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Randy, c'mon!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Have a good night.
dialog: 
text: The Steven glances at the clock -- 11:10. He was supposed to
dialog: meet Diana ten minutes ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Ah, shit.
dialog: 
text: With startling speed, Steven pops off the cuff on his wrist,
text: hangs up, then turns to Randy waving his free wrist.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Wanna know how I did that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (Steven smiles)
dialog: Gotta go. See you guys later.
dialog: 
text: He runs past Randy to the door of the diner, then stops and
text: turns to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: By the way, if you'd been paying
dialog: attention you'd have noticed I held
dialog: the receiver down when I dialed --
dialog: cop like you should be more observant
dialog: than that.
dialog: 
text: And he rushes out of the diner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: He drives me so fucking crazy.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 26 INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA

scene_heading: 28 INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Diana is as happy as she's ever been. The man (who we now
text: recognize as Josh) is still approaching from the shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: God, Ed, I love you too, I...
dialog: 
text: Now directly behind Diana, Josh snakes a hand out, snatches
text: the receiver from her then slams it back into its cradle.
dialog: 
text: Diana only ha time for a STARTLED GASP as Josh grabs her. He
text: takes her head in a firm embrace and draws her face close to
dialog: his.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Josh! What are you doing!
dialog: 
text: His lips draw closer and closer to hers. His eyes are cold,
text: empty places.
dialog: 
text: She turns her head to the side, away from Josh. Her eyes
text: open in a terror born of absolute disbelief and a certain
text: knowledge that, except for the pain, she is already dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA'S POV
dialog: 
text: On the mirror over the mantle. In the reflection she sees
text: not Josh, but Jason Voorhees, mask in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Oh God...Oh Jesus...
speaker_heading: ON JOSH/JASON
dialog: 
text: As he reaches out to Diana, turns her head back to his and
text: opens his mouth -- it's dank and vile and there's something
text: in there, something that writhes horribly, the same oozing
text: color as Jason's dark heart.
dialog: 
text: As the thing squirms out from between his teeth and towards
text: Diana's lips, she manages to screams last:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Panicked, determined, she reaches down and opens the drawer
text: of the phone table.
dialog: 
text: Inside is a service revolver.
dialog: 
text: The phone begins to RING AGAIN as Diana grabs the gun and
text: sticks it against Josh's temple as the black thing in his
text: mouth begins to pry her lips apart, trying to worm inside.
dialog: 
text: She pulls the trigger.
dialog: 
text: The SHOT RINGS LOUD in the room. Josh/Jason staggers back,
text: falls to his knees. He's been shot in the back of the head at
dialog: close range -- it's a wound that would kill anyone human.
dialog: 
text: The phone CONTINUES TO RING, until it is knocked off it's
text: cradle by Diana as she turns and runs to the patio door.
dialog: 
text: It's locked.
dialog: 
text: She fiddles with it, trying to open it, then glances back to
text: make sure Josh/Jason isn't coming for her.
dialog: 
text: Josh/Jason isn't there.
dialog: 
text: Oh, shit. She back against a wall, looking around -- where
text: is he? She turns. He's not there. She spots the phone and
text: moves towards it.
dialog: 
text: Then, from the darkness of the shadows...
dialog: 
text: ...Josh/Jason leaps out at her, grabs her and flings her down
text: to the floor.
dialog: 
text: The injured, but very obviously alive Josh/Jason holds
text: Diana's head firmly against the carpet. He lowers his mouth
text: towards hers and, once again, that black thing in his mouth
text: squirms through his lips. The phone keeps RINGING and
dialog: RINGING...
text: Suddenly, the room is bathed in light as a car pulls up
text: outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 29 INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Steven enters. He sees blood and, hearing Diana SCREAM,
dialog: rushes into
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 30 INT. DIANA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: and leaps on Josh, his momentum knocking the man off Diana
text: before Josh can force the horrible, squirming thing from his
text: mouth into hers -- but the advantage is just momentary.
dialog: 
text: Josh/Jason turns to Steven and grabs him by his shirt,
text: picking him up off the ground with what is clearly superhuman
text: strength and throws him against the nearest wall.
dialog: 
text: Steven hits the wall with a sharp, nearly back-breaking
text: impact. He lies for a moment, stunned, near unconsciousness,
text: then he regains his bearings just in time to see Josh/Jason
text: taking a knife sharpening pole from the knife rack next to
text: him in the kitchen.
dialog: 
text: Then Josh/Jason turns and flings the instrument through the
text: air at Steven just as Diana runs up to see if Steven's okay.
dialog: 
text: The pole pierces Diana through the back.
dialog: 
text: She looks up at Steven with a stunned expression and then
text: sinks down to the floor revealing Josh/Jason behind her.
dialog: 
text: There is a fury in him now that is terrible to behold. An
text: unearthly SCREAM of frustration and rage tears from his
text: throat. His hands reach out, ready to tear into Steven.
dialog: 
text: Steven manages to duck, roll and come up beside the fireplace.
dialog: 
text: Josh/Jason turns and charges at Steven.
dialog: 
text: Steven grabs a fireplace poker and rams it with all of his
text: strength through Josh/Jason's chest.
dialog: 
text: As he does this, he is positioned so that he can't help but
text: see the reflection in the mirror. He sees Jason Voorhees
text: struggling furiously... trying to pull the poker out of his
text: chest. In trying to do that, Josh/Jason is thrown backward.
dialog: 
text: He crashes through a window and falls outside.
dialog: 
text: Steven rushes back to Diana. He bends, taking her in his
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: You saw him? You know who he is?
dialog: 
text: Steven nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA

dialog: You have to...save...Jessica... Save
dialog: Jessica and save the...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: The what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Save your...
dialog: 
text: But the pain is too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Steven...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I'm scared. I'm very scared.
dialog: 
text: All Steven can do is hold her. Her eyes close. She dies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, God Almighty, no...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SHERIFF
dialog: 
text: Standing there, staring, in shock. He pulls his gun.
dialog: 
text: As he does this, Steven sets Diana down and runs towards the
dialog: window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
text: It was Josh. He fell outside. He --
dialog: 
text: Steven looks out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN'S POV
dialog: 
text: There is nothing there but darkness. Josh/Jason is gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON STEVEN
dialog: 
text: As he turns back to SHERIFF. The man kneels by Diana.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Oh, my dear God...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (really to himself)
dialog: He was dead. He had to be dead...
dialog: 
text: SHERIFF looks up at Steven.
dialog: 
text: The boy stands covered in blood. Suddenly, he realizes what
dialog: this must look like.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No... you can't think I...
dialog: 
text: But SHERIFF's eyes grow cold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 31 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Steven is in this dismal interrogation room. He's tired,
text: frightened, angry. We don't know how long he's been here,
text: but it's clearly been a long time. SHERIFF and Steven's
text: friend, Randy, are in the room with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: How many times do you want to hear
dialog: this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Until I hear the truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I've told you the truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: The truth? That Josh, a man I've
dialog: trusted with my own life on more than
dialog: one occasion -- let me see if I've
dialog: got the order right here -- tried to
dialog: rape Diana...got the back of his head
text: blown off...took a poker through the
text: gut...fell through a plate glass
text: window and then magically disappeared
text: into the night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I know what it sounds like.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You don't know shit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I didn't kill her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Then why were you at her house?! She
dialog: didn't want anything to do with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: She asked me to come over. She said
dialog: she had something to tell me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: About what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: About Jessica.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: That's a lie. Diana would never talk
dialog: to you about Jessica. Not after what
dialog: you did to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Look, I know I treated her bad --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: -- Bad?!
dialog: 
text: SHERIFF suddenly hauls off, WHACKS STEVEN ACROSS THE FACE
text: then grabs him by the collar and pulls him close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You call what you did bad?! You
dialog: knocked her up and then left her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No -- she left me! After her
dialog: miscarriage, I --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: -- Miscarriage?! Who the fuck told
dialog: you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: She did!
dialog: 
text: SHERIFF looks at Steven with an almost astonished pity.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: My God...you are one sorry son-of-a-
dialog: bitch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (a little frantic)
dialog: She did have a miscarriage, didn't
dialog: she? Didn't she?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a-
dialog: bitch...
dialog: 
text: Defeated, eyes filled with loss and anger, SHERIFF turns and
text: walks away. Then, just before he exits, he turns back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: If I wasn't the Sheriff here, if I
dialog: thought I could get away with it...
dialog: I would kill you right now. That's
dialog: no exaggeration.
dialog: (to Randy)
dialog: I'll be back.
dialog: 
text: The Sheriff leaves.
dialog: 
text: Steven watches him go, then turns to Randy who can't quite
text: bring himself to meet Steven's steady gaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Do you believe me?
dialog: 
text: Randy has to think about this. Finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I don't believe that you murdered
dialog: Diana. I don't know what really
dialog: happened, but I know you couldn't
dialog: have done it.
dialog: 
text: Steven nods -- that's going to have to be enough for now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You just sit tight -- I'm gonna take
dialog: care of this. I'll straighten
dialog: everything out.
dialog: 
text: Steven SIGHS, then closes his eyes and rubs them.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Jesus, Randy...

dialog: ...what is Jessica gonna do?

speaker_heading: ON VICKI
dialog:

speaker_heading: JESSICA

dialog: Oh, God, Vick...

speaker_heading: VICKI

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI

speaker_heading: VICKI
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: ON JESSICA
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON STEVEN
dialog: 
text: As his eyes widen, realizing what this means, what it was
dialog: that Diana was going to tell him, what Landis meant by his

dialog: 
text: This is his daughter he's looking at.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: My God...
dialog:

text: It's Robert Campbell, the host of "American Casefile".

speaker_heading: OFFICER DILL (O.S.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: What's the problem?

speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Bring him here. I wanna talk to him.

speaker_heading: DUKE
dialog: (matter-of-factly)
