dialog: MUSIC of Finlandia type behind credits builds to
dialog: crescendo on ...
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 1. PAN SHOT - SPECIAL EFFECTS - NIGHT
text: - of star-studded heavens at night. Scattered cumulus
text: clouds alternately obscure and disclose a three-quarter
text: moon and vast open deeps of glittering constellations.
text: The music diminishes and backs the voice of the narra-
dialog: tor.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Since the beginning of Time the people
dialog: of our Earth have looked upon the stars
dialog: and pondered - They wondered what man-
dialog: ner of man - or creature - inhabited
dialog: the faint mysterious worlds that lay
dialog: beyond.
scene_heading: 2. EXT. MT. WILSON OBSERVATORY - NIGHT - LONG SHOT
text: Large telescope pivoting against the sky.
scene_heading: 3. INT. TELESCOPE ROOM - NIGHT - MED. SHOT
text: Two Astronomers - adjusting eye-pieces.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR

dialog: failed to penetrate the dark and awe-
dialog: some secret.
scene_heading: 4. INT. TELESCOPE ROOM - DIFFERENT OBSERVATORY - NIGHT -
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: White haired astronomer - peering into the eye-piece of
dialog: a telescope.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Men still probe the deeps of space -
dialog: men of all ages - seeking the answer.
scene_heading: 5. INT. DAVID MacLEAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT
dialog: of telescope - DOLLY BACK to disclose David MacLean -
text: a twelve year old boy, who is sitting on the floor
text: with his eyes glued to a telescope. He is dressed
text: in rumpled pajamas. A student lamp on the floor
text: lights the scene in low key. A star map and nauti-
text: cal almanac lay on the floor in high key under the
dialog: lamp. A small Cairn terrier named Cricket stares
text: up at him with wistful curiosity.
scene_heading: 6. INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - MED. SHOT
text: - as David moves back from the telescope and rubs
text: his eyes with his knuckles. He leafs through the
dialog: nautical almanac and reaches for the aluminum can-
text: teen on the window sill. It falls to the floor with
text: a clatter. He picks it up quickly and listens ap-
text: prehensively for an indication that he has awakened
text: his parents; sighs with relief and glances at an
text: alarm clock on the window sill which reads 3:40.
text: He unscrews the canteen stopper and tilts it to
text: drink; then stops as a bright light illuminates the
dialog: darkness outside the window.
scene_heading: 7. INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FULL SHOT - SPECIAL
speaker_heading: EFFECTS
text: David's angle - through window, of a swiftly descend-
text: ing ball of brilliant white fire as it sweeps down
text: out of the heavens, hovers for a moment, then drops
text: behind foreground trees.
scene_heading: 8. INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT
text: David - his face highlighted by the ball of fire as
text: he stares with incredible bewilderment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (with awe)
dialog: Well - Gee Whiz!
scene_heading: 9. INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - MED. SHOT
text: David crosses to foot of bed, puts on his bathrobe
text: and slippers; climbs through the window, chirping
text: at the dog, Cricket, who hops up on the window sill
text: and follows him out.
scene_heading: 10. EXT. BACK OF MacLEAN'S HOUSE - FIELD IN B.G. - NIGHT -
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: - as David turns and looks at the dog, who growls and
text: trots toward the field. David follows him toward
text: field, but stops suddenly.
scene_heading: 11. EXT. MacLEAN FIELD - SHOOTING AWAY FROM HOUSE - NIGHT -
speaker_heading: (SPECIAL EFFECTS)
text: David sees a brilliant white light glow suddenly in
text: the distance. It casts a gigantic black shadow of a
dialog: thing that could be a man against the flank of the
text: dark hill. The light goes out suddenly and a strange
text: humming sound fills the air.
scene_heading: 12. EXT. BACK OF MacLEAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT - REVERSE MED.
speaker_heading: SHOT
text: David reacts with amazement to what he has seen, he
text: turns and runs toward house followed by Cricket.
scene_heading: 13. INT. DAVID'S ROOM - SHOOTING TOWARD FIELD - NIGHT
text: - as the dog jumps through the window, followed by
text: David, who grabs a flashlight. CAMERA PANS with David
text: as he exits into the hall.
scene_heading: 14. INT. MR. &. MRS. MacLEAN'S BEDROOM - (LOW KEY) - NIGHT -
speaker_heading: MED. SHOT
text: David bursts through the door and shines the flash-
text: light on the bed and his father and mother sit up.
text: MacLean fumbles for the table light and shades his
text: eyes against the flashlight. He turns on the light.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: (with concern)
dialog: What's the matter, David? Are you
dialog: all right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Dad - listen! I saw a - a - a some-
dialog: thing - just landed in our field.
dialog: A flying saucer or something!
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A space ship - I think. It's there
dialog: now - over by the hill. Come on,
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (with weary exasper-
dialog: ation)
dialog: Have you gone completely crazy - four
dialog: o'clock in the morning!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But, Dad - I saw it - I tell you ...
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: Oh, you had a dream, dear - a night-
dialog: mare.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wasn't asleep! I saw it -- it
dialog: landed in our field!
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (putting his feet on
dialog: floor)
dialog: Now, that's enough!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But, Dad ...
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: All right, march!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (leaving, followed by
dialog: Cricket)
dialog: Aw, gee!
dialog: (he slams door)
text: MacLean gets up and puts on his slippers.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: Oh, John, don't scold him. He didn't
dialog: mean to slam the door.
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (walking towards door
dialog: and yawning)
dialog: I'm not - I'm just going to see that
dialog: he goes to bed.
scene_heading: 15. INT. DAVID'S ROOM - NIGHT - FULL SHOT
text: He is standing by the window, staring out. Cricket
text: has his forepaws on the window-sill. The door opens,
text: David turns and looks at his father guiltily as he
text: closes the door. MacLean indicates the bed with his
text: thumb. With a sigh, David shucks off his bathrobe and
text: slippers and crawls into the bed. Cricket jumps onto
text: the foot of the bed. MacLean crosses to a wardrobe
text: chest and selects a medicine bottle and a spoon from
text: the top of it. He returns and sits on the side of the
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not sick!
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (shakes bottle and pours
dialog: into spoon)
dialog: I know - this is some of that stuff
dialog: Doctor Weber left to make you sleep
dialog: when you had the flu. Come on - open
dialog: up.
text: David looks at his father with exasperated patience
dialog: and with a shrug of martyrdom swallows the medicine
text: and drops back on his pillow.
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Now what makes you think you saw a
dialog: flying saucer?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (rising on elbows, try-
dialog: ing to convince him)
dialog: I don't think, Dad - I know - I --
text: MacLean, with a smile, pushes him back on the pillow.
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: Maybe it was one of the experiment-
dialog: al rockets from over at White Sands -
dialog: (David shakes his head)
dialog: If anything had fallen in the field -
dialog: I'd have heard it, wouldn't I?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It didn't fall, Dad - it landed over
dialog: in the field. Blossom! Gee, Dad,
dialog: Blossom's out there! We'd better go
dialog: get her!
text: MacLean regards the boy with a patient affectionate
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Blossom is an intelligent cow - she
dialog: can take care of herself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But, Dad --
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: You've been reading too many of
dialog: those Science Stories - flying
dialog: saucers!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (yawning)
dialog: But I saw it! And Cricket saw it -
dialog: he growled!
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (fondling the dog)
text: He growls at hoot owls too - and
dialog: shadows! And I want you to stop
text: growling at shadows and go to sleep.
text: David stares at him with patient resignation.
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: Tomorrow morning I'll take my 12
dialog: gauge and you take your .410 and
dialog: you and I and Cricket will go out
dialog: in that field and if there's any
dialog: space ship or flying saucer out
dialog: there, we'll take a shot at it -
dialog: especially if they've bothered our
dialog: cow!
text: David, feeling the effects of the sedative, yawns
text: again. His father runs his fingers lightly through
text: David's hair in a soothing fashion.
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: That's a good boy - go to sleep.
text: David's eyes close and MacLean gets up softly, tiptoes
text: to the light-switch and turns out the light.
speaker_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 16. EXT. MacLEAN FIELD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT
text: Nothing is moving, the bellow of a cow is HEARD over
dialog: scene.
scene_heading: 17. INT. MR. & MRS. MacLEAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - MED. SHOT
dialog: (Very low key) - Moonlight through bedroom window
text: - Mrs. MacLean's voice comes over scene with alarmed
dialog: insistence.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: John! -- John! --
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
dialog: (annoyed and sleepy)
dialog: Now what's the matter?
text: Off scene is HEARD the low mournful bellowing of a cow.
text: The light goes on, revealing MacLean irritably rubbing
dialog: his eyes.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: The cow - something's wrong with
dialog: her.
text: The cow's mooing rises to a terrified bellowing.
speaker_heading: MacLEAN
text: Probably caught in the fence.
text: He gets up, puts on his shoes and bathrobe and takes a
dialog: flashlight.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: Hurry she may be hurt!
dialog: As MacLean exits -
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: 18. EXT. MacLEAN FIELD - NIGHT - MED. SHOT

text: MacLean house in background. David and Cricket, in
text: foreground, are walking hesitantly into the field.
text: There is a sudden high-frequency hum and both David
text: and the dog stare at the ground, which trembles
text: slightly. David turns and runs toward the house, fol-
dialog: lowed by Cricket.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 20. EXT. FRONT OF MacLEAN HOUSE - MORNING - MED. SHOT
text: A police car stands in front of the house and two of-
text: ficers stand on the front porch, talking to Mrs. Mac-
dialog: Lean.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: - and I can't understand what hap-
dialog: pened to him!
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: (reassuringly)
dialog: You say he's been gone for ...
dialog: David and Cricket run into scene.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: What's the matter, David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (breathlessly)
dialog: - over there in the field - I heard
dialog: something - I mean - it was more
dialog: like I felt something.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know - a kind of buzzing
text: sound deep down under the ground.
speaker_heading: MRS. MacLEAN
dialog: Oh, David, this is no time to let
dialog: your imagination run away with you
dialog: when I'm so concerned about your
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: Don't worry, we'll find him, Mrs.
dialog: MacLean. Come on Blaine.

text: They stop and look around.
speaker_heading: JACKSON

speaker_heading: BLAINE

speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: You take the north side, and I'll
dialog: look over here.
speaker_heading: BLAINE
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: 22. EXT. MacLEAN FIELD - DAY - FULL SHOT

scene_heading: 23. EXT. MacLEAN FIELD - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: Blaine looking at flashlight in the grass.
scene_heading: 24. EXT. MacLEAN FIELD - DAY - CLOSE SHOT

speaker_heading: PAT

speaker_heading: KELSTON
dialog: I'm afraid it is.
speaker_heading: PAT

speaker_heading: KELSTON
dialog: Because of the operations at

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: But all they're doing at White
dialog: Sands is just shooting rockets

speaker_heading: KELSTON
dialog: Exactly. Very high up into the

scene_heading: 172. EXT. MacLEAN FIELD - DAY - MED. SHOT

scene_heading: 180. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - LOW KEY - CLOSE SHOT
text: Pat's face -- as she looks up and reacts with terrified
text: scream, shrinking back.
scene_heading: 181. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - LOW KEY - MED. CLOSE SHOT
dialog: Reverse - Pat's angle.
text: Two Mutants stand over her looking down. The lighting
text: of the tunnel scenes seems to come from a luminous
dialog: quality in the walls of the tunnels themselves. These
text: tunnels are cut through the earth by an atomic heat ray
text: which blasts a hole through the earth and fuses the
text: silica along the walls of the tunnel into a radio-active,
dialog: phosphorescent glassy-like substance. (For these shots
dialog: we will use water glass sprayed on cellophane and back
dialog: light it with hot arcs.)
dialog: These creatures are mutations developed by the Martians
dialog: for physical labor. They are humanoid in appearance,
text: but are covered with a coarse black hair. (Flocked
text: baggy tights.) Their feet are about twice the length
dialog: of human feet and the four toes of each foot terminate
text: in heavy black digging claws. The fingers are much long-
dialog: er than human fingers and are equipped with black, non-
text: retractable digging claws. A hairless, snout-like nose,
text: similar to a mole's, protrudes from the front of the
text: face. They are with ears, and beady-like reflecting
text: eyes look out from the hairy mask of the face. At no
dialog: time do they utter any sound, for these creatures are
text: telepathic. One of the mutants leans forward into CAM-
text: ERA with extended long prehensile fingers.
scene_heading: 182. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Pat -- as she cowers back and the long black fingers
text: curl around her wrist. Pat screams and struggles fran-
text: tically and another long black hand comes into scene and
text: grasps the other wrist.
scene_heading: 193. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: David is lying unconscious from his fall, momentarily
text: ignored by the mutants. A mutant grabs at Pat's shoul-
text: der. Pat struggles frantically. Her screams revert to
text: hoarse gasps of effort and terror, and in the struggle
text: her dress is ripped. The long fingers of a hand curl
text: around Pat's neck and squeeze for a moment. She sudden-
text: ly relaxes into unconsciousness. One of the two mutants
text: picks her up, the other picks up David. They lope away
text: with them down the tunnel into infinity and darkness.
scene_heading: 194. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - LONG SHOT
text: The two mutants lope past CAMERA carrying the two inert
text: figures. They disappear around a corner of the tunnel.
scene_heading: 185. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: Mutants rounding another turn, carrying Pat and David

speaker_heading: QUICK DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 186. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: From an open metal trapdoor in b.g. there emanates a
text: stronger light. The two mutants pass CAMERA and lope
text: toward metal door. They enter.
scene_heading: 187. INT. CENTRAL AREA OF SPACE SHIP - DAY - FULL SHOT
text: It is a circular room some twenty feet in diameter,
text: approximately fifteen feet high. It is composed of a
text: shiny metallic substance similar to polished aluminum.
text: The only rivets in evidence mark the outline of bulk-
text: heads spaced around the perimeter of the walls. Upper
text: left, near the spiral steel staircase, a low metal table
text: is near the wall. It is flanked by two stationary met-
text: al benches. The room is dome-like in structure, and an
dialog: area twelve feet in diameter and approximately eight
text: feet in height occupies the apex of the dome, which is
dialog: of a transparent plastic substance. This is the control
text: tower of the space ship. A bank of control panels is
text: placed in this structure and a round, cushioned pilot's
text: seat is suspended on a crosswalk of perforated metal
text: girders. The room is illuminated by a series of circu-
dialog: lar lights which look like portholes. Even so, the
text: lighting is in comparative low key. The two mutants
dialog: descend a spiral staircase and bring Pat and David to
text: the center of the room and lay their unconscious bodies
text: on the floor. Then they step back approximately five
text: feet and assume a rigid attitude grotesquely reminiscent
dialog: of soldiers.
scene_heading: 198. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - LOW KEY - DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: A bulkhead opens in the upstage wall. Sergeant Balardi
text: enters, walking like an automaton. He walks up to Pat,
text: facing upstage. Then a mutant backs out of the bulk-
text: head carrying a Martian seated on a circular metal tray,
text: which is surmounted by a plastic bell jar. Another mu-
text: tant enters, supporting the other handles of the metal
text: tray. A mutant steps forward quickly and places a cir-
dialog: cular metal drum approximately three feet in diameter
text: and thirty inches in height in front of Pat. The other
text: two mutants then place the Martian on the drum and step
dialog: back and assume an attitude of attention: TRUCK in to
dialog: CLOSE SHOT - THE MARTIAN -- He is approximately thirty
text: inches in height, dressed in a singlet that resembles
text: soft chain mail. Over this is a gorget of soft black
text: material similar to velvet. He is seated, tailor-
text: fashion, on a circular cushion resembling sponge rubber.
dialog: He is extremely brontocephalic, and his tremendously
text: large skull is completely devoid of hair. His eyes are
text: small and deep-set and peer from their dark sockets
text: with a strange ophidion lustre. He is entirely covered
text: by the plastic bell jar, and sits so frozen and unmoving
dialog: that he appears to be a wax figure until we are suddenly
text: aware of the eyes moving to the right, then to the left,
text: then down, where he focuses upon Pat.
scene_heading: 189. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - MED. CLOSE SHOT
text: Pat is unconscious on the floor. She stirs into con-
text: sciousness, sits up, then stands, facing the CAMERA.
text: Her eyes widen and stare straight ahead.
scene_heading: 190. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - CLOSE SHOT
text: Martian's eyes - staring into CAMERA.
scene_heading: 191. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - CLOSE SHOT
text: Pat is drawn by the hypnotic stare of the Martian. She
dialog: fights it off.
scene_heading: 192. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: Martian, Balardi and Pat. David is still unconscious
text: on the floor. Balardi stands stiffly.
speaker_heading: BALARDI

dialog: What is your name?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: (in a strained, hoarse
dialog: voice)
dialog: Patricia Collins.
speaker_heading: BALARDI
dialog: (indicating the Martian)
dialog: He is from the fourth planet -- which
dialog: you call Mars. He wants to know what
dialog: they plan to do - those people up above.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: I don't know --
speaker_heading: BALARDI
dialog: Yes, you do -- and you will answer
dialog: in a few moments.
text: He gestures to the mutants.
scene_heading: 193. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: -- as two mutants approach Pat and suddenly grab her
text: arms. She attempts to struggle, but is held in a vise-
text: like grip. She turns suddenly and stares, her eyes
text: widen further with horror. A panel on a bulkhead swings
text: open and a mutant pushes a chromium, wheeled operating
text: table into scene. A tray of surgical instruments is on
dialog: the table.
scene_heading: 194. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: The surgeon mutant lifts a hypodermic needle and ad-
text: vances toward Pat. She screams piercingly and hysteric-
text: ally and continues to scream.
scene_heading: 195. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - CLOSE SHOT
text: Surgeon Mutant -- as he lifts the hypodermic needle of
text: a strange design. His hands, holding the needle, move
text: out of CAMERA, and Pat's screams stop suddenly.
scene_heading: 196. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: -- as the two mutants lift Pat's unconscious body and
text: place it on the operating table. David slowly regains
text: consciousness and sits up, rubbing his eyes in a dazed
dialog: manner.
scene_heading: 197. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - NEW ANGLE - MED. SHOT
text: David -- as his eyes become adjusted to the light and
text: he reacts in terror at seeing Pat being placed upon the
dialog: operating table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (starts to his feet,

dialog: across his mouth.
scene_heading: 198. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - CLOSE SHOT
text: David's face -- with the hand across his mouth, his
text: eyes staring in horror.
scene_heading: 199. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: David's angle - of the mutant surgeon, as he takes up
text: a complex surgical instrument. In his other hand, he
text: lifts up and examines a tiny crystal capsule, to which
text: is affixed a small spiral wire. Turning slowly, he
text: moves toward the unconscious form of Pat on the operat-
dialog: ing table.
scene_heading: 200. INT. SPACE SHIP - DAY - CLOSE SHOT
text: Back of Pat's neck and crown of her head -- The mutant

dialog: the nape of the neck.
scene_heading: 201. EXT. MacLEAN FIELD - DAY - MED. SHOT
dialog: -- with TRUCK in b.g. Fielding, Blake stand in f.g.,

dialog: -- as the surgeon mutant removes a strange, complex
text: helmet affair from Pat's head, while two other mutants
dialog: rush forward and carry the Martian quickly through the
text: bulkhead, closing the bulkhead behind them. The other
text: mutants race across the room and up the spiral steel
text: staircase, leaving Sergeant Balardi staring after them.
text: Pat lies unconscious on the operating table. David
dialog: rushes over to Pat.
scene_heading: 206. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - FULL SHOT
text: Just outside trapdoor -- as the last mutant enters the
text: tunnel through the trapdoor, two other mutants emerge
text: from a side tunnel carrying a machine mounted on a metal,
text: stretcher-like base. The machine resembles a large
text: searchlight with a metal megaphone-shaped device fasten-
text: ed to the front of the lens. Two heavy insulators stand
text: vertically just behind the searchlight part of the
dialog: machine and they are connected to a thing that looks
text: like a small condenser by two three-inch copper ribbons.
text: O.S. can be HEARD the thumping rumble of the tank treads
text: and a dull sound of exploding grenades. The two mutants
text: with the machine run down the tunnel out of scene, leav-

text: The two soldiers run out of scene, followed by Fielding.
text: Blair signals one of the demolition men to remain and

scene_heading: 241A. INT. TUNNEL - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: David hurries along the tunnel, approaches another inter-
text: section. He hears the whistle faintly in the distance
text: and stops. He is again faced with the decision of which
text: tunnel to choose, and is becoming panic-stricken.
scene_heading: 241B. INT. TUNNEL - INTERSECTION - DAY - CLOSE SHOT
text: David - the sweat stands out on his forehead as he tries
text: to peer into the tunnel ahead of him. He starts to turn
text: into the right hand tunnel when he hears faint footsteps
text: approaching. He is about to call when some instinct
text: prompts him to press back against the tunnel wall.
scene_heading: 241C. INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: A mutant is cautiously making his way down the tunnel.
text: He pauses and looks back at the direction from which
text: he came. He advances a few more feet and reaches the
text: intersection, where he stops.
scene_heading: 241D. INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - DAY - CLOSE SHOT
text: David is pressing himself as far into the corner of the
text: opposite tunnel wall as he can. He is terrified. As he
text: presses closer to the wall, he dislodges a tiny pebble,
text: which rolls down the wall on to the floor of the tunnel.
scene_heading: 241E. INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: The mutant hears the sound of the pebble falling and
text: looks around. He starts to advance toward where David
text: is standing when a whistle is heard faintly in the dis-
text: tance. He quickly turns and lopes off into darkness.
scene_heading: 241F. INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - DAY - MED. LONG SHOT

text: ing along endeavoring to catch up with Blair and the
text: other men. He reaches the intersection and bumps
text: squarely into the mutant who is loping up from the other
text: tunnel. The mutant envelopes the soldier in his huge
text: arms and starts to bend him backwards. The soldier vain-
text: ly struggles for his pistol, but is like a child in the
text: mutant's hands. He screams but the mutant covers his
text: mouth with a hairy paw.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER

scene_heading: 241I. INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: The soldier is struggling, but growing weaker, as the
text: mutant has him bent over nearly double. Blair and his
dialog: men round the corner and charge for the mutant, who
text: drops the soldier. As the mutant leaps forward, he is
text: met by a hail of tommy-gun slugs, and drops in his

scene_heading: 247F. INT. TUNNEL - DEAD END - DAY - MED. SHOT
text: David stands on his tiptoes and strives to reach the
dialog: trapdoor, but can't quite touch it. He frantically
text: sets to work digging at the fused earthen wall, trying
text: to carve a foothold. His fingers make little impression
text: on the hard surface. Seeking something to use as a
