speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: So what’s the upshot?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It’s not gonna say “Hello.”
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It absolutely is gonna say “Hello.”
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: How bad are you saying?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It’s pretty bad.
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (to ANDY)
dialog: Alright, what are your guys saying?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Some kind of race condition but we
dialog: haven’t been able to track it down
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Is the synthesizer sampling fast
dialog: enough?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No, so the rates are off and it

speaker_heading: JOANNA
speaker_heading: (to STEVE)
text: It’s 20 seconds out of a two-hour

speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: ANDY

dialog: Is this for real?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: There are a hundred engineers

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What about you?

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I‘1ll pay whatever the fine is.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: The fine is they’re gonna come in
dialog: and tell everyone to leave.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You explained to the fire marshal
dialog: that we’re in here changing the

speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: I did, but unless we can also

speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Steve-—
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: If a fire causes a stampede to the
dialog: unmarked exits it will have been

dialog: presentation.
text: There’s a Mac (the original Mac) on a small table.
text: There’s also a large, unopened carton that was recently

speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: And if you keep alienating people
dialog: for no reason there’s gonna be no
text: one left for it to say hello to.
speaker_heading: STEVE

scene_heading: STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s what Bell was called, the
dialog: phone company. IBM will be the
dialog: computer company and in 10 years
dialog: they'll be the information company
dialog: and that’s very bad for the human
dialog: race so we don’t have time to be
dialog: polite or realistic ‘cause if we
dialog: are, this company’s next product
dialog: launch will be held in front of 26
dialog: people and a stringer from the
dialog: Alameda County Shopper's Guide.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: We--listen--we haven’t advertised
dialog: the voice software. We could pull
dialog: it out of the demo and no one would
dialog: be disappointed. Do you want to try
dialog: being reasonable just, you know, to
dialog: see what it feels like?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay, pull the voice demo.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And then cancel the launch.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I see, you just (tricked me a
dialog: little).
speaker_heading: STEVE

dialog: is but if the computer doesn’t say
dialog: hello then neither will John
dialog: Sculley who, I promise you, agrees
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Sculley’s not gonna cancel the
dialog: launch ‘cause he’s not insane.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He’s also not a hack and when it
dialog: comes to the Macintosh he’s gonna
dialog: do what I ask him to do. What is in
dialog: this box?

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What the fuck is--why is there a
dialog: carton of--who did this?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Somebody thought--
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: --doesn’t matter--thought it would
dialog: be a good idea to have copies of
dialog: that Time cover available at
text: everyone’s seat. It was nipped in
dialog: the bud and all the copies are
text: being taken out of the building--
dialog: they’re probably already out of the
dialog: building so...problem solved.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: This isn’t a Macintosh.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Somebody thought it would be a good
dialog: idea to, like, enthusiastically
text: hand over copies of Time with a not-
text: a-Macintosh on the cover at the
dialog: launch of the Macintosh? What are
text: they handing out at Hewlett-
dialog: Packard, a bushel of apples with my
dialog: face on them?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I’m sure the thinking was--
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah?
scene_heading: STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: --that since the computer is Man of
dialog: the Year that that’s good for our
dialog: business but like I said I’m having
text: them removed from the building.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What I'd like you to do with them
dialog: is to take them, all 2600 copies,
text: and stack them on Kottke’s desk and
dialog: tell him Steve says, “Happy New
dialog: Year to you.”
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I gave Michael Moritz full access,
dialog: the whole campus. Bandley, Apple
dialog: II, Lisa, I gave him Sculley,
dialog: Markkula, I gave him Woz, I gave
dialog: him everybody. Betrayal, thy name
dialog: is Michael Moritz and Bozo, thy
dialog: name is Daniel Kottke. What should
dialog: I call the person who thought it
dialog: would be a good idea to hand these
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I’m not telling you who it was, it
dialog: was done without malice, it’s been
dialog: taken care of, you have a half-hour
dialog: and we have things to talk about.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Like a million in the first 90 days--
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: JOANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We were competitive at 1500 but
dialog: once you replaced the Motorola 6809

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: --which is what supports menus,
text: windows, point and click, high res
dialog: graphics--—
speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay--
speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: STEVE

dialog: idiot is gonna want--if I need to
dialog: tell you there’s a spot on your
dialog: shirt I point to the spot, I don’t
dialog: say there’s a spot 14 centimeters
dialog: down from the collar and 3
text: centimeters to the right of the
dialog: second button while I try to
dialog: remember what the command is for
dialog: club soda, that’s not how a
dialog: person’s mind works.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: If the goal was ease of use, maybe
dialog: you should've given it some memory.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You can complain about memory or
dialog: you can complain about price but
dialog: you can’t do both at the same time.
dialog: Memory is what costs money. And I’m
dialog: glad you're telling me your
dialog: feelings about the Mac now because
dialog: we have a half-hour left, we can

speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I’m just asking you to (manage

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: JOANNA

dialog: By talking to Moritz about it?
speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: JOANNA

dialog: named Lisa?” and Dan said, “Yeah”
dialog: and you said, “What did you tell

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: If we scroll down the thesaurus,

speaker_heading: ANDY

dialog: The computer, the Lisa, you know
dialog: what it stood for?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I'm sorry I said that about the
dialog: iMac, it’s not what I really think.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Behind my back, at the office, you
dialog: know what it stood for?
speaker_heading: LISA
speaker_heading: Local Integrated System
dialog: Architecture. I was five, why
dialog: couldn’t you just lie?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I did. It stood for “Lisa. Colon.
dialog: Invented Stupid Acronym.”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Of course it was named after you,
dialog: are you daffy! Local Integrated
dialog: System Architecture doesn’t even
dialog: mean anything, of course it was
dialog: named after you.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Why did you say it wasn’t all those
dialog: years?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (totally upfront and
dialog: without hesitation)
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Why did you say you weren’t my
dialog: father?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (not backing off it)
dialog: Honey...I honestly don’t know.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: That’s a child’s answer.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (owning it)
dialog: I’m poorly made.

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah I don’t care.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I don’t get it.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I know I didn’t want to be yoked to
dialog: your mom but--
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: That’s just lame.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: And you can belittle my mother all
dialog: you want but she always made dinner
dialog: for me and she always took me to
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Feeding you and taking you to
dialog: school is kind of the baseline of
dialog: parenting, Lisa, it’s actually a
dialog: legal obligation. Don’t devalue
dialog: yourself like that, don’t do that.
dialog: (beat--finally)
dialog: But you’re right, she did. And I
dialog: didn’t.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I‘m using “Different” as a noun,
dialog: smartass. Like “Think Victory.” Or
dialog: “Vote Freedom.”
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Vote Freedom?
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: The Apple chapter of the Harvard

dialog: writing for the Crimson.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Yeah, a little bit. Essays.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'd like to read one.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, I mean now, I'd like to read
dialog: one of your essays now.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: That’s--c’mon, you’ve got to go on
dialog: stage.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Suit yourself but the iMac will not
dialog: be launched until you give me one
dialog: of your essays so the world is
dialog: waiting for you.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It’s not like I have one on me.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Somewhere in that backpack is one
dialog: of your essays. Dump the contents
dialog: on the ground and if I’m wrong I'll
dialog: buy you a Cabriolet.

text: LISA looks at him, not believing this...she unzips one of the
text: pockets of her backpack and things start falling out and as
text: she tries to collect them more things start falling out until
text: everything’s on the ground.
text: STEVE watches as LISA, unhurriedly, collects her things and
dialog: puts them back. It’s going to take a while.
text: STEVE just watches this, smiles and shakes his head...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: I just spilled some...don’t laugh

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I’m not.
text: She finds the essay and holds it out. All she wants is for
dialog: her dad to be proud of her.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It hasn't been published yet, I
dialog: just finished but it’s a first
text: draft and it reads like one.
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Guys, I’m really sorry.
text: STEVE takes the essay, crumpled and coffee-stained...STEVE
text: sees the byline on the essay--"LISA BRENNAN-JOBS.”
text: STEVE can’t help but take in the sight of her using his name.
text: He’d stare at it forever if he wasn’t interrupted by--
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Dad.
text: He looks up at her...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Why don’t you just read it after.
dialog: You can give it your full
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay. But you should know that the
text: Bay Area is strewn with the broken
dialog: spirits of people who couldn't
dialog: handle my full attention.
text: And this makes LISA crack up. She really has a good laugh and
text: that makes her father smile. She picks up her backpack--
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay.
text: LISA starts to walk off--
scene_heading: STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 186.
scene_heading: 120 CONTINUED: 120
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: I’m gonna put music in your pocket.
dialog: LISA turns around--
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: A hundred songs. A thousand songs.
text: Five hundred songs. Somewhere
dialog: between five hundred and a thousand
dialog: songs. Right in your pocket.
dialog: Because I can’t stand looking at
text: that inexplicable Walkman anymore.
dialog: You're carrying around a brick
dialog: playing a cassette tape. We’re not
dialog: savages. So I’m gonna put a
dialog: thousand songs in your pocket.
text: And now we HEAR the musical intro to “Both Sides Now," but
dialog: it’s not the version we’re used to. This is the one Lisa was
text: describing when she was nine. It’s a beautiful male/female
text: duet with heartbreaking harmonies, more mature, wiser and
dialog: haunted.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You can do that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mm-hm. All I have to do really is
dialog: wipe out the record business as we
dialog: know it and we'll be all set.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You want to watch from backstage?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Yeah.
text: LISA joins her father and the two of them walk to the side
text: entrance of the building.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: This is the last semester you get
dialog: to take dumb classes.
speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: LISA

dialog: I don’t take “History of Food.” And
dialog: you gave me my Walkman, I like it.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well cherish it ‘cause it’s not
dialog: gonna be around much longer.
dialog: They walk into--
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 121
text: --where everyone’s waiting. We can HEAR the rock concert-like
text: stomping and clapping from the audience. “Both Sides Now”
dialog: continues--—
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah.
text: JOANNA walks STEVE and LISA--
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 122
text: --where the energy of the audience is louder. The STAGE
text: MANAGER is waiting as is the WOMAN at the PA microphone.
text: STEVE and LISA stand there a moment...
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: On your cue, Steve.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Are you nervous?
text: STEVE shakes his head “no.” He takes a moment and then nods a
text: little to the STAGE MANAGER--"I'm ready, let’s go.”
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: House to half, go.
text: The AUDIENCE begins CLAPPING in anticipation--
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: House out, go.

dialog: Go Cue l.
text: On the giant screen the “Think Different” commercial starts
text: playing to THUNDEROUS CHEERS from the AUDIENCE. We'll HEAR it
text: but NEVER SEE IT.
text: We HEAR the audio as “Both Sides Now” continues. The famous
text: audio only serves as background. What we’re watching is
text: everyone--everyone but STEVE--taken by the ad. STEVE’s taken
text: by other things he’s remembering. One of them’s Lisa.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Here's to the crazy ones. The
text: misfits. The rebels. The
dialog: troublemakers.
text: STEVE’s standing in the dark next to LISA listening to these
text: words. We MOVE IN SLOWLY on his face as he prepares to go on.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER (CONT’D)
text: The round pegs in the square holes.
dialog: The ones who see things
dialog: differently.
text: And we start to INTERCUT with various people out in the
text: house, which is packed with 2,600 eager people--ANDY
text: HERTZFELD...WOZ taking his seat...
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER (CONT’D)
dialog: They're not fond of rules. And they
dialog: have no respect for the status quo.
dialog: You can quote them, disagree with
dialog: them, glorify or vilify them.
scene_heading: AVIE TEVANIAN...ANDREA CUNNINGHAM...
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER (CONT’D)
dialog: About the only thing you can't do
text: is ignore them. Because they change
dialog: things. They push the human race
dialog: forward.
text: JOANNA slips in the back...with SCULLEY...
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER (CONT’D)
dialog: And while some may see them as the
dialog: crazy ones, we see genius.
text: And we're backstage on STEVE and LISA again as “Both Sides
text: Now” continues over. Is the song regretful like Lisa said, or
dialog: does Steve still have a chance to fix himself?
dialog: 122
scene_heading: STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 189.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 122
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER (CONT’D)
dialog: Because the people who think

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (whispering to LISA)
dialog: You remember that painting you did
dialog: here on the original Mac?
text: LISA thinks...and then shakes her head “no.”
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I do.
