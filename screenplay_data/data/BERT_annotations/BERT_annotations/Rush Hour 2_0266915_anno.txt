scene_heading: EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY
text: THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side.
text: HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET
text: VENDOR across the street.
text: She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first
dialog: bite we see:
scene_heading: THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER
text: TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball

speaker_heading: HU LI
dialog: (Chinese, subtitled)
dialog: Someone better call the police.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in

text: dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me"
text: look to two girls in a convertible.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (int Chinese)
dialog: Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu.
text: The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who
text: is driving and singing to his radio.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: ...wish they all could be California...
dialog: wish they all could be California
dialog: girls...
text: Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it
text: out of the SUNROOF.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I warned you about playing that shit
dialog: when I'm in the car.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: That was my CD. Don't you ever touch a
dialog: Chinese man's CD.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Did you see the way those girls drove
dialog: off? I did you a favor.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Those girls drove off because of you.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: All I did was invite them for a drink.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You invited them to get naked and
text: sacrifice a small goat.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (checking Chinese-English
dialog: dictionary)
dialog: I said that? Which word was "goat?"
text: Lee picks up his CD case.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys
dialog: Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don't be giving me attitude, Lee. I've
dialog: been here three days and we haven't done
dialog: shit. We haven't been to a club,
dialog: haven't even talked to a girl. I'm on
dialog: vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Mu-shu? You're hungry?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Not Mu-shu. Mu-shu. I want to see some
dialog: women. Now stop playing dumb and show
dialog: me the shu!
text: Carter flips through the dictionary. A CALL COMES in over
scene_heading: LEE'S CELL PHONE.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT
scene_heading: INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles.
scene_heading: SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
dialog: Lee, there was a bombing at the American
dialog: Embassy. Two American translators were
dialog: killed.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Any leads?
scene_heading: SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We think it's Ricky Tan. If you don't
dialog: want to take the case, I'll understand.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It's my responsibility.
text: Lee hangs up the cell phone.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What was that? Did you just pick up a
dialog: case? Did we just take another damn
dialog: case on my vacation?
text: Lee smiles at Carter.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Of course not. My Superindendent
dialog: invited us to a club tonight. Big
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don't be messing with me, Lee. I will
dialog: kick your ass. I'll hit you so hard
dialog: you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Carter, would I lie to you?

scene_heading: EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT
text: Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their
text: way to the door of the Raven Club. Carter is combing his
text: hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping
text: when he spots two hot WOMEN walking into the club.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's what I'm talking about. A real
dialog: Hong Kong night club. You want an
dialog: Altoid?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You better take one. Your breath has
dialog: been a little funky all day. Let me
dialog: look at you.
text: Carter looks at Lee. Fixes his collar.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Just relax and don't worry about a
dialog: thing. I'll hook you up in there. You
dialog: got condoms?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Take this. It's a Magnum. You can fold
dialog: it in half.
text: Carter dances through the door, Lee follows.
scene_heading: INT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT
text: A dark, upscale club that is packed with GANGSTERS, BEAUTIFUL
text: GIRLS and CIVILIANS. Lee and Carter walk in. Lee is trying
text: to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where
text: a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael
text: Jackson's "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH."
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes.
dialog: They don't like tourists in here, so try
dialog: to blend in.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Blend in? I'm two feet taller than
dialog: everyone here. Where you going?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Bathroom.
text: Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to
text: the bar, takes a seat next to TWO CHINESE THUGS.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How you boys doing tonight?
text: The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the
text: OLD MAN continues to sing.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: That is the worst singing I've ever
dialog: heard. That sounds like something you'd
text: hear in prison after lights out.
text: The thugs continue to ignore Carter.
scene_heading: INT. RAVEN CLUB - BACK HALL - NIGHT
text: Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open
text: door - sees a private room. Several TRIADS are using hi-tech
text: MACHINES to count stacks of AMERICAN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Get closer to my body now. And just
dialog: love me, till you don't know how...
text: Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he
text: realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL
dialog: YOU GET ENOUGH."
scene_heading: INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS
text: A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open,
text: watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael
text: Jackson, singing his heart out. Dancing and making eyes at a
text: few of the smitten women who are watching him.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (whispering from side of stage)
dialog: Carter, get off that stage!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Are you kidding, they love me. I'm a
dialog: star, Lee. A god to these people!
text: Carter resumes singing, really getting down. Moonwalking to
text: the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: This is a gangster bar, we're here
dialog: undercover.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I knew you were lying.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Damn it, why are you ruining my night?
dialog: I'm just starting to have fun.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well fine then, go ahead, pull your
dialog: badge and do your thing.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No, we're here for information, to find
dialog: out where a man named Ricky Tan is. We
dialog: must tread softly and keep our ears
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Tread softly? Who taught you how to
dialog: roost a bar?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Carter, you don't understand. These men
dialog: are Fu-Cang-Long Triads. Part of the
dialog: most deadly gang in China.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Man, are you crazy? You think that
dialog: scares me? I'm from L.A. We invented
dialog: gangs. We were having gang wars before
dialog: anybody even thought about it. We get
dialog: royalties from other gangs. Now gimme
dialog: your badge and gun and I'll show you how
dialog: it's done.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No. You are a civilian. In China, I am
dialog: Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You mean Tito. We had Toto for dinner
dialog: last night.
text: Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun.
text: Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and
text: fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (Chinese)
dialog: Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang
dialog: lui.
text: Nobody moves. Strange looks from the crowd. Carter turns to
dialog: Lee.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What'd I say?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You just said you're their worst
dialog: nightmare - and to line their mothers up
dialog: for a milking.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Shit. C'mon, get up here and help me
dialog: out.
text: Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage. More looks from the Chinese
text: as Carter speaks, Lee translating.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go
dialog: to that side, all fine ass women on this
dialog: side.
text: Nobody moves. Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's try this again. Who here knows
dialog: Ricky Tan, raise your hand.
text: Nobody moves.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Who here is named Lee? Raise your hand.
text: Nobody moves.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I know you're lying.
text: The crowd still hasn't moved. Except in the back, where Lee
text: spots several GANGSTERS leaving. As Lee runs off stage --
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (as they run out)
dialog: I come back and catch y'all singing
dialog: Michael Jackson and you're all going to
dialog: jail.
scene_heading: EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT
text: Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI
text: and several gangsters round a corner.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Stop! LAPD!
text: Lee takes off and chases them on foot.
scene_heading: EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT
scene_heading: EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT
text: The far end of the street is BLOCKED BY MARKET STALLS. The
text: GANGSTERS look around frantically. An apartment building is
text: under CONSTRUCTION, massive BAMBOO SCAFFOLDING top to bottom.
dialog: Their only way out is UP.
text: Lee and Carter dash around the corner to see the gangsters
text: SWARMING UP THE SCAFFOLDING. Lee wastes no time going after
text: them. With a running start, he JAMS A FOOT on the wall and
text: VAULTS to the BOTTOM RUNG, GRABS HOLD AND SWINGS UP.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hang on, Lee. I'm coming.
text: Carter jumps to grab hold of the scaffolding. NOT EVEN
text: CLOSE. He backs up -- he's gonna take a running start!
text: ABOVE - LEE REACHES 4 GANGSTERS. They all tear off the
text: LENGTHS OF BAMBOO and square off. The clatter of wood
text: against wood as they beat at each other. Wrestling over his
text: pole, Lee FLINGS TWO of the GANGSTERS over the edge.
text: BELOW, Carter has hold of the bottom rung, STRAINING MIGHTILY
text: to pull himself up. Just as he gets his chin above the
text: bar... snap! It BREAKS and he drops. Then...
text: WHAM! WHAM! The two gangsters CRASH LAND ON EITHER side of
text: CARTER. HE takes one look at their pain.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Forget this...
text: He dashes into the stairwell. ABOVE, the last two GANGSTERS
text: come at Lee. He stomps down, levering up floor boards, which
text: SEE-SAWS them off-balance. With the advantage, he BATTERS
text: them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off. He climbs
text: after the GANGSTER LEADER.
scene_heading: ON HU LI and the GANGSTERS
text: Coming over the crest of the hill, seeing Carter climbing up
dialog: the hill.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS
text: Lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
text: WHAM! He is clocked by a 16-foot BAMBOO POLE. Lee TOPPLES
text: OVER THE EDGE! We see his adversary for the first time.
scene_heading: HU LI - AGILE, GORGEOUS...DANGEROUS
text: As she steps to the edge... BOOM! The STAIRWELL DOOR FLIES
text: OPEN and CARTER EMERGES. Gun low and ready. Hu Li is gone.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Freeze! Nobody move!
text: Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below.
text: Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li.
text: She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
text: and WINDMILLS a HARD KICK that sends Carter FLYING OFF THE
speaker_heading: ROOF!
text: He falls along the side of the building. He manages to grab
text: the end of a BAMBOO POLE that juts out from the scaffolding.
text: LEE IS RIGHT THERE NEXT TO HIM!
text: They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives. Hu
text: Li looks down at them. She has no weapon to finish them off.
text: She turns and runs, disappearing in the night.
speaker_heading: CARTER AND LEE
text: holding on with all their strength. The bamboo is starting
dialog: to bend.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Try to land on your feet.
text: Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
dialog: miles for this shit.
speaker_heading: The POLE BREAKS

text: silence, bruised and covered in garbage.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You lied to me.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're sorry. I got somebody's old
dialog: chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't
dialog: tell me you're sorry. Just take me
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: No time. There was an explosion at the
dialog: American Embassy today -- two American
dialog: translators were killed.
text: Carter takes this in. Can't believe his own bad luck.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew
dialog: up the Embassy?
scene_heading: EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING
text: Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12
text: year olds are going through their warm up routines.
text: MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of
dialog: this shit. There's two billion Chinese -
dialog: let one of them be your partner.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: This won't take long.
text: Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES.
speaker_heading: MASTER FU
dialog: Dragon kick!
text: Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD.
speaker_heading: MASTER FU (CONT'D)
dialog: Lotus block!
text: The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms. Master Fu
text: notices Carter and Lee watching from the back.
speaker_heading: MASTER FU (CONT'D)
dialog: Twisting Tiger!
text: No response. The students exchange baffled looks.
speaker_heading: MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D)
dialog: (staring straight at Lee)
dialog: Twisting Tiger!
text: Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
text: that leaves the students blown away. Lee smiles, basking in
dialog: the glow...
text: ...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment.
speaker_heading: MASTER FU (CONT'D)
dialog: Didn't I teach you to always arch your
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (bowing, humbled)
dialog: Yes, Master.
text: While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12
text: YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle.
text: Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I was watching you kids. My name is
dialog: Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree
dialog: black belt. At least that's what I tell
dialog: the girls at the Holiday Health Spa
dialog: where I work out.
text: Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no
dialog: reaction.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me give you kids some tips. The key
dialog: to Kung Fu is the follow through. Why
dialog: don't you stand up.
text: THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction. Carter continues to throw
dialog: punches.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Go ahead, kick me, hit me. I'll show
dialog: you how to block. Come on, stand up,
dialog: give me your best shot -- try to kick
dialog: right to my head.
text: The kids still don't move. Carter, working up a sweat from
text: shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the
text: HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake. He swings back around
text: to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him
text: flying back onto the mat. He looks around and sees ALL of
text: the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: That's pretty good. Which one of you
dialog: kids did that?
scene_heading: INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Lee and Master Fu walking.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I need your help, Master. I'm seeking a
dialog: man who used to train with you. He's
dialog: become a killer - the worst kind of
dialog: animal.
speaker_heading: MASTER FU
dialog: Animals kill only from hunger or fear.
dialog: The man you seek is lower than a
dialog: serpent.
dialog: (faces Lee)
dialog: ...he kills for money.
text: In the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
text: Carter from all sides. Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
text: kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him. They
dialog: disappear O.S.
text: Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: MASTER FU (CONT'D)
dialog: He was the best I ever trained, you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Ricky Tan?
speaker_heading: MASTER FU
dialog: No. Your father.
dialog: (Lee reacts)
dialog: Your father and Ricky Tan were my
dialog: favorite students... and for such awful
dialog: things to happen as they did --
text: Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: How do I find Ricky Tan?

speaker_heading: MASTER FU

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I know, Master, but...
speaker_heading: MASTER FU
dialog: The answers you seek can be found in
dialog: Heaven on Earth.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Heaven on Earth? Master, I don't
dialog: understand.
dialog: (working it)
dialog: A temple, where Heaven is on Earth? A
dialog: mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
speaker_heading: MASTER FU
dialog: It's a massage parlor downtown. "Heaven
dialog: on Earth." You will find your answers
dialog: there.
text: Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
dialog: pathway.
speaker_heading: MASTER FU (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait! Put a c-note in the jar.
text: Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway.

speaker_heading: MASTER FU (CONT'D)
dialog: Cheap bastard...
scene_heading: EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS
text: Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And that's how you use the LAPD choke

speaker_heading: HOSTESS

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: HOSTESS

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: You get massage from Chinese girl
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No. It's my first time.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: You pick any girl for you and your

text: Carter looks like a kid in a candy store.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Any girl? Okay. Let's start with that
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: Oh yes, she's very nice.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: She is nice. But I am very tense. I'm
dialog: gonna need a lot of massages. I'll take
dialog: that one, too. How you doin', baby?
dialog: And...that one in pink. She can do my
dialog: feet.
text: Lee elbows Carter.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: She said I could pick any girl I want.
speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: HOSTESS

scene_heading: INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY
text: TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women

text: Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING
text: PURPLE ROBES. Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH
text: TOPS. Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same
text: time. A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Now I'm on vacation. I knew you'd come
dialog: through, Lee.
text: LEE doesn't respond. LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR
text: SIDE OF THE ROOM. A man who radiates a unique blend of
text: sophistication and brutality.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's Ricky Tan? He's four feet tall.
dialog: I'll go over with you right now, shake
dialog: him down.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: This is a very dangerous man.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm a dangerous man. You're not gonna
dialog: ruin my massage because of some midget
text: in a house coat.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'm calling for back up!
text: Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits.
text: Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair
text: with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees. Carter makes a
text: decision, gets up and walks towards him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over
dialog: for you. Get up.
text: Tan looks up for a moment, a smile.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: I'm busy at the moment.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I said get on your feet!
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: I know you, Detective Carter, right?
dialog: You're Lee's American friend. Enjoying
dialog: your visit?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm --
dialog: and don't let the robe fool you. This
dialog: is the only color they had left. Now
dialog: get up!
text: Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop. CARTER GRABS THE LAPTOP
text: from Ricky and throws it across the room - SHATTERING IT
text: against the wall. Ricky glances at his men who are seated
text: around the room waiting to move.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you to get on your feet!
text: Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side,
text: breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Lee, I've missed you, brother.
dialog: (getting up, giving Lee a hug)
dialog: I heard about the two Americans, I'm so
dialog: sorry, you must be under great pressure.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You must come with me for questioning.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Let's go. I've got girls and chicken
dialog: and hot oil waiting for me.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: I don't think so...
text: A nod of Ricky Tan's head, and TEN LARGE MEN in robes and
text: towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing
text: Lee and Carter. A beat...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: It's no problem. But I must excuse
dialog: myself, inspector.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
text: Tan bows to Lee and Carter.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Congratulations. And good day.
text: As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him.
text: But they are blocked by TAN'S MEN.
text: Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off. The man
text: covers his naked body. Lee is grabbed by one of the other
text: henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the
text: towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms --
text: blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all
text: the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel,
text: his robe, or some other found object.
text: Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men
text: flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (ref: his privates)
dialog: Damn! No wonder you're pissed off.
text: Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of
text: the men's punches.
text: In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he
text: flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind.

scene_heading: EXT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - DAY

speaker_heading: LEE

scene_heading: INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - DAY
speaker_heading: PANDEMONIUM

text: SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a
text: 50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
dialog: Chin, you have been ordered by the
dialog: Ministry of Public Security to assist
dialog: the FBI and Secret Service with our
dialog: investigation, to provide us with
dialog: whatever we need. If you have
dialog: information, it belongs to us.
scene_heading: SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
dialog: This is still Hong Kong.
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
dialog: Two Americans have been killed on United
dialog: States Government property -- this is
dialog: our investigation.
scene_heading: SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
dialog: Chief Inspector Lee will brief your
dialog: people...
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
dialog: No. He will report to me. Do we
dialog: understand each other?
text: SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen.
text: Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash
text: can lid, Carter using a red construction cone.
speaker_heading: SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D)
dialog: Who the hell is that?
scene_heading: SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
dialog: (humiliated)
dialog: That is...Chief Inspector Lee. The
dialog: detective in charge of our

scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
dialog: Put a diaper on him, Chin. I want to

scene_heading: INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting

text: Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from
text: Lee's closet, then moves for the door.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Back to Heaven on Earth. I need my damn
dialog: passport back. I'm going home.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Fine. Go home. Who needs you.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why you mad at me? You needed back-up,
dialog: so I backed you up. I was about to take
dialog: out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Stop! I'm sick of your bullshit!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: My bullshit? I'm not the one who goes
dialog: to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters!
dialog: I'm not the one who goes to massage
dialog: parlors to bust crime lords!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It's my job!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're pathetic, man. When's the last
dialog: time you had some fun? When's the last
dialog: time you took a night off, had a date?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I have plenty of dates.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Really? When's the last time you had
dialog: some Mu-shu Let's hear it, Lee, when

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You would never understand my life.
dialog: You're not Chinese.
speaker_heading: CARTER

scene_heading: INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk. Chin
text: stands in the back.
scene_heading: SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
dialog: Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from
dialog: the United States Secret Service.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: The Secret Service? Why?
speaker_heading: STERLING
dialog: What I'm about to tell you cannot leave
dialog: this room. The men who were killed
dialog: yesterday were not American translators.
dialog: They were undercover U.S. customs agents
text: trying to break a Triad smuggling ring.
dialog: We don't know what they're transporting
dialog: out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it
dialog: got the agents killed.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: How can we help?
speaker_heading: STERLING
dialog: Stay the hell out of our way.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I can get to Ricky Tan.
speaker_heading: STERLING
dialog: We know all about Tan. That's why we're
dialog: leaving him out there as bait. We think
dialog: this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan
dialog: and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads.
scene_heading: INT. LEE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN DIEL
text: It's nine-thirty in the morning.
speaker_heading: CARTER

dialog: There was a dinner last night, two

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Two hundred cops? Was Mario Sanchez
dialog: there? He owes me money.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN DIEL
dialog: I've waited my whole life for this job,
dialog: but I don't have a shot in hell of
dialog: getting it. Do you know why?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Is it because of the hookers, sir? You
dialog: tell them there's no crime in being
dialog: lonely.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN DIEL
dialog: No, Carter. The reason I'm screwed is
dialog: because the entire department is about
dialog: to find out the stolen credit cards we

dialog: class upgrades to Hong Kong. And what
dialog: the hell is Heaven on Earth?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sir, I'm working on a big case over here

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How you doing? Can you direct me to the

text: The OLD WOMAN stares at Carter, starts motioning to her CAGES

speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: No, I don't eat live birds. I like my

text: The Woman takes out a bird, holds up a HATCHET.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.

dialog: (beat)
dialog: We are still parked -- we're not moving!
dialog: This is the opposite of chasing -- drive

scene_heading: INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY

scene_heading: SUPERINDENDENT CHIN
dialog: Let him find out on his own. I want the

scene_heading: EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CAB DRIVER

text: parking fancy cars, RICH PEOPLE getting on the boat as their
text: names are checked off a list by two DOORMEN.
scene_heading: INT. YACHT - NIGHT
text: A huge PARTY, a live band plays for a crowd of business men,

speaker_heading: CARTER

scene_heading: EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS
text: The SHIP'S HORN SOUNDS, the yacht starts to head out to sea.
text: Lee steps out of his car, sees the yacht is pulling out of
text: the slip. He runs along the side of the boat, has no choice
text: but to jump from the end of the pier, landing hard on the
text: side of the ship, somehow holding onto a PORTHOLE WINDOW. He
text: clings to the yacht, then throws himself toward a hanging
text: LIFEBOAT, climbs up the side and jumps toward the TOP RAIL --
scene_heading: EXT. YACHT - CONTINUOUS
text: As Carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
text: from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner
text: - almost stepping right into HU LI, who's approaching STEVEN
text: REIGN. Steven Reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
text: impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
dialog: money.
text: He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives,
text: Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
dialog: as sociopath.
text: Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li. Carter
text: hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room
text: for signs of trouble. He heads into the main party.
text: Carter stops walking when he comes upon ISABELLA MOLINA, a
text: stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
text: champagne. Carter lights her cigarette for her.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How you doing, baby? My name is Prince

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled

dialog: Isabella. Champagne, caviar, whatever
dialog: you want. My ship is your ship.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: This is your ship?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's right. I'm the owner, the
dialog: Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: El Capitan?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don't want to play games with you,
dialog: Isabella. I like you. I can see myself
dialog: with you -- in one of those bathrooms
text: over there in about five minutes.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: Well, I'm very tempted. It's such a

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Called? What's my ship called?
dialog: (he has no idea)
dialog: Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow
dialog: Johnson.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: The S.S. Minow Johnson. Funny, the name
text: on the back was "Red Dragon."
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Red Dragon? You sure about that?
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: I'm sure, because this is my friend's
dialog: yacht. And it's his party.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Your friend's ship?
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Oh, man. I must've walked onto the
dialog: wrong yacht. I knew there was a reason
dialog: my keys didn't work.
speaker_heading: STEVEN REIGN
dialog: (taking seat next to Isabella)
dialog: Who's your friend?
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: Somebody who got on the wrong yacht.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Wait a second. You're Steven Reign?

speaker_heading: STEVEN REIGN

speaker_heading: BODYGUARD #1

scene_heading: INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: RICKY TAN

speaker_heading: ON TV

speaker_heading: RICKY TAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist. I

speaker_heading: LEE

dialog: minutes.

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'm okay, you go.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why the hell should you believe him? He
dialog: had us beat up. Naked. That's nasty
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Remember I told you my father was a

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
speaker_heading: CARTER

scene_heading: EXT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - UPPER DECK - NIGHT
text: Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Despite what people suspect...what you

speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: ... if your father were alive, I would

dialog: (beat)
dialog: I didn't blow up the American Embassy,

speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Nobody can protect me. I'll make a deal

speaker_heading: RICKY TAN

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What "revenge" is he talking about?
scene_heading: SPECIAL AGENT STERLING
dialog: I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Good at what?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Forget it.
text: A long beat while Lee considers what to say.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Five years ago, my father was Chief
dialog: Inspector working a big international
dialog: smuggling case.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ask me if I give a shit.
text: Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Ricky Tan killed my father.
text: Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: He found out his partner, Tan, had been
dialog: working for the Triads all along.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Before my father could prove it, he was
dialog: killed in the line of duty.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How the hell did Tan get away with it?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: All the evidence against him
dialog: disappeared, the smuggling case was
text: unsolved. Tan resigned and went over to
text: the Triads openly.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (pause)
dialog: This is about your Daddy's death? Hell,
dialog: Lee, you know my father died on the job.
dialog: You could have told me...
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: This is about more than all that, isn't
dialog: it? This is about your Daddy's last
dialog: case, right?
text: Lee's caught, fibs badly.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No, no, that would be crazy --
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You thought the "Customs Agents get
dialog: blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky
dialog: Tan" and you put it all together and
dialog: came up with a five year old case.
dialog: That's why you didn't tell me what we
dialog: were doing...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I thought you'd think it was crazy.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: IT IS CRAZY!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I know. I know. I am sorry.
text: Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his
text: car. Carter watches him. Finally he rolls his eyes and
dialog: yells.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So are you getting on the plane or not?!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Come on, we still got time to order the
dialog: Kosher meal. Always get the kosher
dialog: meal, they bring it first.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I cannot go to LA...
text: Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the
text: cop beneath the attitude.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It sounds impossible --
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You said --
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: -- but if somebody gave me the chance to
dialog: square up my father's death, I'd go to
dialog: hell to do it.
text: Carter turns, walks away without looking back.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to figure out why they killed
dialog: your Daddy, get on the plane.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Why LA?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (still not turning)
dialog: I guess you're going to have to trust me
dialog: on this one.

scene_heading: INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT
text: Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other
text: passengers, preparing to take off. Lee has a moment of
dialog: doubt.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I should go back. Ricky Tan mentioned a
dialog: boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter
dialog: Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow
dialog: the Rich White Man.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Follow the Rich White Man?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Almost, but you've got to say "Rich
dialog: White Man" all run together like it's
dialog: one word.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Follow the RichWhiteMan...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Not bad. Now every crime, somewhere,
text: has a rich white man taking his cut.
dialog: Every single one. Now in our case, we
dialog: know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Big hotel billionaire. He was on Ricky
dialog: Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just
dialog: before Ricky got smoked.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: How do you know he's our man?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Because when the shooting started he was
dialog: way too cool. See most white people,
dialog: when there's shooting, they either hide
dialog: in a toilet or start screaming high
dialog: pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You sound like that all the time.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Black people keep their cool when the
dialog: shit goes down.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Maybe. But not like Asians. We never
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, what about when Godzilla was
dialog: coming? You people were screaming your
text: asses off.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Just tell me where I can find this
dialog: Steven Reign.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The same place you find all
dialog: RichWhiteMen.
dialog: (a tray arrives)
dialog: Gefilte Fish. Lox and bagel. I love
dialog: this stuff. Here, try it with a smear.

scene_heading: CUT TO REVEAL --

text: Lee standing next to him. WE ARE:
scene_heading: INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT
text: Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down

scene_heading: BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL
text: Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel. Stopping at the

text: Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, that's definitely the woman from
text: Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in
dialog: his suite at his hotel, I told you this
dialog: would work out. They still just
dialog: talking?
speaker_heading: LEE
text: He just left. Kissed her on the cheek.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: He'll be back soon.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Look at her. Now, wake me in an hour,
dialog: I'll take over.
text: Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to
text: sleep on the bed.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Carter, there's something I have to tell
dialog: you. You were right about what you said
dialog: in Hong Kong. All I do is work. Never
dialog: take a day off. It's all I have right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu
dialog: in six months.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You pull a muscle or something?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: My fiancee left me over the summer -- a
dialog: month before our wedding.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm sorry, Lee. Why did she leave you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It's a long story.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Let me guess, she couldn't handle the
dialog: cop thing -- never knowing if you were
dialog: dead or alive. I've seen it a million
dialog: times.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No. It was my singing.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: She hated my voice. Said it drove her
dialog: crazy. I sang to her all the time - in
dialog: bed - in the shower - I thought she
dialog: liked it. She finally told me it was
text: driving her crazy.
text: Carter stares at Lee for a long BEAT.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss
dialog: our personal lives. Let's die curious.
text: LEE LIFTS THE BINOCULARS - turns back to the building.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What's she doing?
scene_heading: BINOCULARS P.O.V. - ON ISABELLA
text: She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through SHEER
text: CURTAINS. Slowly taking off her coat.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Lee? You okay?
text: Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to
text: unbutton her blouse.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: She's just standing around -- not doing
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later
dialog: something's gonna happen.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring.
text: Isabella starts to remove her blouse. Lee starting to sweat
text: as he watches her undress.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Slow down, baby.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Nothing. I said nothing.
text: Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window.
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it hot in here?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hot? I'm freezing my ass off.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'm gonna go in the hall and get a
dialog: bucket of ice. You want some ice?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What's going on?
text: Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: She's getting undressed.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Gimme the binoculars.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No. It's not right.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot
dialog: you.
text: Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as
text: Carter watches to the window.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What's she doing?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I don't want to hear this.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Skirt just came off. She's in black bra

text: there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it
text: looks like Snoopy.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Snoopy? I love Snoopy.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: She just took her hair down. Now she's
dialog: going for the bra -- the clasp is in
text: front -- she's using both hands.
dialog: (to Lee)
dialog: You better get that ice.
text: Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: That's enough. We shouldn't be doing
dialog: this!
text: Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the
text: living room to pick up the PHONE. We see her clearly now in
dialog: bra and panties.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: This is our job. We took an oath as
dialog: police officers. If we don't do this,
dialog: who will? Firemen?
text: Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window. He sees
text: Isabella hang up the phone.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a sec - what the hell is that
dialog: between her legs?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: She's reaching into her panties --
text: something is strapped to her leg. Oh,
dialog: God...please don't let it be a dick.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a
dialog: microphone. Lee, she's wired...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ISABELLA
text: As she turns to the window. A TAPE RECORDER in hand. She
text: puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom
text: and puts on a robe.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I don't understand?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: She's walking back towards the door.
speaker_heading: BINOCULARS P.O.V.
text: We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her
text: hotel room talking with someone.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
text: She opened the door. Someone is
text: delivering a package.
speaker_heading: BINOCULARS P.O.V.
text: Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Lee...it's the girl who delivered the
dialog: package to your office. It's a bomb!
text: Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT
text: Isabella closes the door. She BRINGS THE BOMB WITH HER as
text: she walks into the bedroom --
scene_heading: EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the
text: entrance of the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: LEE/CARTER
dialog: NO!
text: Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and
dialog: panties.
speaker_heading: CARTER

scene_heading: INT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the BOMB
text: toward the END OF THE HALL as he and Carter dive to the
dialog: floor.
dialog: Nothing happens.
text: Lee looks up, SEES a HOTEL EMPLOYEE pushing a room service
text: CART, about to walk right past the package --
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: GET DOWN!!
text: Lee and Carter run back to the bomb.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Pick it up!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It's your turn!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don't need a turn!
text: Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall,
text: heading for the elevator.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Throw it!
text: Carter is about to throw it in, when HE SEES AN OLDER COUPLE
scene_heading: STANDING INSIDE.
speaker_heading: HOTEL GUESTS
dialog: Do you want us to hold the elevator?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Get the hell away from here!
text: Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do
dialog: with it --
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Stairs!
text: Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs --
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he
text: sees TWO MAIDS WALKING toward him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Get out of the building!
text: Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no
dialog: choice but to throw it back to Carter.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Roof!
scene_heading: EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT
text: Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to
text: hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible.
text: He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets
text: are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Wait! There's people down there!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: There's people up here!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Get it out of here!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Take it!
text: Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee
text: and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides
text: to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT
text: OF ISABELLA. She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed
text: off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: Get on your feet.
text: Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella
text: begins to open the package.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I wouldn't do that!!!
speaker_heading: LEE
text: It's a bomb.
text: Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED
scene_heading: DOLLAR BILLS.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: You see, no bomb. Now stay away before
dialog: I throw you both in jail for
text: obstruction.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Throw us in jail? I'm about to bust you
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: I'm an undercover agent for the United
dialog: States Secret Service.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How do we know you're not lying? Let me
dialog: see your badge.
text: Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to
dialog: her bra.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me see it again?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: We can help you. I'm a detective in
dialog: Hong Kong.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Then you know I'm not walking away from
dialog: this case.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, that's right.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: We need to get out of sight. Come down
dialog: to my suite.
scene_heading: INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: (she locks the door)
dialog: Look, I've been working this case for
dialog: months now...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So what's your story?
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
text: Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's
text: package. Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
text: food from the mini fridge.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Is this a payoff?
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard
dialog: of the Superbill?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: It's much more than a counterfeit. 14
dialog: out of 15 world banks can't tell the
dialog: difference. The paper is Crane linen
dialog: blend -- and the bills are printed on
text: U.S. Intaglio presses.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How're they getting into the U.S. Mint
dialog: to use the presses?
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: In 1959, the United States was very
dialog: friendly with the Shah of Iran. We
dialog: wanted his oil, so for the Shah's
dialog: birthday, the government gave him a gift
text: -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press. The
dialog: only one to ever leave the country.
dialog: Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that
text: press on the black market.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Five years ago?!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's right before he left the force.
text: Lee and Carter exchange looks.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
dialog: this past year. Then Tan got hold of
dialog: one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar
dialog: plates -- and started making superbills.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (understanding)
dialog: And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: Yes. They've printed and shipped one
dialog: hundred million dollars, and there's
dialog: only one way to spot a fake.
text: Isabella lights a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL on fire, and it burns
speaker_heading: RED.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: They use an optical transfer ink from
dialog: India that burns red -- the real ink
text: burns black.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What the hell are they going to do with
dialog: a hundred million dollars in funny
dialog: money?
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: The real question is, where are the
dialog: plates? If we can find the plates, we
dialog: can stop the whole operation.
text: Isabella thinks for a beat.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe that's where you can help us.
dialog: Carter, this is your city, right?
text: Carter nods.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads?
text: Lee nods.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the
dialog: plates.
text: (hands Lee a card with a phone
dialog: number)
dialog: Welcome aboard, gentlemen. From this
dialog: moment on, you're working for the United
dialog: States Secret Service.
text: Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out. They exit
text: quickly, trying to hide their excitement. CAMERA STAYS on
text: Isabella as she takes out her CELL PHONE, punches in a
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: STERLING (O.S.)
dialog: Sterling.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
text: Lee and Carter are officially out of the
dialog: Secret Service's way...
scene_heading: EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
text: the street trying their best to look like Secret Service
text: Agents. They approach Carter's parked VETTE.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Secret Service Agent Carter. This is my
dialog: calling, Lee.
dialog: Give me six months and I'll be in
text: Washington protecting a white guy.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: We both know you would never take a
dialog: bullet for someone else.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: They don't know that. What are they
dialog: gonna do, try and shoot the President
dialog: during the interview? I'll bet Isabella
dialog: can pull some strings. You saw the way
text: she was staring at me.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: She never even looked at you.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
dialog: me. I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
dialog: third world ugly.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I am not third world ugly. Women like
dialog: me, they think I'm cute. Like Snoopy.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Snoopy is about six inches taller than
dialog: you. I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a
dialog: chance.
text: Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette. Lee
text: reluctantly gets in, too.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CHINESE SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CRENSHAW KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

dialog: are occupied.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the OWNER, a
text: BLACK MAN named KENNY, is yelling in Chinese to an over
text: worked waiter. Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese
text: woman, works the stove. A couple of cute half-black, half
text: Asian kids run around the kitchen.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Kenny! How you doin'?
text: Kenny looks up at Carter. A cool, appraising glance.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: How's the action tonight? The house
dialog: making out okay?
text: Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to --
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: MEN seated around several card tables, playing MAH-JONGG for
text: big money. Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside. It's very
text: smokey and very crowded.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (to Kenny)
dialog: This is where I say I'm LAPD in a loud
text: voice, they all scream and run and shit.
dialog: Watch. It's real funny.
text: Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Come with me.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong
dialog: Kong, James.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?? Where'd you hear that?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: I got my sources.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And I got mine, meaning you. Nice how
dialog: that works out.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm serious this time, I'm closing this
dialog: place down.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: James, you see my kids back there? You
dialog: know how much I'm paying for private
dialog: school? How can you come in here with
dialog: this attitude, you being little Chang's
dialog: godfather?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Little Chang is gonna have to go visit
dialog: his daddy in jail if you don't
dialog: cooperate.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Jail!? James, you better back off.
dialog: Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'd like to see you try.
text: Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial
text: arts move. Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him --
text: countering Kenny's move.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: (to Lee)
dialog: We're on, then.
text: Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence --
text: Lee BLOCKS -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where
dialog: did you learn that?
dialog: They switch to Chinese.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Master Ching taught me.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: No. Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
text: Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny.
speaker_heading: KENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing hanging out with Baby
dialog: Duck?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Baby Duck?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: That's what we all used to call him when
dialog: he was a kid -- cause he was always
dialog: quacking. Never shut up.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I heard that.
text: Lee and Kenny laugh.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I need some info and I don't have
dialog: time to play around.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: Is this about the funny money?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How'd you know?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: You've been asking loud questions in all
dialog: the wrong places all morning. How come
dialog: you always save me for last, James?
dialog: When are you gonna learn. Shit don't
dialog: happen I don't know about.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So tell me what you know.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty
dialog: good double sawbuck -- but you knew that
dialog: too, didn't you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah. We already been there. This is
dialog: big, Kenny. Benjamins. Secret Service
dialog: calls 'em superbills. Banks can't even
dialog: tell the difference.
text: Kenny considers this for a moment.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: One of my regulars lost fifty thousand
dialog: dollars at the table here last week. I
dialog: was about to send my boys down to tune
text: his ass up, when the guy comes in and
dialog: pays off the whole thing. Including the
dialog: vig -- brand new sequential hundred
dialog: dollar bills. I knew something was
dialog: wrong. Cause this guy's got a regular
dialog: job, no way he comes up with fifty grand
dialog: in cash.
dialog: But I tested the bills, infrared. The
dialog: whole thing. And they checked out.
dialog: 100%.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Do you still have the bills?
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: I still have my lunch money from third
dialog: grade.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Lemme see 'em.
text: Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a WALL SAFE.
text: He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill. Carter
dialog: checks it out.
speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: See. It's perfect.
text: Carter takes out a LIGHTER and holds the flame to it.
speaker_heading: KENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa, what are you doing?
text: Kenny's question is answered as the BILL BURNS BRIGHT RED.
speaker_heading: KENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: (pissed off)
dialog: I knew it. The guy's name is Zing. He
text: works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - REIGN PLAZA - CONTINUOUS
text: Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the

speaker_heading: HU LI
text: Who has her gun out. Waiting for them. ISABELLA is standing
text: near by, and ZING is visible off to the side. An 18-WHEELER
text: in the loading bay is just being shut and locked. A LIMO is
text: parked beside it.
text: Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions. When most of
text: the other WORKERS pull guns; other TRIAD SOLDIERS step out,

speaker_heading: HU LI
dialog: (in Chinese)
dialog: The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will
dialog: be remembered for ridding the Triads of
dialog: your petulance.
text: Hu Li savors the moment.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I hope you just said I have no business
dialog: being here, 'cos I was just leaving.
text: Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him,

text: feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: Hu Li, I think there's someone who will
dialog: want to talk to them first.
text: Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement. BANG! Lee

text: of her gun.
text: BANG! Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across
text: the jaw with her fist.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: ...oh, that's a filling right there.
dialog: That's gonna cost you.
text: Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards.
speaker_heading: HU LI
text: Put them in the truck.
text: The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I should kill you right now, but I'm

speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: No more hitting. I'll get in the truck

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yes. We have heaven.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Is it the same heaven, or is it a

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What's a Chinese heaven?
speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That's rough, man. If I don't get

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Tell me the truth, Carter. Do you think
dialog: I have a good voice?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Forget it. It doesn't matter.
text: Lee turns away from Carter.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: As long as you're asking...I think you

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I knew it. What does she know. You
dialog: want me to sing something?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That depends. How do the Fu-Cang-Long
dialog: usually kill their victims?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: They'll probably torture us first, shock
dialog: our privates, then put two bullets in
dialog: our eyes and one in the back of the

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Go ahead. Sing your ass off.

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Very nice.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It's focus. Every opponent has a weak

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'll remember that next time I'm

speaker_heading: ON CARTER

speaker_heading: CRAPS DEALER

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: CRAPS DEALER
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (starting to scream)
text: Everyone else at the table has thousand

text: blown. He jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
text: the locked vault. There's no way to get the plates.
text: Isabella has set him up again.
text: He turns and smiles at the confused SECURITY GUARDS.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Hi. How's it going? You guys have
dialog: change for a twenty?
text: The GUARDS make their move. And Lee starts to fight them
text: down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he RAMS into TWO
text: MORE GUARDS, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
text: the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
dialog: right cross.
text: Hu Li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
text: stands over him with FIVE TRIAD SOLDIERS. She holds a knife
text: to Lee's throat.
speaker_heading: HU LI
dialog: (in Chinese)
dialog: Open your mouth.
text: She puts the small grenade in Lee's mouth, tapes it shut.
text: She holds the detonator in her hand.
speaker_heading: HU LI (CONT'D)
dialog: (continuing in Chinese)
dialog: That's a ying-tao grenade, Inspector.
dialog: Please follow me or I'll blow 32 teeth
dialog: into your brain.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS
text: A crowd has gathered behind Carter who is at the table
text: rolling dice, a huge stack of chips in front of him.
speaker_heading: CRAPS DEALER
dialog: Winner six!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How much is that?
speaker_heading: CRAPS DEALER
dialog: Two-hundred thousand!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Two-hundred thousand dollars? Who wants
dialog: a hundred dollars?
text: Carter turns to the MAN next to him, who wears a traditional
text: AFRICAN ROBE and is standing with a giant blonde escort.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, your highness, have a hundred
dialog: dollars. The Viagra is on me tonight!
speaker_heading: GAMBLER
dialog: (South African accent)
dialog: I am not royalty, sir.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don't say that, we're all royalty. My
dialog: great grandmammy was Queen Nephertit --
dialog: we probably cousins, man. How much you
dialog: got on the table?
speaker_heading: GAMBLER
dialog: One million.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, we definitely cousins now. Who
dialog: wants to blow on my hand for luck?
text: Carter turns to a BIG TEXAN who is standing with a GORGEOUS
text: YOUNG GIRL who is falling out of her dress.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Marlboro man, you mind if your lady
dialog: blows on my hand for luck?
speaker_heading: TEXAN
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: She's not my lady. She's my niece.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Can I come over for Thanksgiving? Come
dialog: on, baby, give me some luck.
text: The GIRL blows on the dice, and Carter stares down at her.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice blowing. When's your next
dialog: birthday, I'll be the cake.
speaker_heading: TEXAN
dialog: Hey, buddy, watch yourself.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don't threaten me. I got friends in
dialog: this town that will bite off your ears.
dialog: Just sit tight, because I've got the
dialog: dice and I am on fire!
text: Carter throws the dice.
speaker_heading: CRAPS DEALER
dialog: Winner, seven!
text: The table erupts as Carter grabs the dice.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Let it ride!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The elevator doors OPEN and Lee is led toward the eye in the
text: sky room by Hu Li and the three Triads. As they walk into
text: the room, the Triads remain outside guarding the room.
scene_heading: INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: FORTY VIDEO MONITORS show every inch of the hotel. A MAN
text: stands in front of the two-way mirror looking down at the
text: casino, the reflection off the glass obscuring his features.
text: Lee has the tape around his mouth and his hands tied behind
text: his back as he's led into the room by Hu Li.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Imagine a business where people hand you
dialog: money. And you hand them back
dialog: absolutely nothing.
text: Ricky Tan - alive and well, turns around and stares at Lee.
text: Isabella is standing next to him. Lee is shocked at the
text: sight of Ricky Tan alive.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now that's a true American dream.
text: Thanks to a few pieces of metal and a
dialog: very greed driven US Customs agent.
text: Ricky Tan walks toward Lee, starts to smile.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at you, you're ridiculous. You
dialog: know it didn't have to be like this.
dialog: But it's too bad! Like father, like
dialog: son.
text: Lee stares at Isabella for a BEAT. Hu Li motions to one of
dialog: the monitors.
speaker_heading: HU LI
dialog: (in Chinese)
text: He's going for the plates.
text: Ricky Tan looks at one of the MONITORS, sees Steven Reign
text: walking down a hallway, about to walk into the PENTHOUSE
speaker_heading: SUITE.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Look at this old fool, what does he
dialog: think he's doing?
text: Ricky Tan shifts his attention back to Lee.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's almost impossible to find a partner
dialog: that's trustworthy and loyal. Wouldn't
dialog: you agree, Lee?
scene_heading: ON ANOTHER SCREEN
text: We see Carter at the craps table having the time of his life.
text: Ricky Tan turns to walk out of the room, motioning to
text: Isabella as he goes.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, at least you will die with honor.
dialog: But choy Gien.
dialog: SUBTITLES: "Won't see you again."
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS
text: Carter has two racks of chips in front of him, a huge crowd
text: surrounding him.
speaker_heading: CRAPS DEALER
dialog: Winner! Four, winner!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand.
dialog: That's a Ferrari. Do they sell those
dialog: here in the gift shop? Somebody cash me
dialog: out!
text: Several TRIAD SOLDIERS dressed like SECURITY GUARDS approach
text: Carter's table.
speaker_heading: PIT BOSS
dialog: Sir, we'd like to escort you to the
dialog: cashier.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That would be great. Don't want any of
dialog: these rich white people to jump me.
text: As they walk toward the door marked "VIP ROOM", Carter
text: glances at the MEN, knows he's in deep shit.
scene_heading: INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ricky Tan turns to Hu Li.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Chai Hu Li.
dialog: ("Little Fox")
dialog: Have fun.
text: Ricky Tan walks out. Hu Li holds the detonator up to Lee,
text: plays with the button.
speaker_heading: HU LI
dialog: (in Chinese)
dialog: In a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
dialog: this button.
text: Hu Li pulls her KNIFE, moves towards Lee. She holds the
text: blade to his face. About to cut him. When Isabella pulls
text: her gun.
text: Isabella walks toward Lee, whose hands are still tied behind
text: his back. Hu Li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
text: knife in the other. She takes a step toward Isabella.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: It's time to end this, Inspector.
text: Isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
text: from Hu Li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
text: sticking the gun under her chin.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't move! United States Secret
dialog: Service.
text: Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the
text: hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator --
text: the TWO WOMEN fight around it.
text: Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
text: rolls toward the detonator. He's about to grab it when:
text: THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR
text: They're about to move in.
speaker_heading: HU LI
dialog: Get the detonator!
text: The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet,
text: KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her.
text: One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee
text: gets to him first. He fights with one hand tied behind his
dialog: back.
text: Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM.
text: Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - CASHIER
text: Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when:
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW.
text: In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor.
text: The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including:
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Lee!!
text: The guards restrain him.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Lemme ask you something. Any of you
dialog: ever felt $500,000 before?
text: He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying
text: as the GUARDS hit the floor.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Doesn't feel so good, does it?
scene_heading: INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Hu Li picks up the detonator. WHACK! A heeled foot kicks it
text: from her grasp. Isabella has recovered! The detonator FLIES
text: OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS
text: On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND
text: DISAPPEAR into the crowd. It lands on a DRINK CART. Before
text: Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the
text: detonator on her rounds.
text: Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator. He JUMPS atop a
text: BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage. He can't see it,
dialog: but he does see:
speaker_heading: ACROSS THE CASINO
text: Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at
text: bay with a croupier stick.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Black man gets on a hot streak and
dialog: you're all trippin'?
text: Carter and Lee see each other. They have the same
dialog: simultaneous though:
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (help!)
dialog: Lee!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (help!)
dialog: MMMMMM!!!!
text: Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth.
text: But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE. The quickest way
dialog: is the HIGH WAY.
text: Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE. Scattering playing cards.
text: Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop.
text: He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
text: landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other
dialog: side.
text: Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in
text: the Sky Room. He grins.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Check it out. Catfight!
text: POW! He socks a GUARD in the face.
scene_heading: INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Isabella and Hu Li are locked in battle. Rolling to the
text: floor, they both see the gun. They scramble over each other
dialog: to get to it first.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS
text: A security guard CLIMBS on the table to level Carter when Lee
text: arrives. He kicks the guard off and turns to Carter, his
text: plea MUFFLED.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What the HELL are you doing with tape on
dialog: your face?
text: No time to explain -- two more security guards arrive. Kicks
text: and punches fly, but Lee CAN'T GET HIT IN THE MOUTH! He bobs
text: and weaves, holding his hands to Carter to untie them in
text: between swings. Suddenly:
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! GUNSHOTS from the Eye In The Sky Room.
text: Everyone HITS THE DECK. Carter and Lee dive on to the floor
text: as panic ripples through the Casino. People FLEE for the
speaker_heading: EXITS.
text: THE WAITRESS DESERTS HER TRAY. It gets knocked over and TIPS
text: on the floor. The DETONATOR LANDS feet away from Carter.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: This can't be good.
text: Lee's eyes BUG - he sees it too, feet STAMPEDING past it! A
text: high heel misses it by a fraction of an inch. He LUNGES for
text: it, manages to CRADLE it in his taped hands when --
text: WHAM! He is BUMPED and it FLIES AWAY. The second it hits
text: the floor, it is KICKED, skittering down the red carpet.
text: ABOVE...the victor emerges in the Eye in the Sky Room. Hu Li
text: STEPS OUT on the PAGODA ROOF and JUMPS DOWN.
text: The DETONATOR ROLLS right past Hu Li. As she bends to PICK
text: up the detonator, Lee knows he won't get there in time.
text: Horrified, he SCREAMS at CARTER through the tape.
text: Hu Li lifts the detonator.
text: Carter finally pulls the TAPE OFF Lee's face.
text: Lee SPITS the grenade into the air.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (diving on Carter)
dialog: Bomb!!!
text: Hu Li HITS the TRIGGER just as it lands on a roulette table.
speaker_heading: KABOOM!
text: The table is BLOWN OFF IT'S FOUNDATION. Chips and cash
text: volcano. Hu Li is blown backwards by the force of the blast.
text: SHEER PANDEMONIUM grips the casino.
text: AS THE SMOKE CLEARS
text: Carter and Lee peer out from behind a row of slot machines.
text: The place is deserted.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in
dialog: your mouth?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I did!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No you didn't!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yes I did. I said MMMMMM!
text: A hand on Carter's arm. THIS IS SERIOUS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEE (CONT'D)
text: Ricky Tan is alive.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What?!?!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: We have to get to the Penthouse.
text: Lee jumps up, SPRINTS toward the elevators at the dragon end
dialog: of the casino.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hold on!
text: Carter stuffs his pockets with chips, then races after Lee.
text: But halfway up the carpet. Carter stops. Lee turns to see
text: what is holding him up.
text: Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: You go after Ricky. I got this.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Carter...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Just GO!
text: Lee turns and runs off past the dragon. Unfortunately, FIVE
text: TRIADS block his path. In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes
text: short work of them, and races toward the elevators.
scene_heading: DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF!
text: Each readying in their own manner. Hu Li carefully wraps her
text: long hair into a bun on top of her head. Carter stretches,
text: flexes, ready to sting like a bee.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not gonna hold you back this time
dialog: just because you're a woman. I'm gonna
dialog: pretend you're a man.
text: She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her
dialog: undershirt.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
text: A very beautiful man with a perfect body
dialog: who I'd like to take to the movies.
text: She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND
dialog: like a master.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I may have been absent the day we went
dialog: over this in karate class.
text: Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta
text: soldier. WHOOSH! She SLICES IT IN HALF. Carter reaches for
text: another. SLICE! She's toying with him.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT
text: Lee's in the elevator as the doors close. SUDDENLY, a HAND
text: cuts through, parting the doors.
text: It's ISABELLA! A wound on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: I'm fine.
text: She steps in, too weak and starts to fall. Lee grabs her and
text: holds her in his arms. HE gently helps her down.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I didn't know which side you were on.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA
dialog: Now you know.
text: DING! The elevator doors open. Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY
text: - the key to the SUITE. Lee takes the key, backs away and
text: steps into the elevator.
speaker_heading: ISABELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll try to get backup. Be careful.
text: The elevator doors close.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS
text: Steven Reign is closing the safe. There are stacks of
text: HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a
text: black bag along with the plates. As he turns around, he
text: comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: American's love to gamble. Don't they,
dialog: Mr. Reign?
speaker_heading: STEVEN REIGN
dialog: I'm cutting our deal short. I'm
dialog: leaving.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: And my plates?
speaker_heading: STEVEN REIGN
dialog: They stay with me. I'm sure you won't
dialog: have a problem with that.
text: Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt. Grabs the bag and
text: starts to walk toward the door.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: I enjoyed that little story you told
dialog: about the Dragon and the treasure. My
dialog: mother used to tell it to me all the
dialog: time. Do you know the moral of that
dialog: story, Mr. Reign?
speaker_heading: STEVEN REIGN
dialog: Greed will imprison us all.
text: Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: I hate that fortune cookie shit.
text: Lee BURSTS through the suite door - watches as Reign falls
text: dead to the floor. Ricky takes the black bag off the desk.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: Put the plates down.
text: Ricky Tan looks down at the gun in Reign's belt.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - NIGHT
text: WHOOSH! Another Terra Cotta fighting stick is in half in
text: Carter's hands.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Will you STOP?!?!
dialog: (picks up cocktail umbrella)
dialog: What am I supposed to fight you with?
text: No more toying. Hu Li CHARGES Carter, who GRABS a ROULETTE
text: WHEEL as a MAKESHIFT SHIELD. She SLICES it in HALF! He's
dialog: got nowhere to hide.
text: She JABS him with the sword. Carter SCREAMS. Falls back
text: against the table, clutching his chest. Hu Li WINDMILLS,
text: kicking a Terra Cotta soldier on top of Carter, but --
speaker_heading: THWACK!
text: The DOUBLE-BLADED BAMBOO POLE in its hand ricochets back and
text: she is PIERCED THROUGH THE SHOULDER with the blade. Staring
text: at Carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.
text: Carter walks toward her, considers his options, then KICKS
text: HER IN THE HEAD, knocking her out.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: When are you people gonna learn? Don't
dialog: mess with the brothas!
text: WEAK in the KNEES, Carter looks to the SOUND ON HIS CHEST. He
text: reaches through the slice in his jacket. Instead of a hand
text: covered in blood, it comes out with a THICK WAD OF CASH!
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, Benjamin!
text: Carter runs for the elevator.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS
text: Lee is walking toward Ricky Tan, the two men circling Reign's
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: You're just like your father, Lee. All
dialog: these years hiding behind his badge. I
dialog: wanted to help him, to share with him,
dialog: but he was too afraid of change. When
dialog: you think about it, I didn't really kill
dialog: him. I just put him out of his misery.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: Put the plates down. It's over.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: I don't think it's over. There are
dialog: casinos all over this country. Let me
dialog: make you a rich man, Lee. Don't make
dialog: the same mistake he did.
text: Ricky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: If you reach for that gun, I'm going to
dialog: kill you.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Don't you remember? I'm already dead.
text: Ricky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,
text: taking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as
text: Carter bursts in the room.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hey, Ricky, how's it going man? What's
dialog: up, Lee?
text: Lee has the gun pressed to Tan's head. We've never seen him
dialog: like this before.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Would you like me to tell you how your
dialog: father died?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Lee, you okay?
text: Lee doesn't respond. He keeps an eye on Ricky.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: He never begged for his life. Or tried
dialog: to make a deal. All that he asked me,
dialog: just seconds before I pulled the
dialog: trigger, was that I promise not to kill
dialog: you.
text: Lee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the
dialog: trigger but can't.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Lee, wait a second. It's not worth it,
dialog: man. He's making you do this.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It's worth it to me.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: Do you have it in you, Lee? Or are you
dialog: gonna spend the rest of your life hiding
dialog: like your father?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: C'mon, Lee. He's going to jail. You
text: won, now just put the gun down.
text: Lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.
speaker_heading: RICKY TAN
dialog: That's what I thought.
text: Tan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the
text: plates hit him across the face and knock him down.
dialog: THE GUN IS LOOSE
text: Tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:
text: Lee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER. Both KICKING HIM
text: SQUARE IN THE CHEST.
text: Tan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW. Lee tries to
text: grab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.
text: But Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the
text: street below.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: A TAXI is parked out front. Tan's BODY SLAMS on the roof.
text: SMASHING THROUGH A SIGN ON TOP THAT READS: "EVERYBODY'S A
speaker_heading: WINNER!"
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT
text: Lee and Carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
text: it's finally over. Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don't know about you, but I need a
dialog: wine cooler.
text: As they turn to the door -- Hu Li is walking toward them,
text: bleeding and half-dead. She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND.
text: This one twice the size of the one from earlier.
speaker_heading: HU LI
dialog: (in Chinese)
dialog: We'll go together, Inspector.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Please tell me she just asked for a ride
text: to the airport.
text: Hu Li hits the switch - starts to smile. Lee and Carter turn
text: and RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Lee and Carter DIVE OUT THE WINDOW, grab a cable just as the
text: PENTHOUSE BLOWS!
text: The FIREBALL SHOOTS out as they start to slide down the side
dialog: of the hotel.
text: THEY SCREAM AS THE CABLE BREAKS.
text: Lee and Carter SWING toward a HUGE "GRAND OPENING" BANNER.
text: They flip under it, do a loop before they SLAM AGAINST THE
speaker_heading: SIGN.
text: It's KNOCKED LOOSE and they fall with it toward VEGAS BLVD.
text: Lee and Carter hang on as they drop to the street. A HUGE
text: TRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives.
text: The entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I can't believe I flew ten-thousand
dialog: miles for this shit!!
text: They lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES. The sign dips
text: and they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE
scene_heading: STRETCH LIMO.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS
text: Lee and Carter land in the back. Slam into their seats and
text: try to catch their breath. The TWO MEN STARTING TO LAUGH
dialog: when they realize they're alive!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We made it, man.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No problem.
text: Lee and Carter look up to see the VERSACE SALESMAN and FOUR
text: OF HIS FRIENDS sitting in the back of the limo staring at
text: them. The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a
text: night on the town.
speaker_heading: VERSACE SALESMAN
dialog: Well, there is a God after all.
text: Lee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of
dialog: the hotel.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: Here we are. The Red Dragon hotel.
text: In front of the hotel WE SEE FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCE, POLICE
text: CARS and Isabella and Sterling arresting TWENTY TRIADS.
speaker_heading: VERSACE SALESMAN
dialog: We're all going gambling and then to see
dialog: Siegried and Roy. I hope you two are
dialog: feeling lucky!
scene_heading: INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Lee is talking with a bandaged Isabella, who is standing with
text: Sterling and several other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. Lee and
text: Isabella hug goodbye. As she walks off to board her plane,
text: Lee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I saw that. She kissed you, didn't she?
dialog: You played it cool, though. Walking
text: away, never looking back.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: She's going home to New York. I need
dialog: some ice.
text: Lee and Carter watch as she gets on the plane.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That your gate down there?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I'm this way. I guess this is goodbye.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I guess so. Thank you, Carter.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You take care of yourself, Lee.
text: Carter steps back, BOWS TO LEE. Lee SHAKES CARTER'S HAND
text: like a brother. The two men smile. Turn to walk away.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Carter, wait. There's something I want
dialog: you to have.
text: Lee pulls a BADGE from his pocket. Hands it to Carter.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Your father's badge? No way, man. I
dialog: can't take this.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It's okay. I can finally let it go.
text: Carter takes the badge. Smiles.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: In that case, I got something for you.
dialog: I picked it up at the hotel.
text: Carter pulls out a WAD OF CASH.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: About fifty grand. I won it at the
dialog: tables.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No, Carter. I can't take this.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It's okay, I got lots more.
text: Carter pulls out another wad of cash.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: They owe us, man. That's the least they
dialog: can do.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: This money is evidence.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Come on, Lee. Stop being a cop for five
dialog: minutes and live it up. There must be
dialog: something you want.
text: Lee looks back toward Isabella.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I always wanted to go to Madison Square
text: Garden. See the Knicks play.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: New York City?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: First class.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The Plaza Hotel?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: A little Mu-shu.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Some Kung-Pao?
text: They look at each other, smile.
