speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: They had so much fuckin' money in

speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: ...were all slipped in there to skim
dialog: the joint dry. They'd do short

dialog: even take cash right out of the drop

dialog: right here [NANCE], standin' in front

speaker_heading: COUNTER #1

speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: Now, notice how in the count room
text: nobody ever seems to see anything.
dialog: Somehow, somebody's always lookin'
dialog: the other way. Now, look at these
dialog: guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy,
dialog: right? They're countin' money. Who
dialog: wants to bother them? I mean, God
dialog: forbid they should make a mistake

speaker_heading: NANCE

speaker_heading: PISCANO

speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)

speaker_heading: STONE
dialog: You don't have to have a license to

speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: But what happens when they do find

speaker_heading: STONE
dialog: Why would they want to find out?
dialog: We're puttin' a hundred million into

dialog: do is keep changing your job title.
dialog: Like, uh, from Casino Executive to

speaker_heading: GINGER

speaker_heading: HIGH ROLLER #2
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: Who didn't want Ginger? She was one
dialog: of the best-known, best-liked and
dialog: most respected hustlers in town.
dialog: Smart hustlers like her could keep a

dialog: sending him home broke to the little

scene_heading: INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: GINGER comes back from the ladies room. She kisses ACE.

dialog: Any change?
speaker_heading: GINGER

speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: That was all bullshit. She just

scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE - NIGHT
text: GINGER converts her chips into a pile of $100 bills.
speaker_heading: GINGER
speaker_heading: (To CASHIER)
dialog: How you doin' tonight?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Good. How are you?
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: Oh, beat.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: Ginger had the hustler's code.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Take one for you.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (While she counts out
dialog: the cash)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: She knew how to take care of people.
dialog: And that's what Vegas was all about.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
text: (As she pushes a stack
dialog: of $100 bills across
dialog: the counter)
dialog: Sixty-eight hundred.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Thanks
text: She picks up the cash.
speaker_heading: CASHIER

speaker_heading: GINGER

speaker_heading: CASHIER

speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Hey, Mitch.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: ...pit bosses, floor managers.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)

dialog: and take care of anything.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Thanks a lot.
speaker_heading: SHIFT BOSS
dialog: Thank you, Ginger.
scene_heading: EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: GINGER exits and gets into her car, slipping a VALET PARKER
dialog: a $100 bill.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: Ginger took care of the parkers
dialog: because they took care of the security
dialog: guards, who took care of the metro
text: cops, who let her operate.
speaker_heading: VALET PARKER #3
dialog: Thank you, Ginger.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: (Getting into her car)
dialog: I need that stuff tonight.
speaker_heading: VALET PARKER #3
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: You're a doll.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: The valet parking job was such a
dialog: money-maker that they had to pay off
dialog: the hotel manager just to get the
dialog: concession.
scene_heading: INT. GINGER'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: GINGER enters the room with $25,000 in her hands. She taps
text: LESTER DIAMOND's leg with it and he turns to her.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: But one thing I could never
dialog: understand, was that she could have
dialog: everything under control, except for
dialog: her old pimp boyfriend, Lester
dialog: Diamond.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Look, Gin, you know I got other people
dialog: in this. I got partners. But I want
dialog: you to understand that I am lookin'
dialog: out for you in this thing. Okay?
dialog: You're going to get yours back...
dialog: and you're gonna get it back first.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Where are you goin'? Where are you?
dialog: You're in that place. Where are you?
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: I'm here.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: No, you're not. Where are you? Where
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: I'm always here for you.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: You are.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: I am.
text: He hastily kisses GINGER and slips out the door.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look
dialog: at this creep.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: LESTER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: He was a moocher, a card cheat, a
dialog: country-club golf hustler. A
dialog: scumbag... chasing dentists for a
dialog: few bucks.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Careful.
text: GINGER looks out of the window and sees LESTER get into a
text: convertible and drive off.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: I mean, the guy was always broke, he
dialog: always had a story. And somehow, she
dialog: could never turn him down. The way
dialog: Ginger saw it, I guess, was that
dialog: Lester was just an unlucky guy.
dialog: Somebody had to take care of him.

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: I mean, he took care of himself only

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (To customs agent)
dialog: Excuse me, but I folded these things

speaker_heading: COP #1
speaker_heading: (To MARINO)
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: Because Nicky enjoyed being a

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Come on. There we go. Look at that.
dialog: Beautiful.
text: Diamonds fall on the red towel in slow motion.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ACE

dialog: down. Who the fuck were they gonna
dialog: run to? So, I started getting
dialog: everybody in line. Best of all, for
dialog: the first time in my life, I figured
dialog: out a way not to lose.
speaker_heading: ACE (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme,
dialog: all right. It wasn't very scientific
dialog: but it worked. When he won, he
dialog: collected. When he lost, he told the

dialog: were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?

speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)

dialog: But he forgot how lazy them European
dialog: dancin' broads can get. I mean, he

speaker_heading: ACE
speaker_heading: (To SHOWGIRL)

speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER

speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER

speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: ...all you do is give me answers.
dialog: Just - just give me the right answer.
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I
dialog: guess, maybe, because she's frightened
dialog: that if she doesn't lose the weight
dialog: she may even get fired.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: That's right. She will get fired. In
dialog: fact, I want you to send her back to

speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER

speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: No. Just stop everything.

speaker_heading: NICKY (V.O.)
dialog: Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He

dialog: the only town in the country where a
dialog: bookie joint is legit, so, why not
dialog: take advantage, right? So... he
dialog: took bookie joints off the street
dialog: and then opened them up inside the
dialog: casino. Well, within a few years, by

speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: ACE

dialog: Don't worry about that stuff.
text: Outside the glass door NICKY arrives via the stairs from the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE CLARK (O.S.)
dialog: It's just a political witch hunt.
text: ACE opens the sliding glass door and NICKY enters.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Hey, Ace.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Hey.
text: NICKY walks over to CHARLIE CLARK.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Want something to drink? Charlie you
dialog: want a refill?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE CLARK
dialog: Yeah, refill'd be great.
speaker_heading: NICKY
speaker_heading: (Approaching CHARLIE)
dialog: No, I don't want one.
dialog: (Smiling, extends his
dialog: hand.)
dialog: Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE CLARK
dialog: (Shaking hands)
dialog: Hi. Good.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (Sitting down with
dialog: him on a couch)
dialog: I've been trying to reach you.
dialog: You're tougher to get than the
dialog: President.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE CLARK
dialog: Well, I've been busy.
dialog: (Chuckles.)
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah, least you could do is return
dialog: my phone calls, though.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE CLARK
dialog: Listen... Nicky... we talked about
dialog: this... and, uh, I explained to you
dialog: that there was the possibility you
dialog: might have to take some kind of loss.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (Pause.)
dialog: I think I want my money back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE CLARK
dialog: (Chuckling)
dialog: What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You know... I think that you've gotten
dialog: the wrong impression about me. I
dialog: think in all fairness, I should
dialog: explain to you what it is that I do.
dialog: For instance, tomorrow morning I'll
dialog: get up nice and early, take a walk
text: down over to the bank and walk in
dialog: and see you, and, uh... if you don't
dialog: have my money for me, I'll crack
dialog: your fuckin' head wide open in front
dialog: of everybody in the the bank. And
dialog: just about the time that I'm comin'
dialog: out of jail, hopefully, you'll be
dialog: comin' out of your coma. And guess
dialog: what? I'll split your fuckin' head
dialog: open again. Because I'm fuckin'
dialog: stupid. I don't give a fuck about
dialog: jail. That's my business. That's
dialog: what I do. And we know what you do,
dialog: don't we, Charlie? You fuck people
dialog: out of money and get away with it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE CLARK
text: (As he puts a notepad
dialog: in his briefcase)
dialog: You can't talk to me like...
speaker_heading: NICKY
text: (Grabbing CHARLIE by

speaker_heading: CHARLIE CLARK
dialog: (To ACE, panting)
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is

speaker_heading: (Walking with CHARLIE
dialog: to the stairs.)

text: A frightened CHARLIE hurries down the stairs.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You fuckin' try me.
text: He turns to ACE who's behind the bar.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You think he got the point?
speaker_heading: ACE
speaker_heading: (Walking to NICKY)
dialog: What're you doin'? He's a square
dialog: guy, for chrissakes. You can't treat
dialog: him like that. He's gonna run to the
dialog: FBI.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Fuck the FBI! That prick's been
dialog: dodging me for three weeks. And what
dialog: is it with you? All of a sudden,
dialog: you're tryin' to tell me what to do
dialog: all the time.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: I'm not tryin' to tell you what to
dialog: do. But you were way out of line,
dialog: Nick. What're you doin'? Where's
dialog: your head?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Where's my head? Where's your fuckin'
dialog: balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to
dialog: put somethin' really big together
dialog: out here. You know what I'm talkin'
dialog: about, huh? You know! If you're
dialog: actin' like this now, how can I depend
dialog: on you? There's a lot of things
dialog: gonna change out here. And if you
dialog: wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're
dialog: gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Listen, Nick, you gotta understand
dialog: my situation. I'm responsible for
dialog: thousands of people. I got a hundred
dialog: million a year goin' through the
dialog: place. It's all over, I'm gonna
dialog: tell you, it's all over, if I don't
dialog: get that license. And believe me,
dialog: if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go
dialog: bad for a lot of people, you
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah, forget about your fuckin'
dialog: license. I plant my own flag out
dialog: here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin'
dialog: license.
dialog: (Pause.)
dialog: You know, I don't know what it is,
dialog: Sammy, but the more I talk to you,
dialog: the more I feel like you just don't
dialog: wanna go along with me, is that it?
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: No, I don't wanna come -
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You should say so.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: I don't wanna come along with you.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Just say so.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: I'll be honest with you.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: All right, fine.
speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (Holding up the

dialog: You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the
dialog: boss.' That's quiet?
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: That's all taken out of context.
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: I have no control over that. Ronnie
dialog: and Billy were right there. They'll
dialog: tell you exactly what happened.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Well, back home they don't know about
dialog: fuckin' control. That looks bad.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: What happened to me? What happened

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: You lost your control.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I lost control?
speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: NICKY

dialog: lost control?!
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NICKY

dialog: Even your own wife.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: My wife?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Now, what does she have to do with
dialog: all this?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Well, she comes to see me. She was
dialog: upset about a lot of things,
dialog: especially that whole fuckin' Diamond -
dialog: that Lester Diamond incident.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: All of a sudden, you're the shoulder
dialog: to cry on? Did you at least tell her
dialog: about your little role in that whole
dialog: situation?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No, I didn't. What good would that
dialog: do? That's not the fuckin' point.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Listen, I would -
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (Interrupting)
dialog: The point is that she's upset. She's -
dialog: and you got a fuckin' problem.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: I - I would appreciate it if you'd
dialog: stay out of my personal life, okay?
dialog: You wouldn't like it if I did it to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Hey, she came to talk...
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: ...to me.
speaker_heading: ACE

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: She came to talk to me...
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: And I - what was I supposed to do,
dialog: throw her out?
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Ju-just stay away from her. It's
dialog: none of your business, okay? There
dialog: are certain things you don't do, and
dialog: you know that.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It's none of my business?
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: That's right, yeah.
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: A week ago it was my business, now
dialog: it's none of my business. In other
dialog: words, when you need me to take care
dialog: of somethin' for you, then you need
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Yeah, that's right, the way you need
dialog: me to vouch for you as a citizen and
dialog: get you out of one of your jams. I'm
dialog: gonna have to straighten out what

dialog: calmed myself down and we went to

dialog: twenty-five thousand for three suits?
dialog: That doesn't make much sense.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: (Seated across from
text: GINGER at a booth)
dialog: First of all, he's not gonna wear f-
dialog: thousand-dollar suits. But let's say
dialog: he did, which he won't. How you gonna
dialog: get fitted for twenty-five suits in
dialog: three days? I, um, I mean, how could
dialog: you get fitted that fast? I can't
dialog: get fitted that fast, and I pay twice
dialog: as much.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: I bought him a watch too.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GINGER

speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: At the most, which is impossible for

speaker_heading: ACE

text: She looks at ACE.
speaker_heading: ACE
dialog: (Pause)
dialog: So, counting the watch, let's say

dialog: must have had a good time. I know he
dialog: did. That's for sure. I know that...
