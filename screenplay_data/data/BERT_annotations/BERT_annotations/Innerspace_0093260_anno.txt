dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: Cutty. Up.

dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: You broke my lucky flask!

dialog: Afraid of a little electricity,

text: Drives his fist into Igoe's stomach. In fact, Tuck hits

dialog: to his elbow!
text: Tuck looks horrified.
text: He pulls his arm out. And with it, much of Igoe's inner
text: workings: Wires, circuits, relays, diodes, switches. They
text: all come tumbling out in one big tangled, HUMMING, heap.
speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: An android!
text: Igoe begins to short-circuit. Smoke billows out from all
text: the openings in his body. A HISSING noise. SPARKING WIRES.
text: Then, Igoe erupts into flames.
text: Tuck jumps back.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON IGOE'S TATTOO.
text: Flames shrivel and melt the "skin" on Igoe's chest, and
text: the heart-shaped tattoo with Margaret's name in the center
text: begins to perish.
dialog: 435
speaker_heading: TUCK
text: grabs an onboard extinguisher and tries to douse the fire.

scene_heading: INNERSPACE - Rev. 12/3/85
dialog: 126.

speaker_heading: TECH ONE
dialog: There's the chip!

dialog: forced to cover their ears. And then:
speaker_heading: 444
dialog: THE POD APPEARS!
text: Full-sized. Standing in the middle of the lab. Dented

text: Smoke pours from its vents.
speaker_heading: BLANCHARD
dialog: Fire on board!

speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Get back!

dialog: First Blanchard. Then Niles.

speaker_heading: TUCK
dialog: Lydia!

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look... this has been the most
