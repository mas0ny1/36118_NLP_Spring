dialog: You understand.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Unh.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: And you don't hate me?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: And deserve to be.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Unh hunh.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Well. The food here was excellent

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Three and a half.

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: It's really good we had this talk.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Before things went too far
dialog: You know, got too serious.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm too serious.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: No, you're not. It's me.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: No, it's me.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Okay. It's you. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: 'Cause I mean
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: The thing is, I want to do what's
dialog: right  for both of us. I spent
dialog: a lot of timeexaminingmy heart.
dialog: And I felt that you deserved
dialog: my honesty.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Now I just want to make you

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I'm whole.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: 'Cause I was afraid we wouldn't

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: (laughing, sort of)
dialog: Oh, Joy!
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Oh, but you know how it is.
dialog: And well, most guys
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I'm not most guys.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: I know. If only most guys were
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: But then I'd be like most guys.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Oh, Stuart. If only I felt the way
dialog: I'd like to feel with you Life is
dialog: so unfair. It's all my fault.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I know.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: STUART

speaker_heading: STUART

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: For me?
speaker_heading: STUART

dialog: Open it up.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: (discovers a pewter ashtray)
dialog: Oh, but Stuart. This isoh,
dialog: this is beautiful.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Thanks. It's a Gainsevoort

dialog: I sent away for it just after

speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: STUART

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Forty karat gold-plate inlaid base.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Oh, Stuart. Thank you. This really
dialog: means something to me. I'll always
dialog: treasure itas a token
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: No, you won't.
dialog: (retrieves his gift;
dialog: a sudden shift in emotion:)
dialog: 'Cause this is for the girl who
dialog: loves me. The girl who cares for me,
dialog: for who I am, not what I look like.
dialog: I wanted you to know what you'd be
dialog: missing. You think I don't appreciate
dialog: art. You think I don't understand
dialog: fashion. You think I'm not hip.
dialog: You think I'm pathetic, a nerd,
dialog: a lard-ass fatso. You think I'm shit.
dialog: Well, you're wrong. 'Cause I'm
dialog: champagne. And you're shit.
dialog: And till the day you die, you,

dialog: I want to flip her ass over and

dialog: so that my come squirts out of

dialog: actuallydo that Oh, if only she
dialog: knew how I felt, how deep down I
dialog: really cared for her, respected her,
dialog: she would love me back. Maybe.
dialog: But she hardly even knows I exist.
dialog: I mean, she knows I exist  we are
dialog: neighbors, we smile politely
dialog: at each other But I don't know
dialog: how I could ever begin to really
dialog: talk to her, what can I talk about?
dialog: I have nothing to talk about.
dialog: I'm boring. I know. I've been told
dialog: before, so don't tell me it's not
dialog: true. 'Cause it's a fact. I bore
dialog: people. People look at me and they
dialog: get bored. They listen to me and
dialog: they zone out, bored And for her
dialog: to see how boring I amno, no, no
dialog: It's better I say nothing and hope
dialog: though right now, I have to say,
dialog: if I were to suddenly jump out of
dialog: my window, she wouldn't care. I mean,
dialog: she'd care, of course, she'd care,
dialog: I mean, she is human, but I mean
dialog: she'd care the way you care about a
dialog: stranger you read about in the paper
text: that jumps in front of a running
dialog: subway train, a stranger whose name
dialog: you're never sure how to pronounce,
dialog: if it's even printed. I'd be an
dialog: anectodemaybe. But you know what
dialog: I'm going to do? When I see her
dialog: next time, as soon as I see her,
dialog: I'm just going to tell hertell her
dialog: I find herattractive. And that'll
dialog: be that. Thenthen we'll see

text: He leans his head against the wall, listens to HELEN making love to somebody next door: "Oh, Helen! Helen! Helen!" etc. He removes his ear from the wall, sits on the bed, a phone book beside him.
text: He starts flipping randomly through the phone book. He turns to a page. He dials a number from the book. No answer. He sighs. Tries to next number down. A man picks up. ALLEN hangs up immediately. He dials again. A beautiful-sounding WOMAN picks up.
speaker_heading: ALLEN

speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: I don't know what it is,

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Did another guy dump you?
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: No! Ioh, I feel horrible.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Aww. Timmy didn't mean it.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: I'm sorry. I-I'm just overworked.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: It's okay. Because now maybe

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: What?
dialog: A weighty pause.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You've got to eat red meat.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Oh, Trish
speaker_heading: TRISH

dialog: and, well My doctor says just
dialog: once a month
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: I know
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Really. It's the best thing for
dialog: the skin. It'll clear it all up.
speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Are you really?
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Being around you and the kids
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Oh And I'm so happy you're happy.
dialog: 'Cause all this time I've been
dialog: thinking you were so miserable.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Oh, Trish! That's too funny,
dialog: when I couldn't be happier.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: It's just, what with your
dialog: music career never really
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: My career's fine!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Oh, I know, it will be!
dialog: I just know it! And then you'll
dialog: move out of Mom and Dad's
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Real soon!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: And you'll meet Mr. Right!
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Oh, I will. Already I feel
dialog: I'm off to a fresh start!
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: That's right. Just because
dialog: you've hit 30, doesn't mean you
dialog: can't be fresh anymore.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: That's right.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You know, Joy, I've never told you
dialog: this before, but now that we're
dialog: older, and I feel so bonded to you,
dialog: wellthe truth is  oh, I know this
dialog: sounds horrible, but I feel I have to
dialog: be fully open with you, get beyond
dialog: all the old barriers, sibling nonsense 
dialog: well, the truth is I always thought
dialog: you would never amount to much. That
dialog: you'd end up alone, without a career
dialog: or anything. Really, it's what we all
dialog: thought. Mom, Dad, Heleneveryone
dialog: I'd always prayed we'd all be wrong,
dialog: but you had always seemed todoomed
dialog: to failure. But now I see, it's not true.
dialog: There is a glimmer of hope for you
dialog: after all. Oh, I know I'm repeating
dialog: myself, but, oh
dialog: (tears well up)
dialog: I'm so happy for you

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Gee, I don't know.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: How do you feel at the end?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Much better. I wake up happy.
dialog: Feeling good. But then I get very
dialog: depressed because I'm living in reality.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: And you wouldn't kill people
dialog: in real life.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No. I don't think so.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: You don't sound so certain.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm thinking about my patients.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: My patients are ugly. Their problems
dialog: are trite. Each one thinks he is
dialog: unique. On a professional level they
dialog: bore me. On a personal level I have
dialog: no sympathy. They deserve what they get.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: And what about your family?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Trish is good to me.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST
dialog: But still no sex?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No. But she's not too interested,
dialog: either. So really there's no problem
dialog: there, when you think about it,

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't wanna talk about it.
text: And he leaves for the TV room again.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Ignore him. He's just doing it for
dialog: attention. He thinks you'll be
dialog: impressed. As if. So anyway
dialog: Joy came by today.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How's she doing?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Oh, God, I dunno, and frankly
dialog: I'm concerned. I mean, she's not
dialog: like me. She doesn't "have it all."
dialog: She pretends to be happy, but
dialog: I can see right through her:
dialog: she's miserable.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Why do you think that is?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: To be frank, I think she's lazy.
dialog: She's not a go-getter, like me or
dialog: Helen. And she's so picky. I gave
dialog: Damien Ross her phone number, for
dialog: what it's worth, and Joy sounded
dialog: interested, naturally, butI dunno.
dialog: I'm afraid to have to say it, but
dialog: truly it's what I believe: she'll
dialog: always be alone.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We're all alone.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Oh, Bill. Sometimes I wonder how any
dialog: of your patients can talk to you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sometimes I wonder if they'll ever
dialog: stop. I should tape some for you.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Would you? Would you really?
dialog: So that I could listen, too?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: You're such a tease.
dialog: You know I wouldn't tell anyone.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I know. 'Cause you're so secretive.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Well, maybe not as secretive as you.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What secret would you like me to
dialog: tell you?
text: IRISH puts her arms around BILL.
speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: How did it feel?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I dunno. I don't know what to do.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Do you want me toshow you?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No! No! I'm not normal!

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yeah, well
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Oh, I know how weird these things
dialog: can be, but I've always had such faith
dialog: in Trish's judgment that I thought
dialog: why not. It's not like I've got some
dialog: huge social life. I mean, I do have a

dialog: I can't tell you the half of it:

dialog: Now I believe in unions, I'm sensitive

dialog: But that was another time, another

dialog: believe me, those teachers making
dialog: sacrifices for the union, well, the
dialog: union's not going to make any
dialog: sacrifices for them. Those union

dialog: Now we need people who can be dedicated,

dialog: Because this job takes courage.
