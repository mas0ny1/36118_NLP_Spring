text: Teenagers have sex. This is a movie about teenagers who have sex,
dialog: but that doesn't mean there's sex in the movie. Some of the best
dialog: teen films have been about sex and love and nobody ever got naked.
dialog: This film will look beautiful and everyone will look sexy, but
dialog: there's absolutely no reason anyone has to get naked.

text: CREDITS ROLL OVER ‘GIRL ON THE STREET’ INTERVIEWS done on
text: a cheap video camera in various locations around Chagrin
text: Falls, Ohio (population 6,500, an hour south of
dialog: Cleveland):
text: A TEEN GIRL #1 speaks into the camera, playing with her
text: hair as she tries not to giggle.
speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #1
dialog: Mostly, girls just hook up with guys at
dialog: parties, but usually it’s with someone
dialog: they know, like a friend. I mean, it’s
dialog: not like I hear people saying I’m saving
dialog: myself for marriage or anything.
text: She giggles and we cut to a TEEN GIRL #2, this one
text: scrunching her face into her turtleneck, to hide her
text: identity. Her friends mill in the background.
speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #2
dialog: The point of being young is to experience
dialog: a bunch of people so you know what you
dialog: want. In a few more years I’1l be able
dialog: to tell a good one from a bad one.
speaker_heading: CROWD GIRL #1
dialog: (yelling out)
dialog: And the big ones from the little ones.
text: Another teen laughs, revealing her face and we cut to a
text: TEEN GIRL #3 who has her hair cropped close. She speaks
text: directly at the camera, dangerously close to the lens.
speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #3
dialog: They’re nasty sluts. And slutty girls
text: become slutty women and then they marry
dialog: nasty guys, who drive gross cars and
text: smell like cheap beer.
text: A TEEN GIRL #4 pushes the Teen Girl #3 aside and screams:
speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #4
dialog: Is this like those Girls Gone Wild? Are
dialog: you from MTV?
text: SHE RAISES HER SHIRT AND FLASHES HER BREASTS, SCREAMING:
speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #4 (CONT’D)
speaker_heading: WHOOOO!
text: The screen freezes. The title
dialog: 11/4/05 2.
dialog: Normal Adolescent Behavior
text: Appears over her breasts.
scene_heading: EXT. CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL: QUAD - DAY
text: MUSIC: Gary Glitter sings his raunchy “Do You Wanna Touch
dialog: Me”
dialog: Late Summer in Chagrin Falls, Ohio about forty minutes
text: south of Cleveland. WENDY BERGMAN (senior, 17, beautiful
text: but not ready to accept it) walks through the “Coop”
text: private school grounds; she leads us under banners that
text: say “WELCOME NEW CLASS” and “DON’T DIS THE ORIENTATION --
text: HAVE FUN AND WELCOME!” It all feels like it could be the
text: Summer of Love except for the girls are wearing Seven
text: jeans and the guys are wearing vintage and everyone’s
dialog: hair is done, even the ‘alternative’ kids.
text: Wendy passes by as a group of fifty students does a ‘lap
text: sit’ -- they stand in a circle and then sit down at the
text: same time. Eventually they fall amid general hysterical
text: laughter. If Wendy wasn’t rolling her eyes before, she
dialog: certainly is now.
text: ACROSS THE QUAD we meet BILLIE (17, short blond hair and
dialog: vintage clothes, hottest girl in school according to
text: current web polls). She is walking towards Wendy; she is
text: blond to Wendy’s brunette, intelligent enthusiasm to
text: Wendy’s brilliant sarcasm. They are a perfect match for
dialog: each other.
text: A car pulls up quickly between them as they near the
text: parking lot. It squeals to a stop and SEAN MAYER (17,
text: tall with good looks that skew slightly pretty) gets out
text: of the car. The car squeals away. If it looks like the
dialog: opening of the Breakfast Club, well, all the better. He
text: skulks towards the orientation festivities but he also
text: steals a glance at Wendy.
text: Billie yells out to Wendy:
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Woman!
text: Wendy jogs the last few feet to her best friend and then
text: they join the rest of the group. Besides Billie there is
text: ANN, Chinese with a defiant red streak in her hair; JONAH
text: a stoner reading a Miles Davis biography;
dialog: 11/4/05 3.
text: ROBERT, tall and the most conventionally good looking of
text: the unconventional group and PRICE who has blond hair and
text: blue eyes and wants desperately to fit in. Which is why
text: he pulls out, and places on his head, a TRUCKER’S CAP.
text: The GROUP GROANS.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You should burn that hat.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: It’s plastic. Toxic fumes?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: He could burn a little of it
text: Symbolically.
text: She jumps up, fishing a lighter from her bag. She hands
text: the hat and the lighter to Price.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it. Show us you’re better than the
dialog: hat.
text: The group looks at Wendy, asking for permission.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Burn a little. It’1ll be good for you.
text: Price burns a little of the hat, sheepishly, and the
text: group all cheer. Price leans over to hug the girls and
text: it quickly turns into a wrestling/play fight. Wendy looks
text: up and sees a FRESHMEN GIRL and guy whispering and
text: looking at the group’s antics. Wendy stands up, brushing
dialog: herself off.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (to the Freshmen)
dialog: Can we help you?
text: The rest of the group get up as well, looking slightly
text: sheepish, except for Billie. The Freshmen stand there,
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: What?!
dialog: 11/4/05 4.
text: Freshmen Girl points to Wendy’s necklace, which reads
dialog: “Hoochie”.
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN GIRL
dialog: I like your necklace.
text: The two laugh and walk away. Wendy touches her necklace,
dialog: stung.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Okay! I think we’ve successfully oriented
dialog: ourselves. Billie?
text: Billie stands up, and the group gathers their things.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (to Wendy)
dialog: Are you leaving?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (motioning out to the field)
dialog: Can’t. My brother’s here.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (to Wendy)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Call me later?
speaker_heading: WENDY
text: Frigging right.
text: All six hug, with real warmth. Somebody yells out to
text: them from a passing car.
scene_heading: STUDENT IN CAR
dialog: Kiss. Kiss. Kiss!
text: Wendy and Billie roll their eyes.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Seriously, when did being a lesbian
dialog: become cooler than blowing a rock star?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You’ve never blown a rock star.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Neither have you.
dialog: 11/4/05 5.
text: They laugh. The other four are a little ways away, but
text: Billie hangs on to Wendy for a second.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: What if you could blow a rock star?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: And ruin what we have?
text: Billie slaps Wendy’s ass.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: That’s my girl.
text: Wendy waves at Billie as she joins the others and walks
text: off. Wendy is all alone outside the school. She wanders
text: around, kicking a few pebbles, she picks a leaf froma
text: tree and starts humming the theme to “The A-Team.”
text: Wendy goes back inside the school.
scene_heading: INT. CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL: HANGAR - DAY
text: The school is empty, a little eerie. Still humming,
text: Wendy heads towards the classrooms, which are all ina
text: large hangar type building -- each classroom is divided
text: with partitions into a “bay”. In the center is a library
text: and at the far corner, a SCIENCE classroom.
scene_heading: INT. CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL: LAB - DAY
text: Inside the science area, Wendy opens a door removing
text: ETHANOL. Pouring the ethanol into a wide-mouthed beaker
text: she places the leaf in the ethanol, lights a Bunsen
text: burner and lets the leaf start to boil in the solution.
text: Sean watches, unseen by Wendy.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Blowing up the school?
text: Wendy tries to act cool.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Did you follow me in here?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I wanted to get the lay of the land.
dialog: Plus I hate that song.
dialog: 11/4/05 6.
text: Sean hums the “A-Team” theme back. Wendy is caught for a
text: second, then comes right back at him.
speaker_heading: WENDY
text: The “lay of the land”.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I’m new. I figured I could, I dunno,
dialog: memorize where everything was.
speaker_heading: WENDY
text: There’s not much to memorize.
text: She turns him around and points out the “landmarks” of
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: These are the classrooms. No walls, so
dialog: you have to have respect for everyone.
dialog: That’s a big word around here -- respect.
dialog: Make sure you use it inappropriately.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Like irony.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: That would be “incorrectly.”
text: Wendy points out some more places in the school.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the library. We gather in the
dialog: lounge for announcements every Thursday
dialog: for Community Meeting; better known as
dialog: “where people bitch about the lack of
text: respect in the public bathrooms”.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You’re not blowing anything up, are you?
text: Wendy turns back to her leaf.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Get the lights.
text: She gestures to the other side of the room. Sean runs to
text: the switch, hits it. The sun has started to set, so the
text: room is relatively dark.
text: Wendy turns the Bunsen burner off. The leaf GLOWS BRIGHT
speaker_heading: RED.
dialog: 11/4/05 7.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D)
dialog: I just read about it and I wanted to try
text: it. The electrons in the leaf are
dialog: ‘excited’. They have these names that
dialog: are so... Human. Excited. Lazy.
dialog: Aggressive. Did you know they can be
dialog: “impure”?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You couldn’t try it during school?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I hate chemistry.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: But
text: She puts her finger to her lips.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Shhh.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Your secret’s safe. I swear.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Who would you tell?
text: He’s stung, but hides it.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: My mom’s a chemist. I would never make
dialog: fun of you for liking this stuff.
speaker_heading: WENDY
text: (indignant, he’s hit close to
dialog: home )
dialog: If you did I’d kick your ass.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: If I did it would be ironic.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: That’s incorrect.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Kicking my ass would be inappropriate.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No, but it would be disrespectful.
dialog: 11/4/05 8.
text: A pause as she looks at Sean. He smiles at her. She
text: tries not to smile back but she does.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Wendy!
text: The lights blaze on, and the leaf stops shining red.
text: Sean and Wendy move apart, quickly. At the other end of
text: the room is NATHAN BERGMAN (15, he recently grew about
text: six inches, now he’s a taller version of his gawky old
dialog: self).
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: My brother, Nathan.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Can we go home already?
text: Wendy dumps out the ethanol and leaf, and walks away from
text: Sean, who quickly follows her.
scene_heading: EXT. BERGMAN HOUSE: DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Wendy’s car pulls into a driveway, on the left, a large
text: Tudor house, on the right, a similarly sized brick home
text: with a much less well-tended yard.
scene_heading: INT. WENDY’S CAR - DAY
text: Sean sits in the passenger seat, Nathan’s in the
dialog: backseat.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (points left)
dialog: This is me.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (points right)
dialog: That’s me.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You know?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Have you read “The Watchmen”?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You knew who I was?
dialog: 11/4/05 9.
text: Sean keeps his eyes on Wendy.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah. I mean, I saw you, you know,
dialog: around. I didn’t know who you were.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: So you read it? Because I have all of
dialog: them. If you wanna, you know, read them
dialog: or whatever.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, I’1l read them.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I’m going in, okay?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You could come over...ask my mom about
dialog: impure electrodes or whatever.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I’m good. Thanks.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (super eager)
dialog: Or you could come over to our house
dialog: tomorrow? You can read them then.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, sure.
text: Nathan grins, thrilled. Wendy watches Sean as he gets
text: out and goes into his house. Nathan is already at their
text: front door.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You have the keys!
text: Wendy sighs and gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Why’d you ask him over for Saturday?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Why not?
text: Wendy doesn’t answer.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: LEGEND: This Is Saturday

scene_heading: INT. JONAH’S HOUSE: ROOM - DAY 7
text: Zippy, happy pop music plays as we see our group get
text: ready for Saturday night in their own homes on a Saturday
dialog: afternoon.
text: Jonah fixes his hair, takes a long pull on a bong,
text: refixes his hair and then puts on a Cleveland Indians
text: baseball hat.
scene_heading: INT. ANN’S HOUSE: ROOM - DAY 8
text: Ann sits on her bed, which is surrounded by posters that
dialog: have inspirational sayings, like “Hang In There, Baby,”
dialog: and “God Will Provide, But It Helps To Study”. Ann
text: brushes her hair, tries out pigtails, then a ponytail,
text: then scrunches it around so it covers her face.
scene_heading: INT. PRICE’S HOUSE: ROOM - DAY 9
text: Price reads a copy of RAYGUN while he is lifting weights.
scene_heading: INT. BILLIE’S HOUSE: ROOM - DAY 10
text: Billie applies lip liner, fills it in and then blots.
text: She does it again. And again.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE: BATHROOM - DAY 11
text: Robert showers, singing loudly along to the pop song we
dialog: hear.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S BATHROOM - DAY 12
text: And finally Wendy, who is in her bathroom, sitting in the
text: tub though there is no water in it, as she absentmindedly
text: drums her fingers.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: NATHAN’S ROOM - EVENING 13
text: Nathan sits poised in his room, when the doorbell rings
text: and he springs to life and runs out
dialog: 14
dialog: 15
dialog: 11/4/05 11.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: LIVING ROOM - EVENING 14
text: Nathan sprints down the stairs and runs to answer it.
text: Downstairs, Sean is waiting for Nathan.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Hi!
dialog: (trying to be cool)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (he holds the comics up)
dialog: I brought these. If you want to read
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Great. Cool.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So thanks for inviting me.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: We’re neighbors.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: KITCHEN - EVENING 15
text: Nathan has carefully prepared a tray of food, which is
text: waiting for them.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Holy shit. My mom can barely make pop
text: tarts.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Oh I made it.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: For me?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yeah, I mean, I don’t get many guys, I
dialog: mean people, you know...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah. No. That’s cool.
dialog: 16
dialog: 11/4/05 12.
text: Sean takes an involuntary step back.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No... I mean, I like to cook, so it isn’t
dialog: like. I mean, like I didn’t plan
dialog: everything, it’s not a trap. Here.
dialog: Look, see these, these are really easy to
dialog: make - -
text: Nathan grabs a cookie off the tray and hands it to Sean
text: but as he does, he trips on his own feet, he tumbles
text: towards Sean and his hand ENDS UP ON SEAN’S CROTCH.
text: There is a moment where Nathan doesn’t know what to do.
text: His hand actually stays there he’s so confused.
text: Sean moves away and Nathan stands up and does what anyone
text: would do; he runs out. Sean goes after him.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN’S HOUSE: WENDY’S ROOM - NIGHT 16
text: The girls are hanging out, talking about Sean.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: He’s from Chicago.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: So he transferred as a senior?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I guess. People transfer.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: In third grade people transferred. We’ve
dialog: had the same people in our classes
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
text: He seems a little too Queer Eye and not
dialog: enough Straight Guy.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (a little too quickly)
dialog: He’s not. He’s nice.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: He’s nice?
dialog: 11/4/05 13.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: He was nice to Nathan.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Your brother is easy to be nice to. Like
text: puppy dogs and homeless people.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Billie!
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I’m not the one making him out like Sean
dialog: the Saint.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (the peacekeeper )
dialog: If we were normal girls, we’d be fighting
text: over him. Fresh meat.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Thank god we’re not normal.
text: Wendy goes to the door.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m getting a pop.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: For me too.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Yeah.
text: Wendy shuts the door.
scene_heading: 17 INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: KITCHEN - NIGHT 17
text: Wendy is getting three Diet Cokes from the fridge.
speaker_heading: SEAN (0.S.)
dialog: Dammit.
scene_heading: 18 INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: BACK FOYER - NIGHT 18
text: Wendy walks toward the voice, seeing Sean in the back
text: foyer, standing in front of an open garbage can. He has
text: an apple core, which he can’t throw away because the
text: garbage is overflowing.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah. I was supposed to take that out.
dialog: 19
dialog: 11/4/05 14.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Hey.
text: Wendy takes glances quickly above her, as if Billie and
text: Ann could see her right now. But they can’t, so:
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I’1l get it.
text: Wendy takes the garbage bag out of the garbage and ties
text: it shut.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You need help?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Sure.
text: He takes the bag and follows her to the backyard.
scene_heading: EXT. BERGMAN HOUSE: BACKYARD - NIGHT 19
text: They walk to the six trashcans that line up on the
text: property line between their houses. Sean’s backyard is
text: littered with boxes.
text: Wendy opens a trashcan and Sean places the bag inside.
text: As he does, his hand touches hers for a moment, and she
text: catches his eye.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You were sweet to come by.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Nathan’s weird. But potentially very
dialog: cool.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: He’s temporarily weird. Proof that
dialog: phases are real.
text: Wendy absently wipes her hand on her pants.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Is your hand okay?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Huh? Yeah. You know when you touch
dialog: something gross?
text: Sean looks down at his own hand.
dialog: 11/4/05 15.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Oh god, no -- not you. I’m sorry. I
dialog: meant the garbage.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Oh.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I should go in.
text: They don’t move, just stand there for another moment.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You’re kinda weird, too.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Amazing line. Brilliant.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And how do you know it’s a line?
text: He steps closer to her, thinking about kissing her
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Well, if you’re calling me weird in
dialog: earnest, that’s pretty mean.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: So you’re hopeful I’m trying to pick you
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Pick me up? What are you from, 1976?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You’re funny.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No I’m not.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah. Clever. Funny. Smart. You like
dialog: science.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Those are all words that mean ugly.
dialog: 20
dialog: 21
dialog: 22
dialog: 11/4/05 16.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You are definitely not ugly. You’re just
dialog: pretty and smart.
text: Wendy has nothing to say to this. They move closer to
text: each other so that they are almost kissing, but they
dialog: don’t touch.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I can’t-- I mean, I’m not...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (not moving)
dialog: I’m not available. If you didn’t find
dialog: that out at orientation, you’1l
dialog: definitely find it out soon.
text: From in front of the houses the sound of a horn honking
text: interrupts them; Sean and Wendy stay still for one moment
text: longer, but then Sean realizes who it is.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: Sean leaves Wendy standing there. She waits until he is
text: gone and then sprints inside.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: KITCHEN - NIGHT 20
text: Wendy grabs the three Diet Cokes, frantic, almost
text: dropping them. She runs upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S ROOM - NIGHT 21
text: Billie and Ann are looking out the window at the car;
text: Wendy rushes in and looks over their shoulders to see
dialog: Sean.
scene_heading: EXT. MAYER HOUSE: DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 22
text: WENDY’S POV: Outside Sean’s house, ALLYSON, another

dialog: convertible.
dialog: 23
dialog: 24
dialog: 25
dialog: 26
dialog: 11/4/05 17.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S ROOM - NIGHT 23
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Allyson? What does she want?
scene_heading: EXT. MAYER HOUSE: DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 24
text: And a second later, they get their answer. Sean runs out
text: of the house and gets in the car.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S ROOM - NIGHT 25
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Apparently so.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (trying to remain aloof)
dialog: That was fast.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: That poor boy. He has no idea what he’s
text: getting himself into.
text: The girls watch the car pull away, past a Brown Sedan
text: that is gently rocking.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: That car has been there every night this
dialog: week.
text: A foot sticks out of the passenger window. The girls
text: laugh. Billie goes back to the bed, but Wendy keeps
text: looking out the window.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Are we getting ready or what?
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 26
text: Later that night, the three girls are in Wendy’s
dialog: bathroom.
dialog: 27
dialog: 11/4/05 18.
dialog: They have done their makeup and hair for a Saturday
text: night, not too slutty, not too conservative. They look
dialog: average, all-American, Midwestern.
text: The girls look into the mirror into each other’s eyes
text: smiling.
text: N.E.R.D.’s song “Truth or Dare” starts playing. The
text: SOUND OF A LOUD PARTY.
speaker_heading: ALLYSON (0.S.)
dialog: (yelling to be heard)
dialog: They are complete magno-sluts.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE PARTY: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 27
text: Music continues.
text: LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM, we see that everyone is treated
text: to television sets running non-stop porn. Everyone
text: drinks. Bong hits in the corner. In the background,
text: girls disappear with guys into a variety of rooms.
text: Basically, an average teen party.
text: Sean stands with Allyson. RYAN (a girl, also a senior)
text: is sitting on a kitchen counter nearby but out of
text: earshot, with her boyfriend, AARON who is strumming a
text: guitar. Alex, another senior, hands out beers to Sean
dialog: and Allyson.
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: I mean, I understand why the guys do it
dialog: but the girls? It is total depravity.
text: THE DOOR THAT SEAN IS LEANING ON OPENS, and a sexy girl
text: comes out of the bedroom, wiping her mouth. Sean lets
text: her pass, and she looks at him, smiling seductively. A
text: moment later a guy comes out, buttoning his pants.
speaker_heading: ALLYSON (CONT'D)
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: You should ask Ryan and Aaron. They got
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Got out? What, it’s a cult?

dialog: (serious)
dialog: I guess. I mean, I don’t know what else
dialog: you would call it. Don’t you have to
dialog: kill yourself to be in a cult?
dialog: 11/4/05 19.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And they all have sex with each other?
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: It’s pathetic, I know.
text: Sean looks around at all the sex and drinking going on at
dialog: this party.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So, why is what you’re doing different
dialog: than what they’re doing?
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: It just is. See, we invite them every
dialog: week and they never show. Obviously they
dialog: think they’re better than us.
text: Allyson notices something across the room.
speaker_heading: ALLYSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god! They put in a pole? That is
dialog: so cool.
text: Allyson goes towards the stripper pole someone has
text: installed in the rec room.
speaker_heading: ALLYSON (CONT’D)
dialog: I wanna turn!
text: Sean moves through the party, heading for the kitchen
text: where he last saw Ryan. Two guys play Playstation in one
text: room, while a girl gives another guy a lap dance, a blank
text: stare on her face. Sean walks by TWO TANK-TOP GIRLS
text: going to the bathroom wearing almost identical tank-tops.
scene_heading: TANK-TOP GIRL #1
dialog: Are you going to Brian’s thing tomorrow
dialog: night?
scene_heading: TANK-TOP GIRL #2
dialog: Yeah. I just wish it wasn’t a BJ party.
scene_heading: TANK-TOP GIRL #1
dialog: Seriously. They should hand out bibs.
text: Sean looks at Ryan.
dialog: 28
dialog: 11/4/05 20.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE PARTY: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 28
text: Later on, Sean holds two beers as Ryan fixes her shoe,
text: shaking a pebble out of it. She stumbles a little, then
text: gets the shoe back on.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I’m not used to these. Aaron likes them.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Your boyfriend?
text: She shrugs, as if to say, “what can you do”.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT’D)
dialog: So you know Wendy?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Don’t. Really.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I just want to-- she’s my next door
dialog: neighbor, you know?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah.
text: There’s a pause as Ryan and Sean watch a bunch of girls
text: playing spin the bottle for a group of very rowdy guys.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Look, we just had an... arrangement, the
dialog: eight of us. And when Aaron and I didn’t
dialog: want to be with them anymore, we stopped.
dialog: It’s not like I had to be de-programmed.
dialog: Everyone wants it to be this big deal.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So it’s more like a club?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What is it then?
text: Ryan can’t really answer. The girls playing spin the
text: bottle kiss and everyone cheers.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I can’t talk to her?
dialog: 29
dialog: 11/4/05 21.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No. I mean, you might be able to talk to
dialog: her, and maybe hang out at school. You
dialog: should join Student Council. we’re, I
dialog: mean they’re all on it. I’m not anymore.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah. What, you figured we hung out and
dialog: smoked crack?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No. I don’t know.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Amnesty, and Model Congress and the Green
dialog: Party. Last year we worked on two local
dialog: campaigns.
text: Sean looks shocked.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT’D)
dialog: (kind of annoyed)
dialog: Yeah, good students who have sex. It
dialog: happens.
text: They watch another group of girls kiss in the spin the
text: bottle game and then get doused with beer.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I gotta find Aaron.
text: She leaves Sean alone. He sees the SEXY GIRL WHO CAME
text: OUT OF THE ROOM. She smiles at him and reaches out. He
text: smiles shyly but lets her lead him back inside to a
text: bedroom. As they enter, Tank-Top Girls look on.
scene_heading: TANK-TOP GIRL #2
dialog: What is she going for, a world’s record?
text: They laugh.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERT’S HOUSE: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 29
text: In contrast to the party, Robert’s house is quiet, and
text: serene. Marathon Man plays on the television. Our six
text: are sitting on the floor of Robert’s sunken living room,
text: despite the overstuffed and expensive furniture. They
text: are all draped over each other, so that you can’t tell
dialog: whose legs are whose.
dialog: 11/4/05 22.
text: During the scene they throw individually wrapped condoms
text: at each other, winging them hard, like frisbees.
text: In front of them are six SHOE BOXES, each one with a name
text: on it, one for each of them.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I would definitely want to torture Jack
dialog: Black.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: He’s funny!
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: He’s perfect torture material. He thinks
dialog: he’s funny, so he’d be laughing. Until
dialog: he cried. Why, who would you torture?
speaker_heading: WENDY BILLIE
dialog: Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay Lohan.
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
text: Obvious and tired. Something original.
text: Billie sticks out her tongue.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (to Ann, of the boxes)
dialog: You putting in or taking out?
speaker_heading: ANN
text: Taking out.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You always take out. I’m surprised that
text: box isn’t empty.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: I’d torture Eminem. Without a doubt.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: He’s so smug, ya know. And he thinks
dialog: he’s black. So I would tie him up and
dialog: shock him with stuff. You know, feet in
text: a tub of water.
text: Ann reaches into her box and pulls out a small black
dialog: marble.
dialog: 11/4/05 23.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: The marble that I stole in fifth grade.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Because I’m going to give it back. Bad
dialog: karma.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Like you know anything about karma. You
dialog: should be worried about the yin and yang
dialog: of that box.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Besides, I stole that marble. You just
dialog: held onto it for me.
text: Ann sticks her tongue out at Price.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You stole that marble because someone- -
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: -- Lisa Nishi--
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Right, Lisa Nishi, told you that you
dialog: could sit with her if you did.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I don’t remember that.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I do. She let you sit with her and her
dialog: little fifth grade posse for one second
dialog: because you only stole one marble.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Who the hell plays with marbles anyway?
dialog: It’s so dipshitty 1957.
text: Price shrugs.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I’d torture at least one Olsen.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (clearly one of her faves)
dialog: 11/4/05 24.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I would. She would be so spunky and then
dialog: she'd break...it would be totally
dialog: delicious.
dialog: (to Ann)
dialog: Why? wWho’d you torture?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I dunno. That Harry Potter kid probably.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Wendy? It’s your turn.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah. In. Putting in.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Thank god. I’m sick of everyone taking
dialog: stuff out. First you put it in the box
dialog: and cry about whatever dumbass memory it
dialog: stands for. And then you fish it out,
dialog: saying you want it back.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Crying?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (picking up Price’s box)
dialog: Yeah, and how many things are left in
dialog: Senorita Price’s?
text: Jonah fakes crying as he and Robert dip into the box.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Ohhh, this is the black nail polish I
dialog: wore when I wanted to be Goth.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Screw you.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I can do whatever I want. It’s my box.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Yes baby, it is.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: What’s going in?
dialog: 11/4/05 25.
text: Wendy holds up her “Hoochie” necklace, that the freshmen
dialog: pointed out earlier.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: That was a gift.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You’re always saying you don’t want us to
dialog: apologize. Well, I don’t want us to bea
dialog: joke. It’s not funny.
text: Everyone thinks about that for a second.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: I’m funny.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You’re freaking hysterical.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (still hung up on the game)
dialog: You know the torturing? Well, what would
dialog: we torture them for?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: To torture them.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Usually there’s a...end result. Like
dialog: information or because you need to send a
text: message to the other side.
text: Robert starts laughing.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: The other side? There isn’t another
dialog: side. We’re just saying -- if we were
dialog: gonna break someone’s will, who would it
dialog: be?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Um. I dunno. Do they have to be alive?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: No. You’re not gonna do it anyway, so
dialog: no. Anyone.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Either Abraham Lincoln or me at twelve
dialog: years old.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Fuck. That is such a good answer
dialog: 11/4/05 26.
text: Billie takes stock of the boxes.
speaker_heading: JONAH (CONT’D)
dialog: (re. the boxes)
dialog: I went. We all went.
text: Robert stands up and stretches.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You guys gonna help clean up?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: You have a fucking maid.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Who reports back to my dad. Come on.
text: Price, Jonah and Robert go out to start cleaning, Wendy
text: and Ann start cleaning halfheartedly the area around
dialog: them, what they can reach.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Price got really cute this summer.
text: Billie lays back, her head in Ann’s lap.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We have to stop using that word, “cute.”
dialog: Bunnies are cute. Men are sexy.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: These aren’t men.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: They will be.
text: She rolls over so she is looking at Wendy.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: They’11 be our men. Ten years from now
dialog: they’1l be the strongest, smartest men
dialog: anyone knows. And they’1l be ours.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: In ten years, I’m not gonna be here.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Why not? After all you invested? This
dialog: is almost 17 years of training, of
dialog: learning. You want to start from
dialog: scratch?
dialog: 11/4/05 27.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (upset)
dialog: You’re kidding right? What, we’re gonna
dialog: buy a big house in Utah?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (nonplussed)
dialog: You’1l see. We’re all going to college
dialog: together. And then get houses next door
text: As if to prove her point, Billie grabs Price by the knees
text: as he walks by; he falls on the floor. Then she
text: straddles him. He tries to get up.
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: (to Ann and Wendy)
dialog: A little help, here?
text: Instead the girls all sit on Price, and it turns into
text: more of a wrestling match/tickling fight. Price is
text: outnumbered so Robert and Jonah come to his “rescue.”
text: Robert grabs Billie and Jonah grabs Wendy, leaving Ann on
text: top of Price.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Sorry, kids. It’s Saturday night and
dialog: rules are rules. Without rules we would
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (mocking her)
dialog: That’s a little dramatic.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Billie is drama.
text: Nonetheless they re-order, and not without some giggling.
text: Now Robert is with Wendy, Price is with Billie, and Jonah
text: is with Ann.
text: The three couples start making out at various speeds, but
text: each one is fully engaged with whomever they are with.
text: As the camera pulls up and moves over the three couples
text: they each end up on the floor, Robert on top of Wendy, he
text: starts to take off his shirt; Billie straddles Price, his
text: hands go underneath her pants; Ann holds Jonah’s hands
text: down and slowly kisses him, moving down his chest
text: Condoms litter the floor. We hold above them.

scene_heading: EXT. ROBERT’S HOUSE: ENTRANCE - NIGHT 30
text: Billie and Wendy sit on the front steps of Robert’s
text: house. Wendy has her head in Billie’s lap, and they
text: share a bottle of beer. Billie is looking at Wendy’s
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You have, like, sixteen split ends.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Shut up.
text: They sit in silence, looking out on the suburban street
text: everyone asleep, the gray hazy light of pre-dawn.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: When we get to college--
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Shhh. This is the best time. This is
dialog: the time I don’t think about things like
dialog: college. Just--
text: Wendy gets it, and they return to the silence.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (looking at her watch)
dialog: It’s Sunday.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah, you’re a freaking genius. Shut up
dialog: we’re supposed to be having quiet Zen

scene_heading: EXT. CLUB: PARKING LOT - NIGHT 31

dialog: mean, if I have to lay there anyway, at
dialog: least I could be having fun, right?
dialog: 32
dialog: 33
dialog: 11/4/05 29.
text: She gets distracted by her text messages, and wanders

speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #6
dialog: I’m like a boyscout --
speaker_heading: YELLING GUY (0.S.)
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: FLAT AS ALL HELL!
speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #6
dialog: (she flips them off)
dialog: I’m prepared. I don’t wanna have to have

scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: KITCHEN - MORNING 33
text: Wendy comes into the kitchen. Wearing low-slung jeans
text: and a sweater, she looks relatively tame. Wendy grabs
text: some orange juice. ABBY BERGMAN (40’s, dresses mostly in
text: caftans and wears a lot of ethnic jewelry) drinks coffee.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I would kill for your body.
text: Wendy kisses her mom on the cheek
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: The best thing I can tell you is don’t
dialog: get pregnant. I’d have a flat stomach
dialog: today if I had stayed a person and not
dialog: become a mom.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Mommm.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: See?
text: Nathan comes into the kitchen in his baggy jeans and long

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (opening the refrigerator)
dialog: Nobody ate the coffee cake I made?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I can’t eat that stuff.
text: Abby doesn’t say anything. Nathan takes a piece for
text: himself, eats it quickly and washes it down with milk
text: from the container.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now can we go?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I gotta get my bag.
text: Nathan leaves Abby and Wendy alone for a moment.
text: A pause.
dialog: ensemble.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You ready for your college interviews?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You worried I won’t clean up okay? That

speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Ask him if he needs a ride.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Shut up. He’1l think I’m gay.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I’m not gay.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: So then what do you care?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I care. I completely care.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Are you going to ask any girls out today?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: So why not be a little gay? For me.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (lamest comeback ever)
dialog: You be a little gay.

scene_heading: EXT. MAYER HOUSE: FRONT DOOR - MORNING 35
text: Nathan rings the bell and waits, backing up a little.
text: From the side of the house, a stream of water, followed
text: by HELEN MAYER, 40, sexy even in her sweats, she holds
text: the garden hose in front of her, watering everything she
text: sees, turning most of it to mud.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (giving a little wave)

scene_heading: EXT. MAYER HOUSE: FRONT DOOR - MORNING 37
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hi. My brother was supposed to ask you
dialog: if Sean needed a ride. To school.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I think he was dropped on his head a lot.
dialog: My brother. Not your son.
text: Helen laughs.
dialog: 11/4/05 33.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That'd be great. The ride. Not the head
dialog: dropping.
text: Helen goes back to the hose and sprays an upstairs
text: window. BILL MAYER, (movie star handsome with 10 extra
text: pounds) opens it after a second.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (out the window)
dialog: You rang?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Sorry, I thought that was Sean’s room.
dialog: Tell him he has a ride waiting.
dialog: (to Wendy)
dialog: We have to get him acar. Actually we
dialog: have to get me a car, too. We’re city
dialog: people, I guess.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: It’s not a problem.
text: An awkward pause.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Sean said you’re a scientist?
speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
dialog: (he gets his stuff, fumbles)
dialog: Sorry.
text: Wendy feels terrible but there is nothing she can do, so
text: she lets Sean leave.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Sorry.
text: Wendy doesn’t say anything.
text: WENDY’s POV: she watches Sean go into school in the
text: rearview mirror, and she sees Robert and Jonah walk by,
text: completely oblivious to the fact that Sean was in her car
text: a few moments ago. Wendy loses sight of Robert and Jonah
text: until there is a loud bang on the roof of her car. Wendy
text: throws the door open.
speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (to Ryan)
dialog: Doritos?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You ready?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: we’re leaving?
speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (nonchalant )
dialog: Okay. We can go to a “thing”.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Actually, “some other thing”.
dialog: 11/4/05 36.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: That too.
text: Billie finally looks away from Ryan and smiles her
text: Cheshire Cat Grin. Wendy pulls her away.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Don’t be an instigator.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (loud enough for Ryan to
dialog: hear)
dialog: I’m just making sure our little housewife
dialog: is being a good girl.
text: Wendy looks back at Ryan, who is clearly upset by the
text: almost -confrontation.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do I always say to you?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (playing along)
dialog: It’s because they named her Ryan.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: After a soap opera. Don’t name children
dialog: after soap operas. How many times do I
dialog: have to tell you people?
text: Wendy and Billie laugh. Price and Robert come back up to
text: the two of them, now that the moment has passed.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (to Wendy)
dialog: Did you have to wrestle her? Was it
dialog: really ugly?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: She didn’t have to do anything. I’m as

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Really?

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: NATHAN

text: Sean's confused. He picks up another book, does it

text: control his frustration.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I want to kiss you. Pretty much every
dialog: time I see you I want to kiss you.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: That girl, Ryan? She was one of my best

dialog: ever.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: And Aaron.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I saw him

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I don’t live in that world--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: --What? You don’t live in what? The
dialog: world of boyfriends? Of first dates? Of

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No. You, jackass. Of disposable

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: I got a nose job.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PRICE
dialog: Yeah. And I do crunches every day. A

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I don’t understand. You got a nose job?

speaker_heading: BILL

text: INTERCUT WENDY LISTENING TO BILL/HELEN.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I didn’t say anything.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: I saw it. The “Good Night Moon” look.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That look you used to get when you would
dialog: be reading to Sean. That “I’m a dad”
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I can’t help it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You’re already a dad.
dialog: 11/4/05 57.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I’m not arguing.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I start next week. And we’ve paid off
dialog: all our credit card bills. All of them.
dialog: And the car?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah -- so that makes it okay, a BMW?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: A Beemer. Which you wanted.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Please stop saying that.
speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That’s fine. Just don’t say we’re
text: trading a BMw for a baby.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: It’s just, if things were different--
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: --hey, I said I was sorry.
text: Bill says nothing. Helen heads back to their bedroom.
speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT’D)

text: Wendy is near the lounge area when Sean jogs up and
text: starts walking next to her
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Don’t.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I’m walking next to you.
text: Wendy walks faster. Sean walks with her.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Stop it.
text: Wendy pulls Sean into a nearby storage closet, unaware

scene_heading: INT. CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL: CLOSET - DAY 61
text: Sean tries to kiss her, but Wendy stops him.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You can’t and then you can. You won’t
dialog: and then you do. How much more of this
dialog: am I supposed to stick around for?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Until graduation?
text: Sean lets this sink in, then he starts to open the door.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Now you want me?

dialog: 62
dialog: 11/4/05 59.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Come on. Seven months. You can’t wait
dialog: for me?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: If you were in the army or something,
dialog: yeah, I could wait for you. You’re going
dialog: to hook-up with three guys for seven
dialog: months. So no, I don’t think so.
text: Wendy takes his hand and puts it on her breast.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You want what your parents have, don’t
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I guess. They seem pretty happy.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I guess.

speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Maybe. Maybe.

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Wait in here.

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You have something you want to tell me?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (playing it off)
dialog: I stole some french fries from you
dialog: yesterday at lunch.
text: Billie pulls, harder and is about to retort when:
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: (in her bitchiest tone)
dialog: What’s wrong girls? Did someone forget
dialog: to feed the lesbian?
text: A gay girl with a buzz cut and another gay girl with
text: tattoos on her neck laugh.
speaker_heading: ALLYSON (CONT'D)
dialog: See, even the lesbians don’t want you.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: They were laughing at you, Allyson. You
dialog: need to learn how it works, Al. That
dialog: little man in the canoe down there won’t
dialog: help himself, you know. At least the
dialog: guys I sleep with know what to do.
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: You’re like completely perverted.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Jesus. You give new meaning to the word
dialog: “meaningless sex” you know? I don’t mean
dialog: the act. I mean the gender. Without
dialog: meaning.
speaker_heading: ALLYSON
dialog: (barely able to breathe)
dialog: And yet, you’re the ones who are still
dialog: skanks.
text: The SCIENCE TEACHER has walked in.
scene_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 11/4/05 61.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I believe Allyson just referred to us as

scene_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: Allyson?
text: The teacher leaves it at that and then starts writing on
text: the board, back turned. Allyson flips off the girls.
text: Billie, Wendy and Ann all put their fingers up to their

speaker_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER (CONT’D)
dialog: (without turning around)
dialog: Is there a problem girls?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Women. We want to be referred to as
dialog: women.

speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispers to Wendy)
dialog: I better not have seen what I just saw.
dialog: Did I see that?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No.
text: Billie grabs Wendy’s arm a little to hard, a moment that
text: is part violent, part desperate.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: We’1l die without you. You know that.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I have to go to the bathroom.
dialog: (trying a joke)
dialog: You can live without me for a minute,

text: Wendy slips from Billie’s grasp and walks out of the

speaker_heading: BILLIE

text: contemplating her plan.
scene_heading: INT. BERGMAN HOUSE: WENDY’S ROOM - DAY 63
text: Wendy and Sean are kissing, half undressed. Wendy moves
text: toward Sean but misjudges the distance on the narrow bed
text: and starts to slip off. Sean tries to grab at her, but
text: she falls.
text: Wendy is laughing hysterically. Sean goes to help her up
text: and she pulls him off the bed.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You didn’t land on your butt
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It was just my head.
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: It wasn’t that bad.
text: She reaches over and slaps Sean on the ass.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Shut up, that didn’t hurt.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Your rings?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It’s okay.
text: She hits him again. He slaps her lightly back.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No. Hit me for real.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What?
dialog: 11/4/05 63.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hit me for real. I want to feel what
dialog: it’s like to be spanked for real.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I’m not gonna hit you.
text: Wendy gets on the bed, Sean follows, dubious.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I’m telling you it’s okay. You’re not
dialog: gonna hurt me if I tell you it’s okay.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (he is upset at the idea)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Nobody ever spanked me. Not once.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I got spanked for stealing once. It hurt
dialog: a lot. And it’s cruel. I’m never
dialog: spanking my kids.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (half playing)
dialog: You have to. Sometimes they’re bad and
dialog: they have to learn. I never learned.
dialog: Hit me.
text: Sean won’t do it so Wendy hits him on the arm. And then
text: the leg. She smacks his face. Sean does nothing. Then
text: he pounces on her, turns her over and spanks her
text: He stops.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: This is really weird.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Do it again. wWhy’d you stop?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Cause I think this is...
dialog: (searches for word)
dialog: ...abnormal.
text: Wendy gets up.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (pissed off)
dialog: I’m not abnormal.
dialog: 11/4/05 64.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I didn’t say you were. I said that this
dialog: was just...
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No fine, I’m totally abnormal and you
dialog: just want the girl next door.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You are the girl next door.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Come back.
text: Wendy sits on the side of the bed.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I have Calculus to do.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So do I.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: So get to work.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Don’t you want me to take you out on
dialog: dates?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Shouldn’t you have done that before we
dialog: had sex?
dialog: (Sean doesn’t laugh)
dialog: I don’t know how to be a girlfriend. I’m
dialog: not sure I want to know.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Come here.
text: Wendy doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: World fucking peace.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hey look, it’s Sarcastic Man. Able to be
text: a jerk in a single bound.
dialog: 11/4/05 65.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Bite me.
text: She does. He laughs. Sean flips Wendy over and spanks
text: her lightly, once.
speaker_heading: WENDY
text: It doesn’t feel like much.
text: Sean hits her again, testing his strength.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You guys never did this before? On your
dialog: Saturday nights?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I don’t believe you.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Are we talking or spanking?
text: Sean hits Wendy hard, harder than he has before.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit. Ow. Everyone has to be into it.
dialog: We all have to agree and some people
dialog: don’t like to get spanked, I guess.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Do you?
text: He hits her again. She reaches back and hits him.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT’D)
dialog: You can’t hit me.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We have rules now?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (getting nasty)
dialog: I thought you’d like it if we had rules.
dialog: Don’t you guys have rules in your club.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Don’t call it a club!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What else would you call it?
dialog: 11/4/05 66.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We’re friends. We’ve known each other
dialog: since we were in elementary school. I
dialog: love them.
text: Sean smacks her, three times. Wendy finally loses her
text: temper and pulls herself up and away from him.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: It’s your game.
text: Wendy thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You make it sound perverted. Calling it
text: a club.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You don’t think it’s perverted?
text: Sean looks at her, still pouting a little.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I never worry. Like about if I’m pretty,
dialog: or sexy. I never worry about parties or
dialog: being alone -- cause we love each other.
dialog: And I know you think it’s weird, or
dialog: whorish. But my friends are cool people.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Who you like to fuck.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: So? I like sleeping with you too. And
dialog: you’re never gonna make me feel like they
dialog: do.
text: A pause and then Sean moves towards her, but she backs
dialog: away .
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Are those the only rules?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Be honest. That’s the only other one.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (softening)
dialog: I guess you’re breaking that one with me?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 11/4/05 67.
text: Wendy looks in his eyes.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Were you lying?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: When you said you loved me?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I never said that.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: But you do.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Say it then.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah.
text: She hits him.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Say it back!
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Maybe.
text: A pause as she looks at him.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You don’t have to--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We kiss now, right?

speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #10
text: (standing nearby, smirking)
dialog: Or, not popular, and popular.
speaker_heading: TEEN GIRL #9
dialog: It’s stupid. Like I have to kiss a girl

scene_heading: EXT. BERGMAN HOUSE: DRIVEWAY - DAY 66

speaker_heading: WENDY

dialog: 11/4/05 69.
speaker_heading: NATHAN

scene_heading: EXT. MAYER HOUSE: FRONT DOOR - DAY 67
text: Wendy and Nathan slowly approach the front steps.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Ummm.

speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Ummmm. Hi.
text: Helen opens her eyes, looking at Nathan; her hair is

text: overwhelmed by her beauty. Wendy is more shocked.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh. God this must seem... I mean, you
dialog: must think--
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You’re locked out, huh?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Not exactly. Bill’s late and I don’t
dialog: have a car. I have somewhere to be.
text: Nathan takes a step back. But Wendy stays still,
text: something about Helen makes her want to stay and help.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Do you need a ride?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It’s fine. I can call a taxi or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: WENDY

dialog: That jackass. We might as well be in
dialog: high school.
dialog: (suddenly yelling)
speaker_heading: DAMMIT!
dialog: (and then back to “normal”)
dialog: We should go back. You shouldn’t be
dialog: driving me places. This is completely
text: through the looking glass.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You want to go back?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: If by back you mean Chicago, then yes. I
dialog: wanna go back.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: No. Keep going. It’s on Duane. About
dialog: three blocks away I guess.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Oh.

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (suddenly very much a mother)

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: He did?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Do you?
dialog: 69
dialog: 11/4/05 71.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah. I guess I do. Maybe a physicist
dialog: or something in engineering. It’s not
dialog: exactly something they teach at school.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I took Chemistry in college because Bill,
dialog: Sean’s dad, was in it. And I just was so
text: smitten with him. And then when it
dialog: turned out I was better at it -- more

text: then looks at the entrance to the doctor’s office and
text: sighs deeply.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Nothing. It just sucks, watching someone
dialog: be alone.
text: Nathan looks at Wendy and then there’s a long pause as
text: they both sit in the car. They both stretch out their
text: legs, so they are facing each other, Nathan in back
text: Wendy in front.

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I think I might have farted in gym
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (trying not to laugh)
dialog: Okay. You think so?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Well we were running laps. And there was
text: a noise. And I think it was my shoes.
dialog: But then Andy says, “Whew, stop with the
dialog: beans, Bergman.” And then nobody would
text: run behind me. And running is the only
dialog: thing I can do in gym other than wrestle.
dialog: But it probably wasn’t me -- I mean gym
dialog: is pretty smelly already, you know?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: He’s a jackass. His brother is a jackass
dialog: and his father is a huge ass. He has a
dialog: genetic predisposition to asshole.
text: Nathan smiles a thank you to Wendy and then there is
text: another long silence.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (picking up Wendy’s comment
dialog: from before)
dialog: But when do you see people when they
dialog: aren’t alone?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Before, you said it sucked watching
dialog: someone be alone. Like you never see
dialog: that. When do you watch people and they
dialog: aren’t alone?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Are you serious? All the time. People
dialog: are always around other people. wWe’re
dialog: social, you know, as animals.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Like right now, we’re together, and not
dialog: alone.
dialog: 11/4/05 73.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (dubious)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You’re here with me, right? I mean,
dialog: you’re not a figment of my imagination
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: So I’m not alone, and you’re not alone.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I don’t think that’s what it means.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Alone. I don’t think that’s the
dialog: definition of alone.
text: Wendy looks at Nathan and laughs.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You are so weird.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: I know.

speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I go to school with you, you know.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (not looking at him)

speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: She won’t do it, will she?
text: Everyone stops. Wendy stands up but doesn’t leave.
speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You thinking of running away? Maybe we

speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Shut up, Billie.
speaker_heading: BILLIE

speaker_heading: ANN

speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ROBERT

speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Fuck you.

speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at me. Look at you. We’re
dialog: seventeen. We’ll never look like this
dialog: again. Our bodies want it, we want it.
speaker_heading: WENDY

scene_heading: MAKE-OUT GUY

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (to Girl)

speaker_heading: RYAN

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: To do what I always do, fix what you

scene_heading: EXT. MAYER HOUSE: BACKYARD - DAY 80

speaker_heading: NATHAN

text: Helen laughs and then Nathan joins in. Her laughter dies
dialog: down and so does his -- were their ages closer together
dialog: or this a different world, they would kiss now. But
dialog: instead.
speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I should go inside. I’m glad you’re

text: on her stomach, then on her back, then she kicks off her
text: shoes, she scooches around on her bed. She closes the
text: book, then opens it up again, but doesn’t read. Then she

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We’re fine. You’re not missing much.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I’m a terrible cook anyhow. Good thing
dialog: your brother learned. Though he charged
dialog: eight hundred dollars worth of salmon

dialog: it?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Dope?
speaker_heading: ABBY

dialog: Did you see our new neighbors?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Yeah. We met them, like weeks ago.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: How many of “them” are there?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Mom, dad and son. They seem nice. Sean --

dialog: I think school tripped him out
speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You’re not a traditional girl next door
dialog: true. You still have something special.
text: She goes to push Wendy’s hair off her face. Wendy ducks
text: away from her touch.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Mom!
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Sorry. I got lost in the moment. It
dialog: won’t happen again.
speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: ABBY

dialog: Don’t you look at me like that. I’m not

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I wasn’t.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Every time you look at me I think you’re

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It’s okay. I’m just a lot happier than

speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Anyway, I just wanted to tell you I was

dialog: let you go. And we won’t do it.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: What if I want to?
text: Billie shrugs.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: If you were a mom, and your kid was about

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I don’t think this is the same thing.

text: Billie doesn’t respond, she just reaches into the bag and
text: pulls out WENDY’S BOX from Robert’s house. She drops it
text: on the ground in front of Wendy.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I think your queer ass boyfriend would
dialog: really dig this, huh? I was thinking of
text: putting it in his locker. A little after-
dialog: track-practice surprise.
text: Wendy goes for it but Billie is faster and she holds onto
dialog: the box.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (calmly as possible)
dialog: You know what? Go ahead. It doesn’t
dialog: work like that with us. Even better, why
dialog: don’t you give it to him in class.
dialog: Because even if you posted it on the
dialog: internet and took out billboards, he
dialog: wouldn’t care.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I think he’s gonna like the pictures from
dialog: this summer especially.
text: Billie opens her mouth very wide and does a pretty good
text: oral sex simulation. Wendy remains calm.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Do it then. Don’t talk about it.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: And the ones of you on all fours. I
dialog: mean, it probably makes more sense in
dialog: context, you know, with the pictures of
dialog: all of us, but still--

dialog: 90
dialog: 11/4/05 92.
text: Wendy grabs the box from Billie’s unsuspecting hands
text: marches over to Sean’s locker, takes her car keys and
text: easily pries open the weak metal. The locker opens and
text: she shoves the box in. Then she closes it again.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: He wants me and that kills you.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Not so far.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I’m not the box, Billie. And you are.
dialog: You’re a pathetically limited little
dialog: bitch, aren’t you?
text: Billie reaches over and opens Sean’s locker again. Then
text: she shuts it hard so it locks.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: I was thinking of teaching your brother
dialog: how to kiss. You know, train him up
dialog: right. For future generations of Coop

scene_heading: INT. CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL: LOUNGE - DAY 89

speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT’D)
dialog: I think he’s upstairs.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: --okay.

text: Instead of leaving her alone, Wendy decides to help.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Stand here.
text: Helen obliges, and readies her shot
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t bend so much. Aim the fingers of
dialog: your bottom hand toward the back of the
dialog: rim.
text: Helen tries it, and makes basket.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: That wasn’t bad.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You know that girl in school who always
dialog: says she has her period so she doesn’t
dialog: have to go to gym? That was me.
text: Wendy smiles at her. Helen and Wendy trade off shooting
text: baskets.
speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT’D)
dialog: In school, I figured I would always be
dialog: that girl -- the smart one, the one who
dialog: was bad at sports. But it didn’t last.
dialog: That person today, the person you saw, it
dialog: wasn’t really me either. Or it was me
dialog: and I’m not that person anymore. It was
dialog: me for a moment. That was the me who
dialog: gets an abortion. And now she’s gone.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 11/4/05 94.
speaker_heading: HELEN(CONT'D)
dialog: I just didn’t know I would be re-
dialog: inventing myself so much when I grew up.
dialog: You figure that when you’re young is when
dialog: you re-invent yourself -- but it turns
dialog: out that it is forever. You’re forever
dialog: being a new you, in a new life, with new
dialog: consequences.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I guess. Maybe you only think you’re
dialog: new. Maybe you’re the same, only you
dialog: don’t know it.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: That’s depressing.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yeah. But probably true.
text: Helen pushes forward.
speaker_heading: HELEN

speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It’s not a lie if you don’t tell him
dialog: about something that happened.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: How is it not a lie?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: I don’t know.
text: She sits down on the pavement.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Was your husband sorry?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He apologized, if that’s what you mean.
dialog: 11/4/05 95.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: He did it on purpose though. He wanted
dialog: to talk about it more.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Did you tell him he can talk about it
dialog: when he gets pregnant?
text: Helen laughs.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It doesn’t work like that when you’re
dialog: Married. You don’t always get to say the
dialog: meanest, most clever thing.
text: Wendy throws a couple more baskets, not looking at Helen.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What’s it like?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Being married? It’s like...I don’t know
dialog: if I can say it the right way, I mean,
dialog: what’s it like to have a family? Try and
dialog: explain it to me.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Custom made pants.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (laughing, not expecting an
dialog: answer )
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: It’s like custom made pants. They fit
dialog: you perfectly but you can’t change. Not
dialog: even a little.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Only sometimes. Honestly. It isn’t
dialog: always like that. Is Sean pushing for...
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No. No, it’s not Sean. It’s the whole
dialog: “girlfriend” thing.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: The name?
dialog: 92
dialog: 11/4/05 96.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: The identity. Being someone’s
dialog: “girlfriend”.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You have to be something else first. The
dialog: only way to be with someone is to be
dialog: someone.
text: Wendy hands the ball to her.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Sean’s inside?
text: Helen nods.
scene_heading: INT. MAYER HOUSE: SEAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 92
text: Wendy walks into Sean’s bedroom which is empty. She
text: hears water running in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hello?
text: Inside the bathroom, Sean is getting out of the shower
text: Wendy opens the door and knocks him down. Sean tries to
text: get up and Wendy goes to help him when she sees HER BOX
text: on the floor, the contents clearly rifled through, water
text: dripping over it from the shower. Her first instinct is
dialog: to save the valuable contents from getting wet so she
text: grabs the stuff.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah. God forbid the kiddie porn gets
dialog: wet.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: That’s not what’s in here.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah, this is all puppies and “I love
text: unicorns” and tapioca pudding.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: It’s not porn. It’s just--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: They made you do it, right?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Screw you.
dialog: 11/4/05 97.
text: Sean doesn’t say anything, he just sits on the lip of the
dialog: tub.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you want me to go?
text: Sean shrugs. Wendy reaches out and takes his hand to get
text: him to stand. He pulls it away so she gets down on the
text: floor and takes his wet hand and puts in to her lips.
text: Then she kisses each finger. She kisses his palm, and
text: then his wrist. Sean doesn’t pull away.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I don’t know how this works. I
dialog: mean, do we fight now? Tell me what we
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: We don’t do anything.
text: Wendy pauses.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (trying to make a joke)
dialog: So this is what being dumped feels like,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: You’d have to be mine for me to dump you
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: What? What do I do? You wanna yell at
dialog: me? I’m lost--
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: That’s enough. You don’t get to play the
dialog: little innocent girl right now. Not
dialog: after--
dialog: (gestures to the box)
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You know what? It happened. You want it
dialog: to go away, like magic? Poof, and now
dialog: I’m all different? I’m magically a
dialog: virgin?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Yeah.
text: Wendy laughs, but Sean doesn’t
dialog: 11/4/05 98.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You’re kidding, right?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: No. Burn the box. Burn it all.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You’re delusional. why don’t you burn
dialog: all the stuff from your old girlfriends.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I don’t have stuff. That’s the point.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You’re insane.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Why? Do you need this stuff? I mean
dialog: does it have any value?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I’m not saying it has value. But it’s
dialog: what? Letters? A couple of trinkets?
text: She holds up the “Hoochie” necklace.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: This? Some pictures of me naked? You’re
dialog: acting like you’re pure and virginal.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Compared to this?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Really? What was the name of the blowjob
dialog: girl?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: From the party? Billie told me. The
dialog: girl who went down on you?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You believe what Billie says? Besides
dialog: that is completely--
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Please. Don’t be average. It isn’t
dialog: different. Either you agree to be in
dialog: this with me, or you don’t.
dialog: 93
dialog: 11/4/05 99.
text: Sean pulls his hand away.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: (pissed off)
dialog: --fine.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You could just forget it? If I burned
dialog: it, you would just forget that I was ever
text: someone else.
text: She isn’t sure what she was, so she just stops.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I could stop being reminded, couldn’t I?
text: Wendy looks at him for a beat. He puts his hand out for
text: her to kiss again, to seal the deal. She kisses it.
scene_heading: INT. CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL: LOUNGE - DAY 93
text: School is over, and everyone mills around, grabbing
text: books, screaming at each other. It’s chaos. The doors
text: are open, it’s a warm fall afternoon and students have
text: started throwing/chucking buckeyes (like large acorns) at
dialog: each other.
text: Sean and Wendy walk with Ryan and Aaron as they get their

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: So you’11 come on Saturday?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: SEAN
text: A double date. With Ryan and Aaron.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (focusing on Sean)
dialog: Yeah, of course.
text: Wendy doesn’t see Billie walk by.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: It’1l be fun.
dialog: (lowers his voice)
dialog: And tonight we do it, right? You’1l burn
dialog: the box tonight?
text: Wendy notices Billie.
dialog: 11/4/05 100.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (not listening)
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: Billie looks lost without Ann or Wendy, but straightens
text: her back and walks to the soda machines, feeds in her
dialog: dollar.
text: Some buckeyes are thrown at her. She doesn’t flinch.
text: More are thrown. Still, Billie doesn’t move. Finally a
text: barrage of buckeyes are raining down on Billie. She
text: flinches when one hits her in the face. Wendy watches,
text: unable to move.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (it is killing her)
dialog: Say something. Do something.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Not you. Her.
text: Billie finally turns and leaves, never looking at Wendy,
text: never reacting. As she leaves, the other seniors clap.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That is insane.
text: Wendy doesn’t say anything, and Sean goes back to his
text: locker. Wendy waits a moment and then walks away.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I have to see if she’s okay.
text: Sean grabs her wrist.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Everyone will see you.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: She’s fine.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Billie can take it.
text: Wendy pulls her arm away, and then stands, looking out at
text: the sea of students, wanting to run after Billie, but not
dialog: sure if she should.
dialog: 94
dialog: 11/4/05 101.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I’m not going to burn it. I’m not going
dialog: to say I’m sorry for what happened.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Keep your voice down.
text: Wendy’s suddenly past the “voice down”/decorum place.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: And I’m not going to apologize. You
dialog: either love me, or you don’t. I just gave
dialog: up five of the best people in the world
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Who you slept with.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: So what? So what if I slept with them?
dialog: They matter to me. And I just walked
dialog: away and destroyed my life because you
dialog: walked up with all this...
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: Love. It’s called love. You don’t want
dialog: to say it, fine. But that’s what I
dialog: offered you.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You offered me a role in your fairy tale.
dialog: That’s all.
text: Sean doesn’t know what to say. So Wendy makes a decision
dialog: for both of them.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t want me to be your girlfriend.

speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: You remember Miss Hise’s class?
text: Wendy smiles, carefully.

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We tortured her daughter, Greer.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: She carried those bookbags.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: She smelled terrible.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: And then in third grade, when my parents
dialog: split up, and I decided, I don’t know
dialog: why, to do a dance, from that movie,
dialog: Flashdance. You remember?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (starting to laugh)
dialog: We saw it on cable.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (laughing with her)
dialog: I can see the third grade me, and she’s
dialog: getting up to do that dance, and I want

speaker_heading: BILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Your friends, all of us, we don’t want to

speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: That I won’t be so evil?
speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: BILLIE

dialog: It was Uncle Bob.
speaker_heading: WENDY
text: Uncle Bob who smelled like Aqua Velva and
dialog: tasted like Doritos.
speaker_heading: BILLIE

speaker_heading: WENDY

dialog: Let’s go, okay? Billie?
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: Everything?
dialog: (smiles broadly)
dialog: Aaron, did you know that Ryan here. She
dialog: liked it. She liked the pain. She liked
dialog: to be held down and forced. Made her all--
text: Billie turns to Wendy.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BILLIE

speaker_heading: WENDY

dialog: eighth grade.
speaker_heading: BILLIE
dialog: (almost a growl)
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Or how Jonah and Robert have been
dialog: sleeping together for three years. Or
dialog: how Ann’s mom tied her hands together so
dialog: she wouldn’t touch herself when she was
dialog: six.
dialog: (Wendy starts getting giddy)
dialog: Or how I peed during a spelling bee in
dialog: third grade. Or how Aaron threw up when
