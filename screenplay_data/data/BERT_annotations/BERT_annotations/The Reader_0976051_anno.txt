scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY. CREDITS
text: 1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is
text: preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark-
text: haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate
text: quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom
text: to check he’s not making too much noise. He is boiling an
text: egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a
text: sparkling clean plate.
text: MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the
text: sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can,
text: turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and
text: BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She’s attractive, younger. The
dialog: credits end.
speaker_heading: BRIGITTE
dialog: You didn’t wake me.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You were sleeping.
speaker_heading: BRIGITTE
dialog: You let me sleep because you can’t
dialog: bear to have breakfast with me.
text: It’s half-serious. MICHAEL doesn’t react.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nothing could be further from the
dialog: truth. I boiled you an egg. See?
text: MICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from
text: nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’d hardly have boiled you an egg
dialog: if I didn’t want to see you. Tea or
dialog: coffee?
text: BRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing
text: gown. She’s still half-serious.
speaker_heading: BRIGITTE
dialog: Does any woman ever stay long
dialog: enough to find out what the hell
dialog: goes on in your head?
text: MICHAEL smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: BRIGITTE
dialog: What are you doing tonight?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m seeing my daughter.
speaker_heading: BRIGITTE
dialog: Your daughter? You’ve kept very
dialog: quiet about her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Have I? She’s been abroad for a
dialog: year. Did you say tea?
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY
text: MICHAEL kisses BRIGITTE on the cheek as she departs.
speaker_heading: BRIGITTE
dialog: I’m going. Give my love to your
dialog: daughter.
text: He closes the door, then turns to the open door of the
text: bedroom. He looks at the mess of last night’s love-making.
text: Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn
text: goes by.
scene_heading: INT. TRAM. DAY.
text: December 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is
text: in a well-cut suit he’s inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone
text: shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his
text: face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He’s plainly feeling ill.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: 1995. MICHAEL stands at the window, looking out.
scene_heading: INT. TRAM. DAY
text: 1958. Impulsively MICHAEL gets up, rings the bell and gets
text: off at the next stop.
scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: 1995. MICHAEL closes the window.
scene_heading: EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
text: 1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the
text: street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway
text: leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to
text: get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a
text: wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS
text: walks past.
text: MICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand
text: over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the
text: pavement and seizes him by the arm.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Hey. Hey!
text: HANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties.
text: She disappears. He’s sick again. She reappears with a bucket
text: of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down
text: with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Hey, kid. Hey.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
text: Effortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his
text: head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly
text: he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Where do you live?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: HANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted
text: with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his
text: satchel, she is pulling him by the arm.
scene_heading: EXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAY
text: They come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops
text: outside his block, as if nervous she might come in.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s here. I’1ll be fine now. Thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Look after yourself.
text: MICHAEL smiles ‘Thank you’ and goes in. HANNA is left alone.
text: She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping
text: uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came.
text: MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision.
scene_heading: INT. BERG APARTMENT. BLUMENSTRASSE. NIGHT
text: CARLA BERG is at the stove in the kitchen. She takes dinner
text: through for the BERG family, at a round table ina
text: traditional apartment, under a five-candled brass chandelier.
text: MICHAEL'S father, PETER, is a balding, abstracted man, eating
text: in oppressive silence. Next to him, his older brother THOMAS,
text: 18, his older sister, ANGELA, and his younger sister, EMILY.
text: MICHAEL has his book in front of him, not touching his food.
speaker_heading: CARLA
text: I’m worried about him. He looks
dialog: terrible.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The boy’s saying he doesn’t need a
dialog: doctor.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: He does.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don’t need a doctor.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Good then.
text: CARLA looks reproachful.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We’re not going to argue about
dialog: this. People have to take
dialog: responsibility for their own lives.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAY
text: MICHAEL is lying in a single bed, his face violently
text: inflamed. CARLA is with the DOCTOR, a much older man.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Remind me, how old are you now?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Michael’s fifteen.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It’s scarlet fever. He’ll be in bed
dialog: for several months. At least.
text: MICHAEL turns into the pillow, a wet patch beneath his head.
text: Delusional with fever, he senses a presence at the door. He
text: turns. It’s EMILY. But at once CARLA’s arm pulls her away.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Keep away. He’s contagious.
text: They vanish. The door closes. In the corridor the DOCTOR is
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Burn the sheets. Complete
dialog: isolation. And three months is the
dialog: minimum.
scene_heading: INT & EXT. BERG APARTMENT. DAY
text: 1959. A sunny day in March. MICHAEL’s bed has been moved
text: beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is
text: sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving
text: round behind him, tidying the room.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: How are you feeling?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Better. By the way, I meant to tell
dialog: you, the day I got ill... a woman
text: helped me. A woman in the street.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: She helped you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes. She brought me home.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Do you have her address?
scene_heading: EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
text: MICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is
text: looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The
text: woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
text: MICHAEL comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay -
text: green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a
text: sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment.
text: Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red
text: flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at hima
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Come in.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: The flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms. A
text: stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs.
text: There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the
text: room. HANNA carries on ironing.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I brought you these flowers. To say
dialog: thank you.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Put them down there.
text: MICHAEL puts them beside the sink. HANNA has a blanket and a
text: cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she
text: irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and
text: puts it over one of the chairs.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I would have come earlier, but I’ve
dialog: been in bed for three months.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You're better now?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Have you always been weak?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh no. I’d never been ill before.
dialog: It’s incredibly boring. There's
dialog: nothing to do. I couldn’t even be
dialog: bothered to read.
text: HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with
text: the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers.
text: He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks
text: broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She
text: puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she
text: upends the iron.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I have to go to work. I’1l walk
dialog: with you. Wait in the hall while I
dialog: change.
text: MICHAEL goes out into the hall. The kitchen door is slightly
text: open. HANNA takes off her smock and stands in a green slip.
text: Her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair.
text: She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and
text: knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the
text: other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches,
text: riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put
text: the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her
text: dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he
text: blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door
text: slams.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS. DAY
text: MICHAEL runs down the stairs in terror and shame, and out the
text: front door.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD. DAY
text: The WORKMEN look up, curious, as MICHAEL flies by, slamming
text: the outer door.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. DAWN
text: MICHAEL is lying in bed. He looks up at the sound of a tram
text: going by outside.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAWN
text: The tram making its way along the quiet street.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. DAWN
text: MICHAEL gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed.
scene_heading: INT. TRAM. DAY
text: MICHAEL, reading a book, watches unobserved, fascinated as
text: HANNA collects tickets. She calls out the name of the next
text: stop. She doesn’t see him as she works.
scene_heading: EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
text: MICHAEL is standing on the other side of the street from
text: HANNA’S courtyard. He is in two minds about whether to go in.
text: The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He waits for them to
text: finish before he slips in through the archway, making his way
text: to the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING. HANNA’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: MICHAEL is sitting on the steps of the first landing. Then,
text: as if from nowhere, HANNA is suddenly standing behind him, in
text: uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the
text: other. She looks tired but not surprised to see him.
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: There are two more buckets
dialog: downstairs. You can fill them and
dialog: bring them up.
text: HANNA walks straight past him. For a moment he tenses as if
text: there might be some contact. But she goes by.
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR. DAY
text: MICHAEL opens the door. He turns on a dim light. There is a
text: flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke,
text: poured in from the street. He goes down to the bottom, and
text: picks up a bucket. He digs in to the coke, and at once it
text: comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: HANNA is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. She
text: has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. MICHAEL comes
text: in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy.
text: She roars with laughter, full-throated.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You look ridiculous, look at you,
dialog: kid.
text: MICHAEL sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got
text: up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You can’t go home like that. Give
dialog: me your clothes, I’1ll run you a
dialog: bath.
text: HANNA opens the tap. There’s a boiler, and steaming hot water
text: comes out. MICHAEL takes off his sweater, then stops.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What, do you always take a bath in
dialog: your trousers?
text: HANNA takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. He
text: undresses. She puts his sweater on the balcony rail.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It’s all right, I won’t look.
text: On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him.
text: MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He
text: gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he
text: submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out
text: in the open air.
text: When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his
text: clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands
text: it to him.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Wash your hair, I‘1l get you a
dialog: towel.
text: MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes
text: back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out,
text: turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his
text: body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts
text: her body against his back, and he realises she’s naked. He
text: turns and faces her.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: So. That’s why you came back.
text: MICHAEL looks at her, awed.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You’re so incredibly beautiful.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Now, kid, you know that’s not true.
text: At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL
text: goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time,
text: she’s staring into his eyes. He can’t take it. He closes his
text: eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand
text: over his mouth to smother the noise.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. NIGHT
text: The family is half-way through their meal. MICHAEL is sitting
text: watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with HANNA.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You’ve inconvenienced your mother.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How many more times? I’ve said I’m
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You scared her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s hardly my fault, I got lost,
dialog: that’s all. That’s why I was late.
dialog: Can I have some more?
text: He reaches for more stew. THOMAS goes on eating, a look of
text: contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: How can anyone get lost in their
dialog: own home town?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The doctor told me I had to take
dialog: walks.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I meant to head for the castle, I
text: ended up at the sports-field.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: They’re in opposite directions.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s none of your business.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: He’s lying.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: He’s not lying. Michael never lies.
text: CARLA smiles benignly. EMILY knows she’s right. They all eat
text: on for a few moments.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Dad, I’ve decided, I want to go
dialog: back to school tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: The doctor says you need another
dialog: three weeks.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well I’m going.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Peter?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: If he wants to go back, then he
dialog: must.
text: MICHAEL can’t breathe, as if some decisive moment in his life
text: has been reached. PETER is looking at him, seeming to know
dialog: what’s going on.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
text: A massive brownstone building. The whole SCHOOL is coming
text: out, but MICHAEL is first, in a desperate hurry, waving
text: goodbye to his friends and running quickly away.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
text: MICHAEL comes quickly up the stairs. The door of HANNA’S
text: apartment is ajar. He pushes it open.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: HANNA is at the sink. MICHAEL comes in, precipitate, tearing
text: off his clothes and embracing her at the same time. He drops
text: his trousers and lifts her onto the sink. He comes in about
text: twenty seconds. He stands sweating.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: All right, kid, it’s not just about
dialog: you.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
text: They are on the bed. He is lying underneath her. HANNA leads
text: his hands to her face, then down her body. She begins to
text: move, and in response, he moves too. He watches awed as she
dialog: comes.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
text: HANNA has fallen asleep on MICHAEL'S chest. He is awake,
text: looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder. The sound of
text: the wood yard below. He kisses the birthmark. She stirs.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What’s your name?
text: She opens her eyes. A look of suspicion.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Your name.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Why do you want to know?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’ve been here three times. You
dialog: haven’t told me your name.
dialog: 12.
text: MICHAEL waits a moment.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It’s Hanna. What’s yours, kid?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Michael. Hmm. So I’m with a
dialog: Michael.
text: HANNA smiles, as if there were something funny about it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: ‘Hanna’.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM. SCHOOL. DAY
text: A TEACHER, in his sixties, has scrawled the words ‘Odysseus’,
text: ‘Hamlet’ and ‘Faust’ on the blackboard. The class of BOYS is
text: attentive. Next to him, his friend HOLGER SCHLUTER. Across
text: the way, RUDOLF.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: The notion of secrecy is central to
dialog: Western literature. You may say the
dialog: whole idea of character in fiction
dialog: is defined by people holding
dialog: specific information which for
dialog: various reasons - sometimes
dialog: perverse, sometimes noble - they
dialog: are determined not to disclose.
text: MICHAEL looks content. The bell goes.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR. SCHOOL. DAY
text: The BOYS come pouring out cheerfully into the corridor and
text: head to the next classroom. MICHAEL'S demeanour has changed.
text: There’s a knowingness, a swagger, a confidence which is new.
text: MICHAEL lingers for a moment, then slopes off in the opposite
text: direction, alone.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
text: MICHAEL comes out the back door of the school, unobserved,
text: climbs over the railings and starts to run down the street.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA’S APARTMENT. EVE
text: Later. Dark. MICHAEL is almost asleep, HANNA awake.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You never tell me what you've been
dialog: studying.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Studying?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: At school. Do you learn languages?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What languages?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Latin.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Say something in Latin.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh...
text: MICHAEL thinks a moment.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur
dialog: dexteris aptantur enses conditi?
text: MICHAEL smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s Horace.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It’s wonderful.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do you want some Greek?
text: MICHAEL grins, pleased to be able to do something. He goes
text: and gets his satchel. HANNA turns on a light.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon
dialog: oi da naon phais epi gan malainan
dialog: emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto
dialog: tis eratai.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It’s beautiful.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How can you tell? How do you know
dialog: when you’ve no idea what it means?
text: HANNA looks at him a moment.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What about in German?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: In German?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Do you have anything?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, I’m writing an essay. It’s
dialog: about a play. By a writer called
dialog: Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Perhaps
dialog: you've heard of him?
text: HANNA makes no reaction.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The play’s called Emilia Galotti.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Have you got it?
text: MICHAEL reaches down to the satchel and pulls out a book.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Here. You can read it.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I’d rather listen to you.
text: There is a silence as MICHAEL absorbs the idea.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: All right. I’m not very good.
text: MICHAEL grins, embarrassed, then opens the book.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Act One. Scene One. The setting
text: one of the prince’s chambers.
dialog: Prince - “Complaints, nothing but
dialog: complaints, petitions, nothing but
dialog: petitions. For goodness’ sake, just
dialog: imagine that people actually envy
dialog: us.”
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
text: Later. They are in the bath together. HANNA takes a piece of
text: soap and runs it lovingly down his cheek. Then she passes the
text: soap across his stomach.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You’re good at it, aren’t you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Good at what?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Reading.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Why are you smiling?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because I didn’t think I was good
dialog: at anything.
scene_heading: INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY
text: MICHAEL is playing handball with terrific physical
text: confidence. A couple of bruising physical encounters. HOLGER,
text: RUDOLF and MICHAEL all laugh. The whistle blows. Game over.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAM. DAWN
text: An empty tram moving through the eerie early morning streets.
text: MICHAEL appears walking alongside it and gets on.
scene_heading: INT. TRAM. DAWN
text: MICHAEL is sitting in the second carriage. He looks up. The
text: CONDUCTRESS is HANNA. At first, she does not notice him.
text: MICHAEL watches, waiting to be noticed. She turns round and
text: looks at him. He smiles in greeting but she makes no
text: acknowledgement at all. She turns away. He frowns,
text: bewildered.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAM. DAY
text: The tram is heading out of town.
scene_heading: INT. TRAM. DAY
text: HANNA is now talking animatedly to the DRIVER. They are
text: getting on very well, laughing together and chatting. MICHAEL
text: is still by himself in the second carriage, looking foolish.
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAM. DAY
text: The tram comes to a halt and PASSENGERS get on.
scene_heading: INT. TRAM. DAY
text: HANNA is now in the busy second carriage, collecting tickets.
text: MICHAEL looks up expectantly. But as he holds up his ticket,
text: HANNA makes no reaction except to clip it. She turns away
text: without speaking. The tram comes to a halt again, and
text: MICHAEL, humiliated, bolts for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD. DAY
text: MICHAEL watches the tram disappears up the hill. He looks
text: around, lost, in the middle of nowhere. A tractor goes by,
text: WORKERS heading to the fields. MICHAEL sets off to walk back
dialog: to town.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING. HANNA’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: MICHAEL is on the stairs as HANNA comes up, in her uniform.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What was all that about?
text: HANNA lets herself in, saying nothing.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
text: HANNA has gone in to put down her things at the kitchen
text: table. MICHAEL follows, desperate.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I got up - at 4.30 - specially -
dialog: it’s the first day of the holidays,
dialog: I’d been planning to surprise you -
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Poor little baby. Got up at four
dialog: thirty - and on your holidays too.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What is this? I was on your tram!
dialog: You totally ignored me! What do you
dialog: think I was doing? Why the hell do
dialog: you think I was there?
text: MICHAEL has yelled in desperation. HANNA looks him straight
text: in the eye.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I haven't the slightest idea. And
dialog: what you do is your business not
dialog: mine.
text: HANNA turns and moves away.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: And if you wanted to speak to me, I
dialog: was in the first carriage. So why
dialog: did you sit in the second?
text: HANNA goes to run a bath.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: And now, thanks very much, I've
dialog: been working, I need a bath. Get
dialog: out, I’d like to be by myself.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I didn’t mean to upset you.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You don’t have the power to upset
dialog: me. You don’t matter enough to
dialog: upset me.
text: She takes off her clothes to get in. As soon as she does, he
text: gets up and goes into the other room. He sits by himself,
text: miserable. He hears her, bathing. Then finally gets up and
text: goes back in. She is still in the bath.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don’t know what to say. I’ve
dialog: never been with a woman. We’ve been
dialog: together four weeks and I can’t
dialog: live without you. I can’t. Even the
dialog: thought of it kills me.
text: HANNA looks at him thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I sat in the second carriage
dialog: because I thought you might kiss
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Kid, you thought we could make love
dialog: in a tram?
text: They smile. But MICHAEL has a more urgent question.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Is it true what you said? That I
dialog: don’t matter to you?
text: In the bath, she shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do you forgive me?
text: She nods.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAWN

speaker_heading: MICHAEL'S VOICE
dialog: “Danger will only increase my love,

dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY
text: 1995. MICHAEL, now 51, is standing by his desk. He opens a

scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAY

scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM. DAY

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL. DAY

speaker_heading: TEACHER

dialog: Home is a place you dream of, it’s
dialog: not a place you ever attain.
text: The TEACHER breaks off.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Berg, I don’t mean to distract you,
dialog: but we’re meant to studying Homer,

text: The whole class cracks up. MICHAEL blushes.
scene_heading: EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY
text: MICHAEL is riveted as SOPHIE swims fast and lithe through the

speaker_heading: HOLGER
dialog: Michael the water’s fantastic.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s wonderful, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: HOLGER

speaker_heading: HOLGER
dialog: You should see their stores. They

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh sure. Everything mankind could

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You don’t like Americans?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Just it’s more fun without them.
text: He looks SOPHIE straight in the eye. There is a sudden

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why? What for?
speaker_heading: HOLGER

scene_heading: INT. HANNA’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: HANNA is sitting unhappily as MICHAEL reads to her. They are

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Oh kid, kid. Stop.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Nothing’s wrong. It’s nothing.
text: HANNA just shrugs. She goes and sits at the table to drink
text: tea. MICHAEL is irritated.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You never ask, you never bother to
dialog: ask how I am.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You never say.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It just happens to be my birthday.
dialog: It’s my birthday, that’s all. In
dialog: fact, you've never even asked when
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Look if you want a fight, kid...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No, I don’t want a fight. What’s
dialog: wrong with you?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What business is it of yours?
text: She has snapped at him, razor-like.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s always on your terms.
dialog: Everything. We do what you want.
dialog: It’s always what you want. My
dialog: friends were giving me a party!
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Well then why are you here? Go back
dialog: to your party. Isn’t that what you
dialog: want?
text: HANNA puts down her cup, angry. She goes into the bedroom and
text: slams the door. He sits, the magic of the day gone. He gets
text: up and opens the bedroom door. HANNA is on the bed.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And it’s always me that has to
dialog: apologize.
text: Silence. HANNA lets time go by. Then
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You don’t have to apologize. No-one
dialog: has to apologize. No-one can make

text: she washes his body.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: They are making love on the bed. It’s intense. At one point
text: she moves on top of him. She holds his head between her
text: hands, as if she would crush the life out of him. Then she
dialog: lets go.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
text: They are both sweating, exhausted. She looks a moment.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Now you must go back to your
dialog: friends.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA’S APARTMENT. DAY

scene_heading: EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY
text: MICHAEL is sitting on the pier watching as HOLGER, RUDOLF and

speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Michael. You all right?
text: But MICHAEL is running away across the lakeside beach.
scene_heading: INT. LANDING & HANNA’S APARTMENT. DUSK
text: MICHAEL opens the door. He goes in. The apartment is emptied,

text: looks round. He looks at the empty bath, the tap above it. He
text: opens the kitchen cupboards - some coffee, sugar, that’s
text: about it. He goes into the bedroom, the bed stripped bare. He
text: lies down on the bed.
dialog: 31.

dialog: to us eventually.
scene_heading: EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DUSK

dialog: still.
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE. NIGHT
text: 1995. MICHAEL sitting alone, thinking back.
scene_heading: EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DUSK

dialog: Berlin, I suppose.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You've seen your mother?
text: JULIA nods.
speaker_heading: JULIA

dialog: but it could have been anywhere.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Away from your parents?
dialog: 33.
text: JULIA doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m aware I was difficult. I wasn’t
dialog: always open with you. I’m not open
dialog: with anyone.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I knew you were distant. I'd always
dialog: assumed it was my fault.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Julia. How wrong can you be?
text: JULIA colours, on the verge of tears. Then she looks away.
scene_heading: INT & EXT. CAR. NIGHT

text: JULIA doesn’t need to say anything.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: At ten, say.
text: JULIA smiles.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Then good.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

dialog: Oh I don’t know.
speaker_heading: MARTHE
dialog: You’re rather a serious boy.

text: As ROHL and the STUDENTS arrive, the court is a melee of
text: PHOTOGRAPHERS, LAWYERS and PUBLIC. The three JUDGES are
text: already in place, next to six selected CITIZENS. MICHAEL and
text: the others take places in the gallery
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: All photographers are now asked to
dialog: leave.
text: The PHOTOGRAPHERS go.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The defendants, please.
text: From being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The first thing I’m going to do is
dialog: hear motions from each of the
dialog: defendants’ lawyers.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (cont'd)
dialog: They’re going to be arguing that
dialog: there’s no reason to keep the
dialog: defendants in jail until the
dialog: outcome of the forthcoming trial.
text: DIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I am going to take these cases one
dialog: by one.
text: MICHAEL is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase, as
text: MARTHE shakes a pen which isn’t working.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do you want a pen?
speaker_heading: MARTHE
dialog: I’ve got a pen.
text: So MICHAEL doesn’t hear as the JUDGE speaks.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Hanna Schmitz.
text: There is a row of six DEFENDANTS. The fifth woman is HANNA,
text: her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle
text: distance, not looking towards the SPECTATORS. She is wearing
text: a grey dress with short sleeves. They all sit, sideways to
text: the gallery. HANNA rises to her feet. The words seem to come
text: very quietly, across a great distance.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
text: It is only when the JUDGE repeats the name that MICHAEL looks
text: up, hearing it for the first time.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Can you speak louder please?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: My name is Hanna Schmitz.
text: MICHAEL is rigid, blank, just staring.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Thank you. You were born on October
dialog: 21st, 1922?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: At Hermannstadt. And you’re now 43
dialog: years old?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You joined the SS in 1943?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: What was your reason? What was your
dialog: reason for joining?
text: HANNA doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You were working at the Siemens
dialog: factory at the time?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You'd recently been offered a
dialog: promotion. Why did you prefer to
dialog: join the Ss?
text: HANNA has a DEFENCE COUNSEL, a young man, beside her, who is
text: about to get up. But the JUDGE forestalls him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I’ll re-phrase my question. I’m
dialog: trying to ascertain if she joined
dialog: the SS freely. Of her own free
dialog: will.
text: Everyone waits.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I heard there were jobs.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Go on.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I was working at Siemens when I
dialog: heard the SS was recruiting.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Did you know the kind of work you'd
dialog: be expected to do?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: They were looking for guards. I
dialog: applied for a job.
text: MICHAEL is intent now, so are the STUDENTS beside him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: And you worked first at Auschwitz?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Until 1944. Then you were moved to
dialog: a smaller camp near Cracow?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
text: ROHL leans into MICHAEL.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Are you OK?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m fine.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You then helped move the prisoners
dialog: west in the winter of 1944 in the
dialog: so-called death marches?
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN. DAY
text: MICHAEL is hanging out of the window of the train, smoking a
dialog: cigarette.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN. DAY
text: MICHAEL sits down in his seat. ROHL moves to sit opposite
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: So what did you think?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don’t know. It wasn’t quite what
dialog: I expecting.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Wasn’t it? In what way? What were
dialog: you expecting?
text: ROHL is looking at him. MICHAEL doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: I thought it was exciting.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Exciting?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Why? Why did you think it exciting?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Because it’s justice.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY
text: The train hurtles through the German countryside.
scene_heading: INT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT
text: A student party, in a candle-lit room. MARTHE is singing to a
text: guitar. It’s been going on for hours - the STUDENTS are on
text: the floor with beer and cigarettes. The front door is open.
text: DIETER, beer in hand, looks out to the balcony where he can
text: see MICHAEL bent away from them, all by himself.
scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT
text: MICHAEL, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out
text: into the night. His eye lands on a student room in which a
text: couple are making love.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY
text: The small STUDENT GROUP is now rattling around informally in
text: the big lecture room.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: I need to correct an impression.
dialog: Dieter said yesterday this was
dialog: about justice. But is it?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ROHL (cont'd)
dialog: If it were about justice you might
dialog: ask why has it taken so long? The
dialog: war ended twenty years ago.
dialog: Remember, there’ve been no
dialog: significant trials between
dialog: Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz
dialog: trials a couple of years ago.
dialog: That’s a long gap. What’s the
dialog: reason for the gap?
text: ROHL waits a moment for a STUDENT to answer.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: I’d have thought it was obvious.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Say.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Cowardice. It’s cowardice, isn’t
dialog: it? It’s bad conscience. It’s the
text: big cover-up.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: After the war. The German people
dialog: didn’t want to look at what they’d
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Because they had too much to hide.
dialog: All our parents are liars. All
dialog: right, mine are. So it’s left to
dialog: us, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Because we're not implicated.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Aren’t you? Good. So that’s all
dialog: right then.
text: Everyone laughs.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MARTHE
dialog: No, but seriously, Dieter’s right.
dialog: My parents, I can’t even talk to
dialog: them. I don’t love them. How could
dialog: I? How could anyone love them?
dialog: Because they’ve told themselves so
dialog: many lies, they can’t remember the
dialog: truth, let alone admit it. Isn’t
dialog: that why we signed up for this
dialog: seminar?
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: I don’t know. You tell me.
speaker_heading: MARTHE
dialog: Speaking for myself.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Michael?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m not sure any more.
text: ROHL is staring at him thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: What did your father do, Dieter?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: If you want to know, he was in the
dialog: Waffen SS.
text: There are some smiles, but DIETER rides over the reaction.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: That’s what I mean, that’s what I’m
dialog: saying. So were a million other
dialog: Germans.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: That’s exactly my point. That’s why
dialog: it’s better not to pretend this is
dialog: about justice. Forgive me, nor is
dialog: it about getting into an emotional
dialog: state. It has no purpose if it’s
dialog: just the young giving their parents
dialog: a bad time.
text: There’s a silence. That’s clearly why some of them are there.
speaker_heading: MARTHE
dialog: So what is it about? What do you
dialog: think?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Societies think they operate by
dialog: something called morality. But they
dialog: don’t. They operate by something
dialog: called law. You’re not guilty of
dialog: anything merely by working at
dialog: Auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at
dialog: Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been
dialog: convicted, and only 6 for murder.
dialog: To prove murder you have to prove
dialog: intent. That’s the law. Remember,
dialog: the question is never ‘Was it
dialog: wrong?’ but ‘Was it legal?’ And not
dialog: by our laws, no, by the laws at the
dialog: time.
text: DIETER frowns, unhappy.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: But isn’t that...
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Narrow?
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Yes. The law is narrow.
text: ROHL looks unapologetic.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: On the other hand, I suspect people
dialog: who kill other people tend to be
dialog: aware that it’s wrong.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM. MANNHEIM. DAY
text: ROHL is leaning forward, attentive. HANNA is standing,
text: opposite the JUDGE, who holds up a book called MOTHER &
text: DAUGHTER : A STORY OF SURVIVAL.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with
dialog: this book...
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Parts of it have already been read
text: out in court.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: JUDGE (cont'd)
dialog: It’s an American publication, which
dialog: has been translated. It’s by a
text: survivor, a prisoner who survived,
dialog: Ilana Mather...
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes I know. I know Ilana Mather.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: She was in the camp, wasn’t she,
dialog: when she was a child? She was with
dialog: her mother.
text: The judge waits. HANNA seems arrogant, defiant.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
text: In the book, she describes a
dialog: selection process. At the end of
dialog: the month’s labour, every month,
dialog: sixty inmates were selected. They
dialog: were picked out to be sent from the
text: satellite camp back to Auschwitz.
dialog: That’s right, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes, it’s right.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: And so far, each of your fellow
dialog: defendants has specifically denied
dialog: being part of that process. Now I’m
dialog: going to ask you. Were you part of
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
text: There is a stir among the other DEFENDANTS and in the court.
text: They start talking to their LAWYERS.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: So you helped make the selection?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: You admit that? Then tell me, how
dialog: did that selection happen?
text: HANNA shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: There were six guards, so we
dialog: decided we'd choose ten people
dialog: each. That's how we did it - every
dialog: month. We’d all choose ten.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Are you saying your fellow
dialog: defendants took part in the
dialog: process?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: We all did.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Even though they’ve denied it? But
dialog: you admit it. You’re saying you
dialog: took part in the process.
text: The other DEFENDANTS stir with animosity, but the JUDGE is
text: intent, following his own line.
text: He waits.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Did you not realise you were
dialog: sending these women to their
dialog: deaths?
text: HANNA nods slightly.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes but there were new arrivals,
dialog: new women were arriving all the
dialog: time, so of course we had to move
text: some of the old ones on.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I’m not sure you understand...
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: We couldn’t keep everyone. There
dialog: wasn’t room.
text: The JUDGE frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn’t seem
dialog: to understand his point.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: No, but what I’m saying : let me
dialog: rephrase : to make room, you were
dialog: picking women out and saying ‘You
dialog: you and you have to be sent back to
dialog: be killed.’
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Well, what would you have done?
text: HANNA is looking at the JUDGE - a perfectly straight
text: question. MICHAEL smiles slightly, proud of her. Everyone in
text: the court waits for the JUDGE to answer. Silence. ROHL is
text: impassive. But HANNA follows her own thoughts. She quietly
text: asks herself a question.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: So should I never have signed up at
dialog: Siemens?
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY
text: MICHAEL is alone, smoking. On a bench, side by side, are two
text: women. One is very small, dark, in her sixties. The other is
text: composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. ROSE and
text: ILANA MATHER. They look up, catching MICHAEL’s eye. Then a
text: CLERK leans in to the younger woman.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Ms. Mather, they’re ready for you
dialog: now.
text: The two women go into the court. The door closes.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY & COURTROOM. DAY
text: MICHAEL is alone in the now-deserted lobby, unwilling to go
text: back. Then he goes to the door. He opens it a little. The
text: sound of the trial. He opens the door fully. MICHAEL can see
text: that it is ILANA who is testifying. The court is
text: conspicuously packed. Large black-and-white photographs of
text: the labour camp now dominate the room. MICHAEL comes quietly
text: into the back of the room as the trial goes on.
text: MICHAEL has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near
text: ROSE who is sitting in the body of the court. He looks across
text: to the DEFENDANTS. RITA BECKHART, a large older woman, is one
text: of a couple who isn’t bothering to listen.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: In your book you describe the
dialog: process of selection...
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Yes. You were made to work and
dialog: then, when you were no longer any
dialog: use to them, then they sent you
text: back to Auschwitz to be killed.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Are there people here today who
dialog: made that selection?
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: I need you to identify them. Can
dialog: you please point them out?
text: ILANA points with her finger at the DEFENDANTS.
speaker_heading: ILANA
text: Her. And her. And her. And her. And
dialog: her. And her.
text: The last finger has been to HANNA. MICHAEL watches, but HANNA
text: does not react.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Each of the guards would choose a
dialog: certain number of women. Hanna
dialog: Schmitz chose differently.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: In what way differently?
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: She had favourites. Girls, mostly
dialog: young. We all remarked on it, she
dialog: gave them food and places to sleep.
dialog: In the evening, she asked them to
dialog: join her. We all thought - well,
dialog: you can imagine what we thought.
text: HANNA stares back, impassive. MICHAEL watches.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Then we found out - she was making
text: these women read aloud to her. They
dialog: were reading to her. At first we
dialog: thought this guard, this guard is
dialog: more sensitive, she's more human,
dialog: she's kinder. Often she chose the
dialog: weak, the sick, she picked them
text: out, she seemed to be protecting
dialog: them almost. But then she
dialog: dispatched them. Is that kinder?
text: HANNA looks back, not apologizing.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY
text: MICHAEL sits alone, head in hands, in despair.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM. DAY
text: Now ROSE is testifying. The court is quiet, focused.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I want to move on now to the march.
dialog: As I understand it, you and your
dialog: daughter were marched for many
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yes. It was the winter of 1944. Our
dialog: camp was closed down, we were told
dialog: we had to move on. But the plan
dialog: kept changing every day. Women were
text: dying all around us in the snow.
dialog: Half of us died on the march. My
dialog: daughter says in the book, less a
text: death march, more a death gallop.
text: MICHAEL looks along the row to where ILANA is now sitting.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Please tell us about the night in
dialog: the church.
text: MICHAEL watches as ROSE looks across to ILANA. ILANA stares
text: back at her. MICHAEL watches the exchange as ROSE nods, as if
text: accepting she must go ahead and speak.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: That night we actually thought we
dialog: were lucky because we had a roof
dialog: over our heads. We’d arrived ina
dialog: village, as always, the guards took
dialog: the best quarters, they took the
dialog: priest’s house. But they let us
dialog: sleep in a church. There was a
text: bombing raid. In the middle of the
dialog: night. At first we could only hear
text: the fire, it was in the steeple.
text: Then we could see burning beams,
text: and they began to crash to the
text: floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to
dialog: the doors. But the doors had been
text: locked on the outside.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The church burned down? Nobody came
dialog: to open the doors? Is that right?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Even though you were all burning to
dialog: death?
text: ROSE nods.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: How many people were killed?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Everyone was killed.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: How did you survive?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I needed to get away from the other
dialog: women. Because they were panicking,
dialog: they were screaming. I couldn't
dialog: stand it. I couldn’t stand their
dialog: screaming. I was more frightened of
dialog: the other women than I was of the
dialog: fire. So I too my daughter and led
dialog: her to the upper floor. I can’t
dialog: defend what I did. It’s impossible
dialog: to defend. I took Ilana in my arms
dialog: and I led her towards the fire.
text: There was a small gallery at the
text: side of the church on the upper
dialog: level. It saved our lives. The
dialog: gallery didn’t burn.
text: ROSE turns, in tears, to look at ILANA.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Thank you. I want to thank you for
dialog: coming to this country today to
dialog: testify.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE ROOM. LAW SCHOOL. DAY
text: The group is back in the big hall. But the atmosphere is
text: grim. It’s a while before DIETER speaks.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t know what
dialog: we're doing any more.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Don’t you?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: You keep telling us to think like
dialog: lawyers, but there’s something
dialog: disgusting about this.
text: ROHL is very still, like an analyst who is finally leading
text: his patient to the heart of things.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: This didn’t happen to the Germans.
dialog: It happened to the Jews.
text: Everyone is shocked at his violent passion.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: What are we trying to do?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We're trying to understand.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Six women locked three hundred Jews
text: in a church, and let them burn.
dialog: What is there to understand? Tell
dialog: me, I’m asking : what is there to
dialog: understand?
text: MICHAEL can’t answer. DIETER gets up, outraged now.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: I started out believing in this
dialog: trial, I thought it was great, now
dialog: I think it’s just a diversion.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Yes? Diversion from what?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: You choose six women, you put them
dialog: on trial, you say ‘They were the
dialog: evil ones, they were the guilty
dialog: ones’. Brilliant!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: DIETER (cont'd)
dialog: Because one of the victims happened
dialog: to write a book! That’s why they’re
dialog: on trial and nobody else. Do you
dialog: know how many camps there were in
dialog: Europe?
text: DIETER turns, furious.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: People go on about how much did
dialog: everyone know? ‘Who knew?’ ‘What
dialog: did they know?’ That isn’t the
dialog: question. The question is ‘How
dialog: could you let it happen?’ And -
dialog: better - ‘Why didn’t you kill
dialog: yourself when you found out?’
text: One of the group walks out.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Thousands! That’s how many. There
dialog: were thousands of camps. Everyone
dialog: knew.
text: DIETER’S passion is so great that everyone is shaken.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: Look at that woman...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Which woman?
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: The woman you’re always staring at.
dialog: I’m sorry but you are.
text: MICHAEL is white. The atmosphere is electric.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don’t know which woman you mean.
speaker_heading: DIETER
dialog: You know what I’d do? Put the gun
dialog: in my hand, I’d shoot her myself.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY ROAD. DAY
text: MICHAEL walks along an empty wooded road, miles from
text: anywhere. The sun is shining through the trees behind him.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: EXT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY
text: The wire fence of a concentration camp, deserted. MICHAEL,
text: with a back-pack, goes alone through the metal gate. MICHAEL
text: walks among the deserted empty huts.
scene_heading: INT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY
text: Inside one of the huts, MICHAEL is by himself staring at a
text: line of empty beds. He moves on, overwhelmed, lost. He passes
text: through the showers. Then he comes to a room with vast metal
text: cages on either side. In the cages, the countless dusty shoes
dialog: of the exterminated.
scene_heading: INT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY
text: MICHAEL opens a door and walks into a room with a line of gas
text: ovens. He walks past them. Then he stands beside them, his
text: head down.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM. DAY
text: HANNA is standing being examined by the JUDGE. Large
text: photographs and maps of the village, with the lay-out of the
text: church, are now on display.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Why did you not unlock the doors?
text: He waits. HANNA doesn’t reply.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Why did you not unlock the doors?
text: The JUDGE turns to the row of DEFENDANTS.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I’ve asked all of you and I’m
text: getting no answer. Two of the
dialog: victims are in this court. They
dialog: deserve an answer.
text: ILANA and ROSE are not far away from MICHAEL and the
text: STUDENTS. The JUDGE puts down a bound handwritten document.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Here, this is the SS report. You
dialog: all have copies.
text: There is a flurry of paperwork among the DEFENDANTS and
text: LAWYERS as they turn to their copies.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: This is the report which was
dialog: written, approved and signed by all
dialog: of you immediately after the event.
dialog: In the written report, you all
dialog: claim you didn’t even know about
dialog: the fire until after it happened.
dialog: But that isn’t true, is it?
text: The JUDGE waits.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Well? It isn’t true.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I don’t know what you’re asking.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The first thing I’m asking is, why
dialog: didn’t you unlock the doors?
text: HANNA takes a look to the other DEFENDANTS. For the first
text: time her poise is crumbling.
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: Obviously. For the obvious reason.
dialog: We couldn’t.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Why? Why couldn’t you?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: We were guards. Our job was to
dialog: guard the prisoners. We couldn’t
text: just let them escape.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I see. And if they escaped, then
dialog: you'd be blamed, you’d be charged,
dialog: you might even be executed?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Well then?
text: The JUDGE waits.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: If we opened the doors, then there
dialog: would have been chaos. How could we
dialog: have restored order?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: HANNA (cont'd)
dialog: It happened so fast. It was
dialog: snowing. The bombs - There were
text: flames all over the village. Then
text: the screaming began. It got worse
dialog: and worse. And if they’d all come
dialog: rushing out, we couldn’t just let
dialog: them escape. We couldn’t. We were
dialog: responsible for them.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: So you did know what was happening?
dialog: You did know? You made a choice.
dialog: You let them die rather than risk
text: letting them escape.
text: HANNA can’t answer - she has no answer.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: The other defendants have made an
dialog: allegation against you. Have you
dialog: heard this allegation?
text: HANNA does not reply.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: They say you were in charge.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It isn’t true. I was just one of
dialog: the guards.
text: The other DEFENDANTS interrupt to call out ‘She was in
dialog: charge’.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Did you write the report?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. No. We all discussed what to
dialog: say. We all wrote it together.
speaker_heading: BECKHART
dialog: She wrote it! She wrote the report.
dialog: She was in charge.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Is that true?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. And I didn’t write the report.
dialog: Does it matter who did?
text: RITA BECKHART has called out from her place. The JUDGE looks
text: at HANNA a moment.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I need to see a sample of your
dialog: handwriting.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: My handwriting?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Yes. I need to establish who wrote
dialog: the report.
text: At once HANNA’S COUNSEL rises.
speaker_heading: HANNA'S COUNSEL
dialog: I’m sorry, but I really don’t see
dialog: how that’s appropriate. Nearly
text: twenty years have gone by.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Somebody take her this piece of
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: HANNA'S COUNSEL
dialog: Are you really going to compare
dialog: handwriting of twenty years ago,
dialog: with handwriting of today?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Give her the paper. Counsel,
text: approach the bench.
text: A piece of paper and a pen are put down in front of HANNA.
text: Her COUNSEL moves to the bench. MICHAEL stares, first at her,
text: then at the pen and paper, an apprehension rising in him.
scene_heading: INT & EXT. DAY AND NIGHT. FLASHBACKS
text: MICHAEL thinks back, to HANNA in her bedroom saying ‘No you
text: read’, to her looking puzzled at the menu on the bicycle
text: trip, and to her throwing a book away in the apartment. At
text: this moment, MICHAEL realises she is illiterate.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM. DAY
text: Back in the courtroom, HANNA looks up to the JUDGE to stop
dialog: the conference.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: There’s no need. I wrote the
dialog: report.
dialog: 56.
text: MICHAEL, in a panic, pushes along his row, past ROHL and the
text: others, who all look up, knowing something is going on. HANNA
text: turns, as if sensing him behind her.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY
text: MICHAEL is sitting on the steps outside the lecture room.
text: ROHL walks straight past him.
speaker_heading: ROHL

scene_heading: INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY
text: MICHAEL comes into the room and sits down, smoking a
text: cigarette. ROHL waits.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: So?
text: MICHAEL looks at him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I have a piece of information.
text: Concerning one of the defendants.
dialog: Something they’re not admitting.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: What information?
text: MICHAEL stubs out his cigarette.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: You don’t need me to tell you. It’s
dialog: perfectly clear you have a moral
dialog: obligation to disclose it to the
dialog: court.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It happens this information is
dialog: favourable to the defendant. It can
dialog: help her case. It may even affect
dialog: the outcome, certainly the
dialog: sentencing.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: There’s a problem. The defendant
dialog: herself is determined to keep this
dialog: information secret.
dialog: 57.
text: Two STUDENTS come in for the seminar.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: A moment, please. Please.
text: Chastened, they leave.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: What are her reasons?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Because she’s ashamed.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Ashamed? Ashamed of what?
text: MICHAEL doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Have you spoken to her?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: Why of course not?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I can’t. I can’t do that. I can’t
dialog: talk to her.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: What we feel isn’t important. It’s
text: utterly unimportant. The only
dialog: question is what we do.
text: ROHL gets up.
speaker_heading: ROHL
dialog: If people like you don’t learn from
dialog: what happened to people like me,
dialog: then what the hell is the point of
dialog: anything?
scene_heading: INT. REMAND CELL. EVE
text: HANNA is sitting on the edge of her bed. A GUARD comes to the

scene_heading: EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY

text: at her desk. He smiles and closes the door.
speaker_heading: MARTHE
dialog: You’ve taken your time.
text: They kiss. She starts to pull his clothes off. He lets her.
text: He makes no move to undress her. She takes all his clothes
text: off until he is naked, and she remains clothed. He looks at
text: her a moment, then takes her in his arms and they go down on
text: the bed. They make love.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INT. MARTHE’S ROOM. NIGHT
text: MARTHE is apparently asleep, MICHAEL awake. As quietly as he

scene_heading: INT. REMAND CELL. DAY
text: HANNA stands in front of the mirror, tying her tie. There is
text: a small, inadequate mirror in which she checks her dress - a

dialog: formal.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON. DAY
text: HANNA is led through the prison by a GUARD.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY
text: A lot of people heading into the courtroom. As the seminar

dialog: 60.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM. TOWN HALL. DAY
text: HANNA and the PRISONERS are led into the court. HANNA’S suit

dialog: place.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM. DAY
text: Everyone rises as the JUDGES come in to take their places.

speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Hanna Schmitz, in view of your own
dialog: admissions and your special role,
dialog: you are in a different category.
dialog: The court sentences the accused
dialog: Schmitz to imprisonment for life.

speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Well then?
text: CARLA looks at him hard.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You mustn’t worry about Gertrud.
dialog: I’m going to look after her. And
dialog: anyway, let’s face it, she’s

dialog: earns far more than I do.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Michael, I’m not worried about

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: GERTRUD

speaker_heading: GERTRUD
dialog: I bet she was strange.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You could say.
speaker_heading: GERTRUD
dialog: She always was. Why on earth did
dialog: you decide to do that?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don’t know. Impulse.
dialog: 64.
text: GERTRUD says nothing.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I suppose if I’m honest we went

speaker_heading: GERTRUD
dialog: With your mother? And did you
dialog: succeed?
text: They both smile.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Are you all right?
text: He touches her arm.
speaker_heading: GERTRUD

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

scene_heading: INT. MICHAEL’S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY
speaker_heading: MS BRENNER

dialog: It’s kind of you. Thank you for

text: A few PRISONERS are finishing their meal.
text: It takes MICHAEL a moment to realise the OLD WOMAN is HANNA.
text: Then HANNA becomes aware of being watched. She turns and
text: looks round. At once her face lights up. MICHAEL smiles back,
text: but as he approaches her, he fixes onto her inquiring look
text: and sees the light go out of her eyes, as if she has looked
text: at him and been disappointed. He sits down opposite her. She
text: smiles, weary.

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You’ve grown up, kid.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: HANNA

speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Did you get married?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Have you spent a lot of time
dialog: thinking about the past?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You mean, with you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No. No, I didn’t mean with me.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Before the trial I never thought
dialog: about the past. I never had to.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: And now? What do you feel now?
text: HANNA looks a moment, a haunting look, searching him.
dialog: There’s a
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It doesn’t matter what I think. It
dialog: doesn’t matter what I feel. The
text: dead are still dead.
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I wasn’t sure what you’d learnt.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I have learnt, kid. I’ve learnt to
dialog: read.
text: MICHAEL stares, devastated.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I‘1ll pick you up next week, OK?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: That sounds a good plan.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Good. Quietly, or shall we make a
dialog: big fuss?
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: Quietly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: OK. Quietly.
dialog: 74.
text: They look at each other. The other PRISONERS have already
text: gone. They stand up. She scans his face again, searching for
text: his thoughts. He takes her in his arms, a little awkward.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Take care, kid.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You too.
text: They walk side by side, back towards the door. Then by way of
text: saying goodbye, she takes his hand.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: See you next week.
text: She stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand,
text: then vanishes inside. MICHAEL walks on alone.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON. EVE
text: MICHAEL comes out of the main entrance. He stands a moment,
text: looking round at the evening. MICHAEL walks to his car.
scene_heading: INT. HANNA’S ROOM. EVE
text: The room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the
text: other. It is all furnished with simple functional furniture.
text: The end of a hard day’s work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over
text: the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went
text: cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content.
scene_heading: INT. CELL. DAWN
text: HANNA is lying on her bed, fully dressed. She gets up and
text: gets some books down from the shelf. She puts them, one by
text: one, in a pile on the table. Then she takes off her shoes.
text: She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table.
text: Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up.
scene_heading: EXT & INT. PRISON. DAY
text: MICHAEL gets out of the car. He is carrying a bunch of
text: flowers. He walks towards the prison. He leans in to the
text: GUARD who is in a modern office.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON. DAY
text: From the far end of the corridor, MICHAEL is seen sitting on
text: a bench. MS BRENNER comes out of her office and murmurs in
text: his ear. MICHAEL is seen nodding, ashen.
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR & CELL. PRISON. DAY
text: The two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at
text: the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The
text: books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table,
text: a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the
text: door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed
text: bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She didn’t pack. She never intended
dialog: to leave.
text: MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the
text: two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the
text: cassette machine.
text: Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from
text: magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees.
text: One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL
text: kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations,
text: articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA’S childish
text: handwriting : ‘Spring lets its blue banner flutter through
text: the air’ is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the
text: young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school
text: principal. The headline ‘Michael Berg receives school
dialog: literature prize.’
text: MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she
text: sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet
text: of paper from her suit pocket.
speaker_heading: MS BRENNER
dialog: She left me a message, a sort of
dialog: will. I’11 read out the bit that
dialog: concerns you.
text: MICHAEL looks at the effortful handwriting on the page.
speaker_heading: MS BRENNER
dialog: “There is money in the old tea tin.
dialog: Give it to Michael Berg. He should
dialog: send it, alongside the 7,000 marks
text: in the bank, to the daughter who
dialog: wrote the book. It’s for her. She
dialog: should decide what to do with it.
dialog: And tell Michael I said hello. Tell
dialog: him to get on with his life.”
text: MS BRENNER looks at him.
speaker_heading: MS BRENNER
dialog: Do you want to see her?
dialog: 76.
text: MICHAEL shakes his head.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE. MANHATTAN. DAY
text: MICHAEL rides in a taxi into Manhattan. A view of the
text: familiar skyline.
scene_heading: EXT. FIFTH AVENUE. DAY
text: MICHAEL'S taxi comes up Fifth Avenue. It draws up outside an
text: expensive apartment block. MICHAEL gets out and goes in, the
text: Manhattan skyline opening up behind him.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM. ILANA’S APARTMENT. DAY
text: A superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art.
text: MICHAEL has taken his coat off. ILANA MATHER appears,
text: elegant, well-dressed - on the surface, the spirit of
text: prosperous New York. She is now in her early fifties.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Ms Mather?
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Yes. You’re Michael Berg. I was
dialog: expecting you.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: So you must tell me: what exactly
dialog: brings you to the United States?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was already here. I was at a
dialog: conference in Boston.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: You're a lawyer?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: I was intrigued by your letter but
dialog: I can’t say I wholly understood it.
dialog: You attended the trial?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yes. Almost twenty years ago. I was
dialog: a law student. I remember you, I
dialog: remember your mother very clearly.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: My mother died in Israel - a good
dialog: many years ago.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m sorry.
text: MICHAEL hesitates for a moment.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Go on, please.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Perhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz
text: recently died. She killed herself.
text: ILANA shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: She was a friend of yours?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: A kind of friend. It’s as simple as
dialog: this. Hanna was illiterate for the
dialog: greater part of her life.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Is that an explanation of her
dialog: behaviour?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Or an excuse?
text: MICHAEL shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No. No. She taught herself to read
dialog: when she was in prison. I sent her
dialog: tapes. She’d always liked being
dialog: read to.
speaker_heading: ILANA shifts slightly.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Why don’t you start by being honest
dialog: with me? At least start that way.
dialog: What was the nature of your
dialog: friendship?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: When I was young I had an affair
dialog: with Hanna.
text: ILANA looks at him for a moment.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: I’m not sure I can help you, Mr.
dialog: Berg. Or rather, even if I could
dialog: I’m not willing to.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was almost sixteen when I took up
dialog: with her. The affair only lasted a
dialog: summer. But.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: But what?
text: MICHAEL just looks at her.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: I see. And did Hanna Schmitz
dialog: acknowledge the effect she’d had on
dialog: your life?
text: MICHAEL stares back, understood for the first time.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: She'd done much worse to other
dialog: people. I’ve never told anyone.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: People ask all the time what I
dialog: learned in the camps. But the camps
dialog: weren’t therapy. What do you think
dialog: these places were? Universities? We
dialog: didn’t go there to learn. One
dialog: becomes very clear about these
dialog: things.
text: ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: What are you asking for?
dialog: Forgiveness for her? Or do you just
dialog: want to feel better yourself? My
dialog: advice, go to the theatre, if you
dialog: want catharsis. Please. Go to
dialog: literature. Don't go to the camps.
text: Nothing comes out of the camps.
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 79.
text: ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What she wanted...what she wanted
dialog: was to leave you her money. I have
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: As you think fit.
text: MICHAEL reaches for his briefcase. He takes out the lavender
text: tea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ILANA.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Here.
text: ILANA lifts the tin.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: When I was a little girl, I hada
dialog: tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite
dialog: like this. It had Cyrillic
dialog: lettering. I took it with me to the
dialog: camp, but it got stolen.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What was in it?
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of
dialog: hair from our dog. Some tickets to
dialog: operas my father had taken me to.
dialog: It wasn’t stolen for its contents.
dialog: It was the tin itself which was
dialog: valuable, what you could do with
dialog: it.
text: She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: There’s nothing I can do with this
dialog: money. If I give it to anything
dialog: associated with the extermination
dialog: of the Jews, then to me it will
dialog: seem like absolution and that is
dialog: something I’m neither willing nor
dialog: in a position to grant.
text: MICHAEL nods slightly.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was thinking maybe an
dialog: organization to encourage literacy.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Good.
text: There’s a silence.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do you know if there’s a Jewish
dialog: organization?
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: I‘ll be surprised if there isn’t.
dialog: There’s a Jewish organisation for
dialog: everything. Not that illiteracy is
dialog: a very Jewish problem.
text: There is the shadow of a smile.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: Why don’t you find out? Send them
dialog: the money.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Shall I do it in Hanna’s name?
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: As you think fit.
text: ILANA smiles slightly. She puts her hand on top of the tin.
speaker_heading: ILANA
dialog: I‘ll keep the tin.
scene_heading: INT. ILANA’S HOUSE. DAY
text: ILANA is standing at the window watching down to the street
text: where MICHAEL is walking away. She has the tin in her hand.
text: When he’s vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom.
text: There on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of ILANA
text: with her mother in Germany before the war. She sets the tin
text: down beside the photo.
scene_heading: INT & EXT. CAR. DAY
text: 1995. MICHAEL is driving JULIA in the big Mercedes through
text: the German countryside. He is tense, silent. JULIA takes a
text: sideways look at him, but he does not respond.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I thought you liked surprises.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I do. I do like surprises.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY. DAY
text: They draw up at a church. It is the same one he and HANNA
text: passed on their bicycles years before. MICHAEL and JULIA get
text: out and walk towards the graveyard at the side.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
text: MICHAEL & JULIA stand at a deserted grave-side. The whole
text: cemetery is seen. MICHAEL stoops down and uncovers a simple
text: stone : HANNA SCHMITZ 1923-1988. JULIA watching, says her
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Hanna Schmitz.
text: JULIA waits a moment.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Who was she?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That’s what I wanted to tell you.
dialog: That’s why we're here.
text: JULIA looks, waiting. MICHAEL looks for a moment as if he
dialog: will not go on.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: So tell me.
text: There is a moment, then they turn to stroll, MICHAEL talking,
text: starting to tell the story.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was 15, I was coming home from
dialog: school, I was ill...
text: They walk away among the trees.
