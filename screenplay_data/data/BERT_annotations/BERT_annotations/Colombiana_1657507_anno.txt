dialog: 
text: CATALEYA RESTREPO, CAT for short, a contained, very
text: centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting
text: at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home,
text: with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela,
text: attends to her notebook.
dialog: 
text: On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid
text: plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are
text: packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Cat! Is your homework finished
dialog: yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Working on it Mama.
dialog: 
text: Her mother, taking time off from packing, comes over to
text: Cat, and turns the page of the notebook to reveal the Lara
dialog: Croft comic and it's copy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You draw beautifully my love, but
dialog: if you want to be something in
dialog: life you have to study.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I am studying Mama. I want to be

dialog: 
text: Her mother turns the page back to the lessons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Better to be a doctor. A lawyer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Are we going to see Uncle Emilio?
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I don't know. Just waiting to
dialog: hear from your father.
dialog: 
text: Cat looks up at a picture on the wall of the family. Cat,

speaker_heading: DON LUIS

scene_heading: PULL BACK TO
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S GARDEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: At a table, with bottle of liquor and two glasses, Don
text: Luis sits opposite...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
text: Cat's father. Off to the side, Don Luis's right hand man,
text: MARCO, stands like any right hand, unobtrusive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Because I love you Fabio. Like a
dialog: brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: And I love you Don Luis. Like a
dialog: brother.
dialog: 
text: He turns to Marco.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Can you believe this guy Marco?
dialog: We started when we were little...how
dialog: old were we Fabio?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Ten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Ten year old bastards stealing
text: apples from the carts in the market.
dialog: After all we've been through.
dialog: And now we're on top, he wants to
dialog: leave...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Luis, I'm going to be honest with
dialog: you. You remember I had that
dialog: operation?
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: That was last year.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Since then, I'm not a hundred
dialog: percent. And you can't do this
dialog: thing if you're not a hundred
dialog: percent. I'm tired.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: So you'll take a rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: You know how many times we should
dialog: have been dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: I don't even want to count.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Neither do I. But you gotta think.
dialog: How lucky we are to still be alive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Yeah. That's right. We're alive.
dialog: And what about the future of this
dialog: thing we built?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: It's yours. It's not my thing any
dialog: more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: I'm not going to talk you out of
dialog: it, am I cabron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: I'll always be there for you Luis.
dialog: Just pick up the phone, I'm there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: I'm gonna hold you to that. You
dialog: bastard.
speaker_heading: (EMOTIONAL)
dialog: I'm going to miss you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: And I'm going to miss you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: OK. Enough of this sentimental
dialog: bullshit. Next we'll be crying
dialog: like two old women. Come on! One
dialog: last drink, huh?
dialog: 
text: He pours the liquor into the glasses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: To the future.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
text: They tap glasses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Bueno.
dialog: 
text: They shoot the liquor down. Fabio rises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: So. Business is all clear?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
text: All clear.
dialog: 
text: He hands Don Luis a computer disc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: It's all here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: No other copies?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: You even have to ask?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: He shrugs. Opens his arms. The two men embrace. Close
dialog: as brothers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't
dialog: get in too much trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best.
dialog: 
text: And with that, Fabio exits the garden. Don Luis watches
text: him, sad to see his friend go. Sighs deeply, pours himself
text: a whiskey, downs it, turns to Marco.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Kill this motherfucker.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
dialog: 
text: Two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back,
text: the driver in the front. They see Fabio very contained,
text: calm, walking towards them. The driver turns the engine
text: on. Fabio slips into the passenger seat. The car takes
dialog: off.
dialog: 
text: Fabio explodes. Smashes the dashboard. Over and over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: This fucker! The motherfucker!
dialog: 
text: He keeps banging the dash.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Not OK Boss?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: This bastard thinks I'm an idiot.
dialog: Playing it all mellow and shit.
dialog: If he would have yelled and screamed
dialog: and threatened to kill my whole
dialog: family, it would have been OK. We
dialog: have an hour to get out of here.
dialog: At most.
dialog: 
text: Off the nervous looks of the guys in the car...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to
text: three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the
text: car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cat is still at the table drawing, when she hears the
text: screeching of tires, the fast footsteps outside. She senses
text: a storm coming. Fabio bursts in. His wife sees his tension
text: filled face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Fabio?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: We've got ten minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
speaker_heading: (PANICKED)
dialog: Cataleya, go pack!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I'm packed Mama.
dialog: 
text: Cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. Watches as
text: Fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the
text: frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame,
text: comes over to Cat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Listen to me my darling. Just in
dialog: case of anything. This...
dialog: 
text: He holds the chip up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: This is your passport. Do you
dialog: understand?
dialog: 
text: She nods. He places the chip in her hand, takes a card
text: out of his pocket.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: You find yourself alone? You go
dialog: to the address on this card. Show
text: it to the man at the front gate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I don't understand papa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: You don't have to understand. You
dialog: just have to listen, and remember.
dialog: 
text: As Cat looks at the chip.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: As Fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two SUV's come rolling
text: down the street. Their fingers work the triggers of their
text: weapons. The two SUV's roll up. The blacked out windows
dialog: roll down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (polite. smiling)
dialog: Hola. We want to see Don Fabio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
text: He's not home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You mind if we wait?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: Your time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: Fabio writes on top of Cat's drawing, rips the page off,
text: folds it, puts it in her pocket, removes a medal from around
text: his neck, drapes it over hers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: And this will keep you safe.
dialog: 
text: Cat looks down at the medal.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE MEDAL
dialog: 
text: An imprint of a flower.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: The Cataleya orchid. It comes
dialog: from one place on Earth. Our place.
dialog: My mother, your grandmother, used
dialog: to grow them. Every morning I
text: would wake up to the sight of them.
dialog: The smell of them. That's why I
dialog: named you after them. It reminds
dialog: us of who we are.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
text: He kisses her on the forehead. His wife appears at the
text: doorway with two suitcases.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I'm ready.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: The man in the SUV is on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: They said he's not home yet.
dialog: 
text: He listens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: OK. OK.
dialog: 
text: He hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up
dialog: to Fabio's men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Change of plans.
dialog: 
text: He pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAT'S HOME - DAY
dialog: 
text: As they are exiting the house through a rear door, the
text: shots ring out. They see another black SUV rushing up the
dialog: street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Back!
dialog: 
text: He pushes his family back inside. Fabio runs to the window.
text: Sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle. As the
text: men fall, and others run up the stairs firing as they
text: retreat toward the front door...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Too late. Get ready!
dialog: 
text: The Mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room.
text: Fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm Cat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: I love you very much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I love you too Papa.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON FABIO'S HAND
dialog: 
text: Reaches under the table where Cat is sitting, takes a gun
text: strapped there. Next to the gun is a big knife.
dialog: 
text: And then footsteps, coming fast outside, draw his attention.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FABIO
dialog: Alicia!
dialog: 
text: His wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault
text: rifles. She tosses one to Fabio. Both of them take up
text: shooter's positions facing the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CAT
dialog: 
text: Sitting at the table, very still. Watching.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER
dialog: 
text: Facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles,
text: sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting,
text: waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to
dialog: kingdom come.
dialog: 
dialog: But they never get the chance because...
dialog: 
text: BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!!
dialog: 
text: Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the
text: room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one
text: shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred.
dialog: 
text: Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents
text: bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them
text: twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood
text: splattering across the room, across her.
dialog: 
dialog: And then...
dialog: 
text: Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's
text: absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair.
dialog: 
text: And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into
text: the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living
text: thing in the room.
dialog: 
text: Cat. Marco enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You in the kitchen. You, the
dialog: bedroom. You, the back.
dialog: 
text: The gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat,
text: who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read.
dialog: 
text: One of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her
text: head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON MARCO
dialog: 
text: Examines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON THE GUNMAN WITH THE GUN TO CAT'S HEAD
dialog: 
text: He chambers a round, is about to pull the trigger...
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Hey! What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: As the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart, looking
text: for something, Marco strides over to Cat. The frame in
text: his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNMAN
dialog: Don Luis said kill everyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: He also said no names.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNMAN
dialog: She won't remember.
dialog: 
text: He is about to pull the trigger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
speaker_heading: HEY!
dialog: 
text: The gunman stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: She's a kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNMAN
dialog: So what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: What do you mean so what? You
dialog: take a kid, teach them, they have
dialog: value.
dialog: 
text: The gunman takes his gun, lifts Cat's lip, looks at her
dialog: teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNMAN
dialog: I couldn't even get ten bucks for
text: her in the street.
dialog: 
text: The gunman is about to pull the trigger again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Are you stupid or what? Here.
dialog: 
text: Marco hands him some cash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Here's twenty asshole. Go do your
dialog: job.
dialog: 
text: Scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house
text: apart, looking for something.
dialog: 
text: Marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of
text: water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of Cat as
text: he sits opposite her. Her hands are in her lap.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Remember me Cataleya?
dialog: 
text: Cat shakes her head no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: I was at your confirmation. My
dialog: name is Marco, and I was a very
dialog: good friend of your father. I see
dialog: he gave you his medal.
dialog: 
text: Alluding to the medal around her neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
text: The Cataleya orchid. His symbol.
dialog: Your name. That's good. This way
dialog: you will always remember him.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I know this is a terrible thing
dialog: for you to have seen.
dialog: 
text: All the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies
text: of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Some things are too complicated
dialog: for a kid to understand. This is
dialog: one of them. But I am going to
dialog: try explain it and make it very
dialog: simple for you. So you understand.
dialog: Now, you know who Don Luis is?
dialog: 
text: Cat responds, shakes her head yes. Her hand slips
text: imperceptibly under the table.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HER HAND
dialog: 
text: Touches the handle of the knife taped there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Of course you do. He was your
dialog: father's best friend since they're
dialog: kids. He's like an Uncle to you.
dialog: You know he has always been good
dialog: to your family, don't you?
dialog: 
text: Again Cat shakes her head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: This house, the food you eat, the
dialog: clothes you wear. Even your school
dialog: fees. All this comes from Don
dialog: Luis. You know that?
dialog: 
text: Again Cat shakes her head.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: But when someone is good to you
dialog: and you are not good to them back,
dialog: then bad things happen. Things
dialog: like...
dialog: 
text: He alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: This.
dialog: 
text: Cat looks from the bodies and back to Marco, no emotion in
text: her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: I know you are a smart girl. You
dialog: do well in school. So I know this
dialog: is not too complicated for you to
dialog: understand. Am I right?
dialog: 
text: Cat nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Good. Now, your father had
dialog: something that belonged to Don
dialog: Luis. A little thing. No bigger
dialog: than...
dialog: 
text: He holds up his thumbnail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: This. Maybe it was in this.
dialog: 
text: He holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of
dialog: the wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Do you know what I am talking about?
dialog: 
text: Cat nods.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON CAT'S HAND
dialog: 
text: Gripping the knife handle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Excellent. Do you know where it
dialog: is?
dialog: 
text: Cat nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Well, if you give it to me, Don
dialog: Luis will be very grateful. And
dialog: very generous. He will make sure
dialog: that you are clothed, fed, and
dialog: sent to the very best school. You
dialog: will have everything you want.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO (CONT'D)
dialog: But if you don't give it to him,
dialog: he will be very unhappy. And you
dialog: see what happens when he is not
dialog: happy, yes?
dialog: 
text: Cat nods yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: So why don't you just give that
text: little thing which belongs to him.
dialog: Will you do that?
dialog: 
text: Cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from
text: underneath the table, her fist closed tight. Marco smiles,
text: kindly. He holds out his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You are a smart girl.
dialog: 
text: Marco opens his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: And in this life, smart girls get
dialog: everything they want. What do you
dialog: want Cat?
dialog: 
text: And just as she is about to open her hand...
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HER OTHER HAND
dialog: 
text: Under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped
dialog: there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Just tell me sweetheart...what do
dialog: you want?
dialog: 
text: In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's
text: unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife
text: pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the
text: table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream
text: but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: (in his ear)
dialog: To kill Don Luis!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
text: AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!
dialog: 
text: The men searching look up, and before they can react, Cat
text: races past them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Get her!
dialog: 
scene_heading: TRACK WITH CAT
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
text: As she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the
text: bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her
text: onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back,
text: she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. And she jumps, head
text: first. Barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny
dialog: window.
dialog: 
text: And she drops...
dialog: 
text: Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the
text: window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the
dialog: medal of her father.
dialog: 
text: ON THE BATHROOM
dialog: 
text: One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through,
text: looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something
text: beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below.
text: Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and....
dialog: 
text: BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!!
dialog: 
text: Lets loose with a barrage from his weapon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She watches as the bullets split the cement all around her
text: feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the
text: barrage stops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE GUNMAN
dialog: 
text: His clip runs out. And as he fumbles to slam another one
dialog: in...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses
text: that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela.
text: She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father
text: gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps
text: over the small divide between her house and the next roof,
text: and takes off running.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE GUNMAN
dialog: 
text: Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof,
text: out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to
text: shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the
text: ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding
text: his bloody rag wrapped hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: We need her alive!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FAVELA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a
text: drain pipe onto another roof.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE GUNMEN
dialog: 
text: Jumping down from the window of Cat's home, start to sprint
text: across the roof in hot pursuit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She drops down to another roof, this one filled with a
text: vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FAVELA - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marco exits Cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly
text: with a piece of his shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Go! Go!
dialog: 
text: He orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on
text: motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four
dialog: different directions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: As she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley.
text: She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door,
text: which gives way and enters...
dialog: 
scene_heading: AN OPEN COURTYARD
dialog: 
text: Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap.
text: They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood
dialog: splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither
text: does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the
text: far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One
text: of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the
text: gate, hiding it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE GUNMEN
dialog: 
text: They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly
text: kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between
text: the rows of tomato vines.
dialog: 
text: When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over
text: the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes
text: the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth
text: man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof.
dialog: 
text: And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he
text: has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE GUNMEN
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
text: They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look
text: up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from
text: the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting
text: outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes.
dialog: 
text: At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders
text: see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the
dialog: alley...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VRROOOM!
dialog: 
text: And bear down on Cat.
dialog: 
text: Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one
text: of the open doors, but she finds that one after another
text: the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside.
dialog: 
text: The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for
text: them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks
text: down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal
text: pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through
text: the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her,
dialog: tear through the sheets...
dialog: 
text: AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR
speaker_heading: THROATS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She looks back, to the dead gunmen, disappears over the
dialog: hill.
dialog: 
text: AND JUST AS SHE DOES...
dialog: 
text: Marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen ON
text: BOARD, comes rolling up the road. He sees Cat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: There!
dialog: 
text: The jeep screeches around. Cat dashes down an alley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: As she runs up the alley with it's open sewers running on
dialog: either side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON MARCO
dialog: 
text: The alley is too narrow for the jeep. The men spill out,
text: spring up the alley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Alive!
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She runs up the alley, then ducks down another one. She
text: comes to a ladder that leads up a fence, begins to climb.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE GUNMEN
dialog: 
text: Running up the alley, turning into the next one. Where
text: they see the ladder. One of the gunmen pulls out his cell
dialog: phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON MARCO
dialog: 
text: In the jeep, scouting as it rolls along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She is running for all she is worth, out of breath, scared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
dialog: 
text: More thugs on bikes, on foot, in cars. They are everywhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She is leaning against a wall on a rooftop, gulping air,
text: when she hears the roar of engines. Looks over the side
text: of the building to see dozens of gunmen flooding the area.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON GUNMEN
dialog: 
text: Climbing the ladder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON GUNMEN

speaker_heading: ON GUNMEN

speaker_heading: ON GUNMEN
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON MARCO
dialog: 
text: On the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON GUNMEN
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNMAN
dialog: North!
dialog: 
text: The gunmen clear the roof. As the last one leaves, he
text: takes one last suspicious sweep of the roof, cannot figure
text: where this wisp of a girl went to. His eyes briefly focus
dialog: on the chimney...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNMAN
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
text: He clambers over the side of the roof.
dialog: 
text: THE CAMERA STAYS FOCUSED ON THE CHIMNEY.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cat, holding her breath, listening keenly to the sound of
text: the men departing, is wedged into the chimney, her hands
text: and feet clinging like a lizard to the walls on either
dialog: side.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cat comes over the top of a hill, the soot of the chimney,
text: mingled with the blood of her parents, staining her dress.
text: The doors and windows all along the street are shuttered
text: tight. Her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down
text: the street. When she hears the sound of a vehicle. She
text: looks up to a jeep turning the corner.
dialog: 
scene_heading: REVERSE ON MARCO
dialog: 
text: In the windshield of the jeep, staring at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: We got her! Close the net!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She sees Marco. She pauses for a moment, and then does
text: something that stuns even Marco. She starts to run right
dialog: towards the jeep!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON MARCO
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
text: A bit stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: What is she doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: She keeps sprinting toward the jeep. Another jeep appears
text: over the hill behind her. Starts to come at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON MARCO
dialog: 
text: As his jeep speeds right for her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: As she runs, her eyes go to the right, and it becomes
text: apparent she knows exactly what she is doing. She has a
text: plan. And she executes it. Suddenly, she leaps for the
dialog: curb and...
dialog: 
text: A SEWER GRATE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON MARCO
dialog: 
text: Sees Cat dive to the curb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON CAT
dialog: 
text: As she wriggles her skinny little body down the grate,
text: with barely enough room to squeeze in. But in she does
dialog: squeeze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON MARCO
dialog: 
text: In total disbelief, watching her disappear down the narrow
text: slit in the curb.
dialog: 
text: Both jeeps pull up. The men jump out. Marco flattens to
text: the street, peers into the grate, sees Cat staring up at
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Marco takes his gun out. Jams it in the grate...
dialog: 
dialog: BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!
dialog: 
text: Empties his clip into the dark. When he runs out of ammo,
text: he peers down again.
dialog: 
text: Cat is gone. The gunmen run to the next sewer grate fire
text: into that one. Marco looks down, no Cat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Get down there!
dialog: 
text: The gunmen rip the grate out, jump down the hole.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - DAY
dialog: 
text: The gunmen, following the beams of their flashlights, go
text: tramping through the muck of the sewers, trying to find
text: Cat. The only living things they find are rats, scurrying

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUNMAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO V.O.
dialog: Come back out.
dialog: 
text: The gunmen retreat back the way they came. They do not
text: see someone watching them go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
dialog: 
text: A small crevice in the sewer wall. Cat has squeezed herself

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Cars and trucks rumble along a busy thoroughfare.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON A SEWER GRATE CUT INTO THE SIDE OF THE CURB
dialog: 
text: A hand emerges. And then, Cat pulls herself out, into the
dialog: street.
dialog: 
text: PULL BACK TO CAT RISING
dialog: 
text: She stands at the edge of the busy thoroughfare, and looks
text: around. She is in the heart of the city. Where tall office
text: buildings, compete with graceful, classical mansions. In

dialog: 
text: He turns to Cat, who nods yes.
dialog:

text: throws up all over the man's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMERICAN 1
dialog: Oh jeez...
dialog: 
text: Cat reaches into the goop on the desk and comes up with
text: the chip. She hands it over to the man behind the desk,
text: who takes a handkerchief out and takes it from her,

scene_heading: INT. JETWAY - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUREAUCRAT
dialog: You must have done something pretty

dialog: 
text: The biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone,
text: and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her

dialog: is...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: I'm Sherri. And you are?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
text: Very tired.

speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I do.

speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: There's your bed...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: But it's gonna cost you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Twenty dollars.
dialog: 
text: Cat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging

dialog: 
text: Cat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts

text: over to Sherri.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: A week. Peace has it's price,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: Are we clear on that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Twenty dollars a week.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: We got a smart one!

speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: You can go now.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: In peace.
dialog: 
text: Cat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all

text: has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering
dialog: resumes.
dialog: 25.
dialog:

text: is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit
text: she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A
text: door marked: HEADMISTRESS.
dialog: 
text: Cat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEADMISTRESSES OFFICE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway. Cat

dialog: 
text: In one room, opening out to a trucking bay, TV sets are

dialog: 
text: In another room, guns are being serviced. Lots of guns,

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cat enters an office with three women working on computers.
text: Looks like any other business office. At the sight of

dialog: 
text: She looks around the office, when the sound of a door

speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Cataleya?

speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Madonna! I thought you were dead!
dialog: 
text: He crosses himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: I thought you were all...
dialog: 
text: Cat stands stock still. Emilio takes her up in his arms,
text: lifts her, crushes her to his chest. Cat remains suspended,
text: emotionless for a moment. And then, for the first time
text: emotion, real emotion, washes across her face. Her lower
text: lip begins to tremble. Tears well up in her eyes. She
text: bursts into tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: You're safe now.
dialog: 
text: All the emotion, the fear, the anger that she has kept

speaker_heading: EMILIO

dialog:

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
dialog:

dialog: boy's room.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
text: With models of soldiers, futuristic warriors, a big poster

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Emilio sits reading the financial section of the morning

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Good morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: Buenos diaz Cara. Come. Sit.
dialog: I'll make you some eggs.
dialog: 
text: Mama caresses her face, her eyes glisten with a

text: whispers into her ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAMA
dialog: You have your mother's beautiful
dialog: eyes. Don't be scared. This is

speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: When was the last time you slept?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I don't know. A long time ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Well good. A growing body needs
dialog: sleep. When I was your age I would
dialog: sleep half the day. I don't know
dialog: if it helped with the growing, but
dialog: I was well rested for whatever
dialog: came after.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Whose room is that?

speaker_heading: EMILIO

speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: (matter of fact)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: The good news is your father bought
dialog: you your life with what he gave
dialog: you. The bad news is Don Luis was
dialog: playing both sides, and has
dialog: disappeared. You tore down
dialog: everything he spent years building
dialog: up with that little chip. It is
dialog: something he will not forget.
dialog: There is a law in this thing of
dialog: ours. If someone does you, the
dialog: revenge goes all the way down the
dialog: line. Women, children,
dialog: Grandmothers, dogs, cats. No
dialog: exceptions.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Here.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: These are the school supplies you'll

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL

speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: We'll get all this stuff, then go
dialog: over to this little place I know
dialog: down on Maxwell street for some of
dialog: these hot dogs the Polish people
dialog: make here.
dialog: 
text: He turns left at the cross street...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: You like hot dogs?
dialog: 
text: He looks down, sees no Cat. Looks back to see Cat walking

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
text: Cat keeps going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Hey!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Where you going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I've already been to school. I

dialog: 
text: She walks off. Emilio grabs her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Chica. Any idiot can be a killer.
dialog: Look!
dialog: 
text: Emilio draws a .357 magnum pistol from his shoulder holster,
text: and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming
text: down the street. The car careens off the road, smashes a
text: fire hydrant, crashes through a plate glass window of a
text: shop across the street. The water from the hydrant shoot
text: twenty feet in the air. Emilio holsters his gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: You want me to teach you to be a

dialog: you. But you'll be dead in five
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO (CONT'D)
dialog: If you want to be a killer, and
dialog: survive, you have to be a smart
dialog: one. You have to know things
dialog: besides how to pull a trigger.
dialog: You have to know how the world
dialog: works. How people think. You got
dialog: to learn to be psychological.
dialog: That I cannot teach you, unless
dialog: you learn the basics at school.
dialog: Got it?
dialog: 
text: Cat glares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILIO
dialog: Now what's it going to be?
dialog: 
text: He holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the
text: other. Cat hesitates for a moment. Takes the schoolbag
text: from Emilio. Then takes his hand, and they walk off
text: together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers,
text: and people pour out of the school and the surrounding
text: stores. As they put distance between the chaos and
dialog: themselves.

speaker_heading: COP 1
dialog: What the...

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
dialog: 
text: The other car. The drivers door opens. A vodka bottle

speaker_heading: SERGEANT

speaker_heading: SERGEANT

dialog: 
text: Cat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items

text: the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has
dialog: constructed.
dialog:

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: (SMILES)

dialog:

speaker_heading: CAT
text: Top cut sirloin.

speaker_heading: CAT

speaker_heading: CAT

speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Good boys.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

scene_heading: INT. PEPE'S WAREHOUSE/HOME - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: PEPE
dialog: If that's what you want to call

scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE AQUARIUM
dialog:

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
dialog: No answer.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VILLA - NIGHT
dialog:

speaker_heading: CAT

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Who are you?

speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Doesn't matter who I am.

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: I want you exactly where you are.
dialog: 
text: And then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
speaker_heading: ARRRGGGHHHH!
dialog: 
text: He falls to the floor. The blood starts to seep out onto

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Whatever they paid you, I'll double
dialog: it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: You know the thing about sharks.
dialog: You can swim with them all day and

text: one drop of blood in the water and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Please. I'll give you anything

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

dialog: 
text: She fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling

text: Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself
text: up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns
text: and walks toward the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Please! Please!
dialog: 
text: He struggles frantically to pull himself out. Cat exits.
text: And then the sharks hit. WHAM! And hit. And hit. And

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT 1

speaker_heading: ROSS
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: A woman? Are you sure?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
dialog: It's our only lead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Let's see her booking report.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT 2
speaker_heading: (HESITANT)
dialog: Well, there was a little problem.
dialog: Seems she was too drunk to get a
dialog: photo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: But not to get prints.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
dialog: We ran the prints in the data base.
dialog: No match was found.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Lovely. So if there is no booking
dialog: record, how did we get the name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
text: A library card. The only ID she
dialog: had was a library card.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I don't believe this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
text: There are the surveillance tapes.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT 2
text: From three angles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
speaker_heading: (HOPEFUL)
dialog: Well, let's see them.
dialog: 
text: The two agents look at each other, even more chagrined.
text: One of them pushes a button on the computer. And the three
text: angles come up. One has a shot of Cat's face covered by
text: her hair, one has a shot of her face covered by her hand,
text: and the third one has an angle of her nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: That's it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT 1
dialog: That's it.
dialog: 
text: Ross sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: It's not a lot to go on. But put

speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: I have fifty bucks on this shot.

speaker_heading: MARCO
speaker_heading: (SMILING)

dialog: 
text: He opens his arms. They hug. Eduardo is friendly, but

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Here. For you.
dialog: 
text: He goes to hand it to Eduardo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: For what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: First for fucking up your shot.
dialog: Second, for an address. You
dialog: remember Fabio? The Cataleya
dialog: Killer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: It's a long time. My memory...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You went to school with his brother
dialog: in law. What was his name? Emilio?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: Like I said...my memory...
dialog: 
text: Now the men at the bar are starting to take notice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: I have a problem. And we think
text: Fabio's kid is behind it.
dialog: 
text: Eduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in Marco's
text: shirt pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: Look Marco. I gotta be honest
dialog: with you. Everyone knows you guys
dialog: were playing a double game, and
dialog: when the shit went down, you were
dialog: the only ones who got out of it
dialog: clean.
dialog: 
text: The men at the bar are now edging closer. One of them has

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: So you do have a memory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: Yeah. For rats. Now get the fuck
dialog: out, and let me take my shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: OK...
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
text: Marco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes
text: to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker
text: by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco
text: grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball.
text: At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns
text: and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun,
text: and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of
text: Marco's thugs.
dialog: 
text: In an instant it is over. Everyone is dead, except Marco,
text: one of his thugs, and the dazed Eduardo. Marco notices

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Fuck...
dialog:

speaker_heading: CAT

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: That's a hard one for me.

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Let me this time.
dialog: 
text: And for the first time, she lets him touch her first.

speaker_heading: TECH
dialog: Good...now let's see...hands...

scene_heading: INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAT'S APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cat sits by the living room window. Takes the last drop

scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT - DAY

speaker_heading: CAT

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: What about...?
dialog: 
text: He points to the chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: When your dinner's ready, the timer
dialog: on it will have expired. Then you
dialog: can get to work.
dialog: 
text: And she is gone. Ross watches the timer on the microwave.
text: When it beeps, he sits a moment longer. Hesitates to get
text: up. Little by little, he moves himself off the chair,
text: tentative. Afraid that any moment, BOOM! Until he makes
text: the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat,
text: waiting for the worst to happen. And when it doesn't, he
text: breathes a sigh of relief.

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: She will kill a member of my family

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're kidding me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Do I look like I could make
dialog: something like that up?
dialog: 
text: Richard says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: So? What should I do now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'd go to the police. Now if you'll
dialog: excuse me, I have a meeting...

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Ross.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It's her.

dialog: 
text: Richard sits back down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS (CONT'D)
dialog: She says you either give her what

dialog: 
text: Ross points to Richard's chest where a red laser beam holds
text: on his heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
text: Bright red.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What does she think this is?
dialog: Amateur hour? Tell her that glass
dialog: is tempered to resist a direct hit
dialog: by a fifty seven millimeter
dialog: ordinance.
dialog: 
text: All of the sudden, a bullet shatters the window; destroying
text: a picture of Richard standing with the President hanging
text: on the wall just behind his head. The red dot is back on
text: Richard in a heartbeat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: She says she's using seven point
text: six two steel jacketed armor
dialog: piercing shells. And you have ten
text: seconds to give her the address.
dialog: 
text: Richard starts to come unglued.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How can I be sure once she has the
dialog: address she won't kill me anyway?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: You can't. But I can assure you
dialog: that if you don't give her the
dialog: address you will be number twenty
dialog: four on her hit parade. Trust me
dialog: on this one.
dialog: 
text: After an interminable moment...

speaker_heading: ROSS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICHARD
speaker_heading: (SWEATING)

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Thank you. Because honestly I
dialog: didn't know how I was going to

scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY

scene_heading: INT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marco points to the floor plan, explaining to the dozen

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: And here. And here. You must
dialog: expect the unexpected. She is
text: like mist under a door, like a
dialog: mouse in the wall. She will never
dialog: attack straight on. You will not
text: see her, until it is too late.
dialog: She is that invisible.
dialog: 
text: ON DON LUIS as he sips his cognac. He sees a big red truck
text: approaching in the distance up the road. As he watches,

text: drones on in the background...
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: We would prefer she be taken alive.
dialog: But with a bitch like this, if you
dialog: get a kill shot you take it.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Marco?
dialog: 
text: He sees the woman open the rear door of the truck, and

dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON MARCO DON LUIS AND THE THUGS
dialog: 
text: Seeing the rocket heading right for the salon. They all
text: leap out of the way, just as the rocket comes crashing
text: through the bay window. And blows the salon to smithereens.
text: Cat reenters the truck, drives off fast.
dialog: 
text: As the debris falls, and the dust and smoke rises, Marco
text: helps Don Luis up. He is a little stunned. Through the
text: gaping hole where the bay window was, they see the red
text: truck driving off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You four! Get the armored Mercedes!
dialog: We have to get Don Luis out of
dialog: here!
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: OK! Everyone in!
dialog: 
text: But just as they open the doors to the big Mercedes...
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
text: THE RED TRUCK COMES RAMMING THROUGH, TAKES OUT THE WHOLE
text: WALL OF THE GARAGE! DESTROYS THE MERCEDES.
dialog: 
text: Cat leaps out of the truck, and before the four startled
text: thugs know what has hit them, she puts three of them down
text: with shots to the heart.
dialog: 
text: The fourth runs out the back.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GROUNDS - DAY
dialog: 
text: The fourth thug runs for all he is worth, bleeding from
text: his forehead, panicked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CAT
dialog: 
text: Calmly exiting the garage, she removes a set of throwing
text: knives from a belt around her waist, taking a long minute
text: to gauge the distance. When he has almost reached the
dialog: safety of the house...
dialog: 
text: ON THE THUG RUNNING
dialog: 
text: ON CAT FLINGING THE KNIVES
dialog: 
text: TRACK WITH THE KNIVES AND THEN...
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE THUG
dialog: 
text: He drops like dead lead, the two knives embedded in his
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON MARCO WITH DON LUIS
dialog: 
text: Inside the house, seeing Cat through a window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CAT
dialog: 
text: Looking back at him. Pointing a finger at him. Before
text: she disappears in to the drifting mists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Don Luis! You hide here.
dialog: 
text: He opens a secret door in the wall, revealing a small space.
text: Barely big enough for a man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Wait for my call. Either she is
dialog: dead, or we have her far enough
dialog: away so you can make it to the
dialog: garage. Take the van. The armor
dialog: is so thick nothing short of an
text: atomic bomb can penetrate it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Marco. Thank you.
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
speaker_heading: (TOUCHED)
dialog: That's the first time you ever
dialog: said that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Said what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Don't get used to it.
dialog: 
text: Don Luis shuts the door. Off the door slamming...
dialog: 
text: Another door opens, but this one is...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: On the side of the mansion, and leads into the foundation.
text: Cat crawls in and pulls the door shut.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marco and the men are walking through the mansion, guns at
text: the ready, when they come to a long stretch of hallway.
text: Marco signals them to stop. He listens carefully. Signals
text: for one of the men to move down the hall.
dialog: 
text: As Marco and the other men wait, the first thug makes his
text: way down the hall, looking left and right, opening doors...
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON UNDER THE FLOOR FROM THE CAMERA'S POV
dialog: 
text: As the man walks along above, the floor creaks, dust drops
text: down in a fine cloud. As the man progresses, and the dust
text: gets closer and closer...
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON THE THUG ABOVE
dialog: 
text: Turns to Marco to signal everything is OK. Just as he
text: signals he is riddled from below with dozens of bullets.
text: The man dances like a puppet on a string, before falling
text: to the floor, dead. Marco takes a grenade out, flings it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Down!
dialog: 
text: Marco and the thugs dive for cover.
dialog: 
dialog: BAARROOM!
dialog: 
text: The grenade blows a big hole in the floor. As soon as the
text: smoke and the debris stop falling...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Go!
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
text: The thugs hesitate. Marco points his gun at them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Now!
dialog: 
text: Hesitant, the thugs approach the hole. Pointing their
text: weapons, they unload a barrage of bullets. Then stop.
text: Nothing moves. One of them peers over the side.
dialog: 
dialog: BANG!
dialog: 
text: A single shot pieces his eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Outside!
dialog: 
text: The thugs and Marco run...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: The thugs set up two big ass 50 caliber machine guns at
text: the two openings in the foundation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Kill her!
dialog: 
text: The thugs manning the guns let loose, blasting away. Smoke
text: and flashes from the muzzles mingle with the fog.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Don Luis hears the firing, which thunders through his
dialog: closet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: The thugs fire until their ammo is spent. As the sound
text: dies away, silence reigns.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Don Luis hears the silence. He speed dials on his phone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marco's phone rings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Checking.
dialog: 
text: He motions for one of his men to look into the dark hope.
text: Hesitant the man peeks around the side. Nothing happens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: I think we got her.
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Don Luis lets out a sigh of relief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Did you see the body?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marco urges his man to look deeper, expose himself more,
text: to look in the hole. Marco watches as the man does so,
text: very cautiously. Still no movement. He moves full body
text: into the opening to peer in.
dialog: 
dialog: BANG! BANG! BANG!
dialog: 
text: Is blown back by three fast shots.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Marco??
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Stay where you are!
dialog: 
text: And then he starts screaming into the hole, careful to
text: stand just off to the side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You know what bitch? I loved
dialog: killing your father. He was a
dialog: coward! And you know what else?
dialog: I screwed your mother behind your
dialog: father's back! We all did! She
dialog: couldn't get enough of it! The
dialog: whore! I killed her! I killed
dialog: him! You want to avenge them?
dialog: The whore and the coward? That's
dialog: what you come from! Come out!
dialog: I'm here! Come get the bullet
dialog: with your name on it, Bitch!
dialog: 
text: Silence. And then, a whistle from above. Marco looks up
text: to see Cat, standing on a second floor balcony with two
dialog: pistols.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Kill her!
dialog: 
text: Marco starts to fire, his men raise their guns. Too late.
text: In the blink of an eye, with bullets flying wildly all
text: around her, Cat blows five of the seven thugs surrounding
text: Marco away. Marco and the remaining two thugs run toward
text: the guest house. Out of the range of her guns.
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - DAY
dialog: 
text: Don Luis is panicking. Yelling into the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Marco! Marco!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marco and the two thugs run into the small house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: You two here! That door opens...
dialog: 
text: He points to the door they just came through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: ...kill anything that comes through.
dialog: 
text: Marco runs into the bedroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marco runs to the curtained windows, rips the curtains
text: back, hoping to escape. And finds that the windows have
text: metal hurricane shutters on them. With locks. Marco pulls
text: out a set of keys, frantically tries fitting the keys to
text: the locks. None of them work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 
text: He runs for the door again. Just as he has his hand on
text: the knob, two shots ring out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Giorgio?
dialog: 
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Tonino?
dialog: 
text: No answer. He checks his gun, realizes he is out of ammo.
text: He knows his time has come. He drops is gun, backs away
text: from the door. Backs right up to the bed, and sits down.
text: His phone rings.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - DAY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Marco! What the hell's going on???
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
text: There is a small sound outside the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: I will hold here! Run! Run!
dialog: 
text: The door shatters as Cat kicks her way in. Marco pulls
text: his trigger. Click! Click! Click! Marco is frozen.
text: Just stares at Cat. Waiting for what is going to come.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCO
dialog: Do it! Do it you bitch! Isn't
dialog: this the moment you've been waiting
dialog: for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Yes, it is.
dialog: 
text: She empties her gun into him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: Gripped by fear, Don Luis runs for all he is worth across
text: the fog shrouded garden until he reaches the garage. He
text: yanks open the door, runs inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Don Luis runs around Pepe's red truck and the crumbled
text: Mercedes, jumps in the armored van.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Don Luis fumbles with the keys, grinds the ignition in his
text: desperation. The engine turns over. Don Luis slams the
text: transmission into gear, but bangs into the crumbled Mercedes
text: blocking his way. He slams the gearshift into reverse,
text: bashes into the wall behind him, and then jerks the gear
text: shift into drive, ramming the Mercedes with a little more
text: room. Back and forth back and forth, Don Luis rams at the
text: Mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van,
text: bang past the Mercedes, and smash his way out of the garage.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog: 
text: The van comes roaring out of the garage, tearing up the

dialog: main road.
dialog: 
text: Cat comes running from the opposite direction, two guns
dialog: blazing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARMORED VAN - DAY
dialog: 
text: As bullets ping off the van, Don Luis regains some of his
text: confidence. A small smile breaks across his face as he
text: looks in his rear view mirror and sees Cat running and
text: firing, losing ground.
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: Marco?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: It's Cataleya.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: I don't understand you. You should
dialog: have been dead a long time ago.
dialog: You got lucky. You escaped. You
dialog: were given a second chance at a

dialog: Why did you involve yourself with
dialog: this insanity?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: For something you can never
dialog: understand. The love I had for my

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS
dialog: And because of that, you have ruined

dialog: You stupid bitch. Don't you get

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DON LUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I cannot be killed. I do the
dialog: killing. Not the other way around.
dialog: And now it is your turn to be
dialog: hunted. You will never find me.
dialog: But as day follows night, believe
dialog: me, I will find you. And I will
dialog: kill you. And you know why?
dialog: Because I will never be where you
dialog: can kill me. I will never be where
dialog: you want me to be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAT
dialog: Actually Don Luis...you are exactly
dialog: where I want you to be.
dialog: 
text: Don Luis doesn't get it. And then he hears a low growling

text: His eyes register confusion, then apprehension...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DON LUIS'S MANSION - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: EAT!
